      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7969">The theory of '''accessible categories''' is a part of [[mathematics]], specifically of [[category theory]]. It attempts to describe categories in terms of the "size" (a [[cardinal number]]) of the operations needed to generate their objects. 

The theory originates in the work of [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] completed by 1969&lt;ref&gt;

A standard text book by Adámek and Rosický appeared in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Accessible categories also have applications in [[homotopy theory]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;J. Rosický [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2185 "On combinatorial model categories"], ''[[arXiv]]'', 16 August 2007. Retrieved on 19 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Rosický, J. "Injectivity and accessible categories." ''Cubo Matem. Educ'' 4 (2002): 201-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Grothendieck continued the development of the theory for homotopy-theoretic purposes in his (still partly unpublished) 1991 manuscript ''Les dérivateurs''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Some properties of accessible categories depend on the [[Axiomatic set theory|set universe]] in use, particularly on the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] properties and [[Vopěnka's principle]].&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed Colimits and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable Objects==
Let &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; be an infinite [[regular cardinal]], i.e. a [[cardinal number]] that is not the sum of a smaller number of smaller cardinals; examples are &lt;math&gt;\aleph _{0}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Aleph number|aleph-0]]), the first infinite cardinal number, and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{1} &lt;/math&gt;, the first uncountable cardinal). A [[partially ordered set]] &lt;math&gt;(I, \leq) &lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed''' if every subset &lt;math&gt;J &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt; of cardinality less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; has an upper bound in &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the ordinary [[Directed set|directed sets]] are precisely the &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-directed sets.

Now let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. A [[direct limit]] (a.k.a. directed colimit) over a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed set &lt;math&gt;(I, \leq) &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit'''. An object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;'''-presentable''' if the [[Hom functor]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X,-)&lt;/math&gt; preserves all &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimits in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear that every &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable object is also &lt;math&gt;\kappa'&lt;/math&gt;-presentable whenever  &lt;math&gt;\kappa\leq\kappa'&lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;\kappa'&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit is also a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit in that case. A &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-presentable object is called '''finitely presentable'''. 

===Examples===
*In the category '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of all sets, the finitely presentable objects coincide with the finite sets. The &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable objects are the sets of cardinality smaller than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

*In the [[Category of groups|category of all groups]], an object is finitely presentable if and only if it is a [[Presentation_of_a_group#finitely_presented|finitely presented group]], i.e. if it has a presentation with finitely many generators and finitely many relations. For uncountable regular &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable objects are precisely the groups with cardinality smaller than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

*In the [[Category of modules|category of left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules]] over some (unitary, associative) [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the finitely presentable objects are precisely the [[Finitely_generated_module#Finitely_presented,_finitely_related,_and_coherent_modules|finitely presented module]]s.

=={{Anchor|locally_presentable}} &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible and locally presentable categories==
The category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible''' provided that:

* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has all &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimits
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; contains a set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-presentable objects such that every object of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimit of objects of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

An &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-accessible category is called '''finitely accessible'''.
A category is called '''accessible''' if it is &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible for some infinite regular cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. 
When an accessible category is also [[cocomplete]], it is called '''locally presentable'''.

A functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible categories is called '''&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-accessible''' provided that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; preserves &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-directed colimits. 

===Examples===

* The category '''Set''' of all sets and functions is locally finitely presentable, since every set is the direct limit of its finite subsets, and finite sets are finitely presentable.

* The category &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-Mod of (left) &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules is locally finitely presentable for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

* The category of [[simplicial set]]s is finitely accessible.

* The category Mod(T) of models of some [[first-order theory]] T with countable signature is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; -accessible. &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; -presentable objects are models with a countable number of elements.

* Further examples of locally presentable categories are finitary algebraic categories (i.e. the categories corresponding to [[Variety (universal algebra)|varieties of algebras]] in [[Universal algebra|univeral algebra]]) and [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]].

==Theorems==
One can show that every locally presentable category is also [[Complete category|complete]].&lt;ref&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994, remark 1.56&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a category is locally presentable if and only if it is equivalent to the category of models of a limit [[Sketch (mathematics)|sketch]].&lt;ref&gt;Adamek/Rosický 1994, corollary 1.52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adjoint functors]] between locally presentable categories have a particularly simple characterization. A functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; between locally presentable categories:

* is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves small colimits
* is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves small limits and is accessible

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary [[personality psychology]], agreeableness is one of the [[Big five personality traits|five major dimensions]] of personality structure, reflecting individual differences in [[cooperation]] and social harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Graziano, W.G., &amp; Eisenberg, N. (1997). Agreeableness; A dimension of personality. In R. Hogan, S. Briggs, &amp; J. Johnson,  (1997). ''Handbook of Personality Psychology.'' San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

People who score high on this dimension are empathetic and altruistic, while a low agreeableness score relates to selfish behavior and a lack of empathy. Those who score very low on agreeableness show signs of [[dark triad]] behavior such as manipulation and competing with others rather than cooperating.

Agreeableness is considered to be a superordinate trait, meaning that it is a grouping of personality sub-traits that cluster together statistically. The lower-level traits, or [[Facet (psychology)|facets]], grouped under agreeableness are: [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], straightforwardness, [[altruism]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[humility|modesty]], and tender-mindedness.&lt;ref name="Culture Psych"&gt;{{cite book

=== Cattell's 16 Personality Factors ===
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau - Agreeable Burden 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|''Agreeable Burden'' ([[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1895)]]

Like all [[Big Five personality traits]], the roots of the modern concept of agreeableness can be traced to a 1936 study by [[Gordon Allport]] and Henry S. Odbert.&lt;ref name="Trait names"&gt;{{cite journal
  | title   = Trait names: A psycholexical study.

  | doi     = 10.1037/h0093360
  | pages=i–171
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, [[Raymond Cattell]] published a [[cluster analysis]] of the thousands of personality-related words identified by Allport and Odbert.&lt;ref name="Clusters"&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi     = 10.1037/h0054116
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clusters identified in this study served as a foundation for Cattell's further attempts to identify fundamental, universal, human personality factors.&lt;ref name="Cattell book"&gt;{{cite book
  | title     = The Description and Measurement of Personality
  | publisher = World Book
  | author    = Cattell, R. B.
  | location  = New York
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually settled on [[16 personality factors]] through the use of [[factor analysis]]. Further factor analyses revealed five higher-order, or "global", factors to encompass these 16.&lt;ref name="16PF"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although labelled "independence" by Cattell, a global factor defined by high scores on the E, H, L, and Q1 factors of the [[16PF Questionnaire]] was an early precursor to the modern concept of agreeableness.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Big Five ===

Extent of agreeableness in [[Big Five personality traits|the five factor model]] of personality is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self-report measures are either ''lexical''&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; or based on ''statements''.&lt;ref name="Goldbergetal"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last            = Goldberg
  | first           = L.R.

  | doi             = 10.1016/j.jrp.2005.08.007
  | display-authors = etal
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which measure of either type is used is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken.

''Lexical measures'' use individual adjectives that reflect agreeableness or disagreeableness traits, such as sympathetic, cooperative, warm, considerate, harsh, unkind, rude. Words representing disagreeableness are reverse coded. Goldberg (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 20-word measure as part of his 100-word Big Five markers, and Saucier (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | pmid    = 7844738
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. Thompson (2008)&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; systematically revised and improved these markers to develop a 40-word measure with better psychometric properties in both American and non-American populations, the International English Mini-Markers. This brief measure has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing agreeableness and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the Agreeableness measure for native English-speakers is reported as .86, that for non-native English-speakers is .80.

''Statement measures'' tend to comprise more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, ''Am on good terms with nearly everyone'', ''Am not interested in other people's problems'' or ''Sympathize with others' feelings''.&lt;ref name="Goldbergetal" /&gt;

Cattell's [[Factor analysis|factor analytic approach]], used to identify the universal personality structures, inspired countless studies in the decades following the introduction of the 16PF. Using Cattell's original clusters, the 16 Personality Factors, and original data, multiple researchers independently developed a five factor model of personality over this period. From the early 1960s on, these explorations typically included a factor called "agreeableness" or "sociability."&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Personality and Individual Differences"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn      = 1-4051-3008-3
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite repeated replications of five stable personality factors following Cattell's pioneering work, this framework only began to dominate personality research in the early 1980s with the work of [[Lewis Goldberg]]. Using lexical studies similar to those of Allport and Odbert, Goldberg chose the term "Big Five" to reflect the sheer number of personality-related terms encompassed by each of these five distinct factors.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; One of these, agreeableness, was defined by a number of personality-related words similar to those present in earlier and more recent manifestations of the construct; examples include "friendly," "good-natured," "cooperative," "trustful," "nurturing," "sociable," and "considerate."&lt;ref name="goldberg81-1"&gt;{{cite book

=== NEO PI ===

Beginning in the 1970s, [[Paul Costa Jr|Paul Costa]] and Robert McCrae began researching the development of personality assessments based on factor models. Beginning with cluster analyses of Cattell's 16 Personality Factors, Costa and McCrae initially settled on a three-factor model of personality. These three factors were [[neuroticism]] (vs. emotional stability), [[extraversion]] (vs. introversion), and [[Openness to experience|openness]] (vs. closedness) to experience, resulting in the acronym "NEO."&lt;ref name="costamccrae1976"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to similarities between their three-factor NEO Personality Inventory and Goldberg's Big Five, Costa and McCrae began to develop scales to assess agreeableness and conscientiousness in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; This work culminated in the 1985 publication of the first [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory|NEO PI Manual]] to be based on the full [[Five Factor Model]].&lt;ref name="NEOPI85"&gt;{{cite book

== NEO PI facets ==

In the NEO PI, each of the five factors identified by Costa and McCrae are identified with six lower-level traits. Known as [[Facet (psychology)|facets]], the lower-level traits subsumed by agreeableness were first introduced with the 1992 publication of the revised version of the NEO PI. Based on the modern NEO PI-R, the six facets of agreeableness are: [[Trust (social sciences)|Trust]], straightforwardness, [[Altruism]], [[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]], [[Modesty]], and Tender-Mindedness.&lt;ref name="Culture Psych" /&gt;

=== Trust ===

Trust is a defining feature of psychosocial development, personality theory, and [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] conceptions of personality.&lt;ref name="A and C"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who score high on this facet generally believe others' intentions to be benevolent. Those scoring low on this facet tend to be cynical and view others as suspicious, dishonest, or dangerous.

=== Straightforwardness ===

Straightforwardness is the quality of directness and frankness in dealing with others. Despite a long history in [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], straightforwardness is not as vital to personality theory as the other facets of agreeableness.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Those scoring high on straightforwardness tend to interact with others in a direct and frank manner. Low scorers are less direct, tend to be high in [[self-monitoring]], and are generally deceitful or manipulative. Although the two concepts are not identical, those who score low on this facet tend to be high in [[Machiavellianism#In psychology|Machiavellianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Altruism ===

Similar to [[altruism in animals]] and [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]], this facet is defined by measures of selflessness, self-sacrifice, generosity, and consideration, courtesy, and concern for others.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Altruism is similar to [[Alfred Adler]]'s concept of social interest, which is a tendency to direct one's actions toward the betterment of society.&lt;ref name="social interest"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who score low on Altruism tend to be discourteous, selfish, or greedy, a pattern of behaviors known as "self-interest" in [[Classical Adlerian psychology|Adlerian psychology]].

=== Compliance ===

As a facet of agreeableness, compliance is defined as an individual's typical response to conflict. Those who score high on compliance tend to be meek and mild, and to prefer cooperation or deference as a means of resolving conflict. Low scorers tend to be aggressive, antagonistic, quarrelsome, and vindictive.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt;

=== Modesty ===

While trust, straightforwardness, altruism, and compliance all refer to interpersonal or social behaviors, modesty refers to an individual's [[self-concept]]. Those who score high on modesty tend to be humble and other-focused, while low scorers tend to be arrogant and self-aggrandizing.&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Low modesty is otherwise known as conceitedness or [[Narcissism]] and, in extreme cases, can manifest as [[Narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="psychopathology"&gt;{{cite book

=== Tender-mindedness ===

Tender-mindedness is defined as the extent to which an individual's judgments and attitudes are determined by emotion. Coined by [[William James]], this term was also prominent in early versions of the [[16 Personality Factors|16PF]].&lt;ref name="A and C" /&gt; Tender-mindedness is primarily defined by sympathy&lt;ref name="sympathy"&gt;{{cite web

== Equivalents in psychobiological models ==

Models based on [[psychobiological]] theories of personality have each incorporated a factor similar to agreeableness.

== HEXACO Model ==

To address the absence of measures of [[Dark triad]] traits (i.e., [[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]], and [[psychopathy]]), Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee proposed the addition of a sixth factor to the Five Factor Model.&lt;ref name="honesty"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Honesty-Humility does not directly correspond to any Big Five trait, it is strongly [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the Straightforwardness and Modesty facets of Big Five Agreeableness. As both of these facets are only weakly correlated with Big Five Agreeableness, Ashton and Lee suggest dividing NEO PI Agreeableness into two factors similar to those in the HEXACO Model: Honesty-Humility (i.e., Straightforwardness and Modesty) and a redefined Agreeableness (Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness).&lt;ref name="HEXACO" /&gt; Reflecting this conception of Honesty-Humility and HEXACO Agreeableness as unique though similar concepts, Ashton and Lee propose that they represent different aspects of [[reciprocal altruism]]: fairness (Honesty-Humility) and tolerance (Agreeableness).&lt;ref name="versus anger"&gt;{{cite journal

Despite suggesting this reconceptualization of Agreeableness for the NEO PI, Ashton and Lee do not believe HEXACO Agreeableness is accurately captured by Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness. In addition to accounting for these four facets of Big Five Agreeableness, the HEXACO Model's construction of Agreeableness includes content categorized under [[Neuroticism]] in the NEO PI (i.e., temperamentalness and irritability).&lt;ref name="temperamentalness"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reflect the negative emotional content at the low end of HEXACO Agreeableness, this factor is also referred to as "Agreeableness (versus Anger)."&lt;ref name="versus anger" /&gt; The inclusion of anger in the definition of HEXACO Agreeableness further helps to differentiate this factor from Honesty-Humility. In response to offensive or [[Relational transgression|transgressive]] actions, individuals who score low on Honesty-Humility tend not to respond immediately. Instead, they defer their response by planning their revenge and waiting for the perfect opportunity to enact it. Although those who score low on HEXACO Agreeableness also employ this premeditated strategy, they also tend to respond immediately with anger.&lt;ref name="revenge"&gt;{{cite journal

=== HEXACO Agreeableness facets ===

To help capture the numerous distinctions between the Big Five and HEXACO models, Ashton and Lee propose four new [[Facet (psychology)|facet]] labels in their conceptualization of Agreeableness: Forgiveness, Gentleness, Flexibility, and Patience.&lt;ref name="temperamentalness" /&gt; In addition to these four Agreeableness-specific facets, Lee and Ashton have proposed an additional "interstitial" facet located in a space shared by Agreeableness, Honesty-Humility, and Emotionality: [[Altruism]] versus Antagonism.&lt;ref name="altruism-antagonism"&gt;{{cite journal

* ''Forgiveness'': A measure of an individual's response to deception or other transgressions.

* ''Gentleness'': A measure of how an individual typically evaluates others. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to avoid being overly judgmental, while those who score low are highly critical and judgmental.
* ''Flexibility'': A measure of behaviors related to compromise and cooperation. Individuals who score high on this facet prefer cooperation and compromise as means of resolving disagreement, while those who score low tend to be stubborn, argumentative, and unwilling to accommodate others.
* ''Patience'': A measure of one's response to anger and aggravation. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to be able to tolerate very high levels of anger and maintain their composure while expressing anger. Those who score low on Patience have difficulties remaining calm while expressing their anger and tend to have quick tempers, becoming very angry in response to comparatively little provocation.
* ''Altruism versus Antagonism'': Although shared between three HEXACO factors, Altruism versus Antagonism is moderately correlated with Agreeableness.&lt;ref name="altruism-antagonism" /&gt; This interstitial facet assesses the extent to which an individual is sympathetic, soft-hearted, and helpful, with low-scoring individuals tending toward an antagonistic interpersonal style.

== Interpersonal relations ==

Agreeableness is an asset in situations that require getting along with others. Compared to disagreeable persons, agreeable individuals display a tendency to perceive others in a more positive light.

Because agreeable children are more sensitive to the needs and perspectives of others, they are less likely to suffer from [[social rejection]]. Specifically, research indicates that children who are less disruptive, less aggressive, and more skilled at entering play groups are more likely to gain acceptance by their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L. (2003). ''Peer rejection: Developmental processes and intervention strategies''. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that people high in agreeableness are more emotionally responsive in social situations. This effect was measured on both self-report questionnaires and physiological measures, and offers evidence that [[extraversion]] and [[neuroticism]] are not the only Big Five personality factors that influence emotion. The effect was especially pronounced among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also shows that people high in agreeableness are more likely to control negative emotions like anger in conflict situations. Those who are high in agreeableness are more likely to use conflict-avoidant tactics when in conflict with others (whereas people low in agreeableness are more likely to use coercive tactics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Prosocial behaviour ==

A central feature of agreeableness is its positive association with [[altruism]] and helping behaviour. Across situations, people who are high in agreeableness are more likely to report an interest and involvement with helping others. Experiments have shown that most people are likely to help their own [[Kinship|kin]], and help when [[empathy]] has been aroused. Agreeable people are likely to help even when these conditions are not present.&lt;ref&gt;Graziano, W. G., Habashi, M.  M., Sheese, B.E., &amp; Tobin, R. M. (2007).

When [[mental illness]] is present, low agreeableness may be associated with [[narcissism|narcissistic]] and [[anti-social behavior|anti-social]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T. &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1992). ''NEO personality Inventory professional manual''. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, individuals who are extremely high in agreeableness are at risk for problems of dependency. Empirical studies show that many more problems are associated with low agreeableness.

However, high agreeableness does not always lead to prosocial behaviour, in a [[Milgram experiment]] conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bègue|first1=Laurent|last2=Beauvois|first2=Jean-Léon|last3=Courbert|first3=Didier|last4=Oberblé|first4=Dominique|last5=Lepage|first5=Johan|last6=Duke|first6=Aaron|title=Personality Predicts Obedience in a Milgram Paradigm|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=83|issue=3|pages=299|date=2014|doi=10.1111/jopy.12104|pmid=24798990|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12104/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From childhood to adulthood ==

Agreeableness is of fundamental importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and good relations with others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this it has also been implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness has been found to be a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.&lt;ref name="Laursen B., Pulkkinen L., Adams R. 2002 591–603"&gt;{{cite journal

A study done by Caspi, Elder, and Bem (1987) found that explosive and ill-tempered children were found to have higher rates of divorce as adults when compared with their even-tempered peers.

Most recent is a study done by Larsen, Pulkkinen, and Adams (2002) in which they looked at many different levels of childhood behavior and emotion and the correlation into adulthood agreeableness. In their first analyses, structure coefficients showed that childhood compliance, aggression, and self-control discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did activity versus passivity, constructiveness, and anxiety. In their second analyses, structure coefficients indicated that adulthood socialization and impulsivity discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did inhibition of aggression and anxiety. In linking childhood behavioral profiles to adulthood personality profiles, high-compliant, high-self-control, and low-aggressive children were most likely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. These children were more unlikely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults. Further, low-compliant, low-self-control, and high-aggressive children were likely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults and these children were unlikely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. In addition to this, children classified as low-compliance, low-self-control, low-aggression types and children classified as high-compliance, high-self-control, low-aggression types had a greater probability of becoming adults with high-agreeableness, high-socialization, high-impulsivity profiles. Looking at stability of agreeableness they found results that indicated that stable low agreeable individuals reported less career stability and more depression when compared with stable high agreeable individuals and low to high agreeable individuals. Further, stable high agreeable individuals reported lower levels of alcoholism than did the other groups and fewer arrests than did stable low agreeable individuals.&lt;ref name="Laursen B., Pulkkinen L., Adams R. 2002 591–603" /&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with well-known expressions in these states, such as "[[southern hospitality]]" and "[[Minnesota nice]]." Because these states are generally less urbanized than the east and west coasts, people may be more likely to live in small communities and know their neighbors. Consequently, they may be more willing to care about and help their neighbours.

In a study done by Albright et al. (1997) groups of college students from China and the United States rated strangers from both countries on the "Big Five" personality traits, external traits, and how well they were dressed. They found that both Chinese and U.S. students rated faces as showing similar levels of agreeableness and extroversion. The people who were thought to be the most agreeable wore smiles, a facial expression that is recognized around the world.&lt;ref name="Wortman"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Apple''''' is a 1966 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work consists of an [[apple]] on top of a [[plexiglass]] stand. A brass plaque bearing the word 'APPLE' is fixed to the front of the stand.&lt;ref name=VF15&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/05/yoko-ono-moma-exhibit-review|title=The Two Must-See, Must-Do, Must Step-On Works at Yoko Ono's MoMA Show|date=May 2015|author=Bruce Handy|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was subsequently covered in [[bronze]] as part of Ono's 'Bronze Age' series of artworks.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 show, ''Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono'' at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; The preview night of Ono's Indica exhibition on 9 November 1966 was visited by the musician [[John Lennon]] who had heard that "this amazing woman was going to be putting on a show...and it was going to be a bit of a happening". Lennon described himself as "astounded" at the "apple on sale for two hundred quid; I thought it was fantastic—I got her work immediately...it was two hundred quid to watch the fresh apple decompose". The piece also appealed to Lennon as he "didn't have to have much knowledge about avant-garde or underground art... the humor got me straight away".&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; Lennon took a bite out of the apple on display, before apologising and putting the apple back. Ono later recalled that "...he just grabbed it and bit it and looked at me like, you know, "There!" you know? I was so furious, I didn't know what to say. And it all showed in my face: How dare this person, you know, mess around with my work?".&lt;ref name='MOMA'&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple. Yoko Ono. 1966.|url=https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/15/368|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon was subsequently impressed by his interaction with Ono's piece ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]''.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt;

''Apple'' was recreated for the first time in four decades in 2006 at a recreation of the Indica Gallery at the art gallery [[Riflemaker]] in London's Soho district. The original Indica had closed in 1967.&lt;ref name=Ind06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/john-and-yoko-love-at-first-bite-423973.html|title=John and Yoko: Love at first bite|date=12 November 2006|author=Anthony Barnes|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was displayed at Ono's 2015 retrospective, ''Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960–1971'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Critic Bruce Handy highlighted ''Apple'' as one of the "must see" pieces from the exhibition, and believed the [[apple]] itself to be of the [[Granny Smith]] [[cultivar]].&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt;

==Interpretation==
In 1966 Ono described the "...excitement of watching the apple decay, and the decision as to whether to replace it, or just thinking of the beauty of the apple after it's gone".&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt; Bruce Handy wrote that the accompanying label for ''Apple'' highlighted for the viewer the juxtaposition between the physical permanence of the pedestal's brass plaque and the "passage of time marked by the apple's decay and periodic renewal as it is replaced throughout the course of the exhibition" a relationship that begins as "the transparent base recedes into space".&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt;

      <comment>/* First amended Argus system */ Link [[Minor premiership]] to explain what it means in this context</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11241">The '''Argus finals systems''' were a set of related systems of end-of-season championship [[playoff]] [[tournament]] used commonly in [[Australian rules football]] competitions in the early part of the 20th century. The systems generally comprised a simple four-team tournament, followed by the right of the top ranked team from the home-and-away season to challenge for the premiership. The systems were named after the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', which developed and supported their use.

==First Argus system==
In 1901, the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] first adopted the "Argus system", after issues had emerged with the fairness of the system which had been introduced in [[1898 VFL finals series|1898]].

The initial Argus system was, in effect, a simple four-team [[knock-out tournament]], played as follows:
* Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between '''2nd''' vs '''4th''', and the Second Semi-Final was played between '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''.
* Week Two: the [[AFL Grand Final|final]] was played between '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF1&lt;/sub&gt;''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF2&lt;/sub&gt;'''
** The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

==First amended Argus system==

The major complaint about the Argus system used in 1901 was that the four qualifying teams had a statistically equal chance to win the premiership. This particularly displeased Geelong, who had won the [[Minor premiership|minor premiership]], but were eliminated when beaten by Collingwood in the Second Semi-Final.

To prevent this situation, the VFL re-introduced a provision which had existed under the [[1898 VFL finals system|1898 system]]: after the simple knock-out tournament was completed, the team with the best win-loss record for the season would have the opportunity to challenge the winner of the knock-out tournament to a Grand Final for the premiership.&lt;ref name="egep"&gt;{{citation|first=Stephen|last=Rodgers|title=Every Game Ever Played: VFL/AFL Results, 1897–1991|publisher=Viking O'Neil|publication-place=Ringwood, VIC|edition=3rd|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant of the Argus system was played as follows:
* Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between '''2nd''' vs '''4th''', and the Second Semi-Final was played between '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''.
* Week Two: a final was played between '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF1&lt;/sub&gt;''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF2&lt;/sub&gt;'''
**If the winner of the Week Two final had the best record in the league across all matches, ''including all finals up to and including Week Two'', then that team became the '''Major Premier''' for the season. In these cases, the final in week two has retrospectively become known as the Grand Final.
**If the winner of the Week Two final did not have the best record in the league as defined above, then the finals progressed to Week Three.
* Week Three: the Grand Final was played between '''Team with the best record''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; Final&lt;/sub&gt;'''
** The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

It is important to note that under this variant of the ''Argus'' System, the right to challenge did ''not'' automatically go to the [[minor premiership|minor premiers]], ''i.e.'' the team which was ranked highest after the home-and-away season. If the minor premiership had been decided by a close margin, then any losses sustained during the finals could have cost the minor premier its right to challenge or even transferred it to another team.

An example of how this could have happened occurred in the 1906 VFL season: leading into the [[1906 VFL Grand Final|Final]], Carlton had an overall record of 15–3, and Fitzroy had an overall record of 14–4, but Fitzroy had a superior percentage to Carlton.

Had Carlton lost the Final to Fitzroy, both teams would have had a record of 15–4, but Fitzroy would have been ranked above Carlton with its superior percentage, and Carlton therefore would have lost the right of challenge, meaning that Fitzroy would win the premiership. As it happened, Carlton won the Final, giving them a record of 16–3 compared with Fitzroy's 14–5, so Fitzroy had no right of challenge, and Carlton won the premiership.

Many Carlton players and officials, including coach Jack Worrall, erroneously believed that they would have had the right to challenge had they lost the Final. This confusion led to Carlton lodging a complaint with the VFL, and the VFL made further amendments in 1907 to correct for this anomaly.&lt;ref name="egep" /&gt;

==Second amended Argus system==
The second version of the amended Argus system was used by the VFL between 1907 and 1930, except in [[1924 VFL season|1924]]. This is the most widely known variation of the Argus system.

The structure of the finals was mostly the same as the first amended Argus system, except that the right to challenge was given to the '''Minor Premier''' as defined by the team on top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season. Additionally, it became conventional for the two semi-finals to be played on separate weekends, extending the duration of the finals from two or three weeks to three or four weeks.

* Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between '''2nd''' vs '''4th'''.
* Week Two: the Second Semi-Final was played between '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''.
* Week Three: a final was played between '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF1&lt;/sub&gt;''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; SF2&lt;/sub&gt;'''
**If '''Minor Premier''' won the Week Three final, then that team was immediately awarded the '''Major Premiership'''. In these cases, the final in week three has retrospectively become known as the Grand Final.
**If the winner of the Week Three final was not the Minor Premier, then the finals progress to Week Four. The final in week three became known as either the Final or the Preliminary Final.
* Week Four: the Grand Final was played between '''Minor Premier''' vs '''Winner&lt;sub&gt; Final&lt;/sub&gt;'''
** The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

This variation of the Argus system was introduced into the VFA in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9825227 |title=FOOTBALL. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]  |location=Melbourne |date=28 March 1903 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; four years before it was used in the VFL, being used by that competition until 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Barrier Miner|publication-place=Broken Hill, NSW|date=7 January 1933|page=6|title=Central ground for Victorian Assn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in [[Australian Amateur Football Council|amateur football]] until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Best of Football Trivia|author=Marc Fiddian|year=2003|publisher=Galaxy Print and Design|publication-place=Hastings, VIC|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Round-robin Argus system==
For the [[1924 VFL season|1924 season]] only, the VFL trialled a new format, in which the finals were played as a four-team round-robin, but including the Minor Premiers' right to challenge. At the end of the home-and-away season, the top four teams qualified for the finals tournament.

The finals were played over three weeks (with a provision for a fourth week), under the fixture:
*Week one: '''1st''' vs '''3rd'''; '''2nd''' vs '''4th'''
*Week two: '''1st''' vs '''2nd'''; '''3rd''' vs '''4th'''
*Week three: '''1st''' vs '''4th'''; '''2nd''' vs '''3rd'''

At the conclusion of the first three weeks, if the '''Minor Premier''' had finished on top of the round-robin ladder, then that team automatically won the '''Major Premiership''', but if another team won the round-robin competition, then the finals progressed to Week Four.

* Week Four: the Grand Final was played between '''Minor Premier''' vs '''1st&lt;sub&gt; Round robin&lt;/sub&gt;'''

The winner of this match became the '''Major Premier''' for the season.

In the sole VFL season that the system was used, no Grand Final was ultimately required.&lt;ref name="egep" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|McIntyre System}}
After having utilised four variations of the Argus system for thirty years, three clear drawbacks had emerged:
*Firstly, there was uncertainty regarding if there would be three or four finals played.&lt;ref&gt;Four finals were played in [[1928 VFL season|1928]] as the Second Semi-Final between Collingwood and Melbourne was drawn, meaning a replay was required.&lt;/ref&gt; This had resulted, to some extent, in the crowd for at least one of the Semi-Finals or the Final exceeding that of the Grand Final in nine of the 29 seasons that the system was used, including seven of the eleven seasons between 1919–1923 and 1925–1930.&lt;ref&gt;Essendon won the round-robin series in 1924, meaning that no Grand Final was required.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secondly, the minor premier was now seen to have an unfair advantage through its right to challenge to the point where losing the Second Semi-Final could be seen as a preferable route to a premiership: a loss allowed for a week off, while a win would require the minor premier to play on the following weekend.&lt;ref name="egep" /&gt; 
*Thirdly, there was a clear financial benefit to the clubs involved for a Challenge (or Grand) Final to be played, as it required another match to be played, bringing with it additional gate takings. As such, it was a common perception that clubs would contrive results to achieve this, leading to concern amongst the media, fans and officials that the Semi-Finals were not genuine contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10340822 |title=THE FOOTBALL PREMIERSHIP. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=19 September 1904 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To correct for these flaws, the VFL introduced a new system in 1931, the [[Page–McIntyre system]], that removed the minor premiers' right to challenge in favour of giving the minor premier and the second-placed team the advantage of a "double chance" that permitted either team to lose one match (excluding the Grand Final) without being eliminated, and fixed the number of finals at four.

All leagues using the Argus system eventually migrated to the Page–McIntyre system, with amateur football being the last to do so in 1956.

'''Bystander intervention''' is a type of training used in post-secondary education institutions to prevent [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]],  [[binge drinking]] and harassment and unwanted comments of a [[racism|racist]], [[homophobia|homophobic]], or [[transphobia|transphobic]] nature. A bystander is a person who is present at an event, party, or other setting who notices a problematic situation, such as a man making sexual advances on a drunk person. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=A proactive bystander is an individual who accepts personal responsibility for a situation and intervenes to ensure the well-being and/or safety of others.}} &lt;/ref&gt; The bystander then takes on personal responsibility and takes action to intervene, with the goal of preventing the situation from escalating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The bystander who is intervening has several options, including distracting either of the people, getting help from others, checking in later, or directly intervening. There are risks to bystander intervention; it can lead to fights, it can ruin the mood for the people who were "intervened" into, and it can lead to confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Bystander intervention may also be called "bystander education", because the model is based on a system of educating trainers and leaders who will then go on to train people from their community.
==Preventing sexual assault==
One bystander intervention researcher suggests that a potential sexual assault be stopped by pretending to spill a drink on a drunk man who is trying to make sexual moves on an intoxicated woman, to distract him and "...stop bad behavior before it crosses the line from drunken partying to sexual assault". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Advocates hope that bystander intervention programs can yield the same results on sexual assault that designated driver initiatives have had in reducing impaired driving; another similarity is that both programs do not discourage drinking itself, only the combination of drinking and law-breaking. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some US universities are introducing bystander education initiatives to comply with [[Title IX]], which requires US universities which receive federal funding to not discriminate according to gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;
==Research==

A study on bystander intervention by the University of New Hampshire showed that 38 percent of the men who saw a bystander intervention campaign said they intervened to stop a sexual assault, versus only 12 percent of the control group (who did not see the campaign). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; An Ohio University study compared men who took a bystander intervention session with a group of men who did not have the training; 1.5 percent of the bystander intervention participants said they had committed sexual assault over the last four months, versus 6.7 percent from the untrained group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvdvpw/white-women-less-likely-to-help-sexual-assault-victim-if-shes-black |title=White Women Less Likely to Help Sexual Assault Victim If She's Black {{!}} Bystander intervention is seen as one of the most powerful tools in preventing on-campus sexual assaults—but a new study shows that white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help their black peers. |last= Bess|first=Gabby |date=13 March 2017 |website=broadly.vice.com |publisher=Broadly/Vice |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote="We found that although white students correctly perceived that black women were at risk in a pre-assault situation, they tended not to feel as personally involved in the situation," the researchers at SUNY Geneseo, Jennifer Katz and Christine Merrilees, said in an interview with PsyPost. In other words, "despite their shared status as women, white female bystanders in the current study may have felt that a Black woman's plight was not as personally relevant because race has a more powerful effect than gender on intent to intervene and feelings of responsibility to intervene," they write in the study.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charaf-ed-Din. Operation for castration (1466).jpg|thumb|270px|A medical illustration by [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi|Sharaf ad-Din]] depicting an operation for castration, c. 1466]]
{{Violence against men}}
'''Castration''' (also known as '''gonadectomy''') is any action, [[surgery|surgical]], [[chemical substance|chemical]], or otherwise, by which an individual loses use of the [[testicles]]. Surgical castration is bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (excision of both testes), and [[chemical castration]] uses [[pharmaceutical drug]]s to deactivate the testes. Castration causes [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] (preventing the castrated person or animal from [[reproduction|reproducing]]); it also greatly reduces the production of certain [[hormone]]s, such as [[testosterone]]. Surgical castration in animals is often called [[neutering]].

The term "castration" is sometimes also used to refer to the removal of the [[ovary|ovaries]] in the female, otherwise known as an [[oophorectomy]] or, in animals, [[spaying]]. [[Estrogen]] levels drop precipitously following oophorectomy, and long-term effects of the reduction of sex hormones are significant throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prophylactic oophorectomy in pre-menopausal women and long term health – a review | pmc=2585770 | pmid=18714076 | doi=10.1258/mi.2008.008016 | volume=14 | date=September 2008 | journal=Menopause Int | pages=111–6 | last1 = Shuster | first1 = LT | last2 = Gostout | first2 = BS | last3 = Grossardt | first3 = BR | last4 = Rocca | first4 = WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "castration" may also be sometimes used to refer to [[emasculation]] where both the testicles ''and'' the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two. This can cause confusion.

[[#Animals|Castration of non-human animals]] is intended to favor a desired development of the animal or of its habits, as an [[anaphrodisiac]] or to prevent [[overpopulation]]. As above, see [[neutering]] for more information on castration of non-human animals.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Castration of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'': fresco by [[Vasari]] &amp; [[Cristofano Gherardi]] (c. 1560, Sala di Cosimo I, [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]]).]]
Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their "power". Castrated men — [[eunuch]]s – were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] and palace households: in particular, the [[harem]]. Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. Other religions, such as [[Judaism]], were strongly opposed to the practice. The [[Leviticus]] [[Holiness code]], for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from [[sacrifice]].

Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of [[History of China|Chinese history]], most notably in the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]], late [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and late [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] dynasties. There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events.

In ancient times, castration often involved the [[emasculation|total removal of all the male genitalia]]. This involved great danger of death due to bleeding or infection and, in some states, such as the [[Byzantine Empire]], was seen as the same as a death sentence. Removal of only the testicles had much less risk.

Either surgical removal of both testicles or [[chemical castration]] may be carried out in the case of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malecare.com |title=MaleCare.com |publisher=MaleCare.com |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Testosterone]]-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or [[chemical castration]]) is used to slow down the cancer, greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant. 

Castration has also been used in the United States for [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93947|title=Some Sex Offenders Opt for Castration. ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trans women]] often undergo orchiectomy, as do some other transgender people. Orchiectomy may be performed as part of a more general [[sex reassignment surgery]], either before or during other procedures. It may also be performed on someone who does not desire, or cannot afford, further surgery.

[[File:Castration.jpg|right|thumb|The procedure of castration as punishment during the 16th century.]]
Involuntary castration appears in the history of warfare, sometimes used by one side to torture or demoralize their enemies. It was practiced to extinguish opposing male lineages and thus allow the victor to sexually possess the defeated group's women.{{ref}}

===Europe===
[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the [[Normans]] during their invasions of Sicily and Italy.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In the medieval [[kingdom of Georgia]], the [[pretender]] [[Demna of Georgia|Demna]] was castrated by his uncle [[George III of Georgia]] to ensure the supremacy of George's branch of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eastmond|first=Antony|title=Royal imagery in medieval Georgia|year=1998|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=0271016280|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KPdSQU-Bx4C&amp;pg=PA107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another victim of castration was the medieval French philosopher, scholar, teacher, and (later) monk [[Pierre Abélard]]. He was castrated by relatives of his lover, [[Heloise (student of Abelard)|Héloïse]].{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

[[Wimund (bishop)|Bishop Wimund]], a 12th-century English adventurer and invader of the Scottish coast, was castrated.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In medieval England those found guilty of high treason were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], which often included [[emasculation]] or removal of the genitalia.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek mythology]], [[Cronus]] castrated his father, [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], after the latter imprisoned the [[cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[Hecatonchires]].

[[William Wallace]], the Scottish resistance leader, was castrated as part of his execution, for resistance to English rule.

[[Wim Deetman]] was criticized by the Dutch parliament for excluding evidence of castration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands|title=Time for the truth about Catholic sex abuse in the Netherlands|work=RNW|access-date=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321230333/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands#|archive-date=21 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic Church, where ten children were allegedly "punished" by castration in the 1950s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests. However, the Deetman Commission had rejected it as the person who reported the incident admitted it was speculative. Voluntary castration for homosexuality was also state policy in Netherlands at that point, as well against Catholic canon law, and there has been no evidence suggesting the Church had a part in organizing the procedures.
[[Chemical castration]] has been and is used as part of sentencing in criminal cases.

In 1952, [[Alan Turing]]—the father of computer science and the inventor of the [[Turing machine]]—was criminally prosecuted for homosexual acts and chose chemical castration as an alternative to a period of imprisonment.

===China===
According to legend, during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China, in 2281 BCE castration was passed into law as a punishment, which remained so until the reign of [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Gaozu of Tang]] (589–600 CE). However, it was still practiced after his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJESoip9wZEC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=the+five+punishments+are+adopted+branding+cutting+off+the+nose+feet+castration+and+death+emperor+wen+kao+tsu#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20five%20punishments%20are%20adopted%20branding%20cutting%20off%20the%20nose%20feet%20castration%20and%20death%20emperor%20wen%20kao%20tsu&amp;f=false|title=Chronological handbook of the history of China: a manuscript left by the late Rev.

Records of castrations in China date to the [[Shang dynasty]] (ca.1700–1050 BCE), when the Shang kings castrated prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=castration+captives+china#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author1=Gwyn Campbell |author2=Suzanne Miers |author3=Joseph Calder Miller |year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=136|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=total+castration+in+china+mortality+rate#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0-7914-2687-4|page=11|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[King Mu of Zhou|Mu]] of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (10th c. BCE) the Minister of Crime, Marquis Lu, reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUkQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=castration+rape+china#v=snippet&amp;q=castration%20capital%20avoid&amp;f=false|title=China of the Chinese|author=Edward Theodore Chalmers Werner|year=1919|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=|page=146|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the practice existed in China, not only were the testicles merely removed but castration included the severing of one's entire genitalia.

During the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming Dynasty)]], Chinese commanders castrated thousands of [[Miao people|Miao]] boys when their tribes revolted, and then distributed them as eunuch slaves as gifts to various officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=miao+rebellion+tribe+southwest+china+ming#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0-7914-2687-4|page=16|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], there were about 70,000 eunuchs (宦官 ''huànguān'', or 太監 ''tàijiàn'') employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the [[Forbidden City]].

====Non-Han peoples====
Many of the non-Han Chinese peoples who founded states in China after invading originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture, but adopted it from the Han Chinese.

The [[Khitan people]] adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs used were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a [[nomad]]ic [[Mongols|Mongolic people]] and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 12.](Page 18 on online document viewer, Page 12 on actual document)&lt;/ref&gt; When the Khitan founded the [[Liao Dynasty]] they developed a [[harem]] system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. All of the eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plains]] that came from two sources. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]. Another source was during their war with the Chinese [[Song dynasty]], the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and [[emasculate]] them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 13.](Page 19 on online document viewer, Page 13 on actual document)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khitan Empress Dowager [[Xiao Chuo]] (Chengtian) of the [[Liao Dynasty|Khitan Liao state]] took power at age 30 in 982 as a regent for her son. She personally led her own army against the [[Song dynasty|Song Chinese]] in 986 and defeated them in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLNrqn4WLZYC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=Notable Women of China|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXKkCXDvYFYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=Warfare in Chinese History|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1u2oP2RihIgC&amp;pg=PA569&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the ...|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxVfTuKsaJQC&amp;pg=PT91&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=Harmony and War|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcy1N5GXs4wC&amp;pg=PT521&amp;dq=chengtian+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f18pUviMLMez4AO214CQDA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chengtian%20986&amp;f=false|title=China: A History|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; fighting the retreating Chinese army.

During the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasty (1644–1911 CE), the sons and grandsons of the rebel [[Yaqub Beg]] in China were all sentenced to castration. Surviving members of Yaqub Beg's family included his 4 sons, 4 grandchildren (2 grandsons and 2 granddaughters), and 4 wives. They either died in prison in [[Lanzhou]], Gansu, or were killed by the Chinese. His sons Yima Kuli, K'ati Kuli, Maiti Kuli, and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879. They were all underage children, and put on trial, sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father's rebellious "sedition", or if they were innocent of their fathers crimes, were to be sentenced to castration and serving as a [[eunuch]] slave to Chinese troops, when they reached 11 years old, and handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yjg1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wG3LTdKpMMG2twfnsOGFCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=whether%20they%20have%20attained%20full%20age%20or%20not%2C%20be%20delivered%20imperial%20household%20made%20eunuchs%20slaves%20to%20soldiery%20turkestan&amp;f=false|title=Translations of the Peking Gazette|year=1880|page=83|isbn=|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6m_LTdeEC8u3tgfeofTnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 4|year=1888|publisher=D.

===Korea===
The eunuchs of Korea, called ''Naesi'' (내시, 內侍), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in [[Goryeosa]] ("History of Goryeo"), a compilation about the [[Goryeo]] period. In 1392, with the founding of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], the ''Naesi'' system was revised, and the department was renamed the "Department of ''Naesi''" (내시부, 內侍府).&lt;ref name="Naesi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=367722 |title=내시 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=100.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naesi system included two ranks, those of ''Sangseon'' (상선, 尙膳, "Chief of Naesi"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and ''Naegwan'' (내관, 內官, "Common official naesi"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 naesi in total served the palace in Joseon Dynasty period. They also took the exam on [[Confucianism]] every month.&lt;ref name="Naesi"/&gt; The naesi system was repealed in 1894 following [[Gabo reform]].

According to legend, castration consisted of daubing a boy's [[genital]]s with human [[feces]] and having a dog bite them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-fc5X0cUjwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=Korean+eunuchs,+however,+had+it+worst+of+all.+In+ancient+times+they+were+castrated+by+having+their+genitals+smeared+with+human+feces+and+then+being+exposed+to+packs+of+hungry+dogs#v=onepage&amp;q=Korean%20eunuchs%2C%20however%2C%20had%20it%20worst%20of%20all.%20In%20ancient%20times%20they%20were%20castrated%20by%20having%20their%20genitals%20smeared%20with%20human%20feces%20and%20then%20being%20exposed%20to%20packs%20of%20hungry%20dogs&amp;f=false|title=Manthropology: The Science of Why the Modern Male Is Not the Man He Used to Be|author=Peter McAllister|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|location=|isbn=0-312-55543-1|page=280|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], eunuchs became a desirable commodity for [[tributes]], and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=korean+castrated+dog+bite#v=onepage&amp;q=korean%20castrated%20dog%20bite&amp;f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author1=Gwyn Campbell |author2=Suzanne Miers |author3=Joseph Calder Miller |year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=137|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese created [[eunuch]]s through castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date= 5 October 2012|time= 14:00 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Theo ''Đất Việt''|url=http://ngoisao.net/tin-tuc/thoi-cuoc/24h/chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua-2621880.html |newspaper=Ngôi sao |date= 4 October 2012 |time=11:16 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Báo Đất Việt|url= http://www.baomoi.com/The-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/139/9058145.epi|newspaper= Báo Mới|date= 5 August 2012 |time=19:25 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thê lương chuyện ‘của quý’ của thái giám Việt xưa |others=Theo Đất Việt |url=http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-'cua-quy'-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn |newspaper=2sao |date=8 August 2012 |time=15:15 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411133500/http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-%27cua-quy%27-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn |archivedate=11 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa |others=ĐVO |url=http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |newspaper=Treonline |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053555/http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hành trình đau khổ của những hoạn quan thời xưa|others= Theo ''Báo Đất Việt''|url= http://giadinh.net.vn/the-gioi/hanh-trinh-dau-kho-cua-nhung-hoan-quan-thoi-xua-20110824020430125.htm|newspaper= Báo Gia đình &amp; Xã hội|date=24 August 2011 |time=14:25 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bí mật về thái giám trong cung triều Nguyễn|others= Theo Công An Nhân Dân|url= http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|newspaper=Zing News |date=18 July 2013 |time= 09:04 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table.

[[Lý Thường Kiệt]] was a prominent eunuch general during the [[Lý Dynasty]] (1009–1225).

The [[Trần Dynasty]] sent Vietnamese boy eunuchs as tribute to [[Ming Dynasty]] China several times, in 1383, 1384 and 1385&lt;ref name="Tsai 1996 p. 15"&gt;Tsai (1996), p. 15  {{Google books|Ka6jNJcX_ygC|The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty (Ming Tai Huan Kuan)|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Dao, Nguyen Toan, Tru Ca, and Ngo Tin were among several Vietnamese eunuchs sent to China.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyẽ̂n (2008), p. 169  {{Google books|tUN8tC0ftJcC|The History Buddhism in Vietnam, Vol. IIID.5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]], the Ming Chinese under the [[Yongle Emperor]] castrated many young Vietnamese boys, choosing them for their handsomeness and ability, and brought them to Nanjing to serve as eunuchs. Among them were the architect-engineer [[Nguyễn An]]&lt;ref&gt;Wang (2000), p. 135  {{Google books|CdJKLd2jJq0C|Aching for Beauty: Footbinding in China|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nguyen Lang]] (阮浪).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich (1976), p. 691  {{Google books|067On0JgItAC|Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644|page=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese were among the many eunuchs of different origins found at Yongle's court.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2009), p. 147  {{Google books|S3Y2PTI_vYYC|Children in Slavery Through the Ages|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the eunuchs in charge of the Capital Battalions of [[Beijing]] was Xing An, a Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Tran (2006), p. 116  {{Google books|tzh1fQEEFPAC|Việt Nam: Borderless Histories|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Lê Dynasty]] the Vietnamese Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展 |url=http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8 |publisher=國學網－－中國經濟史論壇(China Economic History Forum) |date=2008-03-16 |author=黄啟臣 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053755/http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8 |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3254|publisher=中國評論學術出版社(China Review Academic Publishers Unlimited)|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3257 |title=中国评论学术出版社 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民|publisher=中國評論新聞網 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |date=2006-03-08 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=6&amp;kindid=30&amp;docid=100107474 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=55&amp;kindid=1160&amp;docid=100107474 |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090 |title=明代廣東海上絲綢之路的高度發展 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/5/1/0/100151090.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞：鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民人文历史|url=http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|publisher=广州日报大洋网(www.dayoo.com)|date=2009-10-20|others=published at 15:28 [[24-hour clock|military time]]|accessdate=26 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054046/http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15–17 世紀廣東人與越南 |url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf |publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |author=李慶新 |page=12 |quote=此外,沿海平民在海上航行或捕撈漁獵,遇風漂流至越南者時有發生。如成化十三年, 廣東珠池奉御陳彜奏:南海縣民遭風飄至安南被編入軍隊及被閹禁者超過 100 人。5成化中, 海南文昌人吳瑞與同鄉劉求等 13 人到欽州做生意,遇風飄至安南,當局將他們"俱發屯田, 以瑞獨少,宮之"。6... 6《明孝宗實錄》卷一百五十三,弘治十二年八月辛卯。 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JBWO91Ba?url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf |archivedate=27 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15–17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fc9a0cdd50e2524de5187e89.html|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1472 entry in the [[Ming Shilu]] reported that when some Chinese from [[Nanhai District|Nanhai county]] escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military.

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that 13 Chinese men from [[Wenchang]] including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from [[Hainan]] to [[Guangdong]]'s Qin subprefecture ([[Qinzhou]]), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the [[Chenghua Emperor]]'s rule (1447–1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, [[Wu Rui]] (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the [[Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long|Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long]]. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]]. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] magistrate and then was sent to [[Beijing]] to work as a eunuch in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Lary (2007), p. 91 {{Google books|pFzhWyoYG_wC|The Chinese State at the Borders|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese State at the Borders |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774813334 |url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf |author=Leo K.

Commoners were banned from undergoing castration in Vietnam, only adult men of high social rank could be castrated, most eunuchs were born as such with a congenital abnormality.

===Americas===
In 1778, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote a bill in Virginia reducing the punishment for rape, polygamy or sodomy from death to castration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs10.htm Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments 1778 Papers 2:492—504l]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years several U.S. states have passed laws regarding chemical castration for sex offenders but not one state has mandatory castration. In 2016, [[Steve Hurst]], an Alabama lawmaker proposed a bill requiring certain sex offenses to require the perpetrator be castrated prior to their release from state custody.&lt;ref name="CBS_US_Castration_Bill"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawmaker introduces sex offender castration bill in Alabama |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawmaker-introduces-sex-offender-castration-bill-in-alabama/ |accessdate=23 October 2018 |work=CBS News |date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
Aqa [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]], who established the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Dynasty in Iran (in the 18th century), was a victim of castration by officers of the previous kingdom. When he conquered [[Lotf Ali Khan]], the last king of the [[Zand Dynasty]], Qajar had  Lotf Ali Khan castrated in revenge.

==Slave trade==
[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-East and War-Eunuch near Door of Sultan's Harem.png|thumb|left|Chief Eunuch of [[Abdul Hamid II]] (1912)]]

In the over 13 centuries of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa unknown number of Africans were enslaved and shipped to the Middle East. It is claimed that a vast majority of the male black slaves, estimated at around 80%, were castrated.

"The Caliphate in Baghdad at the beginning of the 10th Century had 7,000 black eunuchs and 4,000 white eunuchs in his palace."&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora |isbn = 978-0374527976|last1 = Segal|first1 = Ronald|date = 2002-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab slave trade typically dealt in the sale of castrated male slaves. Black boys at the age of eight to twelve had their scrotum and penis completely amputated. Reportedly, about two of three boys died, but those who survived drew high prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1210/jcem.84.12.6206| pmid=10599682|title = Long-Term Consequences of Castration in Men: Lessons from the Skoptzy and the Eunuchs of the Chinese and Ottoman Courts| journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism| volume=84| issue=12| pages=4324–4331|year = 1999|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Jean D.| last2=Roehrborn| first2=Claus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking of boys for prostitution in modern times===
An article in the ''Gulf Times'' revealed in 2005 a major sex trade in mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], New Delhi, [[Lucknow]] and [[Gorakhpur]]. One victim was lured from Nepal at the age of 14, sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly castrated. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were also castrated. He escaped and made his way back to Nepal. Two [[non-governmental organization]]s, one that works with homosexuals in Nepal, and one that works to rescue and rehabilitate trafficked women and children, were co-operating to help and rescue these boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=32822&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=44&amp;parent_id=24 |title=Former sex worker's tale spurs rescue mission |date=10 April 2005 |work=Gulf Times |publisher=Gulf-Times.com |accessdate=5 October 2010 |quote=“I spent seven years in hell,” says Raju, now 21, trying hard not to cry.

==Preventive measure==
"Voluntary" chemical or surgical castration has been in practice in many countries—reports are available from American and European countries in particular for over eighty years (chemical for circa thirty)—as an option for treatment for people who have broken laws of a sexual nature, allowing them to return to the community from otherwise lengthy detentions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated.

A ''temporary'' "chemical castration" has been studied and developed as a preventive measure and [[punishment]] for several repeated [[sex crime]]s, such as rape or other [[sexual assault|sexually related violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web1/kamlin.html|title=Chemical Castration: The Benefits and Disadvantages Intrinsic to Injecting Male Pedophiliacs with Depo-Provera|author=Katherine Amlin|accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/04-97/04-27-97/a09wn032.htm|title='Chemical castration' OK'd for Montana inmates|publisher= N.Y.

In modern times, the [[Czech Republic]] practices surgically castrating convicted sex offenders. According to the reports compiled by Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008. The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/cze/2009-02-05-eng.htm |title=Council of Europe report on the Czech Republic |publisher=Cpt.coe.int |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Martin Hollý, director of the Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Bilefsky |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/europe/11castrate.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp |title=Europeans Debate Castration of Sex Offenders |location=Europe;Czech Republic |work=The New York Times |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One serial offender stated that being castrated was the "best decision" he ever made: "On the one hand you have to protect the potential victims and on the other hand I wanted to be protected from myself, I wanted to live like a normal person."&lt;ref name="ukadvisor"/&gt; Don Grubin, a professor at [[Newcastle University]]'s Institute of Neuroscience who also runs a chemical castration program backed by the U.K.'s [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], was initially opposed to physical castration.

===Criticism===
In nonhuman animals, the behavioral effects of gonad removal differ along lines of species and not sex, i.e. there are species where mating behavior ceases if the gonads are removed and other species where it does not cease, but removal of ovaries in females halt mating behavior in all of the same nonhuman animals in which male castration halts mating behavior. Therefore some scientists argue that the notion that castration/spaying would drastically reduce sex drive in human males but not in human females is zoologically nonsensical, citing that humans belong to the animal kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criminologists argue that the apparently lower recidivism rates in castrated male sex offenders compared to non-castrated ones does not prove that it is a biological effect of castration (correlation does not equal causation) but can be explained by other factors. One suggested factor from [[game theory]] is that men who are willing to accept castration to get a shorter prison sentence are those who value freedom from prison higher than men who are not willing to pay the price for freedom in the form of their testicles. This hypothesis can explain their apparent lower recidivism as a result of working harder to conceal the evidence for their crimes, and argue that their parole is a danger of releasing offenders who only hide their crimes more efficiently and are not any less likely to commit new crimes. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain neurologists argue that while testosterone most likely increases internal sexual stimulation, a reduction of sex drive is unlikely to result in a reduction of inappropriate sexual behavior, as reduced internal stimulation from hormones merely increases the required external stimulation to reach orgasm. These neurologists cite that spreading of brain activity that stimulate more brain activity can increase their activity and tire the circuits out, the brain’s path to orgasm, enough to tire out with less external stimulation if the internal signal is stronger, and require more specific external stimulation to reach “satisfaction” if the internal signal is weaker.{{clarification needed|date=January 2018}} Therefore, they argue, a reduced testosterone level would make it more difficult, not easier, to manage remaining vestiges of sex drive by masturbating without the use of pornography or to otherwise get by with more socially and legally acceptable substitutes for desires that it would be unacceptable to act on. These neurologists also cite that many people, both men and women, find that higher levels of initial sexual arousal make it easier to masturbate to orgasm without the preferred type of external stimuli, as predicted by the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015).

==Music==
In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to prevent their voices breaking at [[puberty]] and to develop a special high [[Register (music)|voice]]. The first documents mentioning ''[[castrato|castrati]]'' are Italian church records from the 1550s.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;John Rosselli, "Castrato" article in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. [[Mozart]]'s ''Exultate Jubilate'', [[Gregorio Allegri|Allegri]]'s ''[[Gregorio Allegri#The Miserere|Miserere]]'' and other pieces from this period now sung by [[soprano]]s and countertenors were written for ''castrati''. Some of the alto parts of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] were first sung by a ''castrato''. ''Castrati'' include [[Farinelli]], [[Senesino]], [[Giovanni Carestini|Carestini]], and [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]]. The last true ''castrato'' was [[Alessandro Moreschi]] (1858–1922) who served in the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Samantha|title=All mouth and no trousers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/05/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures|website=The Guardian|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of ''castrati''. In Modern times, the Mexican Javier Medina is the only professional opera singer that can perform as a castrato, since he suffered from an involuntary chemical castration, as a result from a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Medina - "I'm A Natural Castrato" - The Finantial Times  [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74d57b3c-a7b8-11dd-865e-000077b07658.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4QmGfBuQ8] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
A number of religions have included castration as a central theme of their practice. These include:

* The cult of [[Cybele]], in which devotees castrated themselves in ecstatic emulation of [[Attis]]: see [[Galli|Gallus]].
* [[Skoptsy]]
* The [[Valesians]].

===Hinduism===
In South Asia, many [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities, led by a guru. The power of the hijras as a sexually ambiguous category can only be understood in the religious context of Hinduism. In some Hindu beliefs, ritual, and art, the power of the combined man/woman, or androgyne, is a frequent and significant theme.

===Christianity===
While castration is not a major part of [[Christianity]], Jesus himself acknowledged in a discussion about avoiding adultery and divorce that some are involuntarily castrated or born that way, while some others "make themselves eunuchs" willingly out of a desire to be chaste {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1–12|KJV}}.  Given Jesus' frequent use of metaphor and hyperbole, e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|9:62|KJV}}, the church has broadly discouraged any understanding of this passage as recommending literal "self-castration".  That is consistent with Jesus' claims (as a rabbi) to uphold the Law given to Moses, e.g. {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17|KJV}}, a Law which also discouraged literal castration {{bibleverse||Deut|23:1|KJV}}.  However, in his own comments Jesus had no condemnation for any of the above.  In {{bibleverse||Acts|8:34–8:39|KJV}}, a eunuch is baptized by [[Philip the Evangelist]], demonstrating acceptance of castrated individuals in his church.

The first canon of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD forbid clergy members to voluntarily castrate themselves "when in perfect health", but freely accepted those who had been either castrated by others against their will, castrated due to a medical sickness or necessity, or those born as eunuchs.

Paul, arguing against self-righteousness regarding [[circumcision]] in {{bibleverse||Galatians|5:12|KJV}}, says ''As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!'' ([[New International Version|NIV]])

Well-known Christian eunuchs (or alleged eunuchs) include:

* [[Origen]], who is reported by [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html |title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine |publisher=Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have castrated himself based on his reading of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} and other passages in Matthew and Mark that appear to endorse voluntary amputation to avoid sin, although there is some doubt concerning this story. [[Philip Schaff|Schaff]] considers the account genuine but cites [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Baur]] ''et al.'' in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html Eusebius' Church History Book 6, Chapter 8 Origen's Daring Deed] note 1809: "This act of Origen’s has been greatly discussed, and some have even gone so far as to believe that he never committed the act ... There is no reason, however, to doubt the report, for which we have unimpeachable testimony, and which is in itself not at all surprising ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Origen argues against such literal interpretations of the passages from Matthew and Mark in his &lt;cite&gt;First Principles&lt;/cite&gt;.
* Bishop [[Melito of Sardis]] (d. ''ca'' 180), who was a [[eunuch]], according to the church history of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], though, significantly the word "virgin" was substituted in [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]' Latin translation of Eusebius.
* [[Boston Corbett]], who was inspired by this same verse {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} to castrate himself (Corbett was the 19th-century American soldier who is generally believed to have fired the shot that killed [[John Wilkes Booth]]).

===Judaism===
[[Judaism]] strictly forbids the castration of either humans or animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbos]] 110b&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 23:1 expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel; they are forbidden to marry or if married must divorce from their wives (though permitting the castrated to marry or remain married to female converts to Judaism). The laws of castration including cases of irreversible or un-reversed vasectomy and all other cases where the flow of sperm is known to have been placed into a permanent state of dysfunction with either no hope or no desire to take the steps to repair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation reinforced by Isaiah 56:3–5 encourages eunuchs who follow after God's laws.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

According to [[Rashi]], Kham (Ham) castrated his father Noah.

In Judaism, castrated animals are deemed unfit for [[sacrifice]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|22:24|}}). Castrated members of the priestly caste are forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple, to approach the altar, or to make sacrifices, although they could eat their share of the offerings and receive the priestly and Levite gifts (Lev. 21:16–24).

===Islam===
In Islam castration is considered a sin, whether one performs it on himself or on another. As Abdullah ibn Mas'ood said "We were on a campaign with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we had no women with us. We said: Why don’t we get ourselves castrated? But he forbade us to do that." The wisdom behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of jihad against the disbelievers. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of disbelievers would have increased, and that is contrary to the purpose for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent. &lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126987/the-ruling-on-castration&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

A subject of castration who is altered before the onset of [[puberty]] will retain a high voice, non-muscular build, and small genitals. He may well be shorter than average, as the production of sex hormones in puberty—more specifically, estrogen via aromatization of testosterone—stops long bone growth. The person may not develop [[pubic hair]] and will have a small sex drive or [[Asexuality|none at all]].

Castrations after the onset of puberty will typically reduce the sex drive considerably or eliminate it altogether. Castrated people are automatically [[Infertility|sterile]], because the [[testes]] (for males) and [[ovaries]] (for females) produce [[sex cells]] needed for [[sexual reproduction]]. Once removed, the subject is infertile. The voice does not change. Some castrated people report mood changes, such as depression or a more serene outlook on life, although this might not be due to chemical changes but instead emotional changes due to the implications of the procedure. Body strength and muscle mass can decrease somewhat. Body hair may sometimes decrease. Castration prevents [[male pattern baldness]] if it is done before hair is lost. However, castration will not restore hair growth after hair has already been lost due to male pattern baldness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historically, many eunuchs who additionally underwent a [[penectomy]] reportedly suffered from urinary incontinence associated with the removal of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&amp;surlignage=2&amp;PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |title=The various types of eunuch in the Byzantine state: their role and symbolic meaning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113171516/http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&amp;surlignage=2&amp;PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT), typical symptoms (similar to those experienced by menopausal women) include hot flashes, gradual bone-density loss resulting in osteopenia or osteoporosis, and potential weight gain or redistribution of body fat to the hips and chest. Replacement of testosterone in the form of gel, patches, or injections can largely reverse these effects, although breast enlargement has also been reported as a possible side effect of testosterone usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/28/article/3047/gm=20!gid2=2824 |title="HRT for Men Is Risky, Too" by Robert W.

A study conducted at a mental institution in Kansas, where a large number of male inmates had been castrated, found that the eunuchs lived an average of 14 years longer than the uncastrated men.&lt;ref name="longevity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-women-live-longer&amp;page=2|title=Why Women Live Longer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study of 81 historical eunuchs in Korea's royal court found a 14 to 19 year increase in lifespan compared to intact men of similar socioeconomic background; these eunuchs had a [[centenarian]] rate of over 3%.&lt;ref name="koreaeun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/24/14070451-upside-to-castration-eunuchs-lived-longer-study-finds|title=Upside to castration?

==Psychoanalysis and literary theory==
The concept of castration plays an important role in [[psychoanalysis]]; ''see'', for example, [[castration anxiety]].

Castration (as a metaphor) also plays an important role in psychoanalytically-influenced literary theory, for example [[Harold Bloom]]'s ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''.

In the Mexican thriller ''[[La casa del pelícano]]'', castration is shown as being connected to the [[Oedipus complex]].

==Chemical castration==
{{Main|Chemical castration}}
In the case of chemical castration, ongoing regular injections of [[anti-androgen]]s are required. Chemical castration does not actually remove the testicles or ovaries of the subject,&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400960_pf.html "Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders?

==Animals==
{{see also|Neutering|Veterinary sterilization surgery}}
[[File:Castration horse.jpg|thumb|Castration being performed on a horse under [[ketamine]] [[anaesthesia]].]]
Humans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding.
Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]]; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]] such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.

Male horses are usually castrated ([[gelding|gelded]]) using [[emasculator]]s, because [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]]s are rather aggressive and troublesome. The same applies to male [[mule]]s, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as [[oxen]].
[[Selective breeding|Breeding]] individuals are kept [[entire (animal)|entire]] and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.

Livestock may be castrated when used for food to increase growth or weight or both of individual male animals{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and because of the undesirable taste and odor of the meat from sexually mature males. In [[domestic pig]]s the taint, called [[boar taint]], is caused by [[androstenone]] and [[skatole]] concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity.&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;[http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm Genetics of Boar Taint: Implications for the Future Use of Intact Males] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031092222/http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm |date=31 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management.&lt;ref name="pigsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |title=Managing Boar Taint: Focus on Genetic Markers |publisher=The Pig Site |date=12 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150415192046/http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers.&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;[http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210034407/http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html|date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name = "PSU"/&gt; Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3950/mythbusting-boar-taint/ |title=Mythbusting Boar Taint|publisher=The Pig Site |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of pets, castration is usually called [[neutering]], and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called [[spaying]]). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, and also prostate problems are somewhat common in castrated male dogs when they get older.&lt;ref name=Teske&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0303-7207(02)00261-7 |title=Canine prostate carcinoma: epidemiological evidence of an increased risk in castrated dogs |date=2002 |last1=Teske |first1=E. |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=197 |pages=251–5 |pmid=12431819 |first2=E.

A. |issue=1–2 |last2=Naan |last3=Van Dijk |last4=Van Garderen |last5=Schalken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutered individuals have a much higher risk of developing prostate problems in comparison. Castrated male cats are more likely to develop an obstruction in their urethra, preventing them from urinating to some degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11345305 |doi=10.2460/javma.2001.218.1429 |date=2001 |author1=Lekcharoensuk |first2=C.

A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species:

&lt;!--Please add in alphabetical order--&gt;
*[[Pig#Pig vocabulary|Barrow]] (pig)
*[[Cattle#Terminology|Bullock]] (cattle)
*[[Capon]] (chicken)
*[[Gelding]] (horse)
*Gib (cat, ferret)
*[[Ox]] (cattle) (Castration performed on mature bull)
*Stag (cattle, sheep)
*[[Cattle#Terminology|Steer]] (cattle) (Castration performed on young calf)
*[[Wikt:wether|Wether]] (sheep, goat)

An incompletely castrated male in livestock species (horse and cattle) is known as a ''rig''.

The term ''stag'' is used for a male animal castrated after the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s have developed to such a point as to give him the appearance of [[sexual maturity]].

[[File:Elastrator rings.JPG|thumb|Rubber rings and pliers used in [[elastration]]]]
Methods of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] castration include instant [[surgical]] removal, the use of an [[elastrator]] tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply, the use of a [[Burdizzo]] tool or [[emasculator]]s to crush the [[spermatic cord]]s and disrupt the blood supply, [[pharmacological]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s and [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s and [[immunological]] techniques to [[inoculation|inoculate]] the animal against his own [[sex hormones|sexual hormones]].

Certain animals, like horses and [[swine]], are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration (which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anesthetic has been applied), while others, like dogs and cats, are anesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre-scrotal incision in the case of dogs, or a pre-scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats.

In veterinary practice an "open" castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured. A "closed" castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision.

==Parasitic infection==
{{main|Parasitic castration}}
Some [[parasite|parasitic]] [[nematode]]s chemically castrate their hosts. For example, ''[[Microphallus]] pseudopygmaeus'' chemically castrates its host, the snail ''[[Onoba aculeus]]'', and causes it to grow larger than normal.

'''Chul Hyun Ahn''' is a South Korean artist who works primarily with light.

==Description==
[[File:Chul Hyun Ahn, "Visual Echo Experiment," 2005, 9 pieces, 104 x 104 x 5.5 inches.jpg|thumb|Chul Hyun Ahn, "Visual Echo Experiment," 2005, 9 pieces, 104 x 104 x 5.5 inches]]
Ahn is a member of a group of young [[light art]]ists including [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Iván Navarro (artist)|Ivan Navarro]], [[Spencer Finch]], and [[Leo Villareal]]. Ahn creates meditations on zen notions of the infinite and the void which distinguishes Ahn's oeuvre from other artists working with light. Ahn’s multiple on-going sculpture series including "Forked Series" and "Tunnel Series" systematically explore the limitations of space and optics.

Hilarie M. Sheets, contributing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'' who also writes regularly for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Art In America]]'', and ''[[Art + Auction]]'', said his work is "At once thrilling and ominous, it suggests a rabbit hole to another world—underwater, outer space, afterlife—or journey to the unknown, the kind of leap of faith involved in the artist’s own passage to an unfamiliar country and language."&lt;ref&gt;Sheets, Hilarie M. Illuminated Void. Comp. C. Grimaldis Gallery. Baltimore: C. Grimaldis Gallery, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a pillar in the resurgence of light art, "Ahn creates sculptures utilizing light, color and illusion as physical representations of his investigation of infinite space." &lt;ref&gt;"Chul Hyun Ahn." C.grimaldisgallery.com. C. Grimaldis Gallery. Web. 12 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.cgrimaldisgallery.com/2010/05/25/chul-hyun-ahn/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahn lives and works in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where he is represented by [[C. Grimaldis Gallery]].

== Biography ==
Chul Hyun Ahn was born in [[Busan]], South Korea. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the [[Chugye University for the Arts]] in [[Seoul]]. In 1997 he moved to the United States and received a Master of Fine Arts from the Mount Royal School at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] in [[Baltimore]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/galleries/artists_detail.asp?G=&amp;gid=424035807&amp;which=&amp;aid=3277649&amp;ViewArtistBy=online&amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com C. Grimaldis Gallery. art net. Artnet Worldwide Corporation. Website. 8 December 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Grimaldis first saw Ahn's work at his 2002 MFA thesis exhibition at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Soon after, he had his first exhibition with C. Grimaldis Gallery in the winter of 2003 in a solo exhibition titled ''Infinity - Emptiness'' which featured six light sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;C. Grimaldis Gallery, "Infinity - Emptiness." Price List. January 9 - February 8, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capricehorn.com/images/Baltimore_Sun_-_Today-(5F0F7955-6561-1004-B5F2-871068250123).pdf Mcnatt, Glenn. "Illuminating Colorful Reflections." The Baltimore Sun [Baltimore&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 17 January 2007, 4C]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003 Chul Hyun Ahn has exhibited extensively nationally and internationally, and his work can be found in numerous important private and public collections.

In a review of Ahn's 2008 C. Grimaldis Gallery solo exhibition, ''Phenomena: Visual Echo'' art critic Cara Ober wrote: "What does infinity look like? Chul Hyun Ahn's show of thirteen mirrored light boxes (all 2008) answered this question over and over, in subtly different ways. The constructions of plywood and fluorescent light with exposed electrical cords unavoidably recall [[Donald Judd]] and [[Dan Flavin]], but Ahn uses these industrial materials to a different end. Rather than clarifying visual phenomena without artifice, Ahn seeks to mystify." &lt;ref&gt;Ober, Cara. "Chul Hyun Ahn." Rev. of Phenomena: Visual Echo solo exhibition. ''ARTnews'' December 2008: 131. Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caraober.com/artwork/920999_ARTnews_Chul_Hyun_Ahn_at_Grimaldis.html Ober, Cara. ''Cara Ober.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7991">{{merge|Civil commitment of sex offenders in the United States|discuss=Talk:Civil confinement#Merger proposal|date=October 2017}}

In the United States, '''civil confinement''' is a term for the formal legal process by which persons convicted of certain sexual offenses (generally violent [[sex offender]]s) may be subject to [[involuntary commitment]] upon completion of a prison sentence.

== Legal process ==

Although the exact details of the legal process may vary from state to state, the [[United States Supreme Court]] reviewed and upheld as constitutional a statutory process adopted in Kansas. See ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', 521 U.S. 346 (1997). There, civil confinement proceedings could be initiated against "any person who has been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence." Many of those terms were themselves defined in the statute, including "mental abnormality," defined as "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others." ''Id''.

If a prison identified an inmate who was about to be released but potentially fit this definition, the prison authorities were required to notify the local prosecutor of the impending release. The prosecutor was then required to decide whether to petition for commitment. The court would then have to determine whether probable cause existed to support the inmate's status as a "sexually violent predator," and, upon such a determination, order the inmate to be psychologically evaluated. The psychological evaluation would then form the basis of a further trial to determine whether the inmate qualified as a violent sexual predator. Upon such a determination, the inmate would be subject to involuntary commitment at a medical facility until such time as his mental abnormality had changed and it was safe to release him.'' Id''. at 353. The court would then be required to conduct an annual review of the determination, and the inmate would always be allowed to petition for freedom under the same standards. The Supreme Court concluded that this process met previously established standards of constitutional [[substantive due process]] governing voluntary confinement, did not constitute [[double jeopardy]] because the proceedings were civil rather than criminal, and was not an ex post facto law for the same reason. ''Id''. at 353-371. In a following case, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the government must demonstrate that the inmate has at least a serious lack of ability to control his behavior. ''[[Kansas v. Crane]]'' 534 U.S. 407 (2002). The Supreme Court has also determined that Congress has the authority to pass a similar law affecting federal prisoners. ''[[United States v. Comstock]]'', 560 U.S. 126 (2010).

Twenty states have civil commitment facilities, as of 2018.&lt;ref name=mail &gt;{{cite news

== Controversy ==

As with [[civil commitment]] generally, civil confinement is a controversial implementation of state power. Detractors point to the prospect of indefinite detention without due process of law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., David Rosen, "Sex Offenders, Civil Confinement and the Resurrection of Evil: The New Disappeared," May 10, 2007, [http://www.counterpunch.org/rosen05102007.html Counterpunch] ("Civil confinement permits the state to transform a criminal sentence with a specified duration into an indeterminate life sentence.") Accessed January 24, 2008; Mark K. Matthews, "Molesters confined even after jail time is up" [http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=87312 State Line] ("When the most dangerous sexual predators are due to leave prison ... officials can revoke their freedom and toss them into mental hospitals indefinitely.") Accessed January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents cite public safety.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Don Esmonde, "No mercy due 100-year-old pedophile," December 13, 2009, [http://www.buffalonews.com/donnesmonde/story/892797.html The Buffalo News]. Accessed December 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

State legislatures who have decided to adopt civil confinement statutes have expressed the intent of the laws in their enactments. One example is the state of Washington, which explained:

:The legislature finds that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exist who do not have a mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for the existing involuntary treatment act . . . which is intended to be a short-term civil commitment system that is primarily designed to provide short-term treatment to individuals with serious mental disorders and then return them to the community. In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment . . . sexually violent predators generally have personality disorders and/or mental abnormalities which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those conditions render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature further finds that sex offenders' likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high. The existing involuntary commitment act . . . is inadequate to address the risk to reoffend because during confinement these offenders do not have access to potential victims and therefore they will not engage in an overt act during confinement as required by the involuntary treatment act for continued confinement. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for curing sexually violent offenders is poor, the treatment needs of this population are very long term, and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropriate for commitment under the involuntary treatment act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09.010 RCW 70.09.010].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive styles analysis''' ('''CSA''') was developed by Richard J. Riding and is the most frequently used computerized measure of [[cognitive style]]s. Although CSA is not well known in North American institutions, it is quite popular among European universities and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rezaei and Katz|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Rezaei and Katz|2004|p=1318}} state:

:"A number of different labels have been given to cognitive styles and, according to Riding, many of these are but different conceptions of the same dimensions {{Harv|Riding|Sadler-Smith|1992}}. Riding and Cheema {{Harv|Riding|Cheema|1991}} surveyed the various (about 30) labels and, after reviewing the descriptions, correlations, methods of assessment, and effect on behavior, concluded that the styles may be grouped into two principal groups: [[Cognitive style#Multi-dimensional models and measures|the Wholist-Analytic and the Verbal-Imagery]] dimensions. It is argued that these dimensions of cognitive style are very fundamental because they develop early in life and are pervasive given their effect on social behavior, decision making, and learning."

Unlike many other cognitive style measures, CSA has been the subject of much empirical investigation. Three experiments reported by {{Harvtxt|Rezaei and Katz|2004}} showed the reliability of CSA to be low. Considering the theoretical strength of CSA, and unsuccessful earlier attempts to create a more reliable parallel form of it {{Harv|Peterson|2003}}, a revised version was made to improve its validity and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rezaei and Katz|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cremieux 136.jpg|thumbnail|The decree]]
The '''Crémieux Decree''' ({{IPA-fr|kʁemjø|lang}}) was a law that granted [[French citizenship]] to the majority of the Jewish population in [[French Algeria]] (around 35,000), signed by the [[Government of National Defense]] on 24 October 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was named after [[French-Jewish]] lawyer and Minister of Justice [[Adolphe Crémieux]], who had founded the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] a decade earlier.

It was signed as Decree 136 of 1870&lt;ref&gt;({{cite French decree|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 136|date in French=24 octobre 1870|lower case=yes}})&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Adolphe Crémieux]] as Minister of Justice, [[Léon Gambetta]] as Minister of the Interior, [[Alexandre Glais-Bizoin]] and [[:fr:Martin Fourichon|Martin Fourichon]] as a naval and colonial minister. The ministers were members of the military government in Tours, the Gouvernement de la Défense nationale, since France was still at war, and the provisional government had its seat in Tours.

At the same time the naturalization regime in French Algeria was confirmed in Decree 137, determining that Muslims are not French citizens in the French colony of Algeria. The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l'indigénat.

The decree allowed for native [[Jews]] to automatically become [[French citizens]] while [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]] were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the [[Indigénat|Code de l'Indigénat]]. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted. That set the scene for deteriorating relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities and proved fateful in the [[Algerian War of Independence]], after which the vast majority of the French Jews of Algeria emigrated to France.

Decrees 136 and 137 were published in Official Gazette of the City Tours (''Bulletin officielle de la ville de Tours'') on 7 November 1870.

From 1940 to 1943, the Crémieux Decree was abolished under the Vichy regime.

==Text of the decree==
{|class="messagebox"
|
French Republic
No. 136. - Declaring the indigenous Jews of Algeria French citizens.
24 October 1870.

The Government of National Defense Decrees:

The indigenous Jews of the departments of Algeria are declared French citizens; therefore, their actual status and personal status will, after the promulgation of this decree, be settled by French law, any rights acquired to date remaining inviolable.

Any legislative provision, any [[Sénatus-consulte]], decree, regulation or ordinance to the contrary is abolished.

Done at Tours, 24 October 1870

Signed Ad. Cremieux, L. Gambetta, AL. Glais-Bizoin, L. Fourichon

[[File:Inner Sanctum of Sri Chalukya Kumara Rama Bheemeshwara Swamy Temple in SAMALKOT.jpg|thumb|360px|A ''darśana'' literally a means glimpse or view. In a [[Hindu temple]], the term refers to viewing the inner sanctum under the main [[Shikhara]] or [[Gopuram]] of the temple, which hosts the [[murti]] (image of a god). The above arrangement is for darśana at the [[Chalukya Kumararama Bhimeswara Temple]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]

'''Darśana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दर्शन, lit. ''view, sight'') is the auspicious sight of a deity or a holy person.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} The term also refers to six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] and their literature on spirituality and [[soteriology]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word, also in the forms of ''darśana'' or ''darshanam'', comes from [[Sanskrit]] दर्शन, from ''dṛś'', "to see", [[vision (spirituality)|vision]], apparition or glimpse.

==Definition==
''Darśana'' is described as an "auspicious sight" of a holy person, which bestows merit on the person who is seen.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} "Sight" here means seeing or beholding, and/or being seen or beheld.

It is most commonly used for [[theophany]], "manifestation / visions of the divine", in [[Hindu worship]], e.g. of a deity (especially in image form), or a very holy person or artifact. One can receive ''darśana'' or a glimpse of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great [[guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Darshan |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151828/darshan |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=12 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
The term ''darśana'' also refers to the six systems of thought, called ''darśanam'', that comprise classical [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royperrett284&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, pages 88, 284&lt;/ref&gt; The term therein implies how each of these six systems distinctively look at things and the scriptures in Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=royperrett284/&gt;&lt;ref name=britdarshan/&gt; The six orthodox Hindu ''darśana'' are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta]]. Buddhism and Jainism are examples of non-Hindu ''darśana''s.&lt;ref name=britdarshan&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/darshan Darshan - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Mahayana Buddhism ==
&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Mahāyāna Buddhism" links here. Please adjust accordingly if renaming or removing section.--&gt;
On the significance of ''darśana'' in [[Mahayana]] thought, Paul Harrison writes: "By the second century CE... the vision of the [[Buddha]] (''buddha-darśana'') and the accompanying hearing of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (''dharma-śravaṇa'') are represented as a transformation experience of decisive importance for practitioners, be they who have renounced (mundane life) "ascetics" or householders."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harrison, "Commemoration and identification in Buddhanusmṛti", in {{harvnb|Gyatso|1992|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhidharma]], collections of systematic summaries of the [[sutra]]s, mention ''Darśana-[[citta]], i.e.'' [[vision (spirituality)|visions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyatso|1992|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Mahayana philosophers [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Asanga]] acknowledged [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#Five Paths|five paths to liberation]], of which the third is ''darśana-marga'', the "path of seeing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gethin|1998|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nagarjuna]], a prominent philosopher of the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Mahayana Buddhism, wrote that the wise person perceives ''[[tattva]]-darśana,'' true reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] |trans-title=Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way |chapter=Chapter 26 |at=verse 10 |nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unno|1993|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}

==Other meanings==
''Darśana'' also sometimes has a more mundane meaning. For example, [[Sivananda Saraswati]] wrote in his book ''The Practice of Brahmacharya'' that one of the eight aspects of [[brahmacharya]] ([[Celibacy#Hinduism|celibacy]]) is not to look lustfully at women: "You should carefully avoid... Darshana or looking at women with passionate resolve".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sivananda|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar of religion Richard H. Davis has said that ''darśana'' (viewpoint, philosophical school) is one of three terms in classical Indian discourse that could be considered roughly analogous to what today's English-speakers understand as "religion." The other two terms are ''[[dharma]]'' (duty, morality, a code of proper conduct) and ''[[Buddhist Paths to liberation|marga]]'' (route, spiritual path). According to Davis, "most Hindu texts accepted that religious paths (''marga'') are relative to the points of view (''darśana'') and moral responsibilities (''dharma'') of practitioners, whose individual circumstances may make one or another course of action more appropriate in their particular situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2008|pp=363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet [[Gary Snyder]] has given a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] meaning to ''darśana'': 
{{quote|It's a gift; it's like there's a moment in which the thing is ready to let you see it. In India, this is called ''darshan''. Darshan means getting a view, and if the clouds blow away, as they did once for me, and you get a view of the [[Himalayas]] from the foothills, an Indian person would say, 'Ah, the Himalayas are giving you their darshana'; they're letting you have their view. This comfortable, really deep way of getting a sense of something takes time. It doesn't show itself to you right away. It isn't even necessary to know the names of things the way a botanist would. It's more important to be aware of the '[[suchness]]' of the thing; it's a reality. It's also a source of a certain kind of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for [[creativity]]. I see it in the work of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1994|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Sikh culture, folios or manuscripts that depict all ten Gurus on a single page are called ''darśana'' paintings, simply because they offer a vision of all ten sacred Gurus in one glance.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Deep ecology''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] and [[environmental philosophy]] promoting the inherent worth of living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs, plus a radical restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas. 

Deep ecology argues that the natural world is a subtle balance of complex inter-relationships in which the existence of organisms is dependent on the existence of others within [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ecosystems are also considered to be dependent on other ecosystems within the [[biosphere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.

Deep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain inalienable legal [[rights]] to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as "deep" because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology.&lt;ref name="Smith2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Mick |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology: What is Said and (to be) Done? |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1378/1660 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141–156 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement does not subscribe to [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes) since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of philosophical assumptions. Deep ecology takes a more [[holistic view]] of the world human beings live in and seeks to apply to life the understanding that the separate parts of the ecosystem (including humans) function as a whole. This philosophy provides a foundation for the [[environmental movement|environmental]], [[ecology movement|ecology]], and [[green movement]]s and has fostered a new system of [[environmental ethics]] advocating [[wilderness]] preservation, [[human population control]], and [[simple living]].&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E. Gene Frankland|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTB4OMgsxIEC&amp;pg=PA161|isbn=9780415202855}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Origins ==
In his original 1972/73 deep ecology paper, [[Arne Næss]] claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists – who were out in the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were [[Rachel Carson]], [[David Brower]], and [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sessions |first=George |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology, New Conservation, and the Anthropocene Worldview |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1404/1658 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=106–114 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. ''Silent Spring'' helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.

The 1960s was a decade of vigorous social [[activism]] in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia. Some activism focused on war and peace and the issue of nuclear weapons. A well-known early environmental organization started with a focus on nuclear tests and their environmental hazards. Some people in British Columbia, Canada, were opposed to the test of a nuclear weapon by the US government on Amchitka Island. They hired a fishing vessel and sailed towards the nuclear test site in protest. This action led to the founding of [[Greenpeace]], which became more identified with environmental issues as time went by. These great movements were further catalyzed by the now iconic images of the whole Earth floating in space taken during the return of the Apollo space missions from their journey to the moon. Among the astronauts that witnessed seeing the whole Earth firsthand was [[Edgar D. Mitchell]], who in 1971, during the return mission of Apollo 14, had an epiphany that what is needed to solve the eco-crisis "is a transformation of consciousness".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alan |last1=Drengson |first2=Bill |last2=Devall |first3=Mark A. |last3=Schroll |date=2011 |title=The Deep Ecology Movement: Origins, Development, and Future Prospects (Toward a Transpersonal Ecosophy) |journal=International Journal of Transpersonal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |pages=101–117 |doi=10.24972/ijts.2011.30.1-2.101 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

Proponents of deep ecology believe that the world does not exist as a [[natural resource|resource]] to be freely [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited]] by humans. If material goods do not guarantee happiness beyond a very moderate level, and over-consumption is endangering the biosphere, defining a new non-consumptive paradigm of well-being seems primordial, such a paradigm would be non-acquisitive/non-consumerist and non-hierarchical in relation to our place on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Tom|last2=Guyas|first2=Anniina Suominen|title=Earth Education, Interbeing, and Deep Ecology|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=53|issue=3|year=2015|pages=223–245|issn=0039-3541|doi=10.1080/00393541.2012.11518865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics of deep ecology hold that the survival of any part is dependent upon the well-being of the whole. Proponents of deep ecology offer an eight-tier platform to elucidate their claims:

{{quotation|
*The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves. These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
*Richness and [[diversity of life]] forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves
*Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital human needs
*The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the [[human population]]. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
*Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening
*Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
*The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating [[life quality]] (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between ''big'' and ''great''.
*Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

==Development==
The phrase "deep ecology" was coined by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Naess1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Næss|first1=Arne|title=The shallow and the deep, long‐range ecology movement. A summary|journal=Inquiry|volume=16|issue=1–4|year=1973|pages=95–100|issn=0020-174X|doi=10.1080/00201747308601682|url=http://wildsreprisal.com/PDF's/Cascadia%20Rising/The%20shallow%20and%20the%20deep,%20long-range%20ecology%20movement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss rejected the idea that beings can be ranked according to their relative value. For example, judgments on whether an animal has an eternal [[soul]], whether it uses [[reason]] or whether it has [[consciousness]] (or indeed [[higher consciousness]]) have all been used to justify the ranking of the [[human|human animal]] as superior to other animals. Næss states that from an ecological point of view "the right of all forms [of life] to live is a universal right which cannot be quantified. No single species of living being has more of this particular right to live and unfold than any other species."{{fact|date=November 2018}}

This [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] idea is elucidated in [[Warwick Fox]]'s claim that humanity and all other beings are "aspects of a single unfolding reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Warwick, (1990) ''Towards a Transpersonal Ecology'' (Shambhala Books)&lt;/ref&gt;  As such deep ecology would support the view of [[Aldo Leopold]] in his book  ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' that humans are "plain members of the biotic community". They also would support [[Land ethic#Aldo Leopold's land ethic|Leopold's land ethic]]: "a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the [[biocoenosis|biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."  Daniel Quinn, in his novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'', showed that an anthropocentric myth underlies our current view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel (1995), "Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit" (Bantam)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological problems faced by the world today are partly due to the loss of traditional knowledge, values, and ethics of behavior that celebrate the intrinsic value and sacredness of the natural world and that give the preservation of Nature prime importance. Correspondingly, the assumption of human superiority to other life forms, as if we were granted royalty status over Nature - the idea that Nature is mainly here to serve human will and purpose - receives a radical critique in deep ecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deep ecology developed a response to the anthropocentric view and several different actors played an important historical role in its development. Prominent among them was [[Joseph W. Meeker]], who in 1973 told [[George Sessions]] about Arne Næss, whom Meeker knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Merle|title=Sustainable development and deep ecology: An analysis of competing traditions|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=477–488|doi=10.1007/BF02400853|issn=0364-152X|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Warwick Fox related, "One of the things that initially interested Sessions about Næss was Næss's strong interest in, and innovative approach to, the work of Spinoza. Sessions says that he had himself 'arrived at Spinoza as the answer to the process of teaching history of philosophy by about 1972 and independently of being in contact with Næss.'"{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Sessions therefore wrote to Næss at this time, beginning a lifelong association. Meeker's (1972, 1997) book ''The Comedy of Survival: Studies in Literary Ecology'' emerged through the work of scholars seeking an environmental ethic. That book represents Meeker's founding work in literary ecology and [[ecocriticism]], which demonstrates the relationship between the literary arts and scientific ecology, especially humankind's consideration of comedy and tragedy. It reminds readers that adaptive behaviors (comedy) promote survival, whereas tragedy estranges from other life forms. This thesis rests on Meeker's study of comparative literature, his work with biologist [[Konrad Lorenz]], and his work as a field ecologist in the National Park service in Alaska, Oregon, and California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deep ecology offers a philosophical basis for environmental advocacy which may, in turn, guide human activity against perceived self-destruction. Deep ecology and [[environmentalism]] hold that the science of ecology [[History of ecology|shows]] that [[ecosystem]]s can absorb only limited change by humans or other dissonant influences. Further, both hold that the actions of modern civilization threaten global ecological well-being. Ecologists have described change and stability in ecological systems in various ways, including [[homeostasis]], [[dynamic equilibrium]], and "flux of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-First Century.'' Oxford Univ. Press, NY, NY. {{ISBN|0-19-507469-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which model is most accurate, [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} contend that massive human economic activity has pushed the [[biosphere]] far from its "natural" state through reduction of [[biodiversity#Ecological role of biodiversity|biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and other influences. As a consequence, civilization is causing [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] at a rate between 100 species a day and possibly 140,000 species a year, which is 10,000 times the background rate of extinction. Deep ecologists hope to influence social and political change through their philosophy. Næss has proposed, as [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] writes, "that the earth’s human population should be reduced to about 100 million."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"/&gt;

== Environmental education ==
Ecology in the narrow sense refers to the biological science of [[ecology]]. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms have to do with the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes.&lt;ref name="Smith2014" /&gt; Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriate because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.

Ecopedagogy calls for the remaking of capitalist practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests in the face of our current global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education.  In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopnina|first=Helen|date=2015-03-01|title=If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound: Teaching Deep Ecology to Business Students|url=http://jsd.sagepub.com/content/9/1/101|journal=Journal of Education for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=101–116|doi=10.1177/0973408215569119|issn=0973-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misiaszek|first1=Greg William|title=Ecopedagogy and Citizenship in the Age of Globalisation: connections between environmental and global citizenship education to save the planet|journal=European Journal of Education|volume=50|issue=3|year=2015|pages=280–292|issn=01418211|doi=10.1111/ejed.12138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model. The process of environmental education of schoolchildren has the following methodological characteristics:

* Goal-setting as the projected results reflects a model of environmentally responsible personality, taking into account trends in the development of key elements of education system; all natural sciences are involved in the development of basic ecological concepts.

* The introduction of interactive training methods takes place at the high school level in teaching self-reflection, hypothesizing, predicting; school natural science education is rebuilt on the basis of system approach in accordance with the planned ecologization results. Implementation of relevant methodology will promote successful development of environmentally responsible personality in high school graduates.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015" /&gt;

In higher education, the analysis of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” provides an example of how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her book ''Wild Children — Domesticated Dreams: Civilization and the Birth of Education'', [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that the current institutions responsible for the construction and transmission of civilized epistemology are driven by the destructive premises at the foundation of civilization and human predatory culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild children--domesticated dreams : civilization and the birth of education|last=Layla.|first=AbdelRahim|date=2013|publisher=Fernwood Pub|isbn=9781552665480|location=Winnipeg|oclc=829422058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to return to a viable socio-environmental culture, AbdelRahim calls for the rewilding of our anthropology (i.e. our place among other species) and of pedagogical culture, which in civilization is based on the same domestication methods of other animals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

===Scientific===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Old-growth forest]] in [[Biogradska Gora National Park]], [[Montenegro]]]]
Næss and Fox do not claim to use [[logic]] or [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] to derive the philosophy directly from scientific ecology&lt;ref name="Naess1973" /&gt; but rather hold that scientific ecology directly implies the metaphysics of deep ecology, including its ideas about the self and further, that deep ecology finds scientific underpinnings in the fields of [[ecology]] and [[system dynamics]].

In their 1985 book ''Deep Ecology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Devall and George Sessions describe a series of sources of deep ecology.  They include the science of ecology itself, and cite its major contribution as the rediscovery in a modern context that "everything is connected to everything else."  They point out that some ecologists and natural historians, in addition to their scientific viewpoint, have developed a deep ecological consciousness—for some a [[political consciousness]] and at times a [[spiritual consciousness]].  This is a perspective beyond the strictly human viewpoint, beyond [[anthropocentrism]].  Among the scientists they mention specifically are [[Rachel Carson]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[John Livingston (naturalist)|John Livingston]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Barry Commoner]], together with [[Frank Fraser Darling]], [[Charles Sutherland Elton]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Paul Sears]].

A further scientific source for deep ecology adduced by Devall and Sessions is the "new physics", which they describe as shattering [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s vision of the universe as a machine explainable in terms of simple [[linear]] cause and effect. They propose that Nature is in a state of constant flux and reject the idea of observers as existing independent of their environment.  They refer to [[Fritjof Capra]]'s ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]'' for their characterisation of how the new physics leads to metaphysical and ecological views of interrelatedness, which, according to Capra, should make deep ecology a framework for future human societies. Devall and Sessions also credit the American poet and social critic [[Gary Snyder]]—with his devotion to [[Buddhism]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] studies, the outdoors, and alternative social movements—as a major voice of wisdom in the evolution of their ideas.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] was also an influence on the deep ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual===
The central spiritual tenet of deep ecology is that the human species is a part of the Earth, not separate from it, and as such human existence is dependent on the diverse organisms within the natural world each playing a role in the natural economy of the biosphere. Coming to an awareness of this reality involves a transformation of an outlook that presupposes humanity's superiority over the natural world. This self-realisation or "re-earthing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Ecology &amp; re-earthing ~ Q&amp;A|url=http://www.users.on.net/~arachne/deepeco.html|work=users.on.net/~arachne/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for an individual to intuitively gain an ecocentric perspective. The notion is based on the idea that the more we ''expand the self'' to identify with "others" (people, animals, ecosystems), the more we realize ourselves.  [[Transpersonal psychology]] has been used by [[Warwick Fox]] to support this idea.  Deep ecology has influenced the development of contemporary [[ecospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spiritual and philosophical traditions including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] are drawn upon in a continuing critique of the philosophical assumptions of the modern European mind which has enabled and led to what is seen as an increasingly unsustainable level of disregard towards the rights and needs of the natural world and its ability to continue to support human life. In relation to the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, Næss offers the following criticism: "The arrogance of stewardship [as found in the [[Bible]]] consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the [[God|Creator]] and Creation."&lt;ref&gt;Næss, Arne. (1989). ''Ecology, Community and Lifestyle: Outline of an Ecosophy''. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-521-34873-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theme had been expounded in [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]]'s 1967 article "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} ([http://www.zbi.ee/~kalevi/lwhite.htm HTML copy], [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~glennon/LynnWhitearticle.pdf PDF copy]).&lt;/ref&gt; in which however he also offered as an alternative Christian view of man's relation to nature that of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]], who he says spoke for the equality of all creatures, in place of the idea of man's domination over creation. Næss' further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use: a view used frequently in the past to exploit and dispossess native populations.  Many Protestant sects today regard the Bible's call for man to have stewardship of the earth as a call for the care for creation, rather than for exploitation.

The original Christian teachings on property support the Franciscan/stewardship interpretation of the Bible. Against this view, Martin Luther condemned church ownership of lands because "they did not want to use that property in an economically productive fashion. At best they used it to produce prayers. Luther, and other Reformation leaders insisted that it should be used, not to relieve men from the necessity of working, but as a tool for making more goods. The attitude of the Reformation was practically, "not prayers, but production." And production, not for consumption, but for more production." This justification was offered to support secular takings of church endowments and properties.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Richard (1951). Private Property: the History of an Idea. (Rutgers Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Layla AbdelRahim]] sees the root of the anthropogenic degradation of the biosphere in the anthropology that constructs the human animal as the supreme predator. The ontological explanation offered for Human Supremacy by both science and religion, she says, alienate the human being from the community of life and allow for an immoral control and destruction of the wilderness, which, according to her contains the spirit and intelligence of life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Philosophical roots ===

==== Spinoza ====
[[Arne Næss]], who first wrote about the idea of deep ecology, from the early days of developing this outlook conceived [[Baruch Spinoza]] as a philosophical source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Naess | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1007/BF02379991 | title = Spinoza and ecology | journal = Philosophia | volume = 7 | pages = 45–54 | year = 1977 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have followed Næss' inquiry, including Eccy de Jonge, in ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Jonge |first=Eccy |date=April 28, 2004 |title=Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism (Ashgate New Critical Thinking in Philosophy)  |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=978-0754633273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brenden MacDonald, in ''Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity—Realization of Eco-Literacies''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Brenden James|date=2012-05-14|title=Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity -- Schizophrenics and Others Who Could Heal the Earth If Society Realized Eco-Literacy|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/1229|journal=Trumpeter|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=89–101|issn=1705-9429}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--http://www.environment-ecology.com/deep-ecology/63-deep-ecology.html mentions it --&gt;.

One of the topical centres of inquiry connecting Spinoza to Deep Ecology is "self-realization."  See Arne Næss in ''The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology movement'' and ''Spinoza and the Deep Ecology Movement'' for discussion on the role of Spinoza's conception of self-realization and its link to deep ecology.

==Criticism, debate, and response==

===Knowledge of non-human interests===
Animal rights activists state that for an entity to require rights and protection [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsically]], it must have interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| last=Feinberg

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology is criticised for assuming that living things such as plants, for example, have their own interests as they are manifested by the plant's behavior—for instance, self-preservation being considered an expression of a will to live. Deep ecologists claim to ''identify'' with non-human nature, and in doing so, deny those who claim that non-human (or non-sentient) lifeforms' needs or interests are nonexistent or unknowable. The criticism is that the interests that a deep ecologist attributes to non-human organisms such as survival, reproduction, growth, and prosperity are really human interests. This is sometimes construed as a [[pathetic fallacy]] or [[anthropomorphism]], in which "the earth is endowed with 'wisdom', wilderness equates with 'freedom', and life forms are said to emit 'moral' qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==="Deepness"===
Deep ecology is criticised for its claim to being ''deeper'' than alternative theories, which by implication are ''shallow''. When [[Arne Næss]] coined the term ''deep ecology'', he compared it favourably with ''shallow environmentalism'' which he criticized for its [[utilitarian]] and [[anthropocentric]] attitude to nature and for its [[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[consumerism|consumer-oriented]] outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=Great River Earth Institute
| url=http://www.greatriv.org/de.htm
| title=Deep Ecology: Environmentalism as if all beings mattered
| accessdate=2006-04-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this is [[Arne Næss]]'s own view that the "depth" of deep ecology resides in the persistence of its penetrative questioning, particularly in asking "Why?" when faced with initial answers.

Writer William D. Grey believes that developing a non-anthropocentric set of values is "a hopeless quest". He seeks an improved "shallow" view, writing, "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology by William Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookchin's criticisms===
Some critics, particularly [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], have interpreted deep ecology as being [[misanthropic|hateful toward humanity]], due in part to the characterization of humanity by some deep ecologists, such as [[David Foreman]] of [[Earth First!]], as a pathological infestation on the Earth.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (1998).

therefore asserts that "deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics, has managed to bring sincere naturalists like Paul Shepard into the same company as patently antihumanist and macho mountain men like David Foreman who preach a gospel that humanity is some kind of cancer in the world of life."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly anti-human measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve".&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; However, Bookchin himself later admitted that "statements made by Earth First! activists are not to be confused with those made by deep ecology theorists".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecophilosopher [[Warwick Fox]] similarly "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.' That is, just because deep ecology criticizes an arrogant anthropocentrism does ''not'' mean that deep ecology is misanthropic."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"/&gt; Likewise, ''The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology'' attempts to clarify that "deep ecologists have been the strongest critics of [[anthropocentrism]], so much so that they have often been accused of a mean-spirited misanthropy"; however, "deep ecology is actually vitally concerned with humans realizing their best potential" and "is explicit in offering a vision of an alternative way of living that is joyous and enlivening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deep Ecology Movement|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, CA|year=1995|editor=Alan Drengson and Yuichi Inoue|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M4SwWkKLZ4C&amp;printsec=onepage&amp;q=262|isbn=9781556431982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin's second major criticism is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with [[authoritarianism]] and [[hierarchy]]. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly rooted in the manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that "can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Though some deep ecologists may reject the argument that ecological behavior is rooted in the social paradigm (which, according to their view, would be an anthropocentric fallacy), others in fact embrace this argument, such as the adherents to the deep ecologist movement [[Deep Green Resistance]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; has likened deep ecology to its antithesis, the [[wise use]] movement, when he says that they both "misunderstand scientific information and then arrive at conclusions based on their misunderstanding, which are in turn used as justification for their ideologies. Both begin with an ideology and are political and social in focus." Elsewhere, though, he asserts that deep ecology must be taken seriously in the debate about the relationship between humans and nature because it challenges the fundamental assumptions of [[Western philosophy]]. Botkin has also criticized Næss's restatement and reliance upon the balance of nature idea and the perceived contradiction between his argument that all species are morally equal and his disparaging description of [[pioneering species]].

=== Response ===
Some writers have misunderstood Næss, taking his ecosophy T, with its self-realization norm, as something meant to characterize the whole deep ecology movement as part of a single philosophy called "deep ecology". Næss was not doing either of these. He emphasized that movements cannot be precisely defined, but only roughly characterized by very general statements. They are often united internationally by means of such principles as found in the United Nations (UN) Earth Charter (1980), and in UN documents about basic human rights. Næss was doing something more subtle than many thought. He was not putting forth a single worldview and philosophy of life that everyone should adhere to in support of the international ecology movement. Instead, he was making an empirical claim based on overwhelming evidence that global social movements, from the grass roots up, consist of people with very diverse religious, philosophical, cultural, and personal orientations. Nonetheless, they can agree on certain courses of action and certain broad principles, especially at the international level. As supporters of a given movement, they can treat one another with mutual respect. Because of these misunderstandings Næss introduced an apron diagram to clearly illustrate his subtle distinctions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The apron diagram is meant to illustrate logical, as distinct from genetic, relations between views and their connection with social movements, policies and practical actions. By "logical relations" this means verbally articulated relations between the premises and conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is collective cooperation on global concerns, and yet a great variety of ultimate premises from which each person or group acts locally. Within global movements there is diversity at the local level because each place and community is different and must adapt to its unique setting. Thus, Næss stressed that his ecosophy T is not meant to hold for everyone, since it is tailored to his very modest lifestyle suitable to a place such as Tvergastein. The ultimate premises for his whole view might be conceptually incompatible with those in someone else's whole views. But even if this is true, they could both support the platform principles of the deep ecology movement and other social-political global movements, such as for peace and social justice. In recognizing the principle that all living beings have intrinsic worth, there is an acknowledgement that they are good for their own sake. This does not mean committing to biocentric equality or egalitarianism between species. Within the vast diversity of living beings, there are complex relationships the range of which is predation, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis. Many think that symbiosis and complementarity are important values to embrace as they are consistent with global cooperation, community life, and support for the deep ecology movement platform.

==Ecofeminist response==
Ecofeminism and deep ecology have been in dialogue for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting with the natural world may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, [[weasel words|some]] have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diehm |first=Christian |date=2003 |title=The Self of Stars and Stone: Ecofeminism, Deep Ecology, and the Ecological Self |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/79/79 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=31–45 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booth |first=Annie |date=2000 |title=Ways of Knowing: Acceptable Understandings Within Bioregionalism, Deep Ecology, Ecofeminism, and Native American Cultures |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/145/170 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=1 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fellenz|first=Marc R.|title=The Moral Menagerie|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/611905|language=English|isbn=9780252091186|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.

Both [[ecofeminism]] and deep ecology put forward a new conceptualization of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as [[Marti Kheel]],&lt;ref&gt;Kheel, Marti. (1990): ''Ecofeminism and Deep Ecology; reflections on identity and difference'' from: Diamond, Irene. Orenstein. Gloria (editors), ''Reweaving the World; The emergence of ecofeminism''. Sierra Club Books. San Francisco. pp 128-137. {{ISBN|0-87156-623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places too much emphasis on the whole, at the expense of the independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of [[androcentrism]] rather than [[anthropocentrism]]. To others, like [[Karen J. Warren]], the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract [[individualism]] and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as [[racism]] or [[speciesism]], are all forms of [[discrimination]] and are no different from [[sexism]]. Thus, [[anthropocentrism]] is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed [[value system|value structure]] and should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren|first=Karen J.|authorlink=Karen J. Warren|chapter=The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism|edition=5th|editor1-last=Pojman|editor1-first=Louis P.|editor1-link=Louis Pojman|editor2-last=Pojman|editor2-first=Paul|title=Environmental Ethics: Readings in Theory and Application|year=2008|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|pages=33–48|isbn=978-0-495-09503-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential deep ecologist [[Joanna Macy]] has attempted to avoid these conflicts and criticisms through her [[Work that Reconnects]].  By focussing deep ecology on the experience of the consciousness of personal depth within the participant, she speaks of "the greening of the self", which is part of the epochal journey of our times from an [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]ic or [[egotistical]] self to an ecological self.

==Links with other philosophies==
Parallels have been drawn between deep ecology and other philosophies, in particular those of the [[animal rights]] movement, [[Earth First!]], [[Deep Green Resistance]], and [[anarcho-primitivism]].

[[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' critiqued anthropocentrism and put the case for animals to be given moral consideration. This can be seen as a part of a process of expanding the prevailing system of ethics to wider groupings. However, Singer has disagreed with deep ecology's belief in the intrinsic value of nature separate from questions of suffering, taking a more utilitarian stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Gillian (May 2011 ). [http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/425/the_greater_good The Greater Good: Peter Singer On How To Live An Ethical Life]. ''Sun Magazine'', The Sun Interview, Issue 425. Retrieved on: 2011-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminism|feminist]] and [[civil rights movement]]s also brought about expansion of the ethical system for their particular domains. Likewise deep ecology brought the whole of nature under moral consideration.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The links with [[animal rights]] are perhaps the strongest, as "proponents of such ideas argue that 'All life has intrinsic value'".&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite book

Many in the radical environmental direct-action movement [[Earth First!]] claim to follow deep ecology, as indicated by one of their slogans ''No compromise in defence of mother earth''. In particular, [[David Foreman]], the co-founder of the movement, has also been a strong advocate for deep ecology, and engaged in a public debate with [[Murray Bookchin]] on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judi Bari]] was another prominent Earth Firster who espoused deep ecology. Many Earth First! actions have a distinct deep ecological theme; often these actions will be to save an area of [[old growth forest]], the habitat of a snail or an owl, even individual trees. Actions are often symbolic or have other political aims. At one point Arne Næss also engaged in environmental direct action, though not under the Earth First! banner, when he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], in a successful protest against the building of a dam.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seed, J. Macy, P. Flemming, A. Næss, ''Thinking like a mountain: towards a council of all beings'', Heretic Books (1988), {{ISBN|0-946097-26-7}}, {{ISBN|0-86571-133-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[anarchism|anarchist]] currents in the movement, especially in the United Kingdom. For example, [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]], pioneer of [[forest gardening]] in temperate climates, wrote the essay "Can Life Survive?" in ''Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism|publisher=Freedom Press|year=1993|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Deep_Ecology___Anarchism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10693">The '''disposition effect''' is an anomaly discovered in [[behavioral finance]]. It relates to the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value, while keeping [[assets]] that have dropped in value.

[[Hersh Shefrin]] and Meir Statman identified and named the effect in their 1985 paper, which found that people dislike losing significantly more than they enjoy winning. The disposition effect has been described as "[o]ne of the most robust facts about the trading of individual investors" because investors will hold stocks that have lost value yet sell stocks that have gained value."&lt;ref name="ShefrinStatman1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shefrin|first1=Hersh|last2=Statman|first2=Meir|title=The Disposition to Sell Winners Too Early and Ride Losers Too Long: Theory and Evidence|journal=The Journal of Finance|date=July 1985|volume=40|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1985.tb05002.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1985.tb05002.x|accessdate=26 September 2018|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] traced the cause of the disposition effect to the so-called "[[prospect theory]]". The prospect theory proposes that when an individual is presented with two equal choices, one having possible gains and the other with possible losses, the individual is more likely to opt for the former choice even though both would yield the same economic result.

The disposition effect can be minimized by a mental approach called "hedonic framing".

==Overview==
Nicholas Barberis and Wei Xiong have described the disposition effect as "[o]ne of the most robust facts about the trading of individual investors.” The effect, they note, “has been documented in all the available large databases of individual investor trading activity and has been linked to important pricing phenomena such as post-earnings announcement drift and stock-level momentum. Disposition effects have also been uncovered in other settings—in the real estate market, for example, and in the exercise of executive stock options."&lt;ref name="The Journal of Finance"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barberis|first1=Nicholas|last2=Xiong|first2=Wei|title=What Drives the Disposition Effect? An Analysis of a Long-Standing Preference-Based Explanation|journal=The Journal of Finance|date=April 2009|volume=LXIV|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01448.x|url=http://faculty.som.yale.edu/nicholasbarberis/dp_final.pdf|accessdate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812092922/http://faculty.som.yale.edu/nicholasbarberis/dp_final.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barberis has noted that the disposition effect is not a rational sort of conduct because of the reality of [[stock market]] momentum, meaning “that stocks that have done well over the past six months tend to keep doing well over the next six months; and that stocks that have done poorly over the past six months tend to keep doing poorly over the next six months.” This being the case, the rational act would be “to hold on to stocks that have recently risen in value; and to sell stocks that have recently fallen in value. But individual investors tend to do exactly the opposite.”&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barberis|first1=Nicholas|last2=Xiong|first2=Wei|title=What Drives the Disposition Effect?

Alexander Joshi has summed up the disposition effect as the disposition that investors have to hold on to losing positions longer than winning positions, saying that "investors hate losses and will gamble to avoid experiencing them, so they exhibit risk-seeking behaviour by holding losers. Conversely investors will want to lock in gains, so they exhibit risk-averse behaviour by selling winners.”&lt;ref name="The Marshall Society"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joshi|first1=Alexander|title=Behavioural Finance – The disposition effect|url=http://marshallsociety.com/ideas/behavioural-finance-the-disposition-effect/|website=The Marshall Society|publisher=The Marshall Society|accessdate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113150143/http://marshallsociety.com/ideas/behavioural-finance-the-disposition-effect/|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacey and Zielonka showed that the greater the level of stock prices volatility, the more prone the investor was to sell a loser, contrary to the disposition effect. This result explains the panic selling of stocks during a market collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dacey|first1=Raymond|last2=Zielonka|first2=Piotr|title=High volatility eliminates the disposition effect in a market crisis|journal=Decyzje|date=2013|doi=10.7206/DEC.1733-0092.9|url=https://journal.kozminski.edu.pl/index.php/decyzje/article/view/DEC.1733-0092.9/33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shefrin and Statman study==

The effect was identified and named by Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman in 1985. In their study, Shefrin and Statman noted that "people dislike incurring losses much more than they enjoy making gains, and people are willing to gamble in the domain of losses." Consequently, "investors will hold onto stocks that have lost value...and will be eager to sell stocks that have risen in value." The researchers coined the term "disposition effect" to describe this tendency of holding on to losing stocks too long and to sell off well-performing stocks too readily. Shefrin colloquially described this as a "predisposition toward get-evenitis." John R. Nofsinger has called this sort of investment behavior as a product of the desire to avoid regret and seek pride.&lt;ref name="Behavioural Finance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disposition Effect|url=http://disposition-effect.behaviouralfinance.net/|website=Behavioural Finance|accessdate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030730/http://disposition-effect.behaviouralfinance.net/|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prospect theory==
Researchers have traced the cause of the disposition effect to so-called "prospect theory", which was first identified and named by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Kahneman and Tversky stated that, "losses have more emotional impact than an equivalent amount of gains," and that people consequently base their decisions not on perceived losses but on perceived gains. What this means is that, if presented with two equal choices, one described in terms of possible gains and the other described in terms of possible losses, they would opt for the former choice, even though both would yield the same economic end result. For example, even though the net result of receiving $50 would be the same as the net result of gaining $100 and then losing $50, people would tend to take a more favorable view of the former than of the latter scenario.

In Kahneman and Tversky's study, participants were presented with two situations. In the first, they had $1,000 and had to select one of two choices. Under Choice A, they would have a 50% chance of gaining $1,000, and a 50% chance of gaining $0; under Choice B, they would have a 100% chance of gaining $500. In the second situation, they had $2,000 and had to select either Choice A (a 50% chance of losing $1,000, and 50% of losing $0) or Choice B (a 100% chance of losing $500). An overwhelming majority of participants chose “B” in the first scenario and "A" in the second. This suggested that "people are willing to settle for a reasonable level of gains (even if they have a reasonable chance of earning more), but are willing to engage in risk-seeking behaviors where they can limit their losses. In other words, losses are weighted more heavily than an equivalent amount of gains.” This phenomenon is called the “asymmetric value function," which means, in short, that "a loss creates a greater feeling of pain compared to the joy created by an equivalent gain."&lt;ref name="The Journal of Finance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

The prospect theory can explain such phenomena as people who prefer not to deposit their money in a bank, even though they would earn [[interest]], or people who choose not to work overtime because they would have to pay higher [[taxes]]. It also plainly underlies the disposition effect. In both situations presented to participants in Kahneman and Tversky's study, the participants sought, in risk-averse fashion, to cash in on guaranteed gains. This behavior plainly explains why investors act too soon to realize stockmarket gains.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phung|first1=Albert|title=Behavioral Finance: Key Concepts – Prospect Theory|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/behavioral_finance/behavioral11.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131505041800/http://www.investopedia.com/university/behavioral_finance/behavioral11.asp|archivedate=29 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Choices, Values, and Frames"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Choices, Values, and Frames|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521627498|page=372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5GsREMbUmAC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;q=%22Disposition%20effect%22%20Kahneman%20and%20Tversky|accessdate=12 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129061211/https://books.google.com/books?id=P5GsREMbUmAC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;q=%22Disposition%20effect%22%20Kahneman%20and%20Tversky|archivedate=29 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoiding the disposition effect==
The disposition effect can be minimized by means of a mental approach called "hedonic framing". For example, individuals can try to force themselves to think of a single large gain as a number of smaller gains, to think of a number of smaller losses as a single large loss, to think of the combination of a major gain and a minor loss as a net minor gain, and, in the case of a combined major loss and minor gain, to think of the two separately.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"/&gt;

A dry drunk can be described as a person who refrains from alcohol or drugs, but still has all the unresolved emotional and psychological issues which might have fueled the addiction to begin with. These unresolved issues continue to have a hold on their psyche and hence, they act like "dry drunks."&lt;ref name="Bennett2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/heartache-hope/201105/is-there-dry-drunk-in-your-life|title=Is there a "Dry Drunk" in your life?|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27 |first=Carole |last=Bennett |date=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, [[Alcohol dependence|alcohol dependancy]] is a substantial factor in the lives of the alcoholics and accepting sobriety comes with its own challenges and understanding of their personality. Despite leaving alcohol and de-addicting themselves, most of their personalities are an embodiment of their drunkard selves.&lt;ref name="Bennett2011" /&gt; 

The dry drunk is portrayed with feelings of profound depression and frustration and with the indecisive feeling of wanting a drink that they have given up. Several alcoholics drink for about 10-20 years before maintaining sobriety and get used to their personality and character traits that are embodied by their drunkard selves. During this phase of dry drunk, the addicts face restlessness, frustration, anger, impatience and craving. The symptoms of dry drunkenness are irregular and become less intense as the period of sobriety increases. Most of the symptoms of dry drunkenness can be noticed in the initial phase of sobriety.

'''Ethnic penalty''' in [[sociology]] is defined as the economic and non-economic disadvantages that [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] experience in the [[Labour economics|labour market]] compared to other ethnic groups. As an area of study among [[behavioral economics|behavioral economists]], psychologists, and sociologists, it ranges beyond discrimination to take non-cognitive factors into consideration for explaining unwarranted differences between individuals of similar abilities but differing ethnicities.

==Overview==
The concept of the ethnic penalty was first discussed by Oxford sociologist Anthony Heath and refined with greater specificity by another Oxford sociologist, Reza Hasmath and, recently, by another sociologist, Elyakim Kislev. Heath originally looked at the ethnic penalty by making comparisons between two groups in Britain, [[White British|whites]] and [[Black British|blacks]], noting that unemployment of black African men was twice as high as unemployment of white men.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A.F. and J. Ridge (1983) “Social Mobility of Ethnic Minorities”, ''Journal of Biosocial Science'', Supplement No. 8: 169-184.&lt;/ref&gt; Using 2001 UK census data, Johnston et al. suggests that all ethno-religious groups in the UK experienced ethnic penalties in the labour market, with the exception of White British ethno-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R. et al. (2010) "Ethno-Religious Categories and Measuring Occupational Attainment in Relation to Education in England and Wales: A Multilevel Analysis’, Environment and Planning A 42(3): 578-591.&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael and Woods additionally show that "the penalties paid vary considerably between the minority groups" studied, in the case of black, Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi workers in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="carmichael &amp; woods, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/026921700101498#.VGjCRvmsWSo | title=Ethnic Penalties in Unemployment and Occupational Attainment: Evidence for Britain |author1=Carmichael, F.  |author2=Woods, R. | journal=International Review of Applied Economics | year=2000 | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=71–98 | doi=10.1080/026921700101498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson, Purdam, Tajar, et al. also found that this differs between UK-born members of an ethnic minority and those of the same ethnicity born abroad – UK-born males are more likely to be unemployed than males from overseas, while UK-born women "tend to do better in the labour market than their overseas-born counterparts".&lt;ref&gt;Simpson et al. (2006) "Ethnic Minority Populations and the Labour Market: An Analysis of the 1991 and 2001 Census", Department for Work and Pensions.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, Simpson et al. confirmed that this disadvantage is not tied to "concentration of ethnic minorities in deprived areas"; those of an "ethnic minority were still twice as likely to be unemployed than their White counterparts... even in areas that are predominantly White". Furthermore, ethnic minorities experience economic disadvantages even in some areas where their level of educational attainments outperform or are on par with that of the majority population, as is the case in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|date=2007|title=The Paradox of Ethnic Minority Development in Beijing|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/2/|journal=Comparative Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=466|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the education levels of ethnic minorities largely match those of the Han population, yet Hans dominate the demographics of high-wage, high-education and skills-intensive employment sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|date=2007|title=The Paradox of Ethnic Minority Development in Beijing|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/2/|journal=Comparative Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=466|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research into the process of minority job acquisition and retention in China finds that "minorities perceive they are at a disadvantage in the job search process," even if Han-minority wage differentials show little evidence of disadvantages for ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|last2=Ho|first2=Benjamin|date=2015|title=Job Acquisition, Retention, and Outcomes for Ethnic Minorities in Urban China|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/9/|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|language=en|volume=56|issue=1|pages=24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has explored the possibility of a "double penalty" which considers the interaction effects of ethnicity and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherng|first=Hua-Yu Sebastian|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|last3=Ho|first3=Benjamin|date=2016|title=The Double Penalty?

Reza Hasmath concludes that exclusionary [[discrimination]] is not the only potential explanation for ethnic penalties. Conditions such an individual's social network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/lack-of-network-hurting-migrant-workers-20120603-1zq3u.html|title=Lack of network hurting migrant workers|last=May|first=Julia|date=4 June 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a firm's working culture, and a community's social trust should be strongly factored.&lt;ref&gt;Hasmath, R. (2012). ''[https://www.routledge.com/products/9781409402114 The Ethnic Penalty: Immigration, Education and the Labour Market]''. Aldershot: Ashgate. Retrieved 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Silberman and Fournier, in their investigation of ethnic penalty in France, also highlight that an employer may not necessarily wish themselves to discriminate, but that they may be pressured by "a given company’s employees or a customer wishing to have nothing to do with an individual with this or that characteristic".&lt;ref name="Revue"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-francaise-de-sociologie-2008-5-page-45.htm | title=Second Generations on the Job Market in France: A Persistent Ethnic Penalty - A Contribution to Segmented Assimilation Theory |author1=Silberman, R.  |author2=Fournier, I. | journal=Revue Française de Sociologie | year=2008 | volume=49 | issue=5 | pages=45–94 | accessdate=24 November 2014 | doi=10.3917/rfs.495.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elyakim Kislev's work divides the ethnic penalty into four components: individual characteristics, country characteristics, the social environment in host country, and the policy environment in host country. Kislev shows that the main reasons for immigrants’ disadvantage in terms of labor force participation and household income are both origin and host country characteristics, while the effects of ethnic origins, social exclusion, and policies are weaker. However, ethnic origins and social exclusion actually play a central role in determining unemployment of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kislev|first=Elyakim|date=2016-09-19|title=Deciphering the ‘Ethnic Penalty’ of Immigrants in Western Europe: A Cross-Classified Multilevel Analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308032232_Deciphering_the_%27Ethnic_Penalty%27_of_Immigrants_in_Western_Europe_A_Cross-Classified_Multilevel_Analysis|journal=Social Indicators Research|doi=10.1007/s11205-016-1451-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exemplification''', in the [[philosophy]] of language, is a mode of symbolization characterized by the relation between a sample and what it refers to.

== Description ==
Unlike [[ostension]], which is the act of showing or pointing to a sample, exemplification is possession of a property plus reference to its label (Goodman, 1976). For example, if a color sample has the property labelled 'green', then the color sample exemplifies green. At its most basic, possession of a property amounts to being correctly referred to by its label. In other words, an entity, 'x' can be said to possess a certain property if and only if: (1) there can be an abstract singular term which denotes that property, and (2) those assertions are true which predicate such an abstract term of a name or phrase denoting x. 
== A mode of reference ==

[[Reference]] is the relation between something "standing for" something else, like the relation between a word and what it denotes. Usually reference goes in one direction, from the word to what it denotes, but it may also go in both directions, from the denoted back to the word. For instance, when a patch of green paint is used as a colour sample. The sample refers to green by possessing it and thus being referred to by the word denoting it. The sample exemplifies green, it stands for it, and in this way exemplification is a mode of reference.

== Uses of exemplification ==

*Product samples exemplify certain properties they possess.
*As a part in [[ostensive definition]], i.e. definition by exemplification of what is defined. For example, an artist can define a new style by showing works that exemplify it.
*Defined exemplification is a pattern of essay development that uses specific instances (examples) to clarify a point, to add interest, or to persuade (Clouse, 2006).
*Exemplification means using examples to explain, convince, or amuse. Lending interest and information to writing, exemplification is one of the most common and effective ways to developing ideas. Examples may be developed in a sentence or more, or they may be only phrases or even single words, as in the following sentence: "Children like packaged breakfast foods, such as Wheaties, Cheerios, and Rice Krispies."

'''Gender violence''', also known as '''gender-based violence''' or '''gendered violence''', is the term used to denote harm inflicted upon individuals and groups that is connected to normative understandings of their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/755629989|title=Violence against women and girls : a compendium of monitoring and evaluation indicators|last=S.|first=Bloom, Shelah|date=2008|publisher=MEASURE Evaluation, Carolina Population Center|oclc=755629989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection can be in the form of cultural understandings of gender roles, institutional and structural forces that endorse violence based on gender and societal influences that shape violent events along gender lines.  While the term is often used synonymously with ‘violence against women’, gendered violence can and does occur for people of all genders including men, women, male and female children and gender diverse individuals.  

Activities heavily associated with violence are overwhelmingly shaped by understandings of gender and gender roles. War, for example, in contemporary understandings is divided between civilian and combatants with a general understanding that men make up the vast majority of combatants and women and young children the majority of civilians. In cases like the Srebenica massacre, in which 8,000 men and male children were killed, the basis of their murder was a gendered understanding that they had the potential of being, or becoming combatants in the Bosnian war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-03-11|title=Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes: An Encyclopedia2014 086  Edited by Alexander Mikaberidze   Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes: An Encyclopedia  Santa Barbara, CA ABC-Clio 2013 9781598849264 Contact publisher for pricing information|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/rr-11-2013-0271|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=28|issue=3|pages=18–18|doi=10.1108/rr-11-2013-0271|issn=0950-4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing gender and violence at regional levels, the experiences of people who exist in transition between spaces or who are not counted within regional data can potentially be omitted from this discussion; these include displaced persons, people seeking asylum and refugees.

== Asia ==
Violence against women is a major concern in the Asian regions, especially the prevalence of marital violence varies considerably across South Asian countries. For married women aged 15–49 years, physical or sexual violence within marriage has been experienced by 20% in the Maldives, 26% in Pakistan, 28% in Nepal, 38% in India and 53% in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jejeebhoy|first=Shireen J.|last2=Santhya|first2=K.G.|last3=Acharya|first3=Rajib|date=2014-05-19|title=Violence against women in South Asia: The need for the active engagement of the health sector|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2014.916736|journal=Global Public Health|volume=9|issue=6|pages=678–690|doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.916736|issn=1744-1692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence against women is a very serious issue that can be attributed to the death. For example, India recorded over 40.000 dowry-related deaths between 2011 and 2015. In Nepal and Bangladesh, the Asia Foundation points out that gender-based violence is the first or second cause of international homicides in these countries. One of the biggest historical violence against women is the phenomenon of comfort women. Comfort women refers to tens of thousands of young women, majority from Korea who were forced into sex slaves for Japanese military during the Asia Pacific War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/225875908|title=The comfort women : sexual violence and postcolonial memory in Korea and Japan|last=Sarah.|first=Soh, Chunghee|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226767765|oclc=225875908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korea’s comfort women represent gender violence in the context of patriarchal colonial capitalism as the phenomenon reflects Japan’s colonial economy and traditional sexual cultures of Japanese and Korean patriarchy. Therefore, they were victims of sexism, classism, racism, colonialism, militarism, and capitalist imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/225875908|title=The comfort women : sexual violence and postcolonial memory in Korea and Japan|last=Sarah.|first=Soh, Chunghee|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226767765|oclc=225875908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==
Gendered violence in the Middle East greatly targeted towards women and is justified by political and religious laws; acts of gendered violence take the form of forced early marriage, rape, and domestic violence. Gendered violence can also be found in instances where Islamic law is used to justify killing women in order to preserve male honor. In Yemen, for example, 400 women were subjected to honor killings between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadiqi|first=Fatima|date=2014-01-02|title=Gender and Violence in Islamic Societies: Patriarchy, Islamism and Politics in the Middle East and North Africa|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13552074.2014.889351|journal=Gender &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=1|pages=185–187|doi=10.1080/13552074.2014.889351|issn=1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which women are held to a code of honor include the practice of wearing scarves and refraining from using makeup, failure to do so can potentially result in physical and verbal harassment or loss of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2011-04-22|title=Gender and Violence in the Middle East|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203830727|doi=10.4324/9780203830727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars Islamic laws make it justifiable to rape, beat, and sell non-Muslim women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Ali|first=Nadje|date=2016-03|title=Sexual violence in Iraq: Challenges for transnational feminist politics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350506816633723|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=25|issue=1|pages=10–27|doi=10.1177/1350506816633723|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly patriarchal mindset that takes place in both religious and political laws makes it difficult for women to seek an alternative option. Most women in the Middle East are financially dependant on their husband and access to education or finances is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2011-04-22|title=Gender and Violence in the Middle East|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203830727|doi=10.4324/9780203830727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, women require permission from a male guardian if they wish to marry, travel, or work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yount|first=Kathryn M.|last2=Li|first2=Li|date=2010-05-27|title=Domestic Violence Against Married Women in Egypt|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-010-9793-3|journal=Sex Roles|volume=63|issue=5-6|pages=332–347|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9793-3|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are married also face the risk of domestic violence.

Socioeconomic status plays a role as poor families are highly likely to marry their daughters for the right price, specifically in Yemen, where it is more difficult to marry daughters past the age of twenty because they are seen as too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ouis|first=Pernilla|date=2009-07-01|title=Honourable Traditions?

== Oceania ==
To understand the connection between Gender and Violence in the Oceanic context it is crucial to understand the effects of colonisation on Aotearoa (New Zealand), the Pacific islands and the many nations within the Australian continent. While practices of colonisation in these regions have not been homogenous, colonisation has disrupted gender roles, relationships and modes of production, which continue to influence both contemporary gender relations and practices of violence and domination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Atkinson, Judy. "Violence in Aboriginal Australia: Colonisation and Gender." ''Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal'' 14, no. 2 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  As Atkinson discusses, in Australia ongoing colonial relationships of power continue to create and perpetuate gendered violence, particularly for Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, for Aotearoa/New Zealand the introduction of colonial patriarchy and racialised colonial power has fundamentally altered Māori frameworks and relationships to the land which have transformed both Māori ways of being and interpersonal relationships such as connections between genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cavino, Hayley Marama. "Intergenerational Sexual Violence and Wh ā nau in Aotearoa/ New Zealand - Pedagogies of Contextualisation and Transformation." ''Sexual Abuse in Australia and New Zealand'' 7, no. 1 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have these changed relationships resulted in sexual gender based violence but also a broader adoption of masculine settler norms that foster violence and gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Jane, and James Ritchie. ''Violence in New Zealand.'' Huia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these colonial legacies there is a strong focus on supporting peace and deconstructing gendered relations. For example, in the Pacific, the Women, Peace and Security agenda has a large role in preventing violence in Pacific communities as women within in this region play strong roles in advocating for peace and working to prevent violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Nicole|date=2014-04-29|title=Promoting Women, Peace and Security in the Pacific Islands: hot conflict/slow violence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10357718.2014.902032|journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs|volume=68|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1080/10357718.2014.902032|issn=1035-7718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==
Gendered violence exists in North America in forms such as stalking, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual assault.

== South America ==
A major cause of gendered violence in Central and South America comes from a high prevalence of gangs affiliation and membership. In the past, criminal gangs were viewed through a male dominant perception but new research suggests recruitment and involvement of women in gangs is rapidly increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WILDING|first=POLLY|date=2010-11|title=‘New Violence’: Silencing Women's Experiences in the Favelas of Brazil|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022216x10001343|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=42|issue=04|pages=719–747|doi=10.1017/s0022216x10001343|issn=0022-216X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be the case that women would support partners who were gang members while, but now women are being used to commit crimes that were traditionally for men because their essence of innocence deters police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coker|first=Donna|date=2016-07-09|title=Domestic Violence and Social Justice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801215625851|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1426–1437|doi=10.1177/1077801215625851|issn=1077-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite women carrying out masculine roles within gangs, they are still the primary target of violence and face constant abuse by their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WILDING|first=POLLY|date=2010-11|title=‘New Violence’: Silencing Women's Experiences in the Favelas of Brazil|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022216x10001343|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=42|issue=04|pages=719–747|doi=10.1017/s0022216x10001343|issn=0022-216X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who try to leave gangs will often be threatened by other members and will stay in affiliation because they receive very little help from authorities.

The lack of assistance by law enforcement make it possible for this violence to continue and the large scale presence of gangs further contribute to gendered violence happening against women despite the growing number of women with gang membership.

The prevalence of violence against women is very severe in Africa where around one third of African women report to have experienced domestic violence both physical and sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/domestic-violence-and-poverty-in-africa-when-the-husbands-beating-stick-is-like-butter|title=Domestic Violence and Poverty in Africa: When the Husband’s Beating Stick is Like Butter|last=Christiaensen|first=Luc|date=2016-01-18|website=AfricaCan End Poverty|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence within the family, especially experienced by women is attributed to ancient socioeconomic conditions that shape social norms about marriage patterns, living arrangements and the productive role of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|last2=Brioschi|first2=Benedetta|last3=Ferrara|first3=Eliana La|date=2016-01|title=Violence Against Women: A Cross-cultural Analysis for Africa|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w21901|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is considered a form of gender based violation that has a great influence on women and girls’ bodies. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to FGM in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East. FGM is not only a matter of discrimination against females, but it violates a person’s rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender violence does not only target women. In 33 African counties, adult same-sex acts are illegal, including 24 that criminalize lesbian acts, and many other countries have recently passed laws that restrict and punish groups that support work on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. Consequently, sexual minority people are subjected to gender violence, including being harassed, threatened and even killed in some places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keating|first=Christine (Cricket)|last2=Burack|first2=Cynthia|date=2017-09|title=11.

'''Gitte Haslebo''' (born 4 December 1943, [[Copenhagen]]) is a Danish scientist, author, and organisational psychologist who works as a consultant and offers training courses within a [[social constructionist]] framework. She is an associate with the [[Taos Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/gitte-haslebo-ms |title=Gitte Haslebo, MS |publisher=The Taos Institute |accessdate=28 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925140512/http://www.taosinstitute.net/gitte-haslebo-ms |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Haslebo was born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], in 1943, the daughter of Harald and Else Haslebo. She was raised in Vanloese and [[Skovlunde]], where her father founded his construction company, Skovlunde Byggeforretning. She attended Skovlunde Skole until she was 12 years old, when she switched to Lindevangskolen in Ballerup, [[Copenhagen]]. In 1960–61 Haslebo spent a year in the United States, graduating in 1961 from [[Homewood-Flossmoor High School]] in suburban Chicago. After her return to Denmark, she graduated from high school in 1963.

Haslebo completed a master's degree in business administration in 1968 at the [[University of Kansas]] and took a degree as a psychologist from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1970. She also has a Scandinavian process consultant degree from the European Institute for Transnational Training.

== Career ==
Haslebo started out as an [[amanuensis]] at the University of Copenhagen, where she worked from 1970–72. She then began her career as a scientist at the newly established Sydjysk Universitetscenter. She then worked at the Low Income Commission until 1983. After about a year as an official at the Danish Ministry of Environment, she was made head of education for the Danish School of Public Administration, where she was employed until 1989.

'''''Hume and the Problem of Causation''''' is a book written by [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[Alexander Rosenberg]], published in 1981 by [[Oxford University Press]]. 

Beauchamp and Rosenberg developed a single interpretation of [[David Hume]]’s view on the nature of [[Causality|causation]] that rests on all of his works, and defended it against historical and contemporary objections. They argued in particular that Hume was not a skeptic about [[inductive reasoning|induction]] but sought to undermine [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] justifications of induction advanced by [[rationalist]] philosophers.

The book is now out of print but available on line at a web site given below.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Linguistic rights''' are the [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] concerning the individual and collective [[right]] to choose the language or languages for communication in a private or public atmosphere. Other parameters for analyzing linguistic rights include the degree of territoriality, amount of positivity, orientation in terms of assimilation or maintenance, and overtness.&lt;ref&gt;Extra, G., and Yağmur, K. (2004). "Language rights perspectives".&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights include, among others, the right to one's own language in legal, administrative and judicial acts, language education, and media in a language understood and freely chosen by those concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Hornberger, N.H. (2016). Re-visiting orientations to language planning: problem, right, and resource. ''Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe, 33''(3), 30–49. Available from http://bilingualreview.utsa.edu/index.php/br/article/view/118&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights in international law are usually dealt in the broader framework of [[cultural rights|cultural]] and [[right to education|educational rights]].

Important documents for linguistic rights include the [[Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights]] (1996), the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (1992), the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) and the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] (1988), as well as [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 27&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Linguistic rights became more and more prominent throughout the course of history as language came to be increasingly seen as a part of nationhood. Although policies and legislation involving language have been in effect in early European history, these were often cases where a language was being imposed upon people while other languages or dialects were neglected. Most of the initial literature on linguistic rights came from countries where linguistic and/or national divisions grounded in linguistic diversity have resulted in linguistic rights playing a vital role in maintaining stability.&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will and Patten, Alan. (2003). "Introduction: Language Rights and Political Theory: Context, Issues and Approaches." In Will Kymlicka and Alan Patten (eds.), Language Rights and Political Theory(pp1-51): Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1900s that linguistic rights gained official status in politics and international accords.&lt;ref&gt;Bruthiaux, Paul. (2008). "Language rights in historical and contemporary perspective." Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 30(1), 73–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights were first included as an international human right in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948.

Formal treaty-based language rights are mostly concerned with [[minority rights]]. The history of such language rights can be split into five phases.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas, Phillipson, and Rannut, 1994"&gt;Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, Phillipson, Robert, and Rannut, Mart. (1994). "Linguistic human rights: overcoming linguistic discrimination." Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pre-1815. Language rights are covered in bilateral agreements, but not in international treaties, e.g. [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923).
# Final Act of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815). The conclusion to [[Napoleon I]]'s empire-building was signed by 7 European major powers. It granted the right to use Polish to Poles in Poznan alongside German for official business. Also, some national constitutions protects the language rights of national minorities, e.g. Austrian Constitutional Law of 1867 grants ethnic minorities the right to develop their nationality and language.
# Between World I and World War II. Under the aegis of the [[League of Nations]], Peace Treaties and major multilateral and international conventions carried clauses protecting minorities in Central and Eastern Europe, e.g., the right to private use of any language, and provision for instruction in primary schools through medium of own language.&lt;ref name="Caporti,1979"&gt;Caporti, Francesco. (1979). "Study of the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities." New York: United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many national constitutions followed this trend. But not all signatories provided rights to minority groups within their own borders such as United Kingdom, France, and US. Treaties also provided right of complaint to League of Nations and [[International Court of Justice]].
# 1945–1970s. International legislation for protection of human rights was undertaken within infrastructure of [[United Nations]]. Mainly for individual rights and collective rights to oppressed groups for self-determination.
# Early 1970s onwards, there was a renewed interest in [[minority rights|rights of minorities]], including language rights of minorities. e.g. UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.

==Theoretical discussion==

===Language rights + human rights = linguistic human rights (LHR)===
Some make a distinction between language rights and linguistic human rights because the former concept covers a much wider scope.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Thus, not all language rights are LHR, although all LHR are language rights. One way of distinguishing language rights from LHR is between what is necessary, and what is enrichment-oriented.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Necessary rights, as in human rights, are those needed for basic needs and for living a dignified life, e.g. language-related identity, access to mother tongue(s), right of access to an official language, no enforced language shift, access to formal primary education based on language, and the right for minority groups to perpetuate as a distinct group, with own languages. Enrichment rights are above basic needs, e.g. right to learn foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;

===Individual linguistic rights===
The most basic definition of linguistic rights is the right of individuals to use their language with other members of their linguistic group, regardless of the status of their language. They evolve from general human rights, in particular: non-discrimination, freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right of members of a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their community.&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"&gt;Varennes, Fernand de. (2007). "Language Rights as an Integral Part of Human Rights – A Legal Perspective". In Koenig, Matthias, Guchteneire, Paul F. A. (eds), ''Democracy and human rights in multicultural societies'' (pp 115–125): Ashgate Publishing Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual linguistic rights are provided for in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:
* Article 2 – all individuals are entitled to the rights declared without discrimination based on language.
* Article 10 – individuals are entitled to a fair trial, and this is generally recognized to involve the right to an interpreter if an individual does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The individual has the right to have the interpreter translate the proceedings, including court documents.
* Article 19 – individuals have the right to [[freedom of expression]], including the right to choose any language as the medium of expression.
* Article 26 – everyone has the [[right to education]], with relevance to the language of medium of instruction.
Linguistic rights can be applied to the private arena and the public domain.

====Private use of language====
Most treaties or language rights documents distinguish between the private use of a language by individuals and the use of a language by public authorities.&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"/&gt; Existing international human rights mandate that all individuals have the right to private and family life, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and/or the right of persons belonging to a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their group. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] defines privacy as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the sphere of a person's life in which he or she can freely express his or her identity, be it by entering into relationships with others or alone. The Committee is of the view that a person's surname [and name] constitutes an important component of one's identity and that the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one's privacy includes the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with the right to choose and change one's own name."&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This means that individuals have the right to have their name or surname in their own language, regardless of whether the language is official or recognised, and state or public authorities cannot interfere with this right arbitrarily or unlawfully.&lt;br&gt;

====Linguistic rights in the public domain====
The public domain, with respect to language use, can be divided into judicial proceedings and general use by public officials.&lt;br&gt;

According to Article 10 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], individuals have the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in the name of fairness of judicial proceedings, it is an established linguistic right of an individual to an interpreter when he or she does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The public authorities must either use the language which the individual understands, or hire an interpreter to translate the proceedings, including court cases.

General use by public officials can cover matters including public education, public radio and television broadcasting, the provision of services to the public, and so on. It is often accepted to be reasonable and justified for public officials to use the language of minorities, to an appropriate degree and level in their activities, when the numbers and geographic concentration of the speakers of a minority language are substantial enough. However, this is a contentious topic as the decision of substantiation is often arbitrary. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 26, does promise to protect all individuals from discrimination on the grounds of language. Following that, Article 27 declares, "[[minority group|minorities]] shall not be denied the right... to use their own language".&lt;ref name="International Covenant"&gt;Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights". March 23, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5, also does declares the rights for minorities to "use or teach their own language".&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5, (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective linguistic rights===
Collective linguistic rights are linguistic rights of a group, notably a language group or a [[state (polity)|state]]. Collective rights mean "the right of a linguistic group to ensure the survival of its language and to transmit the language to future generations".&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"&gt;Chen, Albert H. Y. "The Philosophy of Language Rights." Language Sciences, 20(1), 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Language groups are complex and more difficult to demarcate than states.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"&gt;Coulmas, Florian. (1998). "Language Rights – Interests of State, Language Groups and the Individual." Language Sciences,20(1), 63–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this difficulty is that members within language groups assign different roles to their language, and there are also difficulties in defining a language.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; Some states have legal provisions for the safeguard of collective linguistic rights because there are clear-cut situations under particular historical and social circumstances.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Collective linguistic rights apply to states because they express themselves in one or more languages.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; Generally, the language régime of states, which is communicated through allocation of statuses to languages used within its boundaries, qualifies linguistic rights claimed by groups and individuals in the name of efficient governance, in the best interest of the [[common good]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; States are held in check by international conventions and the demands of the citizens. Linguistic rights translate to laws differently from country to country, as there is no generally accepted standard legal definition.&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"&gt;Paulston, Christina Bratt. "Language Policies and Language Rights". Annual Review Anthropology, 26, 73–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territoriality vs. personality principles===
The principle of territoriality refers to linguistic rights being focused solely within a territory, whereas the principle of personality depends on the linguistic status of the person(s) involved.&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"/&gt; An example of the application of territoriality is the case of [[Switzerland]], where linguistic rights are defined within clearly divided language-based cantons. An example of the application of personality is in federal [[Canadian legislation]], which grants the right to services in French or English regardless of territory.&lt;br&gt;

===Negative vs. positive rights===
[[Negative and positive rights|Negative linguistic rights]] mean the right for the exercise of language without the interference of the [[Sovereign state|State]].&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"/&gt; Positive linguistic rights require positive action by the State involving the use of public money, such as public education in a specific language, or state-provided services in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"/&gt;

===Assimilation-oriented vs. maintenance-oriented===
Assimilation-oriented types of language rights refer to the aim of the law to assimilate all citizens within the country, and range from prohibition to toleration.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; An example of prohibition type laws is the treatment of [[Kurds]] in [[Turkey]] as well as [[Turkish language|Turks]] in [[Iran]], where they are forbidden to use the Kurdish and Turkish languages respectively. Maintenance-oriented types of language rights refer to laws aiming to enable the maintenance of all languages within a country, and range from permission to promotion. An example of laws that promote language rights is the Basque Normalization Law, where the Basque language is promoted. The neutral point between assimilation-orientation and maintenance-orientation is non-discrimination prescription, which forbids discrimination based on language.

===Overt vs. covert===
Another dimension for analyzing language rights is with degree of overtness and covertness.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Degree of overtness refers to the extent laws or covenants are explicit with respect to language rights, and covertness the reverse. For example, Indian laws are overt in promoting language rights, whereas the English Language Amendments to the US Constitution are overt prohibition. The [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] all fall under covert toleration.

===Criticisms of the framework of linguistic human rights===
Some have criticized linguistic rights proponents for taking language to be a single coherent construct, pointing out instead, the difference between language and speech communities, and putting too much concern over inter-language discrimination rather than intra-language discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. (ed.) 1999. "Language Ideological Debates". Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. 2001. "The Asmara Declaration as a sociolinguistic problem: Reflections on scholarship and linguistic rights". Journal of Sociolinguistics 5(1): 131–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. 2001. "Review of T. Skutnabb-Kangas' Linguistic genocide in education – or worldwide diversity and human rights?" Applied Linguistics 22(4): 539–541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, M. 1998. "Contemporary transformation of local linguistic communities". Annual Review of Anthropology 27: 401–426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wee, L. (2005). "Intra-Language Discrimination and Linguistic Human Rights: The Case of Singlish". Applied Linguistics 26(1): 48–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Other issues pointed out are the assumptions that the collective aims of linguistic minority groups are uniform, and that the concept of collective rights is not without its problems.&lt;ref&gt;May, S. (2001). "Language and Minority Rights: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Politics of Language". London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There is also the protest against the framework of Linguistic Human Rights singling out minority languages for special treatment, causing limited resources to be distributed unfairly. This has led to a call for deeper ethnographic and historiographic study into the relationship between speakers' attitudes, speakers' meaning, language, power, and speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, C. (2001). "African mother-tongue programmes and the politics of language: Linguistic citizenship versus linguistic human rights". Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 22(4): 339–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, C. (2002). "Framing Bourdieu socio-culturally: Alternative forms of linguistic legitimacy in postcolonial Mozambique". Multilingual 21: 247–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical application==
Linguistic rights manifest as legislation (the passing of a law), subsequently becoming a statute to be enforced.&lt;ref name="Siegel,2006"&gt;Siegel, Lawrence. (2006). "The Argument for a Constitutional Right to Communication and Language". Sign Language Studies,6(1),255–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulston,1997a"&gt;Christina Bratt Paulston. (1997). "Language Policies and Language Rights". Annual Review Anthropology,26,73–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Language legislation delimiting official usage can by grouped into official, institutionalizing, standardizing, and liberal language legislation, based on its function.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"&gt;Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove. (2000). "Linguistic Genocide in Education – or Worldwide Diversity and Human Rights?" Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Official legislation makes languages official in the domains of legislation, justice, public administration, and education, [commonly according to territoriality and personality]. Various combinations of both principles are also used.... Institutionalizing legislation covers the unofficial domains of labour, communications, culture, commerce, and business...."&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In relation to legislation, a causal effect of linguistic rights is [[language policy]]. The field of language planning falls under language policy. There are 3 types of language planning: status planning (uses of language), acquisition planning (users of language), and corpus planning (language itself).&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"/&gt;

===Language rights at international and regional levels===

====International platform====
{{See also|Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}
The Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights was approved on 6 June 1996 in Barcelona, Spain. It was the culmination of work by a committee of 50 experts under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. Signatories were 220 persons from over 90 states, representing NGOs and International PEN Clubs Centres. This Declaration was drawn up in response to calls for linguistic rights as a fundamental human right at the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication and the Final Declaration of the General Assembly of the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers. Linguistic rights in this Declaration stems from the language community, i.e., collective rights, and explicitly includes both regional and immigrant minority languages. &lt;br&gt;

Overall, this document is divided into sections including: Concepts, General Principles, Overall linguistic regime (which covers Public administration and official bodies, Education, Proper names, Communications media and new technologies, Culture, and The socioeconomic sphere), Additional Dispositions, and Final Dispositions. So for instance, linguistic rights are granted equally to all language communities under Article 10, and to everyone, the right to use any language of choice in the private and family sphere under Article 12. Other Articles details the right to use or choice of languages in education, public, and legal arenas.&lt;br&gt;

There are a number of other documents on the international level granting linguistic rights. The UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966 makes international law provision for protection of minorities. Article 27 states that individuals of linguistic minorities cannot be denied the right to use their own language. &lt;br&gt;

The UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]] was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1992. Article 4 makes "certain modest obligations on states".&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"&gt;Extra, G., and Yağmur, K. (2004). "Language rights perspectives". In Extra, G. and Yağmur, K. (Eds.), Urban Multilingualism in Europe: Immigrant Minority Languages at Home and School (pp. 73–92): Multilingual Matters Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that states should provide individuals belonging to minority groups with sufficient opportunities for education in their mother tongue, or instruction with their mother tongue as the medium of instruction. However, this Declaration is non-binding.&lt;br&gt;

A third document adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989, which makes provisions for linguistic rights is the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this convention, Articles 29 and 30 declare respect for the child's own cultural identity, language and values, even when those are different from the country of residence, and the right for the child to use his or her own language, in spite of the child's minority or immigrant status.&lt;br&gt;

====Regional platform====

=====Africa=====
{{See also|List of Linguistic Rights in Constitutions (Africa)}}
Linguistic rights in Africa have only come into focus in recent years. In 1963, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) was formed to help defend the fundamental human rights of all Africans. It adopted in 1981 the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], which aims to promote and protect fundamental human rights, including language rights, in Africa. In 2004, fifteen member states ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights Establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Court is a regional, legal platform that monitors and promotes the AU states' compliance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. It is currently pending a merger with the [[African Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the African Union]].

In 2001 the President of the Republic of Mali, in conjunction with the OAU, set up the foundation for the [[African Academy of Languages]] (ACALAN) to "work for the promotion and harmonisation of languages in Africa". Along with the inauguration of the Interim Governing Board of the ACALAN, the [[African Union]] declared 2006 as the [[Year of African Languages]] (YOAL).&lt;ref&gt;African Academy of Languages. (2010). Historical Survey of ACALAN. Retrieved November 9, 2010, from http://www.acalan.org/eng/aboutacalan/historique.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the OAU was disbanded and replaced by the African Union (AU). The AU adopted the Constitutive Act previously drawn up by the OAU in 2000. In Article 25, it is stated that the working languages of the Union and its institutions are Arabic, English, French and Portuguese, and if possible, all African languages. The AU also recognizes the national languages of each of its member institutions as stated in their national constitutions. In 2003, the AU adopted a protocol amending the Act such that working languages shall be renamed as official languages, and would encompass Spanish, Kiswahili and "any other African language" in addition to the four aforementioned languages . However, this Amendment has yet to be put into force, and the AU continues to use only the four working languages for its publications.

=====Europe=====
{{See also|European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|List of Linguistic Rights in Constitutions (Europe)}}
The [[Council of Europe]] adopted the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950, which makes some reference to linguistic rights. In Article 5.2, reasons for arrest and charges have to be communicated in a language understood by the person. Secondly, Article 6.3 grants an interpreter for free in a court, if the language used cannot be spoken or understood.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Convention,1950"&gt;Council of Europe. (1950). Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. from http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Council for Local and Regional Authorities, part of the Council of Europe, formulated the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1992.&lt;ref name="Charter,1992"&gt;Council of Europe. (1992). European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. from http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This Charter grants recognition, protection, and promotion to regional and/or minority languages in European states, though explicitly not immigrant languages, in domains of "education, judicial authorities, administrative and public services, media, cultural activities, and socio-economic life"&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"/&gt; in Articles 8 to 13. Provisions under this Charter are enforced every three years by a committee. States choose which regional and/or minority languages to include.&lt;br&gt;

The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities was implemented by the Council of Europe in 1995 as a "parallel activity"&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"/&gt; to the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. This Framework makes provisions for the right of national minorities to preserve their language in Article 5, for the encouragement of "mutual respect and understanding and co-operation among all persons living on their territory",&lt;ref name="Framework,1995"&gt;Council of Europe. (1995). Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. from http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/157.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of language, especially in "fields of education, culture and the media"&lt;ref name="Framework,1995"/&gt; in Article 6. Article 6 also aims to protect persons from discrimination based on language. &lt;br&gt;

Another document adopted by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in 1998 is the Recommendation 1383 on Linguistic Diversification.&lt;ref name="Recommendation 1383,1998"&gt;Parliamentary Assembly – Council of Europe. (1998). Recommendation 1383 (1998) – Linguistic diversification. from http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta98/EREC1383.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages a wider variety of languages taught in Council of Europe member states in Article 5. It also recommends language education to include languages of non-native groups in Article 8.

===Language rights in different countries===

====Australia====
{{See also|Australian Aboriginal languages}}
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] et al. (2014) proposed the enactment of "Native Tongue Title", an ex gratia compensation scheme for the loss of indigenous languages in Australia: "Although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia compensation schemes for the victims of the [[Stolen Generations]] policies, the victims of [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing) are largely overlooked ... Existing grant schemes to support Aboriginal languages ... should be complemented with compensation schemes, which are based on a claim of '''right'''. The proposed compensation scheme for the loss of Aboriginal languages should support the effort to reclaim and revive the lost languages.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 55 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) parliament passed a legislation that recognises and revives indigenous languages for the first time in Australia's history. "The NSW Government will appoint independent panel of Aboriginal language experts" and "establish languages centres".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-11/nsw-passes-unprecedented-laws-to-revive-indigenous-languages/9039746 NSW introduces nation's first laws to recognise and revive Indigenous languages], Bridget Brennan, ABC, October 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
{{See also|Constitution of Austria}}
Under the Austrian Constitutional Law (1867), Article 8(2) grants the right to maintenance and development of nationality and language to all ethnic minorities, equal rights to all languages used within the regions in domains of education, administration and public life, as well as the right to education in their own language for ethnic communities, without the necessity of acquiring a second language used in the province.&lt;ref name="OBVG,2000"&gt;Federal Assembly. (2000). Austrian Federal Constitutional Laws (selection).Herausgegeben vom Bundespressedienst.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{See also|Constitution of Canada}}
The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) grants positive linguistic rights, by guaranteeing state responsibility to the French and English language communities. Section 23 declares three types of rights for Canadian citizens speaking French or English as their mother tongue and are minorities in a region.&lt;ref name="Constitution,1982"&gt;The Constitution Act. (1982). Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Retrieved Nov 5, 2010, from http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The first accords right of access to instruction in the medium of the mother tongue. The second assures educational facilities for minority languages. The third endows French and English language minorities the right to maintain and develop their own educational facilities. This control can take the form of "exclusive decision-making authority over the expenditure of funds, the appointment and direction of the administration, instructional programs, the recruitment of teachers and personnel, and the making of agreements for education and services".&lt;ref name="Martel,1999"&gt;Martel, Angéline.

Hungary: Central European University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these rights apply to primary and secondary education, sustained on public funds, and depend on the numbers and circumstances.

====Croatia====
{{Main article|Minority languages of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatia minority languages 2011.jpg|thumb|Minority languages in Croatia (official use at local level)]]
[[Croatian language]] is the stated to be the official language of Croatia in Article 3 of the Croatian constitution. The same Article of Constitution stipulates that in some of local units, with the Croatian language and [[Latin script]], in official use may be introduce another language and [[Cyrillic]] or some other script under the conditions prescribed by law. The only example of the use of minority language at the regional level currently is [[Istria County]] where official languages are Croatian and [[Italian language|Italian]]. In eastern Croatia, in [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], at local (municipal) level is introduced [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as co official language. Each municipality, where a certain minority has more than one third of the population, can if it wants to introduce a minority language in official use.

====Finland====
{{See also|Constitution of Finland}}
Finland has one of the most overt linguistic rights frameworks.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Discrimination based on language is forbidden under the basic rights for all citizens in [[Finland]]. Section 17 of the Constitution of Finland explicitly details the right to one's language and culture, although these languages are stated as either Finnish or Swedish. This right applies to in courts of law and other authorities, as well as translated official documents. There is also overt obligation of the state to provide for the "cultural and societal needs of the Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking populations of the country on an equal basis".&lt;ref name="Finland Constitution"&gt;Parliament of Finland. (1999). The Constitution of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt; Other language communities, the ones specifically mentioned are indigenous groups, are granted the right to maintenance and development of their own language. There is an additional right for the specific group, the Sami, that they may use the Sami language when communicating with authorities. The deaf community is also granted the right to sign language and interpretation or translation. &lt;br&gt;

Regulations regarding the rights of linguistic minorities in Finland, insist on the forming of a district for the first 9 years of comprehensive school education in each language, in municipalities with both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking children, as long as there is a minimum of 13 students from the language community of that mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Svenska"&gt;Svenska Finlands Folkting.

====India====
{{See also|Constitution of India}}
The constitution of India was first drafted on January 26, 1950. It is estimated that there are about 1500 languages in India. Article 343–345 declared that the official languages of India for communication with centre will be Hindi and English. There are 22 official languages identified by constitution.  Article 345 states that "the Legislature of a state may by law adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State or Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the official purposes of that State: Provided that, until the Legislature of the State otherwise provides by law, the English language shall continue to be used for those official purposes within the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of this Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Groff, C. (2003). Status and acquisition planning and linguistic minorities in India. Online&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
{{See also|Languages of Ireland}}

Language rights in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are recognised in the [[Constitution of Ireland]] and in the Official Languages Act.

[[Irish language|Irish]] is the national and first official language according to the Constitution (with English being a second official language). The Constitution permits the public to conduct its business – and every part of its business – with the state solely through Irish.

On 14 July 2003, the [[President of Ireland]] signed the [[Official Languages Act 2003]] into law and the provisions of the Act were gradually brought into force over a three-year period. The Act sets out the duties of public bodies regarding the provision of services in Irish and the rights of the public to avail of those services.

The use of Irish on the country's traffic signs is the most visible illustration of the state's policy regarding the official languages. It is a statutory requirement that placenames on signs be in both Irish and English except in the [[Gaeltacht]], where signs are in Irish only.

====Mexico====
{{See also|Languages of Mexico}}

Language rights were recognized in Mexico in 2003 with the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights for the Indigenous Peoples]] which established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages. It recognizes the countries Many indigenous languages as coofficial National languages, and obligates government to offer all public services in indigenous languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pellicer, Dora   |author2=Bábara Cifuentes |author3=Carmen Herrera  |year=2006 |chapter=Legislating diversity in twenty-first century Mexico |title=Mexican Indigenous Languages at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century |editor=Margarita G.

====Pakistan====
{{see also|Languages of Pakistan}}
Pakistan uses English ([[Pakistani English]]) and [[Urdu]] as official languages. Although Urdu serves as the national language and lingua franca and is understood by most of the population, it is natively spoken by only 8% of the population. English is not natively used as a first language, but, for official purposes, about 49% of the population is able to communicate in some form of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/Euromonitor%20Report%20A4.pdf|title=The Benefits of the English Language for Individuals and Societies: Quantitative Indicators from Cameroon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Bangladesh and Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, major regional languages like [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (spoken by the majority of the population), [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]], [[Hindko]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Brahui language|Brahui]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] have no official status at the federal level.

====Philippines====
{{see also|Languages of the Philippines}}
Article XIV, Sections 6–9 of the 1987 Philippine constitution mandate the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/|title=The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|date=February 2, 1987|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*SECTION 6. The national language of the Philippines is Filipino. As it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.

:*SECTION 7. For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English.

::The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein.

::Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.

:*SECTION 8. This Constitution shall be promulgated in Filipino and English and shall be translated into major regional languages, Arabic, and Spanish.

:*SECTION 9. The Congress shall establish a national language commission composed of representatives of various regions and disciplines which shall undertake, coordinate, and promote researches for the development, propagation, and preservation of Filipino and other languages.

====Poland====

The Republic of Poland declares that it shall apply the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in accordance with the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language, dated 6 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=23/01/05&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1|title=Search on Treaties|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====

{{See also|Constitution of Spain}}
Spanish language is the stated to be the official language of Spain in Article 3 of the Spanish constitution, being the learning of this language compulsory by this same article. However, the constitution makes provisions for other languages of Spain to be official in their respective communities. An example would be the use of the Basque language in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community (BAC)]].&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"/&gt; Apart from Spanish, the other co-official languages are Basque, Catalan and Galician.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook.

====Sweden====

In ratifying the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], Sweden declared five national minority languages: [[Sami languages|Saami]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Meänkieli]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;SFS 1999:1175.

====United States====

{{See also|Constitution of the United States}}
Language rights in the [[United States]] are usually derived from the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], with its Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, because they forbid racial and ethnic discrimination, allowing language minorities to use this Amendment to claim their language rights.&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"&gt;Del Valle, Sandra. (2003). "Language Rights and the Law in the United States: Finding our Voices." Multilingual Matters Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of use of the Due Process Clauses is the ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' case which held that a 1919 Nebraska law restricting foreign-language education violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Two other cases of major importance to linguistic rights were the ''[[Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad]]'' case, which overturned a language-restrictive legislation in the [[Philippines]], declaring that piece of legislation to be "violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress",&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"/&gt; as well as the ''[[Farrington v. Tokushige]]'' case, which ruled that the governmental regulation of private schools, particularly to restrict the teaching of languages other than English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], as damaging to the migrant population of [[Hawaii]]. Both of these cases were influenced by the Meyer case, which was a precedent.&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"/&gt;

===Disputes over linguistic rights===

====Basque, Spain====
{{See also|Basque language}}
The linguistic situation for Basque is a precarious one. The Basque language is considered to be a low language in [[Spain]], where, until about 1982, the Basque language was not used in administration.&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"&gt;Urla, J. (1988). Ethnic Protest and Social Planning: A Look at Basque Language Revival. Cultural Anthropology , 379–394.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, a law was passed allowing for Basque to be used in administration side by side with Spanish in the Basque autonomous communities.&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"/&gt;

Between 1935 and 1975, the period of Franco's régime, the use of Basque was strictly prohibited, and thus language decline begun to occur as well.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"&gt;Gardner, N. (2002). BASQUE IN EDUCATION: IN THE BASQUE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY. Department of Culture Basque Government. Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoko Administrazioa Hezkuntza, Unibertsitate eta Ikerketa Saila.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the death of Franco, many Basque nationalists demanded that the Basque language be recognized.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; One of these groups was Euskadi Ta Askatasun ([[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]). ETA had initially begun as a nonviolent group to promote Basque language and culture.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; However, when its demands were not met, it turned violent and evolved into violent separatist groups. Today, ETA's demands for a separate state stem partially from the problem of perceived linguistic discrimination.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; However, ETA called a permanent cease-fire in October 2011.

====Faroe Islands====
{{See also|Faroese language conflict}}
The [[Faroese language]] conflict, which occurred roughly between 1908 and 1938, has been described as political and cultural in nature. The two languages competing to become the official language of the Faroe Islands were Faroese and Danish. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the language of the government, education and Church was Danish, whereas Faroese was the language of the people. The movement towards Faroese language rights and preservation was begun in the 1880s by a group of students. This spread from 1920 onwards to a movement towards using Faroese in the religious and government sector. Faroese and Danish are now both official languages in the Faroe Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, J. H. (1999). On Faroese Language Planning. In G. Spiess, Modernisierung des Wortschatzes europäischer Regional- und Minderheitensprachen (pp. 147–151). Gunter Narr Verlag Tubingen.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nepal====

The [[Newar]]s of [[Nepal]] have been struggling to save their [[Nepal Bhasa]] language, culture and identity since the 1920s. Nepal Bhasa was suppressed during the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] (1846–1951) and [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] (1960–1990) regimes leading to language decline. The Ranas forbade writing in [[Nepal Bhasa]] and authors were jailed or exiled. Beginning in 1965, the Panchayat system eased out regional languages from the radio and educational institutions, and protestors were put in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reinstatement of democracy in 1990, restrictions on publishing were relaxed; but attempts to gain usage in local state entities side by side with [[Nepali language|Nepali]] failed. On 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court forbade [[Kathmandu]] Metropolitan City from giving official recognition to Nepal Bhasa, and [[Rajbiraj]] Municipality and [[Dhanusa District|Dhanusa]] District Development Committee from recognizing [[Maithili language|Maithili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | pages =18–19 | date= September 2009| accessdate = 20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 recognizes all the languages spoken as mother tongues in Nepal as the national languages of Nepal. It says that Nepali in [[Devanagari]] script shall be the language of official business, however, the use of mother tongues in local bodies or offices shall not be considered a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sambidhan.org/Constitution%202063%20English-07/Part%201.pdf |title=The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007|publisher=Constitution Forum |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of national languages in local government bodies has not happened in practice, and discouragement in their use and discrimination in allocation of resources persist. Some analysts have stated that one of the chief causes of the Maoist insurgency, or the [[Nepalese Civil War]] (1996–2006), was the denial of language rights and marginalization of ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/projectteam/turin/downloads/MRD.pdf |title= Mountain Research and Development |publisher= United Nations University and International Mountain Society |page=7 |accessdate=20 September 2013|date= February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
{{See also|Sinhala Only Act}}

The start of the conflict regarding languages in [[Sri Lanka]] goes as far back as the rule of the British. During the colonial period, English had a special and powerful position in Sri Lanka. The British ruled in Sri Lanka from the late eighteenth century to 1948.  English was the official language of administration then. Just before the departure of the British, a "swabhasha" (your own language) movement was launched in a bid to phase out English slowly, replacing it with [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. However, shortly after the departure of the British the campaign, for various political reasons, evolved from advocating Sinhala and Tamil replacing English to just Sinhala replacing English.

In 1956, the first election after independence, the opposition won and the official language was declared to be Sinhala. The Tamil people were unhappy, feeling that they were greatly disadvantaged. Because Sinhala was now the official language, it made it easier for the people whose mother tongue was Sinhala to enter into government sector and also provided them with an unfair advantage in the education system. Tamils who also did not understand Sinhala felt greatly inconvenienced as they had to depend on others to translate official documents for them.

Both the Tamil and Sinhala-speaking people felt that language was crucial to their identity. The Sinhala people associated the language with their rich heritage. They were also afraid that, given that there were only 9 million speakers of the language at that time, if Sinhala was not the only official language it would eventually be slowly lost.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; The Tamil people felt that the Sinhala-only policy would assert the dominance of the Sinhalese people and as such they might lose their language, culture and identity.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt;

Despite the unhappiness of the Tamil people, no big political movement was undertaken till the early 1970s. Eventually in May 1976, there was a public demand for a Tamil state. During the 1956 election the Federal party had replaced the Tamil congress. The party was bent on "the attainment of freedom for the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon by the establishment of an autonomous Tamil state on the linguistic basis within the framework of a Federal Union of Ceylon".&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; However it did not have much success. Thus in 1972, the Federal Party, Tamil Congress and other organizations banded together into a new party called the "Tamil United Front".

One of the catalysts for Tamil separation arose in 1972 when the Sinhala government made amendments to the constitution. The Sinhala government decided to promote Buddhism as the official religion, claiming that "it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster Buddhism".&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; Given that the majority of the Tamils were Hindus, this created unease. There was then a fear among the Tamils that people belonging to the "untouchable castes" would be encouraged to convert to Buddhism and then "brainwashed" to learn Sinhala as well.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt;

Another spur was also the impatience of Tamil youth in Sri Lanka. Veteran politicians noted that current youths were more ready to engage in violence, and some of them even had ties to certain rebel groups in South India. Also in 1974, there was conference of Tamil studies organized in [[Jaffna]]. The conference turned violent. This resulted in the deaths of seven people. Consequently, about 40 – 50 Tamil youths in between the years of 1972 and 1975 were detained without being properly charged, further increasing tension.

A third stimulus was the changes in the criteria for University examinations in the early 1970s. The government decided that they wanted to standardize the university admission criteria, based on the language the entrance exams were taken in. It was noted that students who took the exams in Tamil scored better than the students who took it in Sinhala. Thus the government decided that Tamil students had to achieve a higher score than the students who took the exam in Sinhala to enter the universities. As a result, the number of Tamil students entering universities fell.

After the July 1977 election, relations between the Sinhalese and the Ceylon Tamil people became worse. There was flash violence in parts of the country. It is estimated about 100 people were killed and thousands of people fled from their homes. Among all these tensions, the call for a separate state among Tamil people grew louder.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"&gt;Kearney, R. (1978). Language and the Rise of Tamil Separatism in Sri Lanka. Asian Survey, 18(5), 521–534.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''magma''' (or '''groupoid'''; not to be confused with [[groupoid]]s in [[category theory]]) is a basic kind of [[algebraic structure]]. Specifically, a magma consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] equipped with a single [[binary operation]]. The binary operation must be [[closure (binary operation)|closed]] by definition but no other properties are imposed.

{{Algebraic structures |Group}}

== History and terminology ==
The term ''groupoid'' was introduced in 1927 by [[Heinrich Brandt]] describing his [[Brandt groupoid]] (translated from the German ''Gruppoid''). The term was then appropriated by B. A. Hausmann and [[Øystein Ore]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=B. A. |last=Hausmann |first2=Øystein |last2=Ore |title=Theory of quasi-groups |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=983–1004 |year=October 1937 |jstor=2371362 |doi=10.2307/2371362}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense (of a set with a binary operation) used in this article. In a couple of reviews of subsequent papers in [[Zentralblatt]], Brandt strongly disagreed with this overloading of terminology. The Brandt groupoid is a [[groupoid]] in the sense used in category theory, but not in the sense used by Hausmann and Ore. Nevertheless, influential books in semigroup theory, including [[Alfred Hoblitzelle Clifford|Clifford]] and [[G. B. Preston|Preston]] (1961) and [[John Mackintosh Howie|Howie]] (1995) use groupoid in the sense of Hausmann and Ore. Hollings (2014) writes that the term ''groupoid'' is "perhaps most often used in modern mathematics" in the sense given to it in category theory.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{citation |first=Christopher |last=Hollings |title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142 |year=2014 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1 |pages=142–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bergman and Hausknecht (1996): "There is no generally accepted word for a set with a not necessarily associative binary operation. The word ''groupoid'' is used by many universal algebraists, but workers in category theory and related areas object strongly to this usage because they use the same word to mean 'category in which all morphisms are invertible'. The term ''magma'' was used by [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] [Lie Algebras and Lie Groups, 1965]."&lt;ref name="BergmanHausknecht1996"&gt;{{citation |first=George M. |last=Bergman |first2=Adam O. |last2=Hausknecht |title=Cogroups and Co-rings in Categories of Associative Rings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6NnkQs3JBMC&amp;pg=PA61 |year=1996 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-0-8218-0495-7 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'s ''[[Éléments de mathématique]]'', Algèbre, chapitres 1 à 3, 1970.&lt;ref name="Bourbaki1998"&gt;{{citation |first=N. |last=Bourbaki |title=Algebra I: Chapters 1–3 |chapter=Algebraic Structures: §1.1 Laws of Composition: Definition 1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=STS9aZ6F204C&amp;pg=PA1 |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64243-5 |page=1 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

A magma is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''M'' matched with an [[Binary operation|operation]], •, that sends any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''M''}} to another element, {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}}. The symbol, •, is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. To qualify as a magma, the set and operation {{nowrap|(''M'', •)}} must satisfy the following requirement (known as the ''magma or closure axiom''):

: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'', the result of the operation {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} is also in ''M''.

And in mathematical notation:
: &lt;math&gt;a,b \in M \implies a \cdot b \in M&lt;/math&gt;.

If • is instead a [[partial operation]], then {{math|''S''}} is called a '''partial magma'''&lt;ref name="Müller-HoissenPallo2012"&gt;{{citation |editor-first=Folkert |editor-last=Müller-Hoissen |editor2-first=Jean Marcel |editor2-last=Pallo |editor3-first=Jim |editor3-last=Stasheff |title=Associahedra, Tamari Lattices and Related Structures: Tamari Memorial Festschrift |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y01d6g5UemQC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-0348-0405-9 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more often a [[partial groupoid]].&lt;ref name="Müller-HoissenPallo2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silver"&gt;{{citation |editor-first=Ben |editor-last=Silver |title=Nineteen Papers on Algebraic Semigroups |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=0-8218-3115-1 |last=Evseev |first=A. E. |chapter=A survey of partial groupoids |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphism of magmas ==
A [[morphism]] of magmas is a function, {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}}, mapping magma ''M'' to magma ''N'', that preserves the binary operation:

:''f'' (''x'' •&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') •&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''y'')

where •&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; and •&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the binary operation on ''M'' and ''N'' respectively.

== Notation and combinatorics ==

The magma operation may be applied repeatedly, and in the general, non-associative case, the order matters, which is notated with parentheses. Also, the operation, •, is often omitted and notated by juxtaposition:
: {{math|1= (''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')) • ''d'' = (''a''(''bc''))''d''}}

A shorthand is often used to reduce the number of parentheses, in which the innermost operations and pairs of parentheses are omitted, being replaced just with juxtaposition, {{math|1=''xy'' • ''z'' = (''x'' • ''y'') • ''z''}}. For example, the above is abbreviated to the following expression, still containing parentheses:
:{{math|1= (''a'' • ''bc'')''d''}}.
A way to avoid completely the use of parentheses is [[prefix notation]], in which the same expression would be written {{math|1= ••''a''•''bcd''}}.  Another way, familiar to programmers, is [[postfix notation]] ([[Reverse Polish notation]]), in which the same expression would be written {{math|1= ''abc''••''d''•}}, in which the order of execution is simply left-to-right (no [[Currying]]).

The set of all possible [[string (computer science)|string]]s consisting of symbols denoting elements of the magma, and sets of balanced parentheses is called the [[Dyck language]].  The total number of different ways of writing {{math|''n''}} applications of the magma operator is given by the [[Catalan number]], {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  Thus, for example, {{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2}}, which is just the statement that {{math|(''ab'')''c''}} and {{math|''a''(''bc'')}} are the only two ways of pairing three elements of a magma with two operations. Less trivially, {{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 5}}: {{math|((''ab'')''c'')''d''}}, {{math|(''a''(''bc''))''d''}}, {{math|(''ab'')(''cd'')}}, {{math|''a''((''bc'')''d'')}}, and {{math|''a''(''b''(''cd''))}}.

There are &lt;math&gt;n^{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; magmas with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements so 1, 1, 16, 19683, 4294967296, ... {{OEIS|A002489}} magmas with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... elements. The corresponding numbers of non-isomorphic magmas are 1, 1, 10, 3330, 178981952, ... {{OEIS|A001329}} and of simultaneously non-isomorphic and non-[[antiisomorphic]] magmas are 1, 1, 7, 1734, 89521056, ... {{OEIS|A001424}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=Groupoid|title=Groupoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free magma ==

A '''free magma''', ''M&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'', on a set, ''X'', is the "most general possible" magma generated by ''X'' (i.e., there are no relations or axioms imposed on the generators; see [[free object]]). It can be described as the set of non-associative words on ''X'' with parentheses retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Graduate Algebra: Noncommutative View | page=321 | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | first=Louis Halle | last=Rowen | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-8218-8408-5 |chapter=Definition 21B.1. |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8svFC09gGeMC&amp;pg=PA321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be viewed, in terms familiar in [[computer science]], as the magma of [[binary tree]]s with leaves labelled by elements of ''X''. The operation is that of joining trees at the root. It therefore has a foundational role in [[syntax]].

A free magma has the [[universal property]] such that, if {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''N''}} is a function from ''X'' to any magma, ''N'', then there is a unique extension of ''f'' to a morphism of magmas, ''f'' ′
: ''f'' ′ : ''M&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''N''.

== Types of magma ==
[[Image:Magma to group2.svg|thumb|right|300px]]
Magmas are not often studied as such; instead there are several different kinds of magma, depending on what axioms the operation is required to satisfy. Commonly studied types of magma include:
;[[Quasigroup]]: A magma where [[division (mathematics)|division]] is always possible
;[[Loop (algebra)|Loop]]: A quasigroup with an [[identity element]]
;[[Semigroup]]: A magma where the operation is [[associative]]
;[[Semilattice]]: A semigroup where the operation is [[commutative]] and [[idempotent]]
;[[Monoid]]: A semigroup with an [[identity element]]
;[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]: A monoid with [[inverse element]]s, or equivalently, an associative loop, or a non-empty associative quasigroup
;[[Abelian group]]: A group where the operation is commutative

Note that each of divisibility and invertibility imply the [[cancellation property]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4248">The '''elastic membrane analogy''', also known as the '''soap-film analogy''', was first published by pioneering aerodynamicist [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in 1903.
&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl, L.: "Zur torsion von prismatischen stäben", Phys. Zeitschr., '''4''', pp. 758-770 (1903)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Love 1944, article 224, page 322.&lt;/ref&gt;
It describes the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] distribution on a long bar in [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]].  The cross section of the bar is constant along its length, and need not be circular. The [[differential equation]] that governs the stress distribution on the bar in torsion is of the same form as the equation governing the shape of a membrane under differential pressure.  Therefore, in order to discover the stress distribution on the bar, all one has to do is cut the shape of the cross section out of a piece of wood, cover it with a soap film, and apply a differential pressure across it.  Then the slope of the soap film at any area of the cross section is directly proportional to the stress in the bar at the same point on its cross section.

==Application to thin-walled, open cross sections==
While the membrane analogy allows the stress distribution on any cross section to be determined experimentally, it also allows the stress distribution on thin-walled, open cross sections to be determined by the same theoretical approach that describes the behavior of rectangular sections.  Using the membrane analogy, any thin-walled cross section can be "stretched out" into a rectangle without affecting the stress distribution under torsion.  The maximum shear stress, therefore, occurs at the edge of the midpoint of the stretched cross section, and is equal to &lt;math&gt;3T/bt^2&lt;/math&gt;, where T is the [[torque]] applied, b is the length of the stretched cross section, and t is the thickness of the cross section.

It can be shown that the [[differential equation]] for the [[deflection surface]] of a homogeneous membrane, subjected to uniform lateral pressure and with uniform surface tension and with the same outline as that of the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a bar under [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], has the same form as that governing the stress distribution over the cross section of a bar under [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]].

This analogy was originally proposed by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl, L.: "Zur torsion von prismatischen stäben", Phys. Z., '''4''', pp. 758-770 (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications==

Prandtl's stretched-membrane concept was used extensively in the field of electron tube ("vacuum tube") design (1930's to 1960's) to model the trajectory of electrons within a device. The model is constructed by uniformly stretching a thin rubber sheet over a frame, and deforming the sheet upwards with physical models of electrodes, impressed into the sheet from below. The entire assembly is tilted, and steel balls (as electron analogs) rolled down the assembly and the trajectories noted. The curved surface surrounding the "electrodes" represents the complex increase in field strength as the electron-analog approaches the "electrode"; the upward distortion in the sheet is a close analogy to field strength.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18792">A '''momentum exchange tether''' is a kind of [[space tether]] that could theoretically be used as a launch system, or to change spacecraft orbits.  Momentum exchange tethers create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to [[Centrifugal force|the pseudo-force known as centrifugal force]].  While the tether system rotates, the objects on either end of the tether will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the tether and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation.  The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating tether to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude.  However, using [[electrodynamic tether]] thrusting, or [[ion propulsion]] the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A non-rotating tether is a rotating tether that rotates exactly once per orbit so that it always has a vertical orientation relative to the parent body.  A spacecraft arriving at the lower end of this tether, or departing from the upper end, will take momentum from the tether, while a spacecraft departing from the lower end of the tether, or arriving at the upper end, will add momentum to the tether. 

In some cases momentum exchange systems are intended to run as balanced transportation schemes where an arriving spacecraft or payload is exchanged with one leaving with the same speed and mass, and then no net change in momentum or angular momentum occurs.

=== Tidal stabilization ===
{{Main article|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}
[[File:Skyhooks.gif|thumb|right|A rotating tether and a tidally stabilized tether in orbit]]

Gravity-gradient stabilization, also called "gravity stabilization" and "tidal stabilization", is a simple and reliable method for controlling the attitude of a satellite that requires no electronic control systems, rocket motors or propellant.

This type of [[attitude control]] tether has a small mass on one end, and a [[satellite]] on the other. [[Tidal force]]s stretch the tether between the two masses. There are two ways of explaining tidal forces. In one, the upper end mass of the system is moving faster than orbital velocity for its altitude, so [[centrifugal force]] makes it want to move further away from the planet it is orbiting. At the same time, the lower end mass of the system is moving at less than orbital speed for its altitude, so it wants to move closer to the planet.  The end result is that the tether is under constant tension and wants to hang in a vertical orientation. The other way to explain tidal force is that the top of a tall object weighs less than the bottom, so they are pulled by different amounts. The "extra" pull on the "bottom" of the object stretches it out. On [[Earth]], these are small effects, but in space, nothing opposes them.  Either way, the end result is that the tidal forces stabilize the satellite so that its long dimension points towards the planet it is orbiting. Simple satellites have often been stabilized this way; either with tethers, or with how the mass is distributed within the satellite.

As with any freely hanging object, it can be disturbed and start to swing.  Since there is no atmospheric drag in space to slow the swing, a small bottle of fluid with baffles may be mounted in the spacecraft to damp the pendulum vibrations via the viscous friction of the fluid.

==== Sky-hook ====
{{main article|Skyhook (structure)}}
A sky-hook is a theoretical class of orbiting [[tether propulsion]] intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;H. Moravec, "A non-synchronous orbital skyhook". ''Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 307–322, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Colombo, E. M. Gaposchkin, M. D. Grossi, and G. C. Weiffenbach, “The sky-hook: a shuttle-borne tool for low-orbital-altitude research,” Meccanica, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 3–20, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.M. L. Cosmo and E. C. Lorenzini, Tethers in Space Handbook, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala, USA, 3rd edition, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.L. Johnson, B. Gilchrist, R. D. Estes, and E. Lorenzini, "Overview of future NASA tether applications," ''Advances in Space Research'', vol. 24, no. 8, pp. 1055–1063, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Levin, "Dynamic Analysis of Space Tether Missions", ''American Astronautical Society'', Washington, DC, USA, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for sky-hooks include designs that employ tethers spinning at hyper-sonic speed for catching high speed payloads or high altitude aircraft and placing them in orbit.&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"/&gt;

=== Electrodynamic tethers ===
{{Main article|Electrodynamic tether}}
[[Image:USP6116544-Circuit.png|thumb|left|Electrons flow through the conductive structure of the tether to the power system interface, where it supplies power to an associated load, not shown. (Source: U.S. patent 6,116,544, "Electrodynamic Tether And Method of Use".)]]

In a strong planetary [[magnetic field]] such as around the Earth, a conducting tether can be configured as an [[electrodynamic tether]]. This can either be used as a [[dynamo]] to generate power for the satellite at the cost of slowing its orbital velocity, or it can be used to increase the orbital velocity of the satellite by putting power into the tether from the satellite's power system. Thus the tether can be used to either accelerate or to slow an [[orbit]]ing spacecraft without using any rocket propellant.&lt;ref name= "handbook"&gt;[[NASA]], [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980018321_1998056794.pdf Tethers In Space Handbook], edited by M. L. Cosmo and E. C. Lorenzini, third edition December 1997 (accessed 20 October 2010); see also version of [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/337451main_Tethers_In_Space_Handbook_Section_1_2.pdf NASA MSFC]; available on [https://www.scribd.com/doc/13841374/Tethers-in-Space-Handbook-3rd-Ed Scribd]&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this techniques with a rotating tether, the current through the tether must alternate in phase with the rotation rate of the tether in order to produce either a consistent slowing force or a consistent accelerating force.

Whether slowing or accelerating the satellite, the electrodynamic tether pushes against the planet's magnetic field, and thus the momentum gained or lost ultimately comes from the planet.

=== Bolo ===

A Bolo, or rotating tether, is a tether that rotates more than once per orbit and whose endpoints have a significant tip speed (~ 1 – 3&amp;nbsp;km/s).  The maximum speed of the endpoints is limited by the strength of the cable material and the safety factor it is designed for.

The purpose of the Bolo is to either speed up, or slow down, a spacecraft that docks with it without using any of the spacecraft's on-board propellant and to change the spacecraft's orbital flight path.  Effectively, the Bolo acts as a reusable upper stage for any spacecraft that docks with it.

The momentum imparted to the spacecraft by the Bolo is not free. In the same way that the Bolo changes the spacecraft's momentum and direction of travel, the Bolo's orbital [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum|rotational momentum]] is also changed, and this costs [[energy]] that must be replaced. The idea is that the replacement energy would come from a more efficient and lower cost source than a chemical rocket motor.  Two possible lower cost sources for this replacement energy are an ion propulsion system, or an electrodynamic tether propulsion system that would be part of the Bolo. An essentially free source of replacement energy is momentum gathered from payloads to be accelerated in the other direction, suggesting that the need for adding energy from propulsion systems will be quite minimal with balanced, two-way, space commerce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Rotovator ===
[[File:Cycloid f.gif|right|thumb|If the orbital velocity and the tether rotation rate are synchronized, in the rotovator concept the tether tip moves in a cycloid, and at the lowest point is momentarily stationary with respect to the ground, where it can "hook" a payload and swing it into orbit.)]]

Rotovators are rotating tethers with a rotational direction such that the lower endpoint of the tether is moving slower than the orbital velocity of the tether and the upper endpoint is moving faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baenebooks.com/chapters/0671876864/0671876864_toc.htm] Indistinguishable From Magic [[Robert Forward]]- Chapter 4 Beanstalk&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a [[portmanteau]] derived from the words ''[[wikt:rotor|rotor]]'' and ''[[elevator]]''.

If the tether is long enough and the rotation rate high enough, it is possible for the lower endpoint to completely cancel the orbital speed of the tether such that the lower endpoint is stationary with respect to the planetary surface that the tether is orbiting.  As described by Moravec,&lt;ref name="nonsynch"&gt;Hans Moravec, [https://archive.li/19991012232419/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx “Orbital Bridges”] (1986) (accessed Oct. 10, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "moravec87"&gt;Hans Moravec, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx "Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials"] (Hans Moravec's thoughts on skyhooks, tethers, rotavators, etc., as of 1987) (accessed 10 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; this is "a satellite that rotates like a wheel". The tip of the tether moves in approximately a [[cycloid]], in which it is momentarily stationary with respect to the ground. In this case, a payload that is "grabbed" by a capture mechanism on the rotating tether during the moment when it is stationary would be picked up and lifted into orbit; and potentially could be released at the top of the rotation, at which point it is moving with a speed significantly greater than the escape velocity and thus could be released onto an interplanetary trajectory. (As with the bolo, discussed above, the momentum and energy given to the payload must be made up, either with a high-efficiency rocket engine, or with momentum gathered from payload moving the other direction.)

On bodies with an atmosphere, such as the Earth, the tether tip must stay above the dense atmosphere. On bodies with reasonably low orbital speed (such as the [[Moon]] and possibly [[Mars]]), a rotovator in low orbit can potentially touch the ground, thereby providing cheap surface transport as well as launching materials into [[cislunar space]]. In January 2000, [[The Boeing Company]] completed a study of tether launch systems including [[two-stage tethers]] that had been commissioned by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]].&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Thomas J. |last=Bogar |first2=Michal E. |last2=Bangham |first3=Robert L. |last3=Forward |first4=Mark J. |last4=Lewis |contribution=Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch System |title=Research Grant No. 07600-018l Phase I Final Report |publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts |date=7 January 2000 |contribution-url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/355Bogar.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth launch assist bolo===

Unfortunately an Earth-to-orbit rotovator cannot be built from currently available materials since the thickness and tether mass to handle the loads on the rotovator would be uneconomically large. A "watered down" rotovator with two-thirds the rotational speed, however, would halve the centripetal acceleration stresses.

Therefore, another trick to achieve lower stresses is that rather than picking up a cargo from the ground at zero velocity, a rotovator could pick up a moving vehicle and sling it into orbit. For example, a rotovator could pick up a [[mach number|Mach 12]] aircraft from the upper atmosphere of the Earth and move it into orbit without using rockets, and could likewise catch such a vehicle and lower it into atmospheric flight. It is easier for a rocket to achieve the lower tip speed, so "single stage to tether" has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;AIAA95-2895 "Potential launch cost savings of a tether transport facility"&lt;/ref&gt; One such is called the Hyper-sonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL).&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"/&gt; Either air breathing or rocket to tether could save a great deal of fuel per flight, and would permit for both a simpler vehicle and more cargo.

The company [[Tethers Unlimited, Inc.]] (founded by [[Robert Forward]] and [[Robert P. Hoyt]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9574513 Space Tethers: Slinging Objects in Orbit?] By Nell Boyce — United States National Public Radio — 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has called this approach "Tether Launch Assist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/LaunchAssist.html Tethers Unlimited Inc, "Tether Launch Assist"]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been referred to as a '''space bolas'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry Pratchett|author2=Ian Stewart|author3=Jack Cohen|authorlink1=Terry Pratchett|authorlink2=Ian Stewart (mathematician)|authorlink3=Jack Cohen (scientist)|title=The Science Of Discworld|date=1999|publisher=Random House|isbn=1448176670|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space elevator ===
{{Main article|Space elevator}}
[[File:Mature non-rotating Skyhook.png|thumb|right|upright|Non-rotating Sky-hook first proposed by E. Sarmont in 1990]]

A [[space elevator]] is a space tether that is attached to a planetary body. For example, on [[Earth]], a space elevator would go from the equator to well above geosynchronous orbit.

A space elevator does not need to be powered as a rotovator does, because it gets any required [[angular momentum]] from the planetary body. The disadvantage is that it is much longer, and for many planets a space elevator cannot be constructed from known materials. A space elevator on Earth would require material strengths outside current technological limits (2014).&lt;ref name="io9.why"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dvorsky |first=G. |title=Why we'll probably never build a space elevator |work=io9.com |date=13 February 2013 |url=http://io9.com/5984371/why-well-probably-never-build-a-space-elevator }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop.15185070"&gt;{{cite web |last=Feltman |first=R. |title=Why Don't We Have Space Elevators? |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=7 March 2013 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/nasa/why-dont-we-have-space-elevators-15185070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff.3353697"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jillian |last=Scharr |title=Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=29 May 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[planet Mars|Martian]] and [[lunar space elevator]]s could be built with modern-day materials however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/chapter7.html Space Elevator - Chapter 7: Destinations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025102330/http://isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/chapter7.html |date=2007-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A space elevator on Phobos has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030065879_2003074809.pdf Space Colonization Using Space-Elevators from Phobos, Leonard M. Weinstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space elevators also have larger amounts of potential energy than a rotovator, and if heavy parts (like a "dropped wrench") should fall they would reenter at a steep angle and impact the surface at near orbital speeds. On most anticipated designs, if the cable component itself fell, it would burn up before hitting the ground.

===Cislunar transportation system===
[[Image:Cislunar potential.png|thumb|right|Potential energy in the Earth–Moon system. Because the Moon has higher potential energy, tethers can work together to pick an object off the Moon (the tiny dimple on the right), and place it closer to the Earth in LEO, taking essentially no propellant and even generating energy while doing so.]]

Although it might be thought that this requires constant energy input, it can in fact be shown to be energetically favorable to lift cargo off the surface of the [[Moon]] and drop it into a lower Earth orbit, and thus it can be achieved without any significant use of propellant, since the Moon's surface is in a comparatively higher potential energy state. Also, this system could be built with a total mass of less than 28 times the mass of the payloads.&lt;ref name=lunarforward&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar%2792.pdf "Tether Transport from LEO to the Lunar Surface", R. L. Forward, AIAA paper 91-2322, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LDC00Cislunar.pdf THE CISLUNAR TETHER TRANSPORT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, Robert P. Hoyt, Tethers Unlimited, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotovators can thus be charged by [[momentum]] exchange. Momentum charging uses the rotovator to move mass from a place that is "higher" in a [[gravity field]] to a place that is "lower". The technique to do this uses the [[Oberth effect]], where releasing the payload when the tether is moving with higher linear speed, lower in a gravitational potential gives more [[specific energy]], and ultimately more speed than the energy lost picking up the payload at a higher gravitational potential, even if the rotation rate is the same. For example, it is possible to use a system of two or three rotovators to implement trade between the [[Moon]] and [[Earth]]. The rotovators are charged by lunar mass (dirt, if exports are not available) dumped on or near the Earth, and can use the momentum so gained to boost Earth goods to the Moon. The momentum and energy exchange can be balanced with equal flows in either direction, or can increase over time.

Similar systems of rotovators could theoretically open up inexpensive transportation throughout the [[solar system]].

=== Tether cable catapult system ===

A tether cable catapult system is a system where two or more long conducting tethers are held rigidly in a straight line, attached to a heavy mass. Power is applied to the tethers and is picked up by a vehicle that has linear magnet motors on it, which it uses to push itself along the length of the cable. Near the end of the cable the vehicle releases a payload and slows and stops itself and the payload carries on at very high velocity. The calculated maximum speed for this system is extremely high, more than 30 times the speed of sound in the cable; and velocities of more than 30&amp;nbsp;km/s seem to be possible.&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6290186&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative motif can be created through the use of [[imagery]], structural components, [[language]], and other narrative elements. The flute in [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' is a recurrent sound motif that conveys rural and idyllic notions. Another example from modern [[American literature]] is the green light found in the novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F.&amp;nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]].

Narratives may include multiple motifs of varying types.  In [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', he uses a variety of narrative elements to create many different motifs. [[Imagism|Imagistic]] references to blood and water are continually repeated. The phrase "fair is foul, and foul is fair" is echoed at many points in the play, a combination that mixes the concepts of [[good and evil]]. The play also features the central motif of the [[Hand washing|washing of hands]], one that combines both verbal images and the movement of the actors.

In a narrative, a motif establishes a pattern of ideas that may serve different conceptual purposes in different works.   [[Kurt Vonnegut]], for example, in his [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] narratives such as ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' and ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' makes frequent use of ''motif'' to connect different moments that might seem otherwise separated by time and space.&lt;ref&gt;"Kurt Vonnegut, Jr." ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''. Thomson Gale. 2004. HighBeam Research. 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the American [[science fiction]] [[Cult following|cult]] classic ''[[Blade Runner]]'', director [[Ridley Scott]] uses motifs to not only establish a dark and shadowy [[film noir]] atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutfilm.com/movies/b/bladerunner.htm Blade]&lt;/ref&gt; but also to weave together the thematic complexities of the plot. Throughout the film, the recurring motif of "eyes" is connected to a constantly changing flow of images, and sometimes violent manipulations, in order to call into question our ability, and the narrator's own, to accurately perceive and understand reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Saini, Tinku|year=1996|url=http://scribble.com/uwi/br/tinku/|title=Eye disbelieve|publisher=Tinku Saini, University of Washington|accessdate=2008-01-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227024439/http://scribble.com/uwi/br/tinku/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=McCoy, John|url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|title=The Eyes Tell All|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=2008-02-01|year=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916221220/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Any number of narrative elements with symbolic significance can be classified as motifs—whether they are images, spoken or written phrases, structural or stylistic devices, or other elements like sound, physical movement, or visual components in dramatic narratives. While it may appear interchangeable with the related concept ''theme'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = WordNet 3.0 | publisher = Princeton University | year = 2006 | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=theme | accessdate = 2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a general rule is that a theme is abstract and a motif is concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=H. Porter|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-88719-9|pages=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jyyt1826rhsC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=motif+theme&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cY5nT-rqJIGcgwf28ZXeAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=motif%20theme&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme is usually defined as a message, statement, or idea, while a motif is simply a detail repeated for larger symbolic meaning.  In other words, a narrative motif—a detail repeated in a pattern of meaning—can produce a theme; but it can also create other narrative aspects. Nevertheless, the distinction between the two terms remains difficult to pinpoint.  For instance, the term "[[thematic patterning]]" has been used to describe the way in which "recurrent thematic concepts" are patterned to produce meaning, such as the "moralistic motifs" found throughout the stories of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic observation, as a research tool, comes with both advantages and disadvantages that impact its application. By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation is used in many techniques, from watching an animal's eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/RMPA/naturalisticobservation.html|title=Naturalistic Observation|website=peace.saumag.edu|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''negative pregnant''' (sometimes called a '''pregnant denial''') refers to a denial which implies its affirmative opposite by seeming to deny only a qualification of the allegation and not the allegation itself.  For example, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars" might imply that the person making the statement owes some other sum of money, and was only denying that they owe that particular amount.  

A negative pregnant which appears in [[pleading]]s will often elicit a request for [[further and better particulars]], or an [[interrogatory]].  In order to avoid a negative pregnant in the above example, one might instead say, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars, or any other sum of money."

The issue can also arise in the context of [[statutory interpretation]]. For instance, Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] argues in his dissent to ''EEOC v. Aramco''&lt;ref&gt;''EEOC v. Aramco'' , 499 U.S. 244 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; that the presumption against [[extraterritoriality]] is rebutted by a negative inference from the alien-exemption provision of [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which states that Title VII "shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State." Marshall concludes that "Absent an intention that Title VII ''apply'' 'outside any State,' Congress would have had no reason to craft this extraterritorial exemption. And because only discrimination against aliens is exempted, employers remain accountable for discrimination against United States citizens abroad." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1838.ZD.html  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Co. (89-1838), at Cornell Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Netocracy''' was a term invented by the editorial board of the American technology magazine [[Wired magazine|''Wired'']] in the early 1990s. A [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Internet]]'' and ''[[aristocracy]]'', ''netocracy'' refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a [[bourgeoisie]] of a gradually diminishing importance.

The concept was later picked up and redefined by the Swedish philosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] for their book ''Netocracy — The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism'' (originally published in Swedish in 2000 as ''Nätokraterna - boken om det elektroniska klassamhället'', published in English by Reuters/Pearsall UK in 2002).

The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and Söderqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the netocracy, which they refer to as the consumtariat.

==The consumtariat==
Alexander Bard describes a new [[underclass]] called the consumtariat, a [[portmanteau]] of [[consumer]] and [[proletariat]], whose main activity is consumption, regulated from above. It is kept occupied with private problems, its desires provoked with the use of adverts and its active participation is limited to things like [[Consumer choice|product choice]], product customization, engaging with interactive products and life-style choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bard|first1=Alexander|last2=Sšderqvist|first2=Jan|title=The Netocracts: Futurica Trilogy 1|publisher=Stockholm Text|isbn=9789187173004|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=TeWCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberdeutocracy==
Similar to Netocracy, is the concept of Cyberdeutocracy. Karl W. Deutsch in his book The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, K. (1966). The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized about “information elites, controlling means of mass communication and, accordingly, power institutions, the functioning of which is based on the use of information in their activities.” Thus Deutsch introduced the concept of deutocracy, combining the words ‘ Deutsch’ and ‘ autocracy’ to get the new term
Combining terms 'deutocracy' and ‘ autocracy’ one can get a new term cyberdeutocracy. It is defined as a political regime, based on the control of the political and corporate elites of the information and communication infrastructure of the Internet space. 
Cyberdeutocracy, thus as its fundamental basis has such a resource as the global and managed virtual communication space within which the destruction of the existing, transformation, generation, and introduction in the public consciousness of alternative meanings, symbols, values, and ideas takes place, that shape perception society of political reality take place.The term was first introduced by Phillip Freiberg&lt;ref&gt; What are CyberSimulacra and Cyberdeutocracy?https://www.academia.edu/37288676/What_are_CyberSimulacra_and_Cyberdeutocracy_&lt;/ref&gt;, in his article that analyzed alleged Russian cyber involvement in 2016 U.S. elections, as well as banning people from social networks based on their political views.


==Other usages==
Netocracy can also refer to "Internet-enabled democracy" where issue-based politics will supersede party-based politics.

The word ''netocracy'' is also used as a [[portmanteau]] of ''Internet'' and ''democracy'', not of ''Internet'' and ''aristocracy'':
*"In Seattle, organized labor ran interference for the ragtag groups assembled behind it, marshaling several thousand union members who feared that free trade might send their jobs abroad. In Washington, labor focused on lobbying Congress over the China-trade issue, leaving the IMF and the World Bank to the ad hoc Netocracy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996690-4,00.html The New Radicals]; [[Time (magazine)]]; April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*"From his bungalow in Berkeley, he's spreading the word of grassroots netocracy to the Beltway. He formed an Internet political consulting firm with Jerome ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[San Francisco Chronicle]]; January 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21027">The '''New World Information and Communication Order''' ('''NWICO''' or '''NWIO'''), also known as the '''MacBride Commission''', is a term that was coined in a debate over [[mass media|media]] representations of the [[developing country|developing world]] in [[UNESCO]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term was widely used by the [[MacBride Commission]], a UNESCO panel chaired by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Sean MacBride]], which was charged with creation of a set of recommendations to make global media representation more equitable. The MacBride Commission produced a report titled [[MacBride report|"Many Voices, One World"]], which outlined the main philosophical points of the New World Information Communication Order.

==History==
The fundamental issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time. The American media scholar [[Wilbur Schramm]] noted in 1964 that the flow of news among nations is thin, that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less-developed ones, that important events are ignored and reality is distorted.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur L. Schramm, ''Mass Media and National Development: The Role of Information in the Developing Countries'', [[Stanford University Press]], 1964, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; From a more radical perspective, [[Herbert Schiller]] observed in 1969 that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about radio frequency allocations for [[satellites]] at a key meeting in Geneva in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I Schiller, ''Mass Communications and American Empire'', [[Beacon Press]], 1969, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications. [[Intelsat]] which was set up for international co-operation in satellite communication, was also dominated by the United States. In the 1970s these and other issues were taken up by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and debated within the [[United Nations]] and UNESCO.

&lt;blockquote&gt;NWICO grew out of the [[New International Economic Order]] of 1974. From 1976-1978, the New World Information and Communication Order was generally called the shorter '''New World Information Order''' or the '''New International Information Order'''.

The start of this discussion is the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) as associated with the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) starting from the early 1970s.

Mass media concerns began with the meeting of non-aligned nations in [[Algiers]], 1973; again in [[Tunis]] 1976, and later in 1976 at the [[New Delhi]] Ministerial Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]].

The 'new order' plan was textually formulated by Tunisia's Information Minister [[Mustapha Masmoudi]]. Masmoudi submitted working paper No. 31 to the MacBride Commission. These proposals of 1978 were titled the 'Mass Media Declaration.' The MacBride Commission at the time was a 16-member body created by UNESCO to study communication issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/nwico.html The Grenada Revolution Online: NWICO - New World Information and Communication Order]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among those involved in the movement were the Latin American [[Institute for the Study of Transnationals]] (ILET). One of its co-founders, [[Juan Somavia]] was a member of the MacBride Commission. Another important voice was [[Mustapha Masmoudi]], the Information Minister for [[Tunisia]]. In a Canadian radio program in 1983, Tom McPhail describes how the issues were pressed within UNESCO in the mid-1970s when the United States withheld funding to punish the organization for excluding Israel from a regional group of UNESCO. Some [[OPEC]] countries and a few socialist countries made up the amount of money and were able to get senior positions within UNESCO. NWICO issues were then advanced at an important meeting in 1976 held in [[Costa Rica]].

The only woman member of the Commission was [[Betty Zimmerman]], representing Canada because of the illness of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who died in 1980. The movement was kept alive through the 1980s by meetings of the MacBride Round Table on Communication, even though by then the leadership of UNESCO distanced itself from its ideas.

The UNESCO [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|Convention on Cultural Diversity]] of 2005 puts into effect some of the goals of NWICO, especially with regard to the unbalanced global flow of mass media. However, this convention was not supported by the United States, and it does not appear to be as robust as [[World Trade Organization]] agreements that support global trade in mass media and information.

==Issues==
A wide range of issues were raised as part of NWICO discussions. Some of these involved long-standing issues of media coverage of the developing world and unbalanced flows of media influence. But other issues involved new technologies with important military and commercial uses. The developing world was likely to be marginalized by [[satellite]] and [[computer]] technologies. The issues included:

* News reporting on the developing world that reflects the priorities of [[news agencies]] in [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]]. Reporting of natural disasters and military coups rather than the fundamental realities. At the time four major news agencies controlled over 80% of [[global news flow]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* An unbalanced flow of mass media from the developed world (especially the United States) to the underdeveloped countries. Everyone watches American movies and television shows.
* [[Advertising agencies]] in the developed world have indirect but significant effects on mass media in the developing countries. Some observers also judged the messages of these ads to be inappropriate for the Third World.
* An unfair division of the [[radio spectrum]]. A small number of developed countries controlled almost 90% of the radio spectrum. Much of this was for military use.
* There were similar concerns about the allocation of the [[geostationary orbit]] (parking spots in space) for satellites. At the time only a small number of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later. This might mean eventually getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate.
* Satellite broadcasting of television signals into [[Third World]] countries without prior permission was widely perceived as a threat to national sovereignty. The UN voted in the early 1970s against such broadcasts.
* Use of satellites to collect information on crops and natural resources in the Third World at a time when most developing countries lacked the capacity to analyze this data.
* At the time most mainframe computers were located in the United States and there were concerns about the location of databases (such as airline reservations) and the difficulty of developing countries catching up with the US lead in computers.
* The protection of journalists from violence was raised as an issue for discussion. For example, journalists were targeted by various military dictatorships in Latin America in the 1970s. As part of NWICO debates there were suggestions for study on how to protect journalists and even to discipline journalists who broke "generally recognized ethical standards". However, the MacBride Commission specifically came out against the idea of licensing journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dV-oviiw7dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Many Voices, One World''], Paris 1984, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of the United States==
The United States was hostile to NWICO. According to some analysts, the United States saw these issues simply as barriers to the free flow of communication and to the interests of American media corporations. It disagreed with the MacBride report at points where it questioned the role of the private sector in communications. It viewed the NWICO as dangerous to freedom of the press by ultimately putting an organization run by governments at the head of controlling global media, potentially allowing for censorship on a large scale. From another perspective, the MacBride Commission recommendations requiring the licensing of journalists amounted to prior censorship and ran directly counter to basic US law on the freedom of expression.

There were also accusations of corruption at the highest level of [[UNESCO]] leadership in Paris.  The US eventually withdrew its membership in UNESCO (as did the United Kingdom and Singapore) at the end of 1984. The matter was complicated by debates within UNESCO about [[Israel]]'s archaeological work in the city of [[Jerusalem]], and about the [[Apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The United States rejoined in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2003/01/01/unesco-welcomes-back-usa/ |title=UNESCO welcomes back U.S.A. |author=Henrikas Yushkiavitshus |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124062617/http://globaljournalist.org/stories/2003/01/01/unesco-welcomes-back-usa/ |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The debate on the NWICO that started in the 1970s reflected criticism about non-equitable [[access to information]] and [[media imperialism]]. The NWICO saw the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] back out of UNESCO until 1997 for the UK and 2003 for the US. In 1990-2000, a switch occurred globally, carried by the Internet that contributed to bring more equity to the available content. This was supported by the extension of media powers to [[Developing country|developing countries]] such as [[Mexico]], [[Korea]], [[Kenya]] and [[Nigeria]]; by the adoption of protectionist measures in regards to the free market by western countries like [[Canada]] and [[France]]; and with the rise of satellite broadcasting as a transnational means for non-western countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Expressing the changes.

=== Windhoek Declaration ===
{{Main|Windhoek Declaration}}
This tendency has reached its peak in the 1991 [[Windhoek Declaration]]. The Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press is a statement of [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] principles by African newspaper journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Why the World Became concerned with Journalistic Safety", The Assault on Journalism|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Assault-on-Journalism.pdf|pages=33-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; African diplomats in [[Paris]] (UNESCO), [[Geneva]] ([[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]]) and [[New York City|New York]]’s (UN General Assembly) commitment has been crucial to the success of the Windhoek process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media in Africa: 20 years after the Windhoek Declaration on Press Freedom|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=Windhoek: Media Institute of Southern Africa|year=2011|isbn=|location=http://genderlinks.org.za/wp-content/uploads/imported/articles/attachments/14393_mia.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO endorsed the Windhoek Declaration and United Nations General Assembly recognized the 3 May, date of the Declaration, as “[[World Press Freedom Day]]”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Windhoek Declaration has had other significant impacts in the media field. UNESCO adopted the Windhoek framework concerning [[media development]], characterizing it by freedom, [[Media pluralism|pluralism]] and [[Media Independence|independence]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B3254AA_0_403&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Windhoek Declaration is implemented through the Media Development Indicators (MDIs) framework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Development Indicators: Framework for Assessing Media Development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2008|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001631/163102e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] Intergovernmental Council in 2006&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining Indicators of Media Development.

Resonating with the NWICO, the MDIs help assessing the priority areas for media development that are the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism, the development of [[community media]] and of human resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) ===
{{Main|International Programme for the Development of Communication}}
As a result of the “[[MacBride report|Many Voices, One World]]” 1980 report UNESCO’s General Conference launched the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) the same year in [[Belgrade]]. The Programme was adopted by 39 Member States and aimed at strengthening the development of [[mass media]] in developing countries. Its mandate since 2003 is “... to contribute to [[sustainable development]], democracy and [[good governance]] by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.”&lt;ref&gt;Amendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32, adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Safety of journalists ===
{{Main|Safety of journalists}}
Threats on [[Journalist|journalists]] are one of the major issues blocking media development. Since 2008, UNESCO Member States submit information on the status of the judicial inquiries conducted on each of the journalists killings condemned by the Organization. This information is included in a public report submitted every two years to the IPDC Council by the Director-General and is basis to the Programme's follow-up to killings of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;The IPDC web page: https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives

The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issues of Impunity: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Technological developments ===
{{Main|Access to information}}
Technological developments have direct effects on access to information and on [[privacy]]. Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. According to [[Guy Berger]], “access to digital means of communication, even within the limits established by platform owners, is unprecedented”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There has been a signiﬁcant increase in access to the Internet, which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, issues remain such as the [[digital divide]], the gender divide and the security argument. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;FALLING THROUGH THE NET:   A Survey of the "Have Nots" in Rural and Urban America: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html

National Telecommunications and Information Administration: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities between men and women in navigating the tools used for access to information: it’s the gender divide.&lt;ref&gt;Anja Kovac (2017), ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India, Available at: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/

Website: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/&lt;/ref&gt; With the evolution of the digital age, application of [[freedom of speech]] and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Schultz|first=Wolfgang|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The increasing access to and reliance on [[digital media]] to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to [[Tracking system|track]] individuals’ behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of [[Europe]], new [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] have enabled a greater degree of [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens’ data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of [[human rights]], the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:Nova planta Catalunya 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cover of the Nueva Planta decrees of Catalonia]]

The '''Nueva Planta decrees''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Decretos de Nueva Planta}}, {{lang-ca|Decrets de Nova Planta}}) were a number of [[decree]]s signed between 1707 and 1716 by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]—the first [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[King of Spain]]—during and shortly after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].

Angered by what he saw as [[sedition]] by the Aragonese and taking his native [[Kingdom of France|France]] as a model of a centralised state, King Felipe V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient [[fuero|charters]] (Spanish: ''fueros'', Catalan: ''furs'') of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the [[Crown of Aragon]] ([[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and the [[Kingdom of Majorca|Balearic Islands]]). The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the [[Aran Valley]] were to be ruled by the laws of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] ("the most praiseworthy in all the Universe" according to the 1707 decree), embedding these regions in a new, and nearly uniformly administered, centralised Spain.

The other historic territories&amp;mdash;[[Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|other Basque territories]]&amp;mdash;supported Felipe V initially, whom they saw as belonging to the lineage of [[Henry III of Navarre]], but after Felipe V's military [[History of the Basques#A Basque trade area|campaign to crush the Basque uprising]], he backed down on his intent to suppress [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|home rule]].

The acts abolishing the charters were promulgated in 1707 in Valencia and Aragon,&lt;ref name="payne_bourbon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne16.htm|work=A History of Spain and Portugal - Vol. 2|title=Chapter 16, The Eighteenth-Century Bourbon Regime in Spain|author=Stanley G. Payne|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1715 in [[Majorca]] and the other Balearic Islands (with the exception of [[Menorca]], a possession of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] at the time), and finally in Catalonia on 16 January 1716.&lt;ref name="payne_bourbon" /&gt;

The decrees effectively created a Spanish citizenship or nationality, that judicially did not distinguish between Castilian and Aragonese anymore, both with respect to rights and law. They abolished internal borders and customs except for the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque territory]], giving grant to all Spaniards to trade with American colonies (not only Castilians, as before).

[[Felipe V of Spain|Felipe of Bourbon]] won the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and imposed unification policies over the [[Crown of Aragon]], which had supported the claim of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Karl of Austria]]. These acts constituted the first successful realisation of Spain as a centralised state and were meant both as a modernising element, in line with other European countries where their monarchs were increasing their powers, and also as a punishment on these territories which had fought against Felipe V in the War of Succession. Henceforth, top civil servants were appointed directly from [[Madrid]], the King's court city, and  most institutions in these territories were abolished. Court cases could only be presented and argued in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], which became the sole language of government, displacing [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and other [[Spanish languages]].

'''[[Self]]''' &amp;ndash; an [[individual]] [[person]], from his or her own perspective. To you, self is you. To a different person, self is that person. One's self is a subject of [[Self (philosophy)|philosophy]]; [[Self (psychology)|psychology]] and [[developmental psychology]]; [[Religious views on the self|religion and spirituality]]; [[social science]] and [[Neural basis of self|neuroscience]].

== In general ==

* [[Human]]
* [[Human condition]]
* [[Individuality]] (selfhood) &amp;ndash; state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other persons and possessing his or her own needs or goals, rights and responsibilities. The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of biology, law, and philosophy.
* [[Person]] &amp;ndash; being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility.
* [[Personhood]] &amp;ndash; status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law and is closely tied with legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.

* [[Anger]] &amp;ndash; emotional response related to one's psychological interpretation of having been threatened. Often it indicates when one's basic boundaries are violated. Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation. Anger may be utilized effectively when utilized to set boundaries or escape from dangerous situations.
* [[Jealousy]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; emotion, and the word typically refers to the negative thoughts and feelings of insecurity, fear, and anxiety over an anticipated loss of something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a human connection. Jealousy often consists of a combination of emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness and disgust.
* [[Laziness]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; disinclination to activity or exertion despite having the ability to do so. It is often used as a pejorative; related terms for a person seen to be lazy include couch potato, slacker, and bludger.
* [[Selfishness]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Seven Deadly Sins]]
*# [[Lust]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; emotion or feeling of intense desire in the body. The lust can take any form such as the lust for knowledge, the lust for sex or the lust for power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.
*# [[Gluttony]]&amp;nbsp;– over-indulgence and over-consumption of food, drink, or wealth items to the point of extravagance or waste. In some Christian denominations, it is considered one of the seven deadly sins—a misplaced desire of food or its withholding from the needy.
*# [[Greed]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness, is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intent to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. It is applied to a markedly high desire for and pursuit of wealth, status, and power. ''See also, [[Greed (deadly sin)]].''
*# [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; spiritual or emotional apathy, neglecting what God has spoken, and being physically and emotionally inactive. It can also be either an outright refusal or merely a carelessness in the performance of one's obligations, especially spiritual, moral or legal obligations. Sloth can also indicate a wasting due to lack of use, concerning a person, place, thing, skill, or intangible ideal that would require maintenance, refinement, or support to continue to exist.
*# [[Seven deadly sins#Wrath|Wrath]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; also known as "rage", may be described as inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger. Wrath, in its purest form, presents with self-destructiveness, violence, and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of anger can manifest in different ways, including impatience, revenge, and self-destructive behavior, such as drug abuse or suicide.
*# [[Envy]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; emotion which "occurs when a person lacks another's superior quality, achievement, or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it"
*# [[Pride]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; inflated sense of one's personal status or accomplishments, often used synonymously with hubris.
* [[Vanity]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others.

== Individual rights ==
{{see also|Outline of rights|Human rights}}

[[Individual rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; much of the western world values the concept of individual rights. These rights vary from culture to culture, and by very definition, from person to person, and appear mainly in individualist societies. In considering the self, the most intimate legal relation would be what is codified as '[[sui juris]]', or what laws have a purposed place so far as they are derived of the self.  In such cultures, it is generally considered that each and every individual has the following rights:
*[[right to life|Security rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect people against crimes such as [[abuse]], murder, massacre, and [[torture]]
** [[Security of person]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; liberty, including the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to the remedy of habeas corpus. Security of person can also be seen as an expansion of rights based on prohibitions of torture and cruel and unusual punishment. Rights to security of person can guard against less lethal conduct, and can be used in regard to prisoners' rights.
* [[Human rights#Theory of value and property|Bodily and property rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; encompass "ownership" of your own body and choosing what to do with it, as well as the fruits of the labour that spring forth from using your own body. ("Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself," per [[John Locke]], [[Second Treatise on Civil Government]])
** [[Self-ownership]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; moral or natural right of a person to have bodily integrity, and be the exclusive controller of his own body and life. Also known as "sovereignty of the individual", "individual sovereignty", and "individual autonomy".
*[[Liberty]] rights of the [[The Enlightenment|Classical]] era&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect freedoms in areas such as [[freedom of conscience|belief and religion]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of assembly|assembling]], [[freedom of movement|movement]], and other [[self-determination]] (as an individual person), [[privacy]] from government and others, and [[negative liberty|freedoms from]] other [[paternalist]] meddling generally, whether by governments or others; also encompasses security, bodily and property, political, and due process rights, many group rights, some welfare rights, and (especially outside of the US in the Classical era) equality rights, as all of those categories appear in this list
*[[Political]] rights&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect the liberty to participate in politics by [[freedom of expression|expressing themselves]], protesting, voting and serving in public office
*[[Due process]] rights&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect against abuses of the legal system such as imprisonment without trial, secret trials and excessive punishments; often overlaps with the bodily rights, listed above
*[[Social equality|Equality]] rights&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; guarantee equal citizenship, equality before the [[law]] and nondiscrimination in regards to one's eligibility for all of the other rights in this list
*[[Quality of life|Welfare]] rights (also known as economic or social rights)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; require the provision of [[education]] and protections against severe [[poverty]] and [[starvation]]; generally an expansion of [[positive liberties]]
*[[collective rights|Group rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; provide protection for groups against ethnic [[genocide]], and [[self-determination]] (as a group) and the ownership by countries of their national territories and resources; may overlap with the bodily and property rights, and Social equality rights, listed above

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a subset of a [[topological space]] is '''perfect''' if it is [[closed set|closed]] and has no [[isolated point]]s. Equivalently: the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is perfect if  &lt;math&gt;S=S'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all [[Limit point|limit points]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, also known as the [[Derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

In a perfect set, every point can be approximated arbitrarily well by other points from the set: given any point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and any [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|topological neighborhood]] of the point, there is another point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that lies within the neighborhood.

Note that the term ''perfect space'' is also used, incompatibly, to refer to other properties of a topological space, such as being a [[G-delta space|G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt; space]]. 

==Examples==

Examples of perfect subsets of the [[Real line|real line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are: the [[empty set]], all [[Closed interval|closed intervals]], the real line itself, and the [[Cantor set]]. The latter is noteworthy in that it is [[totally disconnected]].

== Connection with other topological properties ==
[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] proved that every closed subset of the real line can be uniquely written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a [[countable set]].  This is also true more generally for all closed subsets of [[Polish space|Polish spaces]], in which case the theorem is known as the [[Cantor–Bendixson theorem]].

Cantor also showed that every non-empty perfect subset of the real line has cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. These results are extended in  [[descriptive set theory]] as follows:
* If ''X'' is a [[complete metric space]] with no isolated points, then the [[Cantor space]] 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; can be continuously embedded into ''X''. Thus ''X'' has cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''X'' is a [[Separable space|separable]], complete metric space with no isolated points, the cardinality of ''X'' is exactly &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  
* If ''X'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] with no isolated points, there is an injective function (not necessarily continuous) from Cantor space to ''X'', and so ''X'' has cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Raúl Cordero.jpg|thumb|right|Raúl Cordero in 2008]]

'''Raúl Cordero''' (born 1971) is a Cuban born conceptual painter. First known as part of the 90s generation in [[Cuba]], when he started exhibiting his work mostly in [[Europe]] and the [[United States of America]]. Cordero represents through his work the "other Cuban art." Far from the standards of the Cuban Revolution art, and without falling into topics of other artists from in and out of the island, Cordero samples pretexts whimsically obtained from various referential origins (press, magazines, books, TV, photography and video) and shows us his work as a result of recycling, of a revival, creating a new reality that refers more to art than to any other apparent content.

His art education started in [[Havana]] (Academia San Alejandro and Instituto Superior de Diseño) and his influences mix an interest in conceptual American artists such as [[John Baldessari]], [[Bruce Nauman]] or [[Chris Burden]] -who later informed his conceptual training- together with elements of the 12th century's [[Flemish painting]] tradition, acquired during his postgraduate formation in the [[Netherlands]] (Graphic Media Development Centre and Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunsten). Cordero has held visiting professorships at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) in Havana, Cuba; The [[San Francisco Art Institute]], [[California]] and [[The Art Academy of Cincinnati]], in [[Ohio]], U.S.A.

His work features in the collection of several museums such as [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Musée National D’Art Moderne Centre Pompidou]], [[Paris]], [[France]], [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana]], Cuba, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA), [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] (MOCA), California, Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (SMAK). [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno and Museo Extremeño Iberoamericano de Arte Contemporáneo (MEIAC), [[Spain]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego]], California, U.S.A. The National Museum of Fine Arts in Havana is currently building a large exhibition of Cordero's work, which was scheduled to open in November 2017. Cordero is represented by Mai 36 Galerie in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]].

'''Representation''', from the most general and abstract [[systemics|systemic]] perspective, relates to a [[role]] or [[Function (engineering)|function]] or a property of an [[abstraction|abstract]] or real [[Entity|object]], relation or changes. 

For example, 
* an [[ambassador]] or a sport team may represent its nation. 
* graphical figures or written [[symbol]]ic text may represent some abstract ideas or physical objects.

In the case of humans or human-made objects, a representation can be:

* formal or informal, i.e. "legal" or actually realized with a consensus of interested community.
* on the behalf of (or approved by) represented subject or without his/her/their permission.

'''Scottish Landfill Tax''' (SLfT) is a tax which is charged in Scotland under the [[Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/2/contents Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the [[Landfill tax#Landfill tax by country|UK Landfill Tax]] from 1 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/638/made The Scotland Act 2012, Section 31 (Disapplication of UK Landfill Tax)(Appointed Day) Order 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Revenue Scotland]] administers and collects SLfT with support from the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] (SEPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.revenue.scot/scottish-landfill-tax|title = Scottish Landfill Tax|accessdate = 2015-01-30|publisher = Revenue Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Finance/scottishapproach/landfilltax|title = A Scottish Landfill Tax|accessdate = 2015-01-30|publisher = Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rates of Scottish Landfill Tax (given in £/tonne) are £84.40 (standard rate) and £2.65 (lower rate) from 1 April 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2016/94/made The Scottish Landfill Tax (Standard Rate and Lower Rate) Order 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; increased from the preceding year's rates of £82.60 and £2.60 respectively&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2015/127/article/2/made The Scottish Landfill Tax (Standard Rate and Lower Rate) Order 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5795">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[differential topology]], the '''secondary vector bundle structure'''
refers to the natural [[vector bundle]] structure {{math|(''TE'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, ''TM'')}} on the total space ''TE'' of the [[tangent bundle]] of a smooth vector bundle {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''M'')}}, induced by the [[Pushforward (differential)|push-forward]] {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; : ''TE'' → ''TM''}} of the original projection map {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''M''}}.
This gives rise to a [[double vector bundle]] structure {{math|(''TE'',''E'',''TM'',''M'')}}.

In the special case {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''M'') {{=}} (''TM'', ''π&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M'')}}, where {{math|''TE'' {{=}} ''TTM''}} is the [[double tangent bundle]], the secondary vector bundle {{math|(''TTM'', (''π&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, ''TM'')}} is isomorphic to the [[tangent bundle]]

Let {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''M'')}} be a smooth vector bundle of rank {{mvar|N}}. Then the preimage {{math|(''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') ⊂ ''TE''}} of any tangent vector {{mvar|X}} in {{math|''TM''}} in the push-forward {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; : ''TE'' → ''TM''}} of the canonical projection {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''M''}} is a smooth submanifold of dimension {{math|2''N''}}, and it becomes a vector space with the push-forwards

:&lt;math&gt; +_*:T(E\times E)\to TE, \qquad \lambda_*:TE\to TE &lt;/math&gt;

of the original addition and scalar multiplication

:&lt;math&gt;+:E\times E\to E, \qquad \lambda:E\to E&lt;/math&gt;

as its vector space operations. The triple {{math|(''TE'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, ''TM'')}} becomes a smooth vector bundle with these vector space operations on its fibres.

=== Proof ===
Let {{math|(''U'', ''φ'')}} be a local coordinate system on the base manifold {{mvar|M}} with {{math|''φ''(''x'') {{=}} (''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} and let

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\psi:W \to \varphi(U)\times \mathbf{R}^N \\ \psi \left (v^k e_k|_x \right ) := \left (x^1,\ldots,x^n,v^1,\ldots,v^N \right )\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

be a coordinate system on &lt;math&gt;W:=p^{-1}(U)\subset E&lt;/math&gt; adapted to it. Then

:&lt;math&gt; p_*\left (X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_v + Y^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_v \right) = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_{p(v)},&lt;/math&gt;

so the fiber of the secondary vector bundle structure at {{mvar|X}} in {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;M''}} is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;p^{-1}_*(X) = \left \{ X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_v + Y^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_v \ : \ v\in E_x;  Y^1,\ldots,Y^N\in\mathbf{R} \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now it turns out that

:&lt;math&gt; \chi\left(X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_v + Y^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_v\right ) = \left (X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_{p(v)}, \left (v^1,\ldots,v^N,Y^1,\ldots,Y^N \right) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

gives a local trivialization {{math|''χ'' : ''TW'' → ''TU'' × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|(''TE'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, ''TM'')}}, and the push-forwards of the original vector space operations read in the adapted coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\left (X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_v + Y^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_v\right) +_* \left (X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_w + Z^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_w\right) = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_{v+w} + (Y^\ell+Z^\ell)\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_{v+w} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_*\left (X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_v + Y^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_v\right) = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Bigg|_{\lambda v} + \lambda Y^\ell\frac{\partial}{\partial v^\ell}\Bigg|_{\lambda v}, &lt;/math&gt;

so each fibre {{math|(''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') ⊂ ''TE''}} is a vector space and the triple {{math|(''TE'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, ''TM'')}} is a smooth vector bundle.

== Linearity of connections on vector bundles ==
The general [[Ehresmann connection]] {{math|''TE'' {{=}} ''HE'' ⊕ ''VE''}} on a vector bundle {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''M'')}} can be characterized in terms of the '''connector map'''

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\kappa:T_vE\to E_{p(v)} \\ \kappa(X):=\operatorname{vl}_v^{-1}(\operatorname{vpr}X) \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|vl&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''E''  → ''V&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;E''}} is the [[vector bundle|vertical lift]], and {{math|vpr&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''T&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;E'' → ''V&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;E''}} is the [[Ehresmann connection|vertical projection]]. The mapping

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\nabla:\Gamma(TM)\times\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E) \\ \nabla_Xv := \kappa(v_*X) \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

induced by an Ehresmann connection is a [[covariant derivative]] on {{math|Γ(''E'')}} in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla_{X+Y}v &amp;= \nabla_X v + \nabla_Y v \\
\nabla_{\lambda X}v &amp;=\lambda \nabla_Xv \\
\nabla_X(v+w) &amp;= \nabla_X v + \nabla_X w \\
\nabla_X(\lambda v) &amp;=\lambda \nabla_Xv \\
\nabla_X(fv) &amp;= X[f]v + f\nabla_Xv
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if the connector map is linear with respect to the secondary vector bundle structure {{math|(''TE'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, ''TM'')}} on {{math|''TE''}}. Then the connection is called ''linear''. Note that the connector map is automatically linear with respect to the tangent bundle structure {{math|(''TE'', ''π&lt;sub&gt;TE&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''E'')}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5020">'''Seidel's algorithm''' is an algorithm designed by [[Raimund Seidel]] in 1992 for the [[Shortest path problem#All-pairs shortest paths|all-pairs-shortest-path problem]] for undirected, unweighted, connected graphs.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/jcss.1995.1078|title=On the All-Pairs-Shortest-Path Problem in Unweighted Undirected Graphs|first=R.|last=Seidel|publisher=|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|volume=51|issue=3|pages=400–403|doi=10.1006/jcss.1995.1078|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It solves the problem in &lt;math&gt;O(V^\omega \log V)&lt;/math&gt; expected time for a graph with &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; vertices, where &lt;math&gt;\omega &lt; 2.373&lt;/math&gt; is the exponent in the complexity &lt;math&gt;O(n^\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[Matrix Multiplication|matrix multiplication]]. If only the distances between each pair of vertices are sought, the same time bound can be achieved in the worst case. Note that even though the algorithm is designed for connected graphs, it can be applied individually to each [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of a graph with the same running time overall. Note also that there is an exception to the expected running time given above for computing the paths: if &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2&lt;/math&gt; the expected running time becomes &lt;math&gt;O(V^2 \log^2 V)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Details of the implementation ==

The core of the algorithm is a procedure that computes the length of the shortest-paths between any pair of vertices.
This can be done in &lt;math&gt;O(V^\omega \log V)&lt;/math&gt; time in the worst case. Once the lengths are computed, the paths can be reconstructed using a [[Las Vegas algorithm]] whose expected running time is &lt;math&gt;O(V^\omega \log V)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\omega &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(V^2 \log^2 V)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Computing the shortest-paths lengths ===

The python code below assumes the input graph is given as a &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; adjacency matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with zeros on the diagonal. It defines the function APD which returns a matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;D_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the shortest path between the vertices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. The matrix class used can be any matrix class implementation supporting the multiplication, exponentiation, and indexing operators (for example [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.html numpy.matrix]).

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def APD ( A , n ):
    if all( A[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i != j ): return A
    Z = A**2
    B = matrix( [
        [ 1 if i != j and ( A[i][j] == 1 or Z[i][j] &gt; 0 ) else 0 for j in range(n) ]
    for i in range(n) ] )
    T = APD( B , n )
    X = T*A
    degree = [ sum( A[i][j] for j in range(n) ) for i in range(n) ]
    D = matrix( [
        [ 2 * T[i][j] if X[i][j] &gt;= T[i][j] * degree[j] else 2 * T[i][j] - 1 for j in range(n) ]
    for i in range(n) ] )
    return D
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The base case tests whether the input adjacency matrix describes a complete graph, in which case all shortest paths have length &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Graphs with weights from finite universes ==

Algorithms for undirected and directed graphs with weights from a finite universe &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,M,+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; also exist. The best known algorithm for the directed case is in time &lt;math&gt;\tilde{O}(M^{1/(4-\omega)} V^{2+1/(4-\omega)})&lt;/math&gt; by Zwick in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org:80/document/743464/?reload=true|title=All pairs shortest paths in weighted directed graphs-exact and almost exact algorithms|first=U.|last=Zwick|date=1 November 1998|publisher=|pages=310–319|via=IEEE Xplore|doi=10.1109/SFCS.1998.743464}}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm uses rectangular matrix multiplication instead of square matrix multiplication. Better upper bounds can be obtained if one uses the best rectangular matrix multiplication algorithm available instead of achieving rectangular multiplication via multiple square matrix multiplications. The best known algorithm for the undirected case is in time &lt;math&gt;\tilde{O}(MV^\omega)&lt;/math&gt; by Shoshan and Zwick in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org:80/document/814635/?reload=true|title=All pairs shortest paths in undirected graphs with integer weights|first1=A.|last1=Shoshan|first2=U.|last2=Zwick|date=15 February 1999|publisher=|pages=605–614|via=IEEE Xplore|doi=10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814635}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original implementation of this algorithm was erroneous and has been corrected by Eirinakis, Williamson, and Subramani in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=On the Shoshan-Zwick Algorithm for the All-Pairs Shortest Path Problem|first1=Pavlos|last1=Eirinakis|first2=Matthew|last2=Williamson|first3=K.|last3=Subramani|date=28 March 2016|publisher=|eprint=1603.08627|class=cs.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2010}}
'''Modular self-reconfiguring [[robot]]ic systems''' or '''self-reconfigurable modular robots''' are autonomous kinematic [[machine]]s with variable [[Morphology (materials science)|morphology]]. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing and control typically found in [[fixed-morphology robot]]s, [[self-reconfiguring robot]]s are also able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts, in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage.

For example, a robot made of such components could assume a [[worm]]-like shape to move through a narrow pipe, reassemble into something with [[spider]]-like legs to cross uneven terrain, then form a third arbitrary object (like a ball or wheel that can spin itself) to move quickly over a fairly flat terrain; it can also be used for making "fixed" objects, such as walls, shelters, or buildings.

In some cases this involves each module having 2 or more connectors for connecting several together. They can contain [[electronics]], [[sensor]]s, [[computer processor]]s, [[memory]] and [[power supplies]]; they can also contain [[actuator]]s that are used for manipulating their location in the environment and in relation with each other. A feature found in some cases is the ability of the modules to automatically connect and disconnect themselves to and from each other, and to form into many objects or perform many tasks moving or manipulating the environment.

By saying "self-reconfiguring" or "self-reconfigurable" it means that the mechanism or device is capable of utilizing its own system of control such as with actuators or [[stochastic]] means to change its overall structural shape. Having the quality of being "modular" in "self-reconfiguring modular robotics" is to say that the same module or set of modules can be added to or removed from the system, as opposed to being generically "modularized" in the broader sense. The underlying intent is to have an indefinite number of identical modules, or a finite and relatively small set of identical modules, in a mesh or matrix structure of self-reconfigurable modules.

Self-reconfiguration is different from the concept of [[self-replication]], which is not a quality that a self-reconfigurable module or collection of modules needs to possess. A matrix of modules does not need to be able to increase the quantity of modules in its matrix to be considered self-reconfigurable. It is sufficient for self-reconfigurable modules to be produced at a conventional factory, where dedicated machines stamp or mold components that are then [[Assembly line|assembled]] into a module, and added to an existing matrix in order to supplement it to increase the quantity or to replace worn out modules.

A matrix made up of many modules can separate to form multiple matrices with fewer modules, or they can combine, or recombine, to form a larger matrix.  Some advantages of separating into multiple matrices include the ability to tackle multiple and simpler tasks at locations that are remote from each other simultaneously, transferring through barriers with openings that are too small for a single larger matrix to fit through but not too small for smaller matrix fragments or individual modules, and energy saving purposes by only utilizing enough modules to accomplish a given task.  Some advantages of combining multiple matrices into a single matrix is ability to form larger structures such as an elongated bridge, more complex structures such as a robot with many arms or an arm with more degrees of freedom, and increasing strength.  Increasing strength, in this sense, can be in the form of increasing the rigidity of a fixed or static structure, increasing the net or collective amount of force for raising, lowering, pushing, or pulling another object, or another part of the matrix, or any combination of these features.

There are two basic methods of segment articulation that self-reconfigurable mechanisms can utilize to reshape their structures: [[chain reconfiguration]] and [[lattice reconfiguration]].

==Structure and control==
Modular robots are usually composed of multiple building blocks of a relatively small repertoire, with uniform docking interfaces that allow transfer of mechanical forces and moments, electrical power and communication throughout the robot.

The modular building blocks usually consist of some primary structural actuated unit, and potentially additional specialized units such as grippers, feet, wheels, cameras, payload and energy storage and generation.

===A taxonomy of architectures===
Modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems can be generally classified into several architectural groups by the geometric arrangement of their unit (lattice vs. chain). Several systems exhibit hybrid properties, and modular robots have also been classified into the two categories of Mobile Configuration Change (MCC) and Whole Body Locomotion (WBL).&lt;ref&gt;P. Moubarak, et al., Modular and Reconfigurable Mobile Robotics, Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 60 (12) (2012) 1648 – 1663&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MicroUnit.png|thumb|Lattice architecture: 12 modules of the homogeneous lattice system Micro Unit assembled together shown with corresponding grid and docking points network]]
* '''Lattice architecture''' have their units connecting their docking interfaces at points into virtual cells of some regular grid. This network of docking points can be compared to atoms in a crystal and the grid to the lattice of that crystal. Therefore, the kinematical features of lattice robots can be characterized by their corresponding crystallographic displacement groups (chiral [[space group]]s).&lt;ref&gt;N. Brener, F. Ben Amar, and P. Bidaud, "Characterization of Lattice Modular Robots by Discrete Displacement Groups", in ''IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)'', Tapei, Taiwan, October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually few units are sufficient to accomplish a reconfiguration step. Lattice architectures allows a simpler mechanical design and a simpler computational representation and reconfiguration planning that can be more easily scaled to complex systems.
* '''Chain architecture''' do not use a virtual network of docking points for their units. The units are able to reach any point in the space and are therefore more versatile, but a chain of many units may be necessary to reach a point making it usually more difficult to accomplish a reconfiguration step. Such systems are also more computationally difficult to represent and analyze.
* '''Hybrid architecture''' takes advantages of both previous architectures. Control and mechanism are designed for lattice reconfiguration but also allow to reach any point in the space.

Modular robotic systems can also be classified according to the way by which units are reconfigured (moved) into place.

* '''Deterministic reconfiguration''' relies on units moving or being directly manipulated into their target location during reconfiguration. The exact location of each unit is known at all times. Reconfiguration times can be guaranteed, but sophisticated feedback control is necessary to assure precise manipulation. Macro-scale systems are usually deterministic.
* '''Stochastic reconfiguration''' relies on units moving around using statistical processes (like Brownian motion). The exact location of each unit only known when it is connected to the main structure, but it may take unknown paths to move between locations. Reconfiguration times can be guaranteed only statistically. Stochastic architectures are more favorable at micro scales.

Modular robotic systems are also generally classified depending on the design of the modules.

* '''Homogeneous''' modular robot systems have many modules of the same design forming a structure suitable to perform the required task. An advantage over other systems is that they are simple to scale in size (and possibly function), by adding more units. A commonly described disadvantage is limits to functionality - these systems often require more modules to achieve a given function, than heterogeneous systems.
* '''Heterogeneous''' modular robot systems have different modules, each of which do specialized functions, forming a structure suitable to perform a task. An advantage is compactness, and the versatility to design and add units to perform any task. A commonly described disadvantage is an increase in complexity of design, manufacturing, and simulation methods.

Other modular robotic systems exist which are not self-reconfigurable, and thus do not formally belong to this family of robots though they may have similar appearance. For example, [[self-assembling]] systems may be composed of multiple modules but cannot dynamically control their target shape. Similarly, tensegrity robotics may be composed of multiple interchangeable modules but cannot self-reconfigure.

==Motivation and inspiration==
There are two key motivations for designing modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems.

* '''Functional advantage''': Self reconfiguring robotic systems are potentially more '''robust''' and more '''adaptive''' than conventional systems. The reconfiguration ability allows a robot or a group of robots to disassemble and reassemble machines to form new morphologies that are better suitable for new tasks, such as changing from a legged robot to a snake robot ([[snakebot]]) and then to a rolling robot. Since robot parts are interchangeable (within a robot and between different robots), machines can also replace faulty parts autonomously, leading to self-repair.

[[File:SpaceMolecubes.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Autonomous modular robotics in space]]

* '''Economic advantage''': Self reconfiguring robotic systems can potentially lower overall robot cost by making a range of complex machines out of a single (or relatively few) types of mass-produced modules.

Both these advantages have not yet been fully realized. A modular robot is likely to be inferior in performance to any single custom robot tailored for a specific task. However, the advantage of modular robotics is only apparent when considering multiple tasks that would normally require a set of different robots.

The added degrees of freedom make modular robots more versatile in their potential capabilities, but also incur a performance tradeoff and increased mechanical and computational complexities.

The quest for self-reconfiguring robotic structures is to some extent inspired by envisioned applications such as long-term space missions, that require long-term self-sustaining robotic ecology that can handle unforeseen situations and may require self repair. A second source of inspiration are biological systems that are self-constructed out of a relatively small repertoire of lower-level building blocks (cells or amino acids, depending on scale of interest). This architecture underlies biological systems' ability to physically adapt, grow, heal, and even self replicate – capabilities that would be desirable in many engineered systems.

Manufacturer operating in the self-reconfiguring modular robot industry include ABB Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., Yaskawa Electric Corporation, Fanuc Corporation, Kuka AG, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Denso Corporation, Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp., Comau S.P.A., Universal Robots A/S, and CMA Robotics S.P.A. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/self-reconfiguring-modular-robot-market-1180 Manufacturer of self-reconfiguring modular robot] Retrieved 19-09-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application areas==
Given these advantages, where would a modular self-reconfigurable system be used? While the system has the promise of being capable of doing a wide variety of things, finding the "[[killer application]]" has been somewhat elusive. Here are several examples:

===Space exploration===
One application that highlights the advantages of self-reconfigurable systems is long-term space missions.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite web
| publisher = Palo Alto Research Center ([[PARC (company)|PARC]])
| year = 2004
| url = http://www2.parc.com/spl/projects/modrobots/publications/pdf/space.pdf
| title = Modular Reconfigurable Robots in Space Applications
| format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; These require long-term self-sustaining robotic ecology that can handle unforeseen situations and may require self repair. Self-reconfigurable systems have the ability to handle tasks that are not known a priori, especially compared to fixed configuration systems. In addition, space missions are highly volume- and mass-constrained. Sending a robot system that can reconfigure to achieve many tasks may be more effective than sending many robots that each can do one task.

===Telepario===
Another example of an application has been coined "telepario" by CMU professors Todd Mowry and Seth Goldstein. What the researchers propose to make are moving, physical,
three-dimensional replicas of people or objects, so lifelike that human senses would accept them as real. This would eliminate the need for cumbersome virtual reality gear and overcome the viewing angle limitations of modern 3D approaches. The replicas would mimic the shape and appearance of a person or object being imaged in real time, and as the originals moved, so would their replicas. One aspect of this application is that the main development thrust is geometric representation rather than applying forces to the environment as in a typical robotic manipulation task. This project is widely known as claytronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~claytronics/|title=Claytronics - Carnegie Mellon University|first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Programmable matter]] (noting that programmable matter is a much more general term, encompassing functional programmable materials, as well).

===Bucket of stuff===
A third long term vision for these systems has been called "bucket of stuff". In this vision, consumers of the future have a container of self-reconfigurable modules say in their garage, basement, or attic. When the need arises, the consumer calls forth the robots to achieve a task such as "clean the gutters" or "change the oil in the car" and the robot assumes the shape needed and does the task.

== History and state of the art ==
The roots of the concept of modular self-reconfigurable robots can be traced back to the "quick change" end effector and automatic tool changers in computer numerical controlled machining centers in the 1970s. Here, special modules each with a common connection mechanism could be automatically swapped out on the end of a robotic arm. However, taking the basic concept of the common connection mechanism and applying it to the whole robot was introduced by Toshio Fukuda with the CEBOT (short for cellular robot) in the late 1980s.

The early 1990s saw further development from Greg Chirikjian, Mark Yim, Joseph Michael, and Satoshi Murata. Chirikjian, Michael, and Murata developed lattice reconfiguration systems and Yim developed a chain based system. While these researchers started with from a mechanical engineering emphasis, designing and building modules then developing code to program them, the work of Daniela Rus and Wei-min Shen developed hardware but had a greater impact on the programming aspects. They started a trend towards provable or verifiable distributed algorithms for the control of large numbers of modules.

One of the more interesting hardware platforms recently has been the MTRAN II and III systems developed by Satoshi Murata et al. This system is a hybrid chain and lattice system. It has the advantage of being able to achieve tasks more easily like chain systems, yet reconfigure like a lattice system.

More recently new efforts in stochastic self-assembly have been pursued by [[Hod Lipson]] and Eric Klavins. A large effort at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] headed by Seth Goldstein and Todd Mowry has started looking at issues in developing millions of modules.

Many tasks have been shown to be achievable, especially with chain reconfiguration modules. This demonstrates the versatility of these systems however, the other two advantages, robustness and low cost have not been demonstrated. In general the prototype systems developed in the labs have been fragile and expensive as would be expected during any initial development.

There is a growing number of research groups actively involved in modular robotics research. To date, about 30 systems have been designed and constructed, some of which are shown below.

;PolyBot G3 (2002)
A chain self-reconfiguration system. Each module is about 50&amp;nbsp;mm on a side, and has 1 rotational DOF. It is part of the PolyBot modular robot family that has demonstrated many modes of locomotion including walking: biped, 14 legged, slinky-like, snake-like: concertina in a gopher hole, inchworm gaits, rectilinear undulation and sidewinding gaits, rolling like a tread at up to 1.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, riding a tricycle, climbing: stairs, poles pipes, ramps etc. More information can be found at the polybot webpage at PARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parc.com/modrobots/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020804033020/http://www.parc.com/modrobots/ |archivedate=4 August 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:4leg2Cat.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Metamorphosis by a self-reconfigurable robot, M-TRAN III]]

A hybrid type self-reconfigurable system. Each module is two cube size (65&amp;nbsp;mm side), and has 2 rotational DOF and 6 flat surfaces for connection. It is the 3rd M-TRAN prototypes. Compared with the former (M-TRAN II), speed and reliability of connection is largely improved. As a chain type system, locomotion by CPG (Central Pattern Generator) controller in various shapes has been demonstrated by M-TRAN II. As a lattice type system, it can change its configuration, e.g., between a 4 legged walker to a caterpillar like robot.

;AMOEBA-I (2005)

AMOEBA-I, a three-module reconfigurable mobile robot was developed in Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) by Liu J G et al.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1708645][http://www.springerlink.com/content/m81820061n48jh32/].AMOEBA-I has nine kinds of non-isomorphic configurations and high mobility under unstructured environments.Four generations of its platform have been developed and a series of researches have been carried out on their reconfiguration mechanism, non-isomorphic configurations, tipover stability, and reconfiguration planning. Experiments have demonstrated that such kind structure permits good mobility and high flexibility to uneven terrain. Being hyper-redundant, modularized and reconfigurable, AMOEBA-I has many possible applications such as Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) and space exploration.

'''Stochastic-3D (2005)'''

High spatial resolution for arbitrary three-dimensional shape formation with modular robots can be accomplished using lattice system with large quantities of very small, prospectively microscopic modules. At small scales, and with large quantities of modules, deterministic control over reconfiguration of individual modules will become unfeasible, while stochastic mechanisms will naturally prevail. Microscopic size of modules will make the use of electromagnetic actuation and interconnection prohibitive, as well, as the use of on-board power storage.

Three large scale prototypes were built in attempt to demonstrate dynamically programmable three-dimensional stochastic reconfiguration in a neutral-buoyancy environment. The first prototype used electromagnets for module reconfiguration and interconnection. The modules were 100&amp;nbsp;mm cubes and weighed 0.81&amp;nbsp;kg. The second prototype used stochastic fluidic reconfiguration and interconnection mechanism. Its 130&amp;nbsp;mm cubic modules weighed 1.78&amp;nbsp;kg each and made reconfiguration experiments excessively slow. The current third implementation inherits the fluidic reconfiguration principle. The lattice grid size is 80&amp;nbsp;mm, and the reconfiguration experiments are under way.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Molecubes (2005)'''

This hybrid self-reconfiguring system was built by the [[Cornell]] Computational Synthesis Lab to physically demonstrate artificial kinematic self-reproduction. Each module is a 0.65&amp;nbsp;kg cube with 100&amp;nbsp;mm long edges and one rotational degree of freedom. The axis of rotation is aligned with the cube's longest diagonal. Physical self-reproduction of a three- and a four-module robots was demonstrated. It was also shown that, disregarding the gravity constraints, an infinite number of self-reproducing chain meta-structures can be built from Molecubes.

The programmable parts are stirred randomly on an air-hockey table by randomly actuated air jets. When they collide and stick, they can communicate and decide whether to stay stuck, or if and when to detach. Local interaction rules can be devised and optimized to guide the robots to make any desired global shape.

'''[http://www.isi.edu/robots/superbot SuperBot] (2006)'''

The SuperBot modules fall into the hybrid architecture. The modules have three degrees of freedom each. The design is based on two previous systems: [http://www.isi.edu/robots/conro Conro] (by the same research group) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20061027060910/http://unit.aist.go.jp/is/dsysd/mtran3/ MTRAN] (by Murata et al.). Each module can connect to another module through one of its six dock connectors. They can communicate and share power through their dock connectors. Several locomotion gaits have been developed for different arrangements of modules. For high-level communication the modules use hormone-based control, a distributed, scalable protocol that does not require the modules to have unique ID's.

'''Miche (2006)'''

The Miche system is a modular lattice system capable of arbitrary shape formation. Each module is an autonomous robot module capable of connecting to and communicating with its immediate neighbors. When assembled into a structure, the modules form a system that can be virtually sculpted using a computer interface and a distributed process. The group of modules collectively decide who is on the final shape and who is not using algorithms that minimize the information transmission and storage. Finally, the modules not in the structure let go and fall off under the control of an external force, in this case gravity.

'''[http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_DAndrea/DFA The Distributed Flight Array] (2009)'''

The Distributed Flight Array is a modular robot consisting of hexagonal-shaped single-rotor units that can take on just about any shape or form. Although each unit is capable of generating enough thrust to lift itself off the ground, on its own it is incapable of flight much like a helicopter cannot fly without its tail rotor. However, when joined together, these units evolve into a sophisticated multi-rotor system capable of coordinated flight and much more. More information can be found [http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_DAndrea/DFA here].

'''[http://biorob.epfl.ch/roombots Roombots] (2009)'''

Roombots have a hybrid architecture. Each module has three degree of freedom, two of them using the diametrical axis within a regular cube, and a third (center) axis of rotation connecting the two spherical parts. All three axes are continuously rotatory. The outer Roombots DOF is using the same axis-orientation as Molecubes, the third, central Roombots axis enables the module to rotate its two outer DOF against each other. This novel feature enables a single Roombots module to locomote on flat terrain, but also to climb a wall, or to cross a concave, perpendicular edge. Convex edges require the assembly of at least two modules into a Roombots "Metamodule". Each module has ten available connector slots, currently two of them are equipped with an active connection mechanism based on mechanical latches.
Roombots are designed for two tasks: to eventually shape objects of daily life, e.g. furniture, and to locomote, e.g. as a quadruped or a tripod robot made from multiple modules.

Being inspired form social insects, multicellular organism and mophogenetic robots. The aim of the Sambot is to develop swarm robotics and  conduct research on the swarm intelligence, self-assembly and co-evolution of the body and brain for autonomous morphogeneous. Differing from swarm robot, self-reconfigurable robot and morphgenetic robot, the research focuses on self-assembly swarm modular robots that interact and dock as an autonomous mobile module with others to achieve swarm intelligence and furtherly discuss the autonomous construction in space station and exploratory tools and artificial complex structures. Each Sambot robot can run as an autonomous individual in wheel and besides, using combination of the sensors and docking mechanism, the robot can interact and dock with the environments and other robots. By the advantage of motion and connection, Sambot swarms can aggregate into a symbiotic or whole organism and generate locomotion as the bionic articular robots. In this case, some self-assembling, self-organizing, self-reconfiguring, and self-repairing function and research are available in design and application view. Inside the modular robot whose size is 80(W)X80(L)X102(H) mm, MCU (ARM and AVR), communication (Zigbee), sensors, power, IMU, positioning modules are embedded.

==Challenges, solutions, and opportunities==
Since the early demonstrations of early modular self-reconfiguring systems, the size, robustness and performance has been continuously improving. In parallel, planning and control algorithms have been progressing to handle thousands of units. There are, however, several key steps that are necessary for these systems to realize their promise of ''adaptability, robustness and low cost''. These steps can be broken down into challenges in the hardware design, in planning and control algorithms and in application. These challenges are often intertwined.

===Hardware design challenges===
The extent to which the promise of self-reconfiguring robotic systems can be realized depends critically on the numbers of modules in the system. To date, only systems with up to about 50 units have been demonstrated, with this number stagnating over almost a decade. There are a number of fundamental limiting factors that govern this number:

* Limits on strength, precision, and field robustness (both mechanical and electrical) of bonding/docking interfaces between modules
* Limits on motor power, motion precision and energetic efficiency of units, (i.e. specific power, specific torque)
* Hardware/software design. Hardware that is designed to make the software problem easier. Self-reconfiguring systems have more tightly coupled hardware and software than any other existing system.

===Planning and control challenges===
Though algorithms have been developed for handling thousands of units in ideal conditions, challenges to scalability remain both in low-level control and high-level planning to overcome realistic constraints:

* Algorithms for parallel-motion for large scale manipulation and locomotion
* Algorithms for robustly handling a variety of failure modes, from misalignments, dead-units (not responding, not releasing) to units that behave erratically.
* Algorithms that determine the optimal configuration for a given task
* Algorithms for optimal (time, energy) reconfiguration plan
* Efficient and scalable (asynchronous) communication among multiple units

===Application challenges===
Though the advantages of Modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems is largely recognized, it has been difficult to identify specific application domains where benefits can be demonstrated in the short term. Some suggested applications are

* [[Space exploration]] and [[Space colonization]] applications, e.g. [[Lunar colonization]]
* Construction of large architectural systems
* Deep sea exploration/mining
* Search and rescue in unstructured environments
* Rapid construction of arbitrary tools under space/weight constraints
* Disaster relief shelters for displaced peoples
* Shelters for impoverished areas which require little on-the-ground expertise to assemble

===Grand Challenges===
Several robotic fields have identified ''Grand Challenges'' that act as a catalyst for development and serve as a short-term goal in absence of immediate ''killer apps''. The Grand Challenge is not in itself a research agenda or milestone, but a means to stimulate and evaluate coordinated progress across multiple technical frontiers. Several Grand Challenges have been proposed for the modular self-reconfiguring robotics field:

* '''Demonstration of a system with &gt;1000 units'''. Physical demonstration of such a system will inevitably require rethinking key hardware and algorithmic issues, as well as handling noise and error.
* '''Robosphere'''. A self-sustaining robotic ecology, isolated for a long period of time (1 year) that needs to sustain operation and accomplish unforeseen tasks without ''any'' human presence.
* '''Self replication''' A system with many units capable of self replication by collecting scattered building blocks will require solving many of the hardware and algorithmic challenges.
* '''Ultimate Construction''' A system capable of making objects out of the components of, say, a wall.
* '''Biofilter analogy''' If the system is ever made small enough to be injected into a mammal, one task may be to monitor molecules in the blood stream and allow some to pass and others not to, somewhat like the [[blood–brain barrier]]. As a challenge, an analogy may be made where system must be able to:
** be inserted into a hole one module's diameter.
** travel some specified distance in a channel that is say roughly 40 x 40 module diameters in area.
** form a barrier fully conforming to the channel (whose shape is non-regular, and unknown beforehand).
** allow some objects to pass and others not to (not based on size).
** Since sensing is not the emphasis of this work, the actual detection of the passable objects should be made trivial.

===Inductive transducers===
A unique potential solution that can be exploited is the use of inductors as transducers. This could be useful for dealing with docking and bonding problems. At the same time it could also be beneficial for its capabilities of docking detection (alignment and finding distance), power transmission, and (data signal) communication. A proof-of-concept video can be seen 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEZcE3UjF2w here]. The rather limited exploration down this avenue is probably a consequence of the historical lack of need in any applications for such an approach.

===Google Groups===
[http://groups.google.com/group/selfreconfigurable Self-Reconfiguring and Modular Technology] is a group for discussion of the perception and understanding of the developing field.robotics.

[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/modular-robotics Modular Robotics Google Group] is an open public forum dedicated to announcements of events in the field of Modular Robotics. This medium is used to disseminate calls to workshops, special issues and other academic activities of interest to modular robotics researchers. The founders of this Google group intend it to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas within the community of modular robotics researchers around the world and thus promote acceleration of advancements in modular robotics. Anybody who is interested in objectives and progress of Modular Robotics can join this Google group and learn about the new developments in this field.

The '''Silent Sentinels''' were a group of women in favor of women's [[suffrage]] organized by [[Alice Paul]] and the [[National Woman's Party]]. They protested in front of the [[White House]] during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency starting on January 10, 1917.&lt;ref name="Stillion1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stillion Southard|first1=Belinda|title=The National Woman's Party and the Silent Sentinels|location=University of Maryland|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silent Sentinels started to protest after a meeting with the president on January 9, 1917, during which he told the women to "concert public opinion on behalf of women's suffrage."&lt;ref name="Stillion2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillion Southard|first1=Belinda A.|title=Militancy, power, and identity: The Silent Sentinels as women fighting for political voice|journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs|date=2007|volume=10|issue=3|pages=399–417|doi=10.1353/rap.2008.0003|jstor=41940153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters served as a constant reminder to Wilson of his lack of support for suffrage. At first the picketers were tolerated, but they were later arrested on charges of obstructing traffic.The women protested for six days a week until June 4, 1919 when the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was passed both by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

The name Silent Sentinels was given to the women because of their silent protesting. Using silence as a form of protest was a new principled, strategic, and rhetorical strategy within the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|national suffrage movement]] and within their own assortment of protest strategies.&lt;ref name="Stillion2"/&gt;

Throughout this two and a half year long vigil many of the nearly 2,000 women&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/tactics-and-techniques-of-the-national-womans-party-suffrage-campaign/|title=Tactics and Techniques of the National Woman's Party Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who picketed were harassed, arrested, and unjustly treated by local and US authorities, including the torture and abuse inflicted on them before and during the November 14, 1917 Night of Terror.

==Background==
The Silent Sentinels' protests were organized by the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), a militant women's suffrage organization. The NWP was first founded as the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS) in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] following the Congressional Committee's woman suffrage parade in 1913.&lt;ref name="Stillion3" /&gt; CUWS by definition was an organization that took a militant approach to women's suffrage and broke away from the more moderate [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).&lt;ref name=Stillion3&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUWS only lasted for three years until its founders merged it with the Woman's Party to form the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref name=Stillion3/&gt; The [[National Woman's Party]] boasted fewer members than [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]](having 50,000 members to NAWSA's 2 million),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but its tactics were more attention-grabbing and harnessed more media coverage. The NWP's members are known primarily for picketing the White House and going on hunger strikes while in the workhouses.

==The Suffragist==
''[[The Suffragist]]'' was the [[National Woman's Party]] weekly newsletter. ''The Suffragist'' acted as a voice for the Silent Sentinels throughout their vigil. It covered the Sentinels' progress and included interviews with protesters, reports on President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s (non) reaction, and political essays.&lt;ref name ="Stillion1" /&gt; While the Sentinels were in prison, a few meters wrote about their experiences which were later posted in ''The Suffragist''. "Although The Suffragist was intended for mass circulation, its subscription peaked at just over 20,000 issues in 1917. Further, most copies went to party members, advertisers, branch headquarters, and NWP organizers, which strongly suggests that the [[suffragists]] themselves were a key audience of the publication."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

==Banners==
[[File:Suffragette banner carried in picket of the White House.jpg|thumb|A Sentinel with a banner]]

The following are examples of banners held by the women:
* "Mr. President, what will you do for woman suffrage?"&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;
* "Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?"&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;
* "We shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Woodrow. Address to Joint Session of Congress. Congress. Washington D.C.. 2 April 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Democracy Should Begin at Home"
* "The time has come to conquer or submit, for us there can be but one choice. We have made it." (another quotation from Wilson)
* "Kaiser Wilson, have you forgotten your sympathy with the poor Germans because they were not self-governed? 20,000,000 American women are not self-governed. Take the beam out of your own eye." (comparing Wilson to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany, and to a famous quote of [[Jesus]] regarding hypocrisy)
* "Mr. President, you say liberty is the fundamental demand of the human spirit."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt; 
* "Mr. President, you say we are interested in the United States, politically speaking, in nothing but human liberty."&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

The Sentinels all wore purple, white, and gold sashes which are the NWP's colors. Their banners were also usually colored this way.&lt;ref name=Stillion2 /&gt;

==Responses==
The public's responses to the Silent Sentinels were varied.

Some people wholeheartedly approved of the work Silent Sentinels were performing. Men and women present at the scene of the [[White House]] showed their support for the Sentinels by bringing them hot drinks and hot bricks to stand on. Sometimes, women would even assist in holding up the banners. Other ways of showing support included writing letters praising the Sentinels to The Suffragist and donating money.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Woman's Crusade: Alice Paul and the Battle for the Ballot|last=Walton|first=Mary|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-61175-7|location=New York, NY|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some disapproved of Silent Sentinels' protests. This included some of the more moderate suffragists. For example, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]- then the leader of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] believed that the best way to realize women's suffrage was to gain the vote through individual states first, upon which women could vote for a pro-suffrage majority in Congress. She thus opposed advocating for a national amendment to grant women's suffrage, as the Sentinels did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Members of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] feared that pickets would create a backlash from male voters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Anti-suffragists also opposed the Silent Sentinels' protest. Mobs sometimes attempted to deter the Silent Sentinels through violence (which increased after US entry into [[World War I]]). For example, some attacked the Silent Sentinels and tore their banners to shreds. This occurred especially with the more provocative banners, such as banners calling [[Woodrow Wilson]] "Kaiser Wilson."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The New York Times called the protests "silent, silly, and offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Sentinels|url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/3/2/silent-sentinels |website=The Attic|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men hurled insults or rotten fruit.

At first President Wilson was not very responsive to the women's protest. At points he even seemed amused with it by tipping his hat and smiling. It was said that at one point Wilson even invited them in for coffee.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson: A Portrait : Women's Suffrage|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wilson/portrait/wp_suffrage.html|website=PBS|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other points in time, he ignored the protests altogether, such as when the Sentinels protested on the day of his second inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Sentinels continued to protest, the issue became bigger and Wilson's opinion began to change. Although he continued to dislike the Silent Sentinels, he began to recognize them as a group seriously presenting him with an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Militant Citizenship: Rhetorical Strategies of the National Woman's Party, 1913–1920|last=Stillion Southard|first=Belinda A.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60344-281-7|location=College Station, TX|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occoquan Workhouse and the Night of Terror==
[[File:F B Hilles152007v.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Bayard Hilles]], chairman of the Delaware Branch of the [[National Woman's Party|NWP]] and member of the national executive committee, was arrested picketing the [[White House]] July 13, 1917, sentenced to 60 days in [[Occoquan Workhouse]]. She was pardoned by President Wilson after serving three days of her term.]]

On June 22, 1917, police arrested protesters [[Lucy Burns]] and Katherine Morey on charges of obstructing traffic because they carried a banner quoting from Wilson's speech to Congress: "We shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments." On June 25, 12 women were arrested, including [[Mabel Vernon]] and [[Annie Arniel]] from [[Delaware]], again on charges of obstructing traffic. They were sentenced to three days in jail or to pay a $10 fine. They chose jail because they wanted to show commitment to their cause and their willingness to sacrifice their physical bodies. On July 14, 16 women, including [[Florence Bayard Hilles]], [[Alison Turnbull Hopkins]], and [[Elizabeth Selden Rogers]] (of the politically powerful Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family) were arrested and sentenced to 60 days in jail or to pay a $25 fine.&lt;ref name="Freedom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Doris|title=Jailed for Freedom|date=1920|publisher=Liverright Publishing|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the women chose jail. Lucy Burns argued that the women should be treated as political prisoners, but Wilson denied this request.

When the women arrived at the [[Occoquan Workhouse]] (now the [[Lorton Correctional Complex]]) they were asked to give up everything except for their clothing. They were then taken to a showering station where they were ordered to strip naked and bathe. There was only one bar of soap available for everyone in the workhouse to use, so all of the suffragists refused to use it. Afterwards they were given baggy, unclean, and uncomfortable prison clothes and taken to dinner. They could barely eat dinner because it was so sour and distasteful.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;
 
The conditions of the Occoquan Workhouse were very unsanitary and unsafe. Prisoners had to share cells and many other things with those who had [[syphilis]], and worms were frequently found in their food.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

After serving three days in the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia, Wilson pardoned the women. At first they refused to be pardoned because they were innocent and had nothing to be pardoned for, but they were eventually forced out.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; After a heated debate, the House of Representatives created a committee to deal with women's suffrage in September 1917. Massachusetts Representative [[Joseph Walsh (Massachusetts)|Joseph Walsh]] opposed the creation of the committee, thinking the House was yielding to "the nagging of iron-jawed angels." He referred to the Silent Sentinels as "bewildered, deluded creatures with short skirts and short hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HOUSE MOVES FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE; Adopts by 181 to 107 Rule to Create a Committee to Deal with the Subject. DEBATE A HEATED ONE Annoyance of President by Pickets at White House Denounced as "Outlawry."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1917/09/25/archives/house-moves-for-woman-suffrage-adopts-by-181-to-107-rule-to-create.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 25, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the suffragists kept protesting, the jail terms grew longer. Finally, police arrested [[Alice Paul]] on October 20, 1917, while she carried a banner that quoted Wilson: "The time has come to conquer or submit, for us there can be but one choice. We have made it." She was sentenced to seven months in prison. Paul and many others were again sent to the Occoquan Workhouse, where Paul was placed in [[solitary confinement]] for two weeks, with nothing to eat except bread and water. She became weak and unable to walk, so she was taken to the prison hospital. There, she began a [[hunger strike]], and others joined her.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

In response to the hunger strike the prison doctors force fed the women by putting tubes down their throats.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt; They force fed them substances that would have as much protein as possible, like raw eggs mixed with milk. Many of the women ended up vomiting because their stomachs could not handle the protein. One physician reported that Alice Paul had "a spirit like [[Joan of Arc]], and it is useless to try to change it. She will die but she will never give up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nardo|first1=Don|title=The Split History of the Women's Suffrage Movement: A Perspective Flip Book|date=1947|publisher=Capstone|location=Stevens Point, WI|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Burns suffered injuries from force feeding, so after the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, she was unable to continue to work with Paul.

On the night of November 14, 1917, known as the "Night of Terror", the superintendent of the Occoquan Workhouse, W.H. Whittaker, ordered the nearly forty guards to brutalize the suffragists. They beat [[Lucy Burns]], chained her hands to the cell bars above her head, then left her there for the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mickenberg|first1=Julia L.|title=Suffragettes and Soviets: American Feminists and the Spector of Revolutionary Russia|journal=Journal of American History|date=2014|volume=100|issue=4|page=1041|doi=10.1093/jahist/jau004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They threw [[Dora Lewis]] into a dark cell and smashed her head against an iron bed, which knocked her out. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, who believed Lewis to be dead, suffered a heart attack. [[Dorothy Day]], who later co-founded the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], was slammed repeatedly over the back of an iron bench. Guards grabbed, dragged, beat, choked, pinched, and kicked other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|title=Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten|journal=Public Policy|date=2004|volume=415|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers carried stories about how the protesters were being treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E5D7113AE433A25756C2A9679D946696D6CF|title=Move Militants from Workhouse|date=November 25, 1917|work=The New York Times|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories angered some Americans and created more support for the suffrage amendment. On November 27 and 28, all the protesters were released, including Alice Paul after spending five weeks in prison. Later, in March 1918, the [[D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated six suffragists' convictions.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hunter_v._District_of_Columbia ''Hunter v. District of Columbia''], 47 App. D.C. 406 (D.C. Cir. 1918).&lt;/Ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459608 Collins, Representing Injustice: Justice as an Icon of Woman Suffrage]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the [[Information (formal criminal charge)|informations]] on which the women's convictions were based were overly vague.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;

==Decision==
On January 9, 1918, Wilson announced his support of the women's suffrage amendment. The next day, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the amendment but the Senate refused to even debate it until October. When the Senate voted on the amendment in October, it failed by two votes. And in spite of the ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arrests of White House protesters resumed on August 6, 1918.

To keep up the pressure, on December 16, 1918, protesters started burning Wilson's words in watch fires in front of the White House. On February 9, 1919, the protesters burned Wilson's image in [[effigy]] at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Phillip Edward|title=Prison Narratives from Boethius to Zena|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian|location=New York, NY|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another front, the National Woman's Party, led by Paul, urged citizens to vote against anti-suffrage senators up for election in the fall of 1918. After the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1918|1918 election]], most members of Congress were pro-suffrage. On May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives passed the amendment, and two weeks later on June 4, the Senate finally followed. With their work done in Congress, the protesters turned their attention to getting the states to ratify the amendment.

It was ratified on August 18, 1920, upon its ratification by Tennessee, the thirty-sixth state to do so by the single vote of a legislator ([[Harry T. Burn]]) who had opposed the amendment but changed his position after his mother sent him a telegram saying "Dear Son, Hurrah! and vote for suffrage. Don't forget to be a good boy and help [[Carrie Chapman Catt|Mrs. Catt]] put the 'rat' in ratification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A '''tape diagram''', also known as a '''bar model''', is a pictorial representation of [[ratio]]s. In [[mathematics education]], it is used to solve [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Lisa Watts-Lawton and Colleen Sheeron |title=Eureka Math Curriculum Guide: A Story of Units, Grade 2 yes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 |year=2015 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-81261-7 |page=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So lets do this problem that has been given to us by teachers all around. ''A boy has won 15 games, for every 3 games that he wins, he loses 2, how many games has the little boy lost?''

==Example==

A math problem reads: A boy has won 15 games. His ratio for him is 3:2. The tape diagram would look something like this:

{| class="ckckck m 
| 
| style="background: #ccccff;" | ?
| style="background: #ccccff;" | ?
| style="background: #ffffff;" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
! colspan="4" | Total games lost = ?
|}
Using the above diagram, it can be concluded that the boy has lost 10 playing times.{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

==How does the tape diagram work==
The tape diagram works by showing different ratios. In the example before it shows how a boy has won 15 games. So if his win to loss ratio is 3:2 it would look like this. How many games has he lost?(3x5)

Now how did you get those three 5s you ask.
{|
! colsepan="4" | Total games won = 15
|-
! Win
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| 
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" |5
| style="background: #ffffff;" | fh&amp;nbsp;
|-
! colsepan="4" | Total games lost = ?
|}

So the answer to how many games did he lose is 10. Because 5+5=10

'''Teen dating violence''' is the [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] / [[emotional abuse|emotional]] [[abuse]] (or [[violence]]) within a dating relationship among adolescents.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | last = CDC | author-link = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Teen dating violence | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = June 29, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) has been a well examined and documented phenomenon in adults; however, there has not been nearly as much study on violence in adolescent dating relationships, and it is therefore not as well understood. The research has mainly focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chu | first1 = Ann T. | last2 = Sundermann | first2 = Jane M. | last3 = DePrince | first3 = Anne P. | contribution = Intimate partner violence in adolescent romantic relationships | editor-last1 = Donohue | editor-first1 = William T. | editor-last2 = Benuto | editor-first2 = Lorraine T. | editor-last3 = Woodward Tolle | editor-first3 = Lauren | title = Handbook of adolescent health psychology | page = 193 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781461466338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=KX29BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescents is an important realm of study as, in addition to the usual negative effects of abuse, this violence occurs at a critical period in the social and mental development of a person.  This is also an important topic from a [[gender studies]] perspective as almost 32% of male adolescents engage in some form of violence, whether sexual, physical or emotional, towards their partners while adolescent violence from females is nearly half of that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Peralta | first2 = Robert | title = The relationship between drinking and violence in an adolescent population: does gender matter? | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1080/016396202317192008 | date = January 2002 | ref = harv }} [http://www3.uakron.edu/publications/relationshiprp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United States public health authority, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "[a]dolescents and adults are often unaware that teens experience dating violence."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==Gender differences==
{{see also|Domestic violence#Gender differences}}
The literature on IPV among adolescents indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Knox | first1 = Lyndee | last2 = Lomonaco | first2 = Carmela | last3 = Alpert | first3 = Elaine | contribution = Adolescent relationship violence | editor-last1 = Mitchell | editor-first1 = Connie | editor-last2 = Anglin | editor-first2 = Deirdre | title = Intimate partner violence: a health-based perspective | pages = 514, 516 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199720729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q04QO7UmyowC&amp;pg=PA514 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jessica R. | last2 = Ghandour | first2 = Reem M. | last3 = Kub | first3 = Joan E. | title = Female perpetration of violence in heterosexual intimate relationships: adolescence through adulthood | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–249 | doi = 10.1177/1524838008324418 | pmc = 2663360 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv | pmid=18936281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard adolescent dating violence, and that this is "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ely | first1 = Gretchen | last2 = Dulmus | first2 = Catherine N. | last3 = Wodarski | first3 = John S. | contribution = Adolescent dating violence | editor-last1 = Rapp-Paglicci | editor-first1 = Lisa A. | editor-last2 = Roberts | editor-first2 = Albert R. | editor-last3 = Wodarski | editor-first3 = John S. | title = Handbook of violence | page = 36 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780471214441 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtOvUULaNZEC&amp;pg=PA36 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" and that this "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"/&gt;

Regarding studies that indicate that girls are as likely or more likely than boys to commit IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences exist between the genders, including that girls are significantly more likely than boys to report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more likely than boys to need  psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence as a part of dating violence. They are also more likely to take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more likely to report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more likely to report committing less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more likely to report committing more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; That girls are more likely to engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{citation | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Katie M. | last2 = Dardis | first2 = Christina M. | last3 = Gidycz | first3 = Christine A. | contribution = The role of victimization experiences in adolescent girls and young women's aggression in dating relationships | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 2, Part I. Impact of teen violence on adolescents, family, and peers | pages = 71–82 | publisher = Praeger | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780313393761 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and [[self-efficacy]]; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

==Controversies and arguments==
There is a common misconception that aggression is stable over time. That is, young people who are labeled as or considered to be violent and aggressive at any point in time are then assumed to be dangerous for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loeber | first1 = Rolf | last2 = Stouthamer-Loeber | first2 = Magda | title = Development of juvenile aggression and violence: some common misconceptions and controversies | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–259 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.242 | pmid = 9491750 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contentious issue because there is a desire to protect both parties involved (or that have the potential to become involved) in teen dating violence. While classifying the perpetrator as a threat may be detrimental to his or her life and future relationships, not classifying the perpetrator this way may put future partners at risk.

There is considerable debate over whether we as a society have an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of teen dating violence by gender. It is important to note that although male and female adolescents do not differ in "overall frequency of violence in dating relationships," females are subject to "significantly higher levels of severe violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molidor | first1 = Christian | last2 = Tolman | first2 = Richard M. | title = Gender and contextual factors in adolescent dating violence | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–194 | doi = 10.1177/1077801298004002004 | pmid = 12295440 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact begs the question of whether abuse should be evaluated based on “severity” and how that can and should be measured, or if all abuse should be considered equally harmful.

[[Age of consent]] is an issue that cannot be ignored in the discussion of teenage dating violence. Teenage sex is regulated in such a way that "age of consent laws render teenagers below a certain age incapable of consent to sexual activity with adults, and sometimes with peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sutherland | first = Kate | title = From jailbird to jailbait: age of consent laws and the construction of teenage sexualities | journal = [[William &amp; Mary Law School#Law journals|William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–349 | ssrn = 1586883 | date = Spring 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmjwl9&amp;div=20 | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=wmjowl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the adult may be just a few months older than the minor. There are a number of states in which "age of consent statutes are used to prosecute consensual sex between two persons both under the age of consent." This type of prosecution has been deemed unconstitutional in some states by citing violation of privacy rights, but remains in effect in other states. Sexual behavior and aggression can be so deeply intertwined that the legality of underage consensual sex is sure to have an effect on teen dating violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Nature vs. nurture==
{{OR section|date=September 2015}}
Significant research has been done on the causes behind violent behavior in adolescent dating relationships with the intention of guiding the creation of dating violence prevention programs, and in turn has provided findings on the roles of nature and nurture in the development of such behavior with a strong favor towards nurture factors. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the potential association between a spectrum of childhood adverse experiences and physical violence in relationships before age 21 for both members. The subjects were asked questions about violence in their adolescent relationships, as either victim or perpetrator, and their childhood surrounding twelve different adversities: parental death, parental divorce, long-term separation from parent, parental mental illness, parental substance abuse disorder, parental criminality, inter-parental violence, serious physical illness in childhood, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and family economic adversity. The results demonstrated a strong positive correlation between ten out of the twelve childhood adversities and physically violent behavior in a teen relationship, with 13.8% responding with experiences of sexual violence, and 11.6% experiencing inter-parental violence. This points to a strong influence of experience, or nature, on violent tendencies in adolescent relationships. Multiple other studies corroborate these findings, citing childhood bullying, assault, and maltreatment as significant indicators for future violence in adolescent dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Breslau | first2 = Joshua | last3 = Chung | first3 = W.J. Joanie | last4 = Green | first4 = Jennifer Greif | last5 = McLaughlin | first5 = Katie A. | last6 = Kessler | first6 = Ronald C. | title = Adverse childhood experiences and risk of physical violence in adolescent dating relationships | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 65 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–1013 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2009.105429 | pmid = 21321063 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | pmc=3686487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been little explicit study of the relationship between nature and teen dating violence, there has been proven correlation between testosterone levels and violent tendencies that could come to fruition in adolescent dating relationships. Higher testosterone levels “manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence.”  A study published in the International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reported, “Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.” However, the study also noted that many cases of high testosterone levels are disarmed through socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–568 | doi = 10.5812/ijem.3661 | pmc = 3693622 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=23843821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, because children are exposed to relationships early in their life through their parents and being so malleable at a young age, most evidence points to an adverse experience or experiences in childhood as fodder for such behavior in adolescence.

==Prevalence and approaches==
The literature on IPV among adolescents primarily focuses on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;

====Statistics====
While dating, domestic and sexual violence affect women regardless of their age, teens and young women are especially vulnerable. Young people ages 12 to 19 experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Truman | first1 = Jennifer L. | last2 = Rand | first2 = Michael R. | title = Criminal victimization, 2009 | url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv09.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2010 }} {{NCJ|231327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people age 18 and 19 experience the highest rates of stalking. Approximately one in three adolescent girls in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner—a figure that far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence affecting youth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Antoinette | title = Interpersonal and physical dating violence among teens | journal = The National Council on Crime and Delinquency Focus | date = September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425153501/http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]], former Wisconsin Representative said "if the numbers we see in domestic violence (dating violence) were applied to terrorism or gang violence, the entire country would be up in arms, and it would be the lead story on the news every night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Savacool | first = Julia | title = Our most important mission ever: stop violence against women now | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/domestic-violence-stop | work = [[Marie Claire]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | date = 10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Women's Health'', "81% of parents surveyed either believed dating violence is not an issue or admit they don't know if it's an issue",&lt;ref name=UMHS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = Who's affected by dating violence? | journal = Women's Health | page = 3 | date = June–July 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905041051/http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | archive-date = 5 September 2008 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | ref = harv }} Sources: [[Futures Without Violence|Family Violence Prevention Fund]] and [[Advocates for Youth]]&lt;/ref&gt; this is concerning because of the growth of dating abuse in teenagers relationships.&lt;ref name=UMHS /&gt; Dating violence has advanced{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} through the years by the means of communication technology.  A survey conducted by Teenage Research Unlimited stated that "[10] percent of teens have been threatened physically via e-mail, IM, text messaging, chat rooms, etc."

A 2008 [[meta-analysis]], which examined 62 [[empirical research]] studies between 1996 and 2006, relating to domestic violence in heterosexual intimate relationships from adolescence through to adulthood in the United States, reported on research findings that consistently show that adolescent females commit significantly more acts of domestic violence in intimate relationships than adolescent males. It stated, however, that the "data also suggest that females who commit acts of domestic violence may experience more violent or frequent IPV victimization than males" and that "[t]he highest rates [for female-perpetrated IPV] were found for emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Prevalence rates varied widely within each population, most likely due to methodological and sampling differences across studies." The authors added, "Few longitudinal studies existed, limiting the extent to which we could identify developmental patterns associated with female perpetrated intimate partner violence." They found a few studies which reported prevalence rates of IPV perpetration among females at two or more time points, which they stated made "it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the developmental patterns associated with this type of violence." There was also only one study that reported on prevalence rates over time for female perpetrated IPV among adolescents. "This study found a significant increase in prevalence over a six month period; however, they measured lifetime perpetration of IPV, therefore, it is unclear if there was an actual increase or simply an accumulation of violence," stated the authors. "Together, these studies provide very limited evidence that female perpetration of IPV may follow a similar developmental trajectory as other forms of violence. [...] Unfortunately, many of the studies included in this review used modified or alternative instruments making it difficult to accurately compare prevalence estimates."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In a 2009 survey, the CDC found that 9.8% of high school students in the U.S. reported having been intentionally physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend in the preceding 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; A 2011 CDC nationwide survey of the U.S. population reported that 23% of females and 14% of males who ever experienced rape, other physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner first experienced some form of partner violence between 11 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The ages between 16 and 24 are when youth are the most susceptible to dating violence. Also, according to the CDC, one in ten teens will be physically abused between seventh and twelfth grade. Because of this abuse, victims are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, employ precarious sexual conduct, develop eating disorders, and attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The above numbers are notable in their magnitude and in their discrepancy, indicating that at some point between birth and high school a huge number of males are learning that it is useful and acceptable to abuse their dating partners in some way. The reciprocal of males learning violent behaviors is that women are not learning this fact and are instead learning through our culture and through violence directed at them that they are to be submissive. Males learning violent behaviors coupled with females thinking it normative creates a cycle of women being abused, learning to accept it and imparting this idea to their children and repeating the process. According to a study conducted by Susan M. Sanders she found that many adolescents do not always view aggressive behavior as violent or abusive and roughly 77.6% young girls agreed that after a physical altercation such as being kicked by their partner that they would cease to date them. The study conducted demonstrated that many adolescents, primarily females were more susceptible to leave only after a physical altercation took place. With these studies it was found that once a physical altercation took place the victim  would then view it as abusive and eventually desire to leave the relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Susan, M. S.(2003) Teen Dating Violence: The Invisible Peril. New York. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent dating violence is a subject which must be understood in order for true equality between the sexes to be achieved and to help stop partner violence in adults before it occurs.

====Legislation====
In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) states that "[p]olicymakers can play a role in preventing teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web | title = Teen dating violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609073629/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/teen-dating-violence.aspx | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url = http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=17582 | website = ncsl.org | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | date = May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists those states that currently have laws requiring school boards to develop and adopt programs to address this issue. Further, according to NCSL "[i]n 2011 at least eight states have introduced legislation to address teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; On January 31, 2011, President Obama proclaimed February 2011 to be "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = President of the United States | author-link = President of the United States | title = Presidential proclamation--National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/31/presidential-proclamation-national-teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-pr | website = whitehouse.gov | publisher = [[White House]] | date = 31 January 2011 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. first recognized "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week", sponsored by Senator [[Mike Crapo]], to "increase public awareness and education of the prevalence of teen dating violence among our nation's teens".&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite web | last = Crapo | first = Mike (Sen.) | author-link = Mike Crapo | title = Teen dating violence awareness week | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130219164115/http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | archive-date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | website = crapo.senate.gov | date = 19 February 2013 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first week in February was so recognized through 2009. Beginning in 2010, Senator Crapo joined the Department of Justice in recognizing the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

====National helpline and organizations====
The National Dating Abuse Helpline, created by [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]], is a 24-hour nationwide Web-based and telephone resource created to help teens and young people who are experiencing dating abuse. They offer information on building healthy relationships and how to recognize warning signs. It is the only helpline in the country serving all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hingorani | first = Jitin | title = New national teen dating abuse helpline to provide urgent support for teens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090214073216/http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | archive-date = 14 February 2009 | url = http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | website = jwi.org | publisher = Resources, Training &amp; Education: Domestic Violence Newsletters, Jewish Women International | date = March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anatomy of Power''''' is a [[1983 in literature|1983]] book by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[economist]] [[John Kenneth Galbraith]].  It sought to classify three types of power: ''compensatory power'' in which submission is bought, ''condign power'' in which submission is won by making the alternative sufficiently painful, and ''conditioned power'' in which submission is gained by persuasion.  In short; money, force and ideology.

It further divided power by source: power either stems from ''personality'' or leadership, ''property'' or wealth, or ''organisation''.

The book goes on to detail a brief history of the use of power, noting the broad arc of history in moving away from condign and towards compensatory and then conditioned power, and from personality and property towards organisation.  Finally, it details what Galbraith views as the main sources of power in the modern world: government, the military, religion and the press.

'''The Summerland''' is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater" /&gt; [[Wicca]]ns and some earth-based [[Modern paganism|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-summerland-2562874| title=What is the Summerland?|author=Patti Wigington|date=March 19, 2018|publisher=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesterbear.com/Wicca/FAQsummerland.html|title=FAQ:What is the Summerland? Do you think it is a real place?|author=Myth Woodling|date=March 23, 2014|work=Yet Another Wicca...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary|Summerland}}

==History of the concept==
[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'', to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of human spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or 'sphere', of the afterlife we can hope to enter.

[[C.W. Leadbeater]], a Theosophist, also taught that those who were good in their previous earthly [[incarnation]] went to a place called Summerland between incarnations.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W  ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy==
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the [[Astral plane]] Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. 

Theosophists believe the Summerlands are maintained by hosts of [[Deva (New Age)|planetary angels]] serving [[Sanat Kumara]], the [[Nordic alien]] from [[Venusians|Venus]] who Theosophists believe is the governing [[deity]] of Earth and leader of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth. Sanat Kumara is believed to rule over our planet from the [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] of [[Shamballa]], believed by Theosophists to exist on the etheric plane (a plane between the [[physical plane]] and the astral plane), about five miles (8 km) above the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt;

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the [[Mental plane]] Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations — only those souls that are more highly developed [[Spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, i.e., those souls that are at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|first, second, and third levels of initiation]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt;

The final permanent eternal afterlife heaven to which Theosophists believe most people will go millions or billions of years in the future, after our cycle of reincarnations in this [[Round (Theosophy)|Round]] is over, is called [[Nirvana]], and is located beyond this physical [[Cosmos]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt; In order to attain Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fourth level of initiation]] or higher, meaning one is an ''[[arhat]]'' and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

[[File:Time's Paces.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The poem as it appears in the book ''Hymns and Other Stray Verses'' (1901)&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Time's Paces''' is a poem about the apparent speeding up of time as one gets older. It was written by [[Henry Twells]] (1823–1900) and published in his book ''Hymns and Other Stray Verses'' (1901). The poem was popularised by [[Guy Pentreath]] (1902–1985) in an amended version. Pentreath saw the poem ''Time's Paces'' attached to a clock case in the North Transept of [[Chester Cathedral]] where it is to be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;See this ChesterTourist.com website: http://www.chestertourist.com/cathedral.htm ''Retrieved 2012.02.22.'' Photographs of the clock and the poem are to be found by scrolling down this large collection of photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the poem was even set to music.&lt;ref&gt;See this 'Chester on the web' site about the restoration of the clock and the use of the song to mark its re-dedication. {{cite web |url=http://www.chesterontheweb.com/chester/94-chester-cathedral-events/473-chester-cathedral-clock-restored.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125094048/http://www.chesterontheweb.com/chester/94-chester-cathedral-events/473-chester-cathedral-clock-restored.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} ''Retrieved 2012-02-22.''&lt;/ref&gt; Pentreath quoted his version of the poem in his last sermon at [[Wrekin College]], [[Shropshire]] where he was headmaster till 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Information supplied by e-mail by the Assistant Archivist at [[Cheltenham College]] in [[Gloucestershire]] where Pentreath was headmaster from 1952 to 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; His version then entered the public domain. Perhaps he wrote the poem down from memory and reconstructed it in the process. He may not have consciously intended to improve on Twells' version.

The last four lines of Pentreath's version were missed out in [[Gerald James Whitrow|Whitrow's]] quotation in his book, ''The Natural Philosophy of Time'' and in some quotations in other books. The first sentence also begins with "For" as in "For when I was a babe . . ." This was added by [[Gerald James Whitrow|Whitrow]] who may have received the poem orally or informally from Pentreath since he gives no reference source for the poem in his otherwise well referenced book.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Gerald James Whitrow|G.J. Whitrow]], '' The Natural Philosophy of Time'', Oxford: the Clarendon Press, 1st ed. 1961, 2nd ed. 1980, Ch. 2, p.63, and also in his later book: ''The Nature of Time'', London: Penguin, 1975, p. 39. Whitrow's shortened version also appears in ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]], Oxford: OUP, 1988, p. 641, but it is wrongly attributed to [[Henry Twells]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''Transmodernity''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept used by the Spanish philosopher and feminist [[Rosa María Rodríguez Magda]] in her 1989 essay ''La sonrisa de Saturno: Hacia una teoría transmoderna''. Her approach, based on [[Hegel]]ian logic, views [[modernity]], [[postmodernity]], and transmodernity as a [[dialectic]] triad in which transmodernity is critical of both [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]], but incorporates elements of both.&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, John (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3XAHXFpPYSIC&amp;pg=PA283 ''Philosophical Issues in Tourism''], p. 283. Channel View Publications. {{ISBN|1845412494}},&lt;/ref&gt;
Transmodernism, as first identified in the philosophical work of Rodriguez (2004), is an umbrella term that connotes the emerging socio-cultural, economic, political and philosophical shift way beyond postmodernity (Ateljevic, 2013:200) which is much more wide, deep and radical than what dominant economists and politicians call globalization (Ghisi, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Ateljevic, I. (2013). Visions of transmodernity: A new renaissance of our human history. Integral Review, 9(2), 200-219.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other interpretations on this term have been elaborated in conjunction with the cultural movement of [[transmodernism]] founded by Argentinian-Mexican philosopher [[Enrique Dussel]]. The concept of transmodernity has also been used to re-work the notion of postmodernity, highlighting its structural relation to globalization and informatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], a sentence which asserts incomplete truth conditions for a proposition may be regarded as a truism.{{cn|date=June 2017}} An example of such a sentence would be "Under appropriate conditions, the sun rises."  Without contextual support{{spaced ndash}}a statement of what those appropriate conditions are{{spaced ndash}}the sentence is true but incontestable. A statement which is true by definition (for example, the [[Lapalissade]] "If he were not dead, he would still be alive") would also be considered a truism.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The word may also be used with a different sense in [[rhetoric]], to disguise the fact that a proposition is really just an [[opinion]].{{Example needed}} {{cn|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6430">The '''Unified Soil Classification System''' ('''USCS''') is a [[soil classification]] system used in [[engineering]] and [[geology]] to describe the [[Texture (geology)|texture]] and [[Particle size|grain size]] of a [[soil]]. The classification system can be applied to most [[unconsolidated]] materials, and is represented by a two-letter symbol. Each letter is described below (with the exception of '''Pt'''):

&lt;!-- Two tables side-by-side --&gt;
{|
! First and/or second letters
! Second letter
|-align="center" valign="top"
|&lt;!-- First table --&gt;
{|class="wikitable"

! Letter

! G

|-
! S

|-
! M
| [[silt]]
|-
! C

|-
! O

|}
|&lt;!-- Second table --&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Letter
! Definition
|-
! P
| poorly graded (uniform particle sizes)
|-
! W
| well-graded (diversified particle sizes)
|-
! H
| high [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]
|-
! L
| low plasticity
|}
|}&lt;!-- End of tables --&gt;

If the soil has 5–12% by weight of fines passing a #200 sieve (5% &lt; P&lt;sub&gt;#200&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 12%), both grain size distribution and plasticity have a significant effect on the engineering properties of the soil, and dual notation may be used for the group symbol. For example, GW-GM corresponds to "well-graded gravel ''with silt''."

If the soil has more than 15% by weight retained on a #4 sieve (R&lt;sub&gt;#4&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 15%), there is a significant amount of gravel, and the suffix "with gravel" may be added to the group name, but the group symbol does not change. For example, SP-SM could refer to "poorly graded SAND with silt" or  "poorly graded SAND with silt and gravel."
