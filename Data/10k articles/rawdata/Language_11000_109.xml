'''Abdur Rouf Choudhury''' (1 March 1929 – 1996) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] writer. 

==Early life==
Choudhury was born on 1 March 1929, in [[Habiganj District]], Bangladesh (then  part of [[Assam]]) where his father Azhar Choudhury, a land owner, and his mother Nazmun Nesa Choudhury, a house wife resided.

==Contributions==
In his contributions to [[Bengali literature]], the writer and philosopher Choudhury depicted a transparent portrait of modern Bengali's life in abroad. He was a scholar of science, with great intellectual abilities and eloquent of both pen and speech. He had a remarkable openness to modern [[Western culture|Western]] knowledge as well as [[Eastern world|Eastern]] knowledge. Choudhury made a lasting contribution to Bengali literature with his novels, travelogue, essays and his introspective autobiographical and [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] works.&lt;ref name="Sharak 1, Dhaka, 1998"&gt;Sharak 1, Dhaka, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

His novels and short stories were often set against an emergent urban background, but more commonly in cities outside Bangladesh such as London, [[Bedford]], Calcutta, Karachi and [[Kohat]]; where the majority of immigrant Bengali resided. Choudhury created his characters from highly diverse backgrounds and developed themes that revolved around the twists and turns of events, the conflicts and contradictions prevailing in the social processes. His characters embraced a new change; death of an old social values which were based on the ideas of corruptions, religious, political, economical; and the rise of the self-freedom, birth of a new society, these immediately preceded the social processes of the present day and hence are vital to identifying and understanding contemporary problems.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"&gt;Jibani Granthamala: A Series of Literary biographies, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, Feb 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential to analyses Choudhury's writings in the light of the social scenario from 60s-90s, when deprivation and degradation were taken for granted in Bangladesh, London and India-Pakistan which were known by some and unknown by others. These realities some times were dedicated and made indelible in the name of religious sermons and social sanctions. Thus his main task was to focus readers' attention, by giving a frame-by-frame picture of the helplessness and inhuman predicament of the victims of injustice.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;LIVING IN A FARAWAY LAND, Junaidul Haque, Dhaka, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''[[Porodeshe Porobashi]]''' (Life on Distant Shores), Chowdhury has not only discovered London, where he stayed with fellow Sylhetis, but also discovered his own homeland. When you are far away, when you are detached from your object of love, your inner eye gets working and you discovery the truth. This discovery is ugly from a close look but is beautiful and lovable when seen from a distance. Most of us who stay in our homeland fail to take a close look at it. But the novelist succeeds in discovering his own land while staying overseas and thinking of it and loving it. Reality and nostalgia get mixed with each other to form a perfect image of the writer's homeland in his mind. '''Porodeshe Porobashi''' is a quality work of art by any standard. The writer is a powerful narrator and uses wit and humour quite deftly. He is a skilful user of words. The writer depends on autobiographical elements and has a philosophical outlook. He clearly understood the psyche of Bangladeshis staying abroad. He dips deep into the human mind, as he has written elsewhere about the book, the writer mixes reality with the light and shade of truth. Thus it is a true picture of common life. It is lively and hat at all dull, neither a travelogue nor a memoir, it is a novel with lively characters, a touching story of human suffering and a story of the eternal lonely man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

The wide canvas of words and tales of this artist brought out the plight of women in the male-dominated set-up of society. Over and above the Islamic-based code of beliefs of the society; male-domination society pushed woman into complete subjugation, making them property for the use of men, because of such a 'life-style's set-up, economical and social oppression was principally faced by women. This drove women to utter frustration and desperation. Choudhury portrayed women, their plight, and their helplessness in the face of this male-dominated society. On the other hand, he wrote about their sense of humanitarian values, their love, sorrows, their deep longing for a life as normal and beautiful as free women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt;

In the wake of the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], which surged up all over Bangladesh, was recounted in his writing '''Ekti Jatike Hotay''' (Legacy of a Nation). Choudhury believed that in today's world men no longer wanted to keep themselves constricted within the sphere of a specified duty.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt;

In Choudhury's time, in a modern society with priest as its advocate and protector, religion lost all its progressivism. It went so far that religion became bogged down in rituals, superstitions and bigotry, while its proponents stank of greed, corruption, even debauchery: even the so-called mullahs could not keep themselves free from this downfall. Almost half the characters in his novels '''Sampan Crass''' (St. Pancras) and '''Aniketon''' represented the mainstay of the decadent society, while the other half, were absorbed with the emerging thoughts, ideals and values of the new society - humanist and secular in content.&lt;ref&gt;Sharak 2, Dhaka, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Choudhury's most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel '''Natun Diganta''' (New Horizon) vol. 1, 2, 3. This is the largest novel of Choudhury. Based mainly on the political activities and the political leaders of Pakistan, of the Indian Subcontinent in board sense, the novel covers the span from 1968 to the Liberation War of Bangladesh (1971). The novel begins with no other character than that of Bhutto and gradually reveals his true nature. The readers will also get a vivid picture of greater "Undivided Bengal", changes in the social structure and the creation of a socialist state. The author's own experiences of tension, imagination and dreams combined together to produce a multi-faceted novel.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Star, 8 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Choudhury's short-stories the write portrays the changes of village life brought by the time. He is very much in love with his motherland, the rivers and paddy fields. He portrays the London life of people from [[Sylhet]] quite faithfully and in great detail. Researchers will find his works useful in the future. Choudhury handles a lot of characters and a wide range of time. Most of the writings are perfect picture of our society, and it has a lovely appearance also. In some of his short stories the writer gives a lot of importance to the physical state of human existence, society should get rid of its negative forces, and build strength on human body and its soul, both of which are deeply linked, and hence both are very important for human beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt;

He was an understanding revolutionary in his own right, ploughing alone a firm held furrow. He carried on his revolution through revealing revelations of all surviving social practices and norms. Unlike many others of his stature, Choudhury as a man, towers far above Choudhury as a writer, though he carved out a place for himself amongst the galaxy of contemporary novelists.&lt;ref name="Sharak 1, Dhaka, 1998"/&gt;

'''Adolfo Ferreira Caminha''' (May 29, 1867 – January 1, 1897) was a Brazilian [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] novelist, famous for his polemical novel ''[[Bom-Crioulo]]'', which deals with [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[homosexuality]].

==Life==
Caminha was born in [[Aracati]] in 1867, to Raimundo Ferreira dos Santos and Maria Firmina Caminha. Orphaned when he was 10 years old, he went to live with his uncle in [[Fortaleza]]. In 1883, he moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where another relative of his matriculated him in a naval school. In 1886, he published his first book: ''Voos Incertos'' (''Uncertain Flights''). In the same year, he made an instruction trip to the United States.

In 1887 he was promoted to [[Second Lieutenant]] and published the [[short story]] books ''Judite'' and ''Lágrimas de um Crente'' (''Tears of a Believer''). In 1888 he returned to Fortaleza, but got involved on a scandal where he [[elopement (marriage)|eloped]] with an ''[[alférez (rank)|alférez]]''{{'}}s daughter. They would have two daughters, and fled to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where Caminha would spend his life as a [[civil service|civil servant]].

By 1891, Caminha was working on [[newspaper|journal]]s such as the ''[[Jornal do Commercio]]'', ''[[Gazeta de Notícias]]'' and ''O País'', using the [[pseudonym]] '''Félix Guanabarino'''. He also published the novel ''[[A Normalista]]''. In 1894, he published an account of his travel to the U.S.A., entitled ''No País dos Ianques'' (''In the Country of the [[Yankee]]s''). In 1895, he published his controversial novel ''[[Bom-Crioulo]]'' and ''Cartas Literárias''. In 1896, he founded a journal named ''Nova Revista'', and published the novel ''Tentação''.

Poor and debilitated by [[tuberculosis]], he would die at only 29 years old, leaving unfinished two novels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13581">An '''authors' editor''' is a [[language professional]] who works "with authors to make draft texts fit for purpose".&lt;ref name="Fit" /&gt; He or she edits manuscripts that have been drafted by the author (or authors) but have not yet been submitted to a publisher for publication.&lt;ref name="Shashok" /&gt; This type of editing is called ''author editing'', to distinguish it from other types of editing done for publishers on documents already accepted for publication: an authors' editor works "with (and, commonly, for) an author rather than for a publisher".&lt;ref name="NegAccept" /&gt; A term sometimes used synonymously with authors' editor is "manuscript editor" which, however, is less precise as it also refers to editors employed by scholarly journals to edit manuscripts after acceptance (in place of the term [[copy editor]]).&lt;ref name="Iverson" /&gt;

Authors' editors usually work with academic authors, researchers and scientists writing scholarly journal articles, books and grant proposals.&lt;ref name="Careers" /&gt; Thus, the authors' editor facilitates the [[academic writing]] process by acting before [[Electronic submission|submission]] or [[peer review]]. Authors' editors may also help authors revise manuscripts after peer review, but once the document is accepted for publication the collaboration ends (and other editors, for example a [[copy editor]] or production editor, take over).

==The work of authors' editors==
An author's collaboration with an authors' editor begins after a manuscript has been drafted. The manuscript must be drafted in the desired publishing language: author editing does not include [[translation]]. The manuscript must be relatively complete, as author editing does not include the tasks of drafting or writing. If authors need help conceiving, structuring or writing their text, then they require the work of a [[Developmental editing|developmental editor]] or a writer (e.g. [[medical writer]] or [[technical writer]]).

The goal of author editing is to help authors produce a clear, accurate and effective document that meets readers' expectations and that will be favorably received by publishers, journal editors and peer reviewers.&lt;ref name="Fit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NegAccept" /&gt; Therefore, authors' editors do both linguistic editing and substantive editing (editing of "substance", i.e. content&lt;ref name=SubstantEdit /&gt;). They improve format, structure, grammar, style, data presentation, argumentation, flow and accuracy. They query authors about unclear content, inform and educate authors about good writing techniques (called "didactic editing"&lt;ref name=DidactEdit /&gt;), and engage authors in revising the text (they "elicit revision"&lt;ref name="Kerans" /&gt;). Rather than simply correct the text, they collaborate with authors by dialoging with them (through in-text comments, email, phone, [[internet telephony]], etc.) about the content and style; examples of how they annotate texts and negotiate the acceptability of the language have been given in an essay by Burrough-Boenisch.&lt;ref name="NegAccept" /&gt; Authors' editors may also advise authors on peer review and the [[Academic publishing#Publishing process|publishing process]],&lt;ref name="Fit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shashok" /&gt; and on high-impact publishing strategies.&lt;ref name="HighImpact" /&gt;

When authors receive the revised manuscript, they usually must dedicate substantial time and effort to reviewing the editor's changes and queries.&lt;ref name="Fit" /&gt; They may discuss the work with the editor, to learn why certain changes were made and to resolve issues that were raised during editing. After they have revised the text, they may resubmit it to the editor for an additional round of editing (if the fee agreement so permits) or finalize it on their own.

==Author editing and authors' writing skills==
The authors' editor is an optional figure in the publishing process. Authors are more likely to hire an authors' editor when they are not fluent in the language in which they wish to publish: this is particularly the case for non-anglophone academics and scientists who publish their research in English for international communication. Another reason for working with an authors' editor regards the author's writing skills, as some scientists and clinicians may face difficulties composing an adequate text in a reasonable amount of time despite being excellent researchers.

Skilled writers will not need to hire such an editor, instead finding sufficient the feedback of colleagues (prior to submitting a manuscript) and peer reviewers (after submission). Nonetheless, even skilled writers may benefit from author editing, especially when they are short of time and have ambitious publishing goals. In fact, since these editors can save researchers time, help them improve their writing, and maximize their chances of publication success, when a regular collaboration is established, authors' editors can become trusted allies of research teams.&lt;ref name="ResInfo" /&gt;

Less skilled writers who are aware that editing will improve their manuscripts (or have been told to seek editing by a journal or publisher) also may not go to an authors' editor, but instead may use one of the many specialized [[Editing#Editing services|editing firms]] (for convenience, greater availability, possibly lower costs). However, these firms, for their global nature, do not always permit the establishment of the collaborative relationship between editor and author-clients which is necessary for true author editing. Finally, novice writers may not realize how they can benefit by presubmission author editing; by submitting unedited manuscripts, they may find themselves in a situation of multiple rejections.&lt;ref name="MultiRej" /&gt;

==Origins==
Although term "authors' editor" is little known, even by persons whose work could accurately be called author editing, it is not new but has been in use at least since the 1970s. The roots of this profession seem to lie in the arena of medical editing in the US. The first known use of the term to describe an editor working in the research setting dates to 1968, in an essay by Mayo Clinic editor Bernard Forscher.&lt;ref name="Forscher" /&gt; In 1973, an article entitled "The author's editor" by L.B. Applewhite&lt;ref name="Applewhite" /&gt; was published in the first volume of the journal ''Medical Communications'' of the [[American Medical Writers Association]].  In 1974, an essay by Barbara G. Cox with the same title&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; was published in the ''[[Mayo Clinic Proceedings]]''. In the early 1980s, the [[Council of Biology Editors]] (now the [[Council of Science Editors]]) began to define and discuss the role of authors' editors, through a seminal paper by Martha M. Tacker&lt;ref name="Tacker" /&gt; followed by a national survey of 100 scientific authors' editors,&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt; both published in the journal ''CBE Views'' (now ''Science Editor''). The survey sparked an editorial in the ''Canadian Medical Association Journal''.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; These early papers used the term "author's editor" (with author in singular) but today, when academic papers usually have multiple authors, the pluralized term "authors' editor" is becoming standard usage.

Curiously, the term "authors' editor" was used in 1953, in the title of a Doctor of Education thesis, to describe [[Maxwell Perkins]], a literary editor who helped shape American literature in the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Robillard" /&gt;

'''''Betula utilis''''' ('''Himalayan birch''', '''''bhojpatra''''', {{lang-sa|भूर्ज}} ''bhūrjá'') is a [[birch]] tree native to the [[Himalayas]], growing at elevations up to {{convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The specific epithet, ''utilis'', refers to the many uses of the different parts of the tree.&lt;ref name="Elvin"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Liu, Cuirong |author2=Elvin, Mark |title=Sediments of time: environment and society in Chinese history |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1998 |page=65 |isbn=0-521-56381-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFfgk3pc5-gC&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white, paper-like bark of the tree was used in ancient times for writing [[Sanskrit]] scriptures and texts.&lt;ref name="Müller" /&gt; It is still used as paper for the writing of sacred mantras, with the bark placed in an amulet and worn for protection.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; Selected varieties are used for landscaping throughout the world, even while some areas of its native habitat are being lost due to overuse of the tree for firewood.

==Taxonomy==
''Betula utilis'' was described and named by botanist [[David Don]] in his ''Prodromus Florae Nepalensis'' (1825), from specimens collected by [[Nathaniel Wallich]] in Nepal in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Don|first=David|authorlink=David Don|title=Prodromus floræ Nepalensis, sive Enumeratio vegetabilium, quæ in itinere|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odgGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58|year=1823|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web3.dnp.go.th/botany/PDF/TFB/TFB_Special_Issue/special_Issue_reduce.pdf|title=THAI FOREST BULLETIN|last=Santisuk|first=Thawatchai|date=November 2009|publisher=The Forest Herbarium (BKF)|page=172|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Betula jacquemontii'' ([[Édouard Spach|Spach]]), first described and named in 1841, was later found to be a variety of ''B. utilis'', and is now ''Betula utilis'' var. ''jacquemontii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipni.org:80/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=295114-1|title=Betulaceae Betula jacquemontii Spach|work=International Plant Names Index|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Betula utilis subsp. jacquemontii Bark Stamme.jpg|right|thumb|White, paper-like bark]]
[[File:Betula-utilis-lenticells.JPG|right|thumb|Close-up showing [[lenticel]]s]]
In its native habitat, ''B. utilis'' tends to form forests, growing as a shrub or tree reaching up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. It  frequently grows among scattered conifers, with an undergrowth of shrubs that typically includes evergreen ''[[Rhododendron]]''. The tree depends on moisture from snowmelt, rather than from the monsoon rains. They often have very bent growth due to the pressure of the deep winter snow in the Himalaya.&lt;ref name="Elvin" /&gt;

Leaves are ovate, {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with serrated margins, and slightly hairy. Flowering occurs from May–July, with only a few male [[catkin]]s, and short, single (sometimes paired) female catkins. The [[perianth]] has four parts in male flowers, and is absent in the female flowers. Fruits ripen in September–October.&lt;ref name="Elvin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chauhan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chauhan, Narain Singh |title=Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of Himachal Pradesh |publisher=Indus Publishing Company |location= |year=1999 |page=125 |isbn=81-7387-098-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQnTAU-3lcC&amp;pg=PA125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin, papery bark is very shiny, reddish brown, reddish white, or white, with horizontal [[lenticel]]s. The bark peels off in broad, horizontal belts, making it very usable for creating even large pages for texts.&lt;ref name="Elvin" /&gt; A fungal growth, locally called ''bhurja-granthi'', forms black lumps on the tree weighing up to 1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Chauhan" /&gt;

The wood is very hard and heavy, and quite brittle. The heartwood is pink or light reddish brown.&lt;ref name="FoC"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994|title=Betula utilis D. Don|journal=Flora of China|publisher=Harvard University|volume=4|page=309|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=200006168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and use==
[[File:Kashmir Sharada MS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kashmir]]i manuscript on birch bark (c. 17th century)]]
[[File:Betula utilis02 by Line1.jpg|right|thumb|''Betula utilis'' var. ''jacquemontii'' used in landscaping]]
The bark of Himalayan birch was used centuries ago in India as paper for writing lengthy scriptures and texts in Sanskrit and other scripts, particularly in historical [[Kashmir]]. Its use as paper for books is mentioned by early Sanskrit writers [[Kalidasa]] (c. 4th century CE), [[Sushruta]] (c. 3rd century CE), and [[Varahamihira]] (6th century CE). In the late 19th century, Kashmiri pandits reported all of their books were written on Himalayan birch bark until [[Akbar]] introduced paper in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book |author=Müller, Friedrich Max |title=Selected essays on language, mythology and religion, Volume 2 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |location= |year=1881 |pages=335–336fn  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word for the tree is ''bhûrja''—sharing a similarity with other [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] words that provide the origin for the common name "birch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Masica, Colin P. |title=The Indo-Aryan languages |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1991 |page=38 |isbn=0-521-29944-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Itp2twGR6tsC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bark is still used for writing sacred [[mantra]]s, which are  placed in an [[amulet]] and worn around the neck for protection or blessing.&lt;ref name= "Müller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wheeler, David Martyn |title=Hortus Revisited: A 21st Birthday Anthology |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=2008 |page=119 |isbn=0-7112-2738-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20vS2esVCRcC&amp;pg=PA119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was mentioned as early as the 8th or 9th century CE, in the Lakshmi Tantra, a [[Pancaratra]] text.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gupta, Sanjukta |title=Laksmi Tantra a Pancaratra text; Orientalia Rheno-traiectina; v.15 |publisher=Brill Archive |location= |year=1972 |page=xxi  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztEUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, the bark was also used as clothing by attendants of [[Lord Shiva]].&lt;ref name="Chauhan" /&gt;

The bark is widely used for packaging material (particularly butter), roof construction, umbrella covers, bandages, and more. The wood is used for bridge construction, and the foliage for fodder. The most widespread use is for firewood, which has caused large areas of habitat to be eliminated or reduced.&lt;ref name="Elvin" /&gt; Parts of the plant, including the fungal growth (''bhurja-granthi'') have also long been used in local traditional medicine.&lt;ref name="Chauhan" /&gt;

==Conservation==
Deforestation due to overuse of the tree has caused loss of habitat for many native groves of ''B. utilis'' (locally called ''bhojpatra'' in the Indian Himalaya). The first high-altitude ''bhojpatra'' nursery was established in 1993 at Chirbasa, just above [[Gangotri]], where many Hindus go on pilgrimage to the source of the sacred [[Ganges]] river. Dr. Harshvanti Bisht, a Himalayan mountaineer, established the first nursery and continues to expand the reforestation of ''bhojpatra'' in the Gangotri area and inside [[Gangotri National Park]]. About 12,500 bhojpatra saplings had been planted in the area by the year 2000.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20081116/dplus1.htm|last=Jain|first=Anmol|title=Mountaineer on mission green|date=2008-11-16|work=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, attempts have been made to ban the collection of ''bhojpatra'' trees in the Gangotri area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-08-08/lucknow/27969581_1_kanwarias-gangotri-uttarakhand|title=Kanwar mela: Alert in Uttarakhand|date=2007-08-08|work=Times of India|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties and cultivars==
Many named varieties and cultivars are used in landscaping throughout the world. In the eastern end of the tree's native distribution, several forms have orange- or copper-colored bark. ''Betula utilis'' var. ''jacquemontii'', from the western end of the native habitat, is widely used because several cultivars have especially white bark. These include:

Those cultivars marked {{smallcaps|agm}} have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].

''B. utilis'' 'Fascination' has an orange- to mahogany-colored bark, which peels off to reveal a polished-looking layer underneath. The bark of  'Wakehurst Place Chocolate', as the name implies, is dark brown to nearly black.&lt;ref name="Junker"&gt;{{cite book |author=Junker,Karan |title=Gardening with woodland plants |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Or |year=2007 |page=116 |isbn=0-88192-821-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk28nOOY2IAC&amp;pg=PA116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''biomass''' is the mass of living biological organisms in a given area or [[ecosystem]] at a given time. Biomass can refer to ''species biomass'', which is the mass of one or more species, or to ''community biomass'', which is the mass of all species in the community. It can include [[microorganisms]], plants or animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=biomass|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/B00660.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass can be expressed as the average mass per unit area, or as the total mass in the community.

How biomass is measured depends on why it is being measured. Sometimes, the biomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms ''in situ'', just as they are. For example, in a salmon [[fishery]], the salmon biomass might be regarded as the total wet weight the salmon would have if they were taken out of the water. In other contexts, biomass can be measured in terms of the dried organic mass, so perhaps only 30% of the actual weight might count, the rest being water. For other purposes, only biological tissues count, and teeth, bones and shells are excluded. In some applications, biomass is measured as the mass of [[Organic carbon|organically bound carbon]] (C) that is present.

The total live biomass on [[Earth]] is about 550 - 560 billion tonnes C,&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-On YM, Phillips R, Milo R | title = The biomass distribution on Earth | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 25 | pages = 6506–6511 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29784790 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1711842115 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/15/1711842115.full.pdf | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Groombridge/&gt; and the total annual [[primary production]] of biomass is just over 100 billion tonnes C/yr.&lt;ref name=Behrenfeld /&gt; The total live biomass of bacteria may be as much as that of plants and animals&lt;ref name="Whitman etal" /&gt; or may be much less.&lt;ref name=Kallmeyer /&gt; The total number of [[DNA]] [[base pair]]s on Earth, as a possible approximation of [[global biodiversity]], is estimated at (5.3±3.6) x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landenmark HK, Forgan DH, Cockell CS | title = An Estimate of the Total DNA in the Biosphere | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002168 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26066900 | pmc = 4466264 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002168 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel | name-list-format = vanc |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total mass of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes of [[carbon]].&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |access-date=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological pyramids==
{{Main|Ecological pyramid}}
[[File:Ecological pyramid.svg|thumb|An ecological pyramid.]]

An ecological pyramid is a graphical representation that shows, for a given [[ecosystem]], the relationship between biomass or [[primary production|biological productivity]] and [[trophic level]]s.

* A ''biomass pyramid'' shows the amount of biomass at each trophic level.
* A ''productivity pyramid'' shows the [[Primary production|production]] or [[Trophic dynamics|turn-over]] in biomass at each trophic level.

An ecological pyramid provides a snapshot in time of an [[biocoenosis|ecological community]].

The bottom of the pyramid represents the primary producers ([[autotroph]]s). The primary producers take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called [[primary production]]. The pyramid then proceeds through the various trophic levels to the [[apex predator]]s at the top.

When energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, typically only ten percent is used to build new biomass. The remaining ninety percent goes to metabolic processes or is dissipated as heat. This energy loss means that productivity pyramids are never inverted, and generally limits food chains to about six levels. However, in oceans, biomass pyramids can be wholly or partially inverted, with more biomass at higher levels.

{{clear}}

==Terrestrial biomass==

Terrestrial biomass generally decreases markedly at each higher [[trophic level]] (plants, herbivores, carnivores). Examples of terrestrial [[Autotroph|producers]] are grasses, trees and shrubs. These have a much higher biomass than the animals that [[Heterotroph|consume them]], such as deer, zebras and insects. The level with the least biomass are the highest [[predator]]s in the [[food chain]], such as foxes and eagles.

In a temperate grassland, grasses and other plants are the primary producers at the bottom of the pyramid. Then come the primary consumers, such as grasshoppers, voles and bison, followed by the secondary consumers, shrews, hawks and small cats. Finally the tertiary consumers, large cats and wolves. The biomass pyramid decreases markedly at each higher level.

==Ocean biomass==
{{marine food chain}}
{{see also|Marine life}}

Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with phytoplankton, and follows the course:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Phytoplankton → zooplankton → predatory zooplankton → [[filter feeder]]s → predatory fish
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Phytoplankton]] are the main [[primary producer]]s at the bottom of the marine [[food chain]]. Phytoplankton use [[photosynthesis]] to convert inorganic carbon into [[protoplasm]]. They are then consumed by microscopic animals called zooplankton.

[[Zooplankton]] comprise the second level in the food chain, and includes small [[crustacean]]s, such as [[copepod]]s and [[krill]], and the [[larva]] of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.

In turn, small zooplankton are consumed by both larger predatory zooplankters, such as [[krill]], and by [[forage fish]], which are small, schooling, [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] fish. This makes up the third level in the food chain.

{{clear}}

[[File:Arctic food web.svg|thumb|300px|left|An ocean food web showing a network of food chains]]

The fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.

Apex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up the fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.

Marine environments can have inverted biomass pyramids. In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers grow and reproduce slowly.

There is an exception with [[cyanobacteria]]. Marine cyanobacteria are the smallest known [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms; the smallest of all, ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kettler GC, Martiny AC, Huang K, Zucker J, Coleman ML, Rodrigue S, Chen F, Lapidus A, Ferriera S, Johnson J, Steglich C, Church GM, Richardson P, Chisholm SW | title = Patterns and implications of gene gain and loss in the evolution of Prochlorococcus | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e231 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18159947 | pmc = 2151091 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030231 | url = http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful [[species]] on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater may contain 100,000 cells or more. Worldwide, there are estimated to be several [[octillion]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;) individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=27 September 2006 |title=Earth from Saturn |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prochlorococcus'' is ubiquitous between 40°N and 40°S and dominates in the [[oligotroph]]ic (nutrient poor) regions of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Partensky F, Hess WR, Vaulot D | title = Prochlorococcus, a marine photosynthetic prokaryote of global significance | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–27 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10066832 | pmc = 98958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterium accounts for an estimated 20% of the [[oxygen]] in the Earth's [[atmosphere]], and forms part of the base of the ocean [[food chain]].&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91448837|title=The Most Important Microbe You've Never Heard Of|author=|date=|website=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacterial biomass==
There are typically 50 million [[Bacterial cell structure|bacterial cells]] in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. The 2018 census &lt;ref name="Bar-On"/&gt; gives for bacterial biomass ≈70 billions of tonnes of carbon, equal to 15% of the whole biomass, In a much-cited study from 1998&lt;ref name="Whitman etal"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitman WB, Coleman DC, Wiebe WJ | title = Prokaryotes: the unseen majority | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6578–83 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618454 | pmc = 33863 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/95/12/6578.pdf | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}&lt;/ref&gt; the world bacterial biomass had been mistakenly calculated to be 350 to 550 billions of tonnes of carbon, equal to between 60% and 100% of the carbon in plants. More recent studies of seafloor microbes had cast considerable doubt on that, one study in 2012&lt;ref name=Kallmeyer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kallmeyer J, Pockalny R, Adhikari RR, Smith DC, D'Hondt S | title = Global distribution of microbial abundance and biomass in subseafloor sediment | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 40 | pages = 16213–6 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22927371 | pmc = 3479597 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1203849109 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/109/40/16213.full | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10916213K }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the calculated microbial biomass on the seafloor from the original 303 billions of tonnes of C to just 4.1 billions of tonnes of C, reducing the global biomass of prokaryotes to 50 to 250 billions of tonnes of C. Further, if the average per cell biomass of prokaryotes is reduced from 86 to 14 femtograms C&lt;ref name=Kallmeyer /&gt; then the global biomass of prokaryotes was reduced to 13 to 44.5 billions of tonnes of C, equal to between 2.4% and 8.1% of the carbon in plants. The mentioned current value (≈70 billions of tonnes of carbon) was published in May 2018.

==Global biomass==
Estimates for the global biomass of species and higher level groups are not always consistent across the literature. Apart from bacteria, the total global biomass has been estimated at about 550 billion tonnes C.&lt;ref name=Groombridge&gt;Groombridge B, Jenkins MD (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kHeAXV5-XwC ''Global biodiversity: Earth’s living resources in the 21st century''] Page 11.

==Global rate of production==
[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Globally, terrestrial and oceanic habitats produce a similar amount of new biomass each year (56.4 billion tonnes C terrestrial and 48.5 billion tonnes C oceanic).]]

Net [[primary production]] is the rate at which new biomass is generated, mainly due to photosynthesis. Global primary production can be estimated from [[satellite]] observations. Satellites scan the [[NDVI|normalised difference vegetation index]] (NDVI) over terrestrial habitats, and scan sea-surface [[chlorophyll]] levels over oceans. This results in 56.4 billion [[tonne]]s [[Organic carbon|C]]/yr (53.8%), for terrestrial primary production, and 48.5 billion tonnes C/yr for oceanic primary production.&lt;ref name=Behrenfeld&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Field CB, Behrenfeld MJ, Randerson JT, Falkowski P | title = Primary production of the biosphere: integrating terrestrial and oceanic components | journal = Science | volume = 281 | issue = 5374 | pages = 237–40 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9657713 | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5374.237 | bibcode = 1998Sci...281..237F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the total [[photoautotrophic]] primary production for the Earth is about 104.9 billion tonnes C/yr. This translates to about 426 gC/m²/yr for land production (excluding areas with permanent ice cover), and 140 gC/m²/yr for the oceans.

However, there is a much more significant difference in [[Population density|standing stocks]]—while accounting for almost half of total annual production, oceanic [[autotroph]]s account for only about 0.2% of the total biomass. Autotrophs may have the highest global proportion of biomass, but they are closely rivaled or surpassed by microbes.&lt;ref name="Whitman98"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitman WB, Coleman DC, Wiebe WJ | title = Prokaryotes: the unseen majority | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6578–83 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618454 | pmc = 33863 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/12/6578.full.pdf | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groombridge02"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Groombridge B, Jenkins M | title = World Atlas of Biodiversity: Earth's Living Resources in the 21st Century | publisher = World Conservation Monitoring Centre, United Nations Environment Programme | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=_kHeAXV5-XwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=biomass | isbn = 0-520-23668-8 | pmc = 3408371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Camfranglais''', '''Francanglais''', or '''Francamglais''' ([[portmanteau]] of the [[French language|French]] adjectives ''camerounais'', ''français'', and ''anglais'') is a [[pidgin language]] of [[Cameroon]], consisting of a [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] mixture of [[Cameroonian French]], [[Cameroonian English]] and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]], in addition to lexical contributions from various indigenous [[languages of Cameroon]].

The language blend is common among young people in the country, and rivals [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] ("Creole") as the country's most common [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name="Niba"&gt;Niba.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most popular in the high-density urban centres where [[Anglophone Cameroonian|anglophones]] and [[Francophone Cameroonian|francophones]] meet.&lt;ref name="DeLancey and DeLancey"&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Camfranglais has caused concern for educators, who worry that the language blend may hinder acquisition of regular French and English and may be seen as a shortcut around true [[bilingualism]].&lt;ref name="DeLancey and DeLancey" /&gt; Studies are underway over Camfranglais, which some academics consider to be on its way to becoming a proper language.&lt;ref name="Niba" /&gt;

== History ==
Camfranglais first emerged in the mid-1970s after the reunification of Francophone [[Cameroun]] and Anglophone [[Southern Cameroons]]. It is believed to have originated in the markets, ports, schools, and sports stadiums of Cameroon's larger cities.&lt;ref name="DeLancey and DeLancey2"&gt;DeLancey, Mark W., and Mark Dike DeLancey (2000): ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'' (3rd ed.). Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It became fashionable in the late 1990s, due partially to its use by popular musicians.&lt;ref name="DeLancey and DeLancey2" /&gt; Camfranglais continues to be used in music today, in the work of musicians like Koppo, Krotal, and AkSangGrave, as well as by writers such as Kalalobe and Labang.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein-Kanjora|first=Gardy|date=2015-12-06|title=Camfrang forever! Metacommunication in and about Camfranglais|url=https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/SS/article/view/27951|journal=Sociolinguistic Studies|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=261–289|doi=10.1558/sols.v10i1-2.27951|issn=1750-8649|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Camfranglais sees widespread unofficial use in the Cameroonian education system. Though Cameroon claims both French and English as official languages, elementary schools teach in only a single language. Thus, elementary pupils are surrounded by others that primarily speak the same language. It is not until secondary school that learning the other becomes mandatory. This helps explain why Camfranglais sees use in secondary school environments, as it is the first time that many students from different linguistic backgrounds begin to attend the same schools. Furthermore, Camfranglais is a hidden language, mainly used by speakers as a way to hide their conversations, or appear mysterious to others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kouega|first=Jean-Paul|date=2003|title=Camfranglais: A novel slang in Cameroon schools|journal=English Today|language=en|volume=19|issue=02|pages=|doi=10.1017/s0266078403002050|issn=0266-0784|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it has grown rapidly within the Cameroonian secondary school system, where students use it to communicate without being understood by outsiders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Classification ====
While it is classified as a pidgin language, this is inaccurate. Speakers are already fluent in either English and French, and as such it is not used in situations where both parties lack a common tongue. As a whole, Camfranglais sets itself apart from other pidgins and creoles in that it consists of an array of languages, at least one of which is already known by those speaking it. For instance, while it contains elements of borrowing, code-switching, and pidgin languages, it is not a contact language as both parties can be presumed to speak French, the lexifer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Numerous other classifications have been proposed, like ‘pidgin’, ‘argot’, ‘youth language’, a ‘sabir camerounais’, an ‘appropriation vernaculaire du français’ or a ‘hybrid slang’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, as Camfranglais is more developed than a slang, this too is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Kougea, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Kießling proposes it be classified as a 'highly hybrid sociolect of the urban youth type", a definition that Stein-Kanjora agrees with.&lt;ref&gt;Kießling, R. (2005). bak mwa me do'-Camfranglais in Cameroon. ''Lingua posnaniensis'', ''47'', 87-107. ''Stein-Kanjora, 263''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and Popularity ==
Camfranglais has been accepted and embraced by Cameroon's urban youth population, particularly on the internet. In fact, this acceptance has created what some consider to be a 'Camfranglais Cult' among the youth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While the reasons for this are many, Stein-Kanjora posits that by choosing it over French, English, or indigenous languages, the youth are able to form a modern, urban identity, separate from the colonial and tribal connotations of older languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Camfranglais is predominantly used by youth between the ages of 12 and 26.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, although the number of female speakers is growing, the language is mainly used and developed by males, at least partially due to active exclusion of women by male speakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Carlo Penco''' (born August 1948) is an Italian [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] and  full professor in  [[philosophy of language]] at the [[University of Genoa]] in [[Italy]].

He received his Ph.D. in Philosophy ''Summa cum Laude'' at the University of Genoa in 1972 with a specialization in the [[philosophy of science]] (at the time in Italy there were no PhD; he became a member of the PhD program later as a teacher). He studied with [[Evandro Agazzi]] in Genoa, with [[Michael Dummett]] in Oxford, and later with [[Robert Brandom]] at the University of Pittsburgh.
He has received various academic awards and fellowships including: CNR Fellow (1976), NATO Fellow at Oxford University (1979) and Fellow of the Center for Philosophy of Science in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1998). He has been President of the  [http://www.sifa.unge.it  Italian Society for the Analytic Philosophy] (2002-2004), and member of Steering Committee of the Italian Society for Logic and the Philosophy of Sciences and the [http://esap.info European Society for Analytic Philosophy]. Together with Joao Branquino and Josep Corbi, he began a series of [http://www.dif.unige.it/epi/con/latinmeeting07/ "Latin Meeting in Analytic Philosophy"], in order to foster the exchange of ideas among Analytic Philosophers in the southern countries in Europe, with connection with Latin America.  
He has been teaching in South of Italy (University of Lecce) between 1988 and 1991; then he went to the University of Genoa, where he is still teaching as full professor in Philosophy of Language. President of the Master in Philosophy during the period 2004-2010, he became Head of the Doctoral School in Human Science. 
He has been working in the Editorial or Scientific Committees for various journals, such as Epistemologia, An International Journal for Logic and Philosophy of Science,  Networks, A journal for the philosophy of Artificial Intelligence and the Cognitive Sciences,  European Journal of Analytic Philosophy, Theoria (A Swedish Journal for Philosophy). 
His early research interests has been mainly on the philosophy of the later Wittgenstein and the philosophy of Frege. He began to work on the problem of context for the Meetings "Modeling and Using Contexts" since 1999. His recent interests are more strictly linked to different topics in the Philosophy of Language and Pragmatics, mainly on the problem of the boundaries between semantics and pragmatics.

'''Catharina Ahlgren''' (1734 &amp;ndash; c. 1800) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[feminist]] writer, poet, translator, managing [[Editing|editor]], and one of the first identifiable female [[journalist]]s in Sweden. She is also known for her correspondence with [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand {{sv icon}}: Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida.

Några anteckningar från det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age") Second edition.

==Biography==
Catharina Ahlgren was the daughter of Anders Ahlgren, governor of [[Östergötland]], and Laurentia Juliana Liungenfeldt. Through her sister, she was the sister-in-law of [[Johan Gustaf Halldin]], chancellor of the [[Kungliga Biblioteket]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand {{sv icon}}: Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida. Några anteckningar från det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age") Second edition. Wahlström &amp; Widstrand, Stockholm (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to V. Örnberg, she was at one point a chamber lady in the court of the queen [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]], but lost her position because of some kind of intrigue: "Chamberlady at court but soon lost her position because of plotting, managed a book shop that failed. Made translations and wrote literary things."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand {{sv icon}}: Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida. Några anteckningar från det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age") Second edition. Wahlström &amp; Widstrand, Stockholm (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

Catharina Ahlgren married first to Bengt Edvard Eckerman, cavalry master of the royal Scanian Husars. During her first marriage, she had the daughters [[Charlotte Eckerman]] and [[Julie Eckerman]] and the sons Bengt Gustaf and Christopher. Her first marriage was reportedly troubled by economic difficulties and her youngest son were not acknowledged by her spouse as his. The marriage ended in a [[divorce]] in 1770. She married for the second time to the book printer [[journeyman]] Anders Bark or Barck.

She moved with her second spouse to [[Finland]], possibly in 1775, and are listed as a resident in [[Åbo]] in 1782. Also her second marriage ended in a divorce. At the death of her eldest daughter Charlotte in 1790, she was one of the beneficiaries of the will. In 1796, she settled with her youngest daughter Julie in [[Linköping]].&lt;ref&gt;Tilda Maria Forselius, "Min nådiga pappas Uprigtiga Vän och fiolliga flicka: Julie Ekerman/Björckegrens brev till Carl Sparre lästa utifrån frågor om makt och identitet". Magisteruppsats framlagd vid Institutionen för litteraturvetenskap och idéhistoria, Stockholms universitet, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Her contemporary, the orientalist and writer [[Jonas Apelblad]], listed her in his writers dictionary as a strong and gifted personality, "[f]emina potens, sed ingenio plena" ("a forceful woman, but full of talent") who did not live a more peaceful life with her second spouse then she had with her first.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Öhrberg (2001).

==Literary career==

===Translator and poet===
Catharina Ahlgren reportedly became known as a poet and translator in the 1750s literary world before she had anything formally published. She was a personal friend of the famed poet [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]], and their correspondence is preserved. While her friend Nordenflycht wrote under the pseudonym "Herdinnan i Norden" (Shepherdess of the North), Catharina Ahlgren wrote under the name "Herdinnan i Ahl-Lunden" (Shepherdess of the Alder-Grove).&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand {{sv icon}}: Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida. Några anteckningar från det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age") Second edition. Wahlström &amp; Widstrand, Stockholm (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

She was active as a translator of both poetry and novels from the English, French and German languages. Among her translations were [[German language|German]] poem ''Die Prüfung Abrahams'' by [[Christoph Martin Wieland]], and the English novel ''[[The Distressed Wife, or the history of Eliza Wyndham]]''.

She debuted as a poet with her French language poem ''Au jour de l'illustre naissance de sa majestee notre adourable Reine Le 24 Jullet'', dedicated to the queen, [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]], on the queens birthday in 1764.

===Journalist and editor===
During the [[age of liberty]] in Sweden, there were many essay papers published, discussing important issues in society, notably ''[[Then Swänska Argus]]''.
These essay papers were often written in form of a debate or a correspondence between two anonymous signatures. Some of them also took up the topic of the role of women in society and [[gender equality]], the earliest one being ''[[Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga]]'' by [[Margareta Momma]] in 1738-39. This presaged [[first-wave feminism]] in the English-speaking world. Many of them are believed to have female editors and journalists, but as they were customarily written under anonymous pseudonyms, most of them have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Christensson (in Swedish): Signums svenska kulturhistoria. Gustavianska tiden (English: Swedish culture history by signum. The Gustavian age) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the few identified of them were Margareta Momma, [[Anna Maria Rückerschöld]] and Catharina Ahlgren.

Literary women were viewed as fashionable. A male editor stated during a publication of a female poet: "As we wish for nothing higher than to encourage the knowledge among us, it cannot be anything other than pleasant that a member of the gender [women] so admirably support our intention."&lt;ref&gt;Henrika Zilliacus-Tikkanen: När könet började skriva – Kvinnor i finländsk press 1771–1900 (English: When gender started to write - women in Finnish media 1771-1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the correspondence-debate in her paper, she wrote 1772:

{{quote|Even though I have just sent my letter, I still write anew until the post leaves. My only consolation Is my feather [feather pen]. Of all artists I praise the inventor of the art of writing the most.&lt;ref&gt;Tilda Maria Forselius (in Swedish): "Ett brev betyder så mycket"– några samtida perspektiv på historiska brev (English: "A letter means so much" - contemporary perspectives on historical letters)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likely through her second marriage, Catharina Ahlgren acquired a [[printing press]], which she managed for a period.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand {{sv icon}}: Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida. Några anteckningar från det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age") Second edition. Wahlström &amp; Widstrand, Stockholm (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the writers she published was works by Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht.

On 29 October 1772, Catharina Ahlgren published and edited the essay paper ''Brefwäxling emellan twänne fruntimmer, den ena i Stockholm och den andra på landet i åskillige blandade ämnen'' (Correspondence between two ladies, on in Stockholm and the other in the country, in a number of various subjects), under the signature Adelaide. This was a [[feminist]] essay publication, written in the form of a debate i letters between two female signatures, in which she argued in favor of a social conscience, [[democracy]] and [[gender equality]], and recommended [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] between women as a protection against male guardianship and superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Christensson (in Swedish): Signums svenska kulturhistoria. Gustavianska tiden (English: Swedish culture history by signum. The Gustavian age) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that the only way to reach true love within a relationship is to be equals, adding that as men so often want to rule over women, it is much harder to retain friendship with them than with another woman.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Christensson (in Swedish): Signums svenska kulturhistoria. Gustavianska tiden (English: Swedish culture history by signum. The Gustavian age) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed love and friendship, upbringing and education, monarchy and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Christensson (in Swedish): Signums svenska kulturhistoria. Gustavianska tiden (English: Swedish culture history by signum. The Gustavian age) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1773, the essay was renamed ''Brefväxling emellan Adelaide och någre wittre snillen i omwäxlande ämnen'' (Correspondence between Adelaide and some literary geniuses in various subjects), and later that year ''Fortsättning af Adelaides brefwäxling, angående Fru Windhams historie'' (Adelaide's continuing correspondence, concerning the history of Mrs Windham).
Catharina Ahlgren is also presumed to be the author of the noted essay paper ''De Nymodiga Fruntimren, eller Sophias och Bélisindes Tankespel'' (Modern Women, or the thought play of Sophia and Belisinde), which were written in the same fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand {{sv icon}}: Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida. Några anteckningar från det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age") Second edition. Wahlström &amp; Widstrand, Stockholm (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; This primarily concerned with women's education as a mean of reform in women's position: for example, criticizing the dominating French language in the customary education of females, as this was used for nothing more than reading of romantic novels, and advocated that girls should learn English instead, so they could be able to take part in the scientific literature normally only published in that language, such as history and geography.&lt;ref&gt;Hadenius, Stig, Nilsson, Torbjörn &amp; Åselius, Gunnar, Sveriges historia: vad varje svensk bör veta, Bonnier Alba, Stockholm, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Catharina Ahlgren also played a pioneer role in Finland, where she lived in [[Åbo]] from at least 1782 onward. She is identified as the editor behind ''Om att rätt behaga'' (Of the Art to Please Properly), which was, in fact, the first paper published in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Henrika Zilliacus-Tikkanen: När könet började skriva – Kvinnor i finländsk press 1771–1900 (English: When gender started to write - women in Finnish media 1771-1900)&lt;/ref&gt;  
She discontinued ''Om konsten at rätt behaga'' officially because of health reasons. In her farewell she wrote: "You may see, gentlemen, how much I wished to copy you."&lt;ref&gt;Henrika Zilliacus-Tikkanen: När könet började skriva – Kvinnor i finländsk press 1771–1900 (English: When gender started to write - women in Finnish media 1771-1900)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, she published her last paper, ''Angenäma Sjelwswåld'' (Pleasant Defyings).

'''Dendi''' is a [[Songhay language]] used as a [[trade language]] across northern [[Benin]] (along the [[Niger River]]; [[Donga Department|Donga]] and [[Alibori]] provinces, e.g. [[Djougou]], [[Kandi, Benin|Kandi]]). It forms a [[dialect cluster]] with [[Zarma language|Zarma]] and [[Koyraboro Senni|Songhai proper]] but is heavily influenced by [[Bariba language|Bariba]].

Dendi has been described as a four-[[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Salmons, ''Accentual change and language contact: Comparative survey and a case study of early Northern Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagnosis-related group''' ('''DRG''') is a system to classify [[hospital]] cases into one of originally 467 groups,&lt;ref&gt;Mistichelli, Judith [http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/publications/scopenotes/sn4.pdf Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) and the Prospective Payment System: Forecasting Social Implications]&lt;/ref&gt; with the last group (coded as 470 through v24, 999 thereafter) being "Ungroupable". This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by [[Robert B Fetter]], PhD, of the [[Yale School of Management]], and [[John D. Thompson]], MPH, of the [[Yale School of Public Health]].&lt;ref name=fetter1980&gt;Fetter RB, Shin Y, Freeman JL, Averill RF, Thompson JD (1980) Case mix definition by diagnosis related groups. Medical Care 18(2):1–53&lt;/ref&gt; The system is also referred to as "the DRGs", and its intent was to identify the "products" that a hospital provides.  One example of a "product" is an appendectomy.  The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement, to replace "cost based" reimbursement that had been used up to that point.  DRGs are assigned by a "grouper" program based on [[ICD]] (International Classification of Diseases) diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of complications or [[comorbidity|comorbidities]]. DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] pays the hospital for each "product", since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources.&lt;ref&gt;Fetter RB, Freeman JL (1986) Diagnosis related groups: product linemanagement within hospitals. Academy of Management Review 11(1):41–54&lt;/ref&gt; DRGs may be further grouped into [[Major Diagnostic Category|Major Diagnostic Categories]] (MDCs).  DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Purpose==
The original objective of diagnosis related groups (DRG) was to develop a classification system that identified the "products" that the patient received.  Since the introduction of DRGs in the early 1980s, the [[healthcare]] industry has evolved and developed an increased demand for a patient classification system that can serve its original objective at a higher level of sophistication and precision.&lt;ref&gt;Baker JJ (2002) Medicare payment system for hospital inpatients: diagnosis related groups. Journal of Health Care Finance 28(3):1–13&lt;/ref&gt;  To meet those evolving needs, the objective of the DRG system had to expand in scope.  Today, there are several different DRG systems that have been developed in the US.  They include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.3mhis.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9907/~/definitions-manuals|title=Definitions Manuals|website=support.3mhis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Medicare DRG (CMS-DRG &amp; MS-DRG)
* Refined DRGs (R-D RG)
* All Patient DRGs (AP-DRG)
* Severity DRGs (S-DRG)
* All Patient, Severity-Adjusted DRGs (APS-DRG)
* All Patient Refined DRGs (APR-DRG)
* International-Refined DRGs (IR-DRG)

==History==
The system was created in the early 1970s by Robert Barclay Fetter and [[John D. Thompson]] at [[Yale University]] with the material support of the former Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now called the [[Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services]] (CMS).&lt;ref name=fetter1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ahima2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bielby|first1=Judy A.|title=Evolution of DRGs|url=http://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=106590#.V8TMT5MrI7p|website=AHIMA|publisher=The American Health Information Management Association|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRGs were first implemented in [[New Jersey]], beginning in 1980 with a small number of hospitals partitioned into three groups according to their budget positions — surplus, breakeven, and deficit — prior to the imposition of DRG payment.&lt;ref name=newjersey&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/5/2/32.pdf Lessons of the New Jersey DRG Payment System]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey experiment continued for three years, with additional cadres of hospitals being added to the number of institutions each year until all hospitals in New Jersey were dealing with this [[prospective payment system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/5/2/32.full.pdf| title=Lessons of the New Jersey DRG payment system|author1=William  C.  Hsiao, Harvey  M.  Sapolsky |author2=Daniel  L. Dunn |author3=Sanford L. Weiner |last-author-amp=yes | date=1986|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRGs were designed to be homogeneous units of hospital activity to which binding prices could be attached. A central theme in the advocacy of DRGs was that this reimbursement system would, by constraining the hospitals, oblige their administrators to alter the behavior of the physicians and surgeons comprising their medical staffs. Hospitals were forced to leave the "nearly
risk-free world of cost reimbursement."&lt;ref&gt;Eastaugh SR (1999) Managing risk in a risky world. Journal of Health Care Finance 25(3):10&lt;/ref&gt; and face the uncertain financial consequences associated with the provision of health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz L, Scholtes S, Vera A (2008) DRG Cost Weight Volatility and Hospital Performance. OR Spectrum 30(2): 331-354&lt;/ref&gt; DRGs were designed to provide practice pattern information that administrators could use to influence individual physician behavior.&lt;ref name=newjersey /&gt;

DRGs were intended to describe all types of patients in an acute hospital setting. DRGs encompassed elderly patients as well as newborn, pediatric and adult populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdp8o5zDMu0C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=The+DRGs+encompassed+elderly+patients+as+well+as+newborn,+pediatric+and+adult+populations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NbyrG9j_WK&amp;sig=IrFSdVmK2J2i9i3qR9isycPfZMA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPsu7lrdLJAhVS1GMKHbrHDgoQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20DRGs%20encompassed%20elderly%20patients%20as%20well%20as%20newborn%2C%20pediatric%20and%20adult%20populations&amp;f=false| title=The Business of Nurse Management: A Toolkit for Success| author=Nancy Bateman| date=2012|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospective payment system implemented as DRGs had been designed to limit the share of hospital revenues derived from the Medicare program budget,&lt;ref name=newjersey /&gt; and in spite of doubtful results in New Jersey, it was decided in 1983 to impose DRGs on hospitals nationwide.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In that year, HCFA assumed responsibility for the maintenance and modifications of these DRG definitions.  Since that time, the focus of all Medicare DRG modifications instituted by HCFA/CMS has been on problems relating primarily to the elderly population.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1987, New York state passed legislation instituting DRG-based payments for all non-Medicare patients.  This legislation required that the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) evaluate the applicability of Medicare DRGs to a non-Medicare population.  This evaluation concluded that the Medicare DRGs were not adequate for a non-Medicare population.  Based on this evaluation, the NYS DOH entered into an agreement with [[3M]] to research and develop all necessary DRG modifications.  The modifications resulted in the initial APDRG, which differed from the Medicare DRG in that it provided support for transplants, high-risk obstetric care, nutritional disorders, and pediatrics along with support for other populations.  One challenge in working with the APDRG groupers is that there is no set of common data/formulas that is shared across all states as there is with CMS.  Each state maintains its own information.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1991, the top 10 DRGs overall were: normal [[newborn]], [[childbirth|vaginal delivery]], [[heart failure]], [[psychosis|psychoses]], [[cesarean section]], [[neonate]] with significant problems, [[angina pectoris]], specific cerebrovascular disorders, [[pneumonia]], and [[hip replacement|hip]]/[[knee replacement]]. These DRGs comprised nearly 30 percent of all hospital [[:wikt:discharge|discharge]]s.&lt;ref name="drgtop10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/natstats.jsp|title=Most Frequent Diagnoses and Procedures for DRGs, by Insurance Status|accessdate=2006-04-22|publisher=Agency for Health Care Policy and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history, design, and classification rules of the DRG system, as well as its application to patient discharge data and updating procedures, are presented in the CMS ''DRG Definitions Manual'' (Also known as the ''Medicare DRG Definitions Manual'' and the ''Grouper Manual''). A new version generally appears every October. The 20.0 version appeared in 2002.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 2007, author Rick Mayes described DRGs as:

{{quote|...the single most influential postwar innovation in medical financing: Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS). Inexorably rising medical inflation and deep economic deterioration forced policymakers in the late 1970s to pursue radical reform of Medicare to keep the program from insolvency. Congress and the Reagan administration eventually turned to the one alternative reimbursement system that analysts and academics had studied more than any other and had even tested with apparent success in New Jersey: prospective payment with diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Rather than simply reimbursing hospitals whatever costs they charged to treat Medicare patients, the new model paid hospitals a predetermined, set rate based on the patient's diagnosis. The most significant change in health policy since Medicare and Medicaid's passage in 1965 went virtually unnoticed by the general public. Nevertheless, the change was nothing short of revolutionary. For the first time, the federal government gained the upper hand in its financial relationship with the hospital industry. Medicare's new prospective payment system with DRGs triggered a shift in the balance of political and economic power between the providers of medical care (hospitals and physicians) and those who paid for it - power that providers had successfully accumulated for more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mayes

Before the introduction of version 25, many CMS DRG classifications were "paired" to reflect the presence of complications or comorbidities (CCs).  A significant refinement of version 25 was to replace this pairing, in many instances, with a trifurcated design that created a tiered system of the absence of CCs, the presence of CCs, and a higher level of presence of Major CCs.  As a result of this change, the historical list of diagnoses that qualified for membership on the CC list was substantially redefined and replaced with a new standard CC list and a new Major CC list.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Another planning refinement was not to number the DRGs in strict numerical sequence as compared with the prior versions. In the past, newly created DRG classifications would be added to the end of the list. In version 25, there are gaps within the numbering system that will allow modifications over time, and also allow for new MS-DRGs in the same body system to be located more closely together in the numerical sequence.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''Divan-khane''' ({{lang-fa|دیوان‌خانه}}) is a [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase from {''[[wiktionary:%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86#Persian|divan]]'' = court} + {''[[wiktionary:%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87#Persian|khane]]'' = house} to describe a [[guest house]] usually for prominent people in the [[Middle East]]ern society.

In tribal Middle Eastern, Arab, Persian, and Kurdish societies, a guest house of the tribal chieftain is used mostly for discussing tribal affairs. This served as an institution dedicated to the political and social affairs of the tribe. A ''diwan'' or ''diwan-khane'' was a special room, or house, dedicated to the ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'' and his male guests, for sitting and drinking tea, discussing the political and social affairs of the tribe and other mundane subjects. 

The ''agha'' and his guests would also listen to singers and story tellers (usually Jewish merchants or peddlers), who would entertain them. The common ''agha'' was in charge of several major tasks of the tribal society under his jurisdiction: He was the head of the political unit, the [[judge]] and [[arbitrator]], the military leader and the finance minister responsible mainly for receiving dues/taxes from his subjects for their harvest and commercial transactions under his jurisdiction. 

One of the best studies of ''aghas''in the [[Kurd]]ish society is by [[Mordechai Zaken]]: ''Jewish subjects and their tribal chieftains in Kurdistan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jewish Subjects and Their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan (Jewish Identities in a Changing World) |last=Zaken |first=Mordechai |authorlink=|year=2007 |publisher=BRILL |location= |isbn=90-04-16190-2 |page= |pages=376 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Subjects-Chieftains-Kurdistan-Identities-Changing/dp/9004161902/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">'''ETAP-3''' is a proprietary linguistic processing system focusing on [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitp.ru/ru/science/works/452.htm |title=МНОГОЦЕЛЕВОЙ ЛИНГВИСТИЧЕСКИЙ ПРОЦЕССОР ЭТАП-3 |publisher=Iitp.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] at the [[Institute for Information Transmission Problems]] ([[:ru:Институт проблем передачи информации им. А. А. Харкевича РАН]]). It is a [[Rule-based machine translation|rule-based system]] which uses the [[Meaning-Text Theory]] as its theoretical foundation. At present, there are several applications of ETAP-3, such as a [[machine translation]] tool, a converter of the [[Universal Networking Language]], an interactive learning tool for Russian language learners and a [[treebank|syntactically annotated corpus]] of Russian language. Demo versions of some of these tools are [http://cl.iitp.ru/etap3 available online].

==Machine translation tool==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Etap 01.jpg|thumb|alt=A sample translation of a Russian sentence into English generated by ETAP-3|A sample translation of a Russian sentence into English generated by ETAP-3]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Etap 02.jpg|thumb|alt=A syntax tree of a Russian sentence generated by ETAP-3|A syntax tree of a Russian sentence generated by ETAP-3]] --&gt;
The ETAP-3 machine translation tool can translate text from [[English language|English]] into [[Russian language|Russian]] and vice versa. It is a rule-based system which makes it different from the most present-day systems that are predominantly statistical-based. The system makes a syntactical analysis of the input sentence which can be visualized as a [[Parse tree|syntax tree]].

The machine translation tool uses bilingual dictionaries which contain more than 100,000 lexical entries.

==UNL converter==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Etap 03.jpg|thumb|alt=A UNL control representation of a Russian sentence generated by ETAP-3|A [[Universal Networking Language|UNL]] representation of a Russian sentence generated by ETAP-3]] --&gt;
The UNL converter based on ETAP-3 can transform English and Russian sentences into there representations in [[Universal Networking Language|UNL]] (''Universal Networking Language'') and generate English and Russian sentences from their [[Universal Networking Language|UNL]] representations.

==Russian language treebank==
A syntactically annotated corpus ([[treebank]]) is a part of [[Russian National Corpus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruscorpora.ru/en/search-syntax.html |title=Search the Corpus. Russian National Corpus |publisher=Ruscorpora.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 40,000 sentences (600,000 words) which are fully syntactically and morphologically annotated. The primary annotation was made by ETAP-3 and then manually verified by competent linguists. This makes the syntactically annotated corpus a reliable tool for linguistic research.

==Lexical functions learning tool==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Etap 04.jpg|thumb|alt=Lexical functions learning tool|Lexical functions learning tool]] --&gt;
The ETAP-3 system makes extensive use of [[lexical function]]s explored in  the [[Meaning-Text Theory]]. For this reason, an interactive tool for Russian language learners aiming at the acquisition of lexical functions has been developed. Such learning tools are now being created for [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitp.ru/ru/researchlabs/245.htm#lex |title=Лаборатория № 15 |publisher=Iitp.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
An '''epithet''' (from {{lang-el|ἐπίθετον}} ''epitheton'', neuter of {{lang|el|ἐπίθετος}} ''epithetos'', "attributed, added"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2339438 |title=Epithetos| editor-first1= Henry George |editor-last1= Liddell| editor-first2=  Robert |editor-last2= Scott| work=A Greek-English Lexicon| publisher=Perseus.Tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a '''byname''', or a descriptive term (word or phrase), accompanying or occurring in place of a name and having entered common usage. It has various shades of meaning when applied to seemingly real or fictitious people, divinities, objects, and [[binomial nomenclature]]. It can also be a descriptive title: for example, [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], [[Alfred the Great]], [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] or [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]].

In contemporary use, ''epithet'' often refers to an abusive, defamatory, or derogatory phrase, such as a [[racial epithet|racial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epithet| title= epithet| website= Merriam-Webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[animal epithet]].&lt;ref name="Herzfeld2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herzfeld |first=Michael|title=Cultural Intimacy: Social Poetics and the Real Life of States, Societies, and Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lSpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-29755-0 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use as a [[euphemism]] is criticized by Martin Manser and other proponents of [[linguistic prescription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manser| first= Martin H. |year=2007 |title=Good Word Guide |edition=6th |publisher=A&amp;C Black| page=147| isbn=978-0-7136-7759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
Epithets are sometimes attached to a person's name or appear in place of his or her name, as what might be described as a glorified nickname or [[sobriquet]].  An epithet is linked to its noun by long-established usage.  Not every adjective is an epithet. An epithet is especially recognizable when its function is largely decorative, such as if "cloud-gathering Zeus" is employed other than in reference to conjuring up a storm. "The epithets are decorative insofar as they are neither essential to the immediate context nor modeled especially for it.  Among other things, they are extremely helpful to fill out a half-verse", [[Walter Burkert]] has noted.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, W. ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture of the Early Archaic Age'', 1992, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some epithets are known by the Latin term ''epitheton necessarium'' because they are required to distinguish the bearers, e.g. as an alternative to numbers after a prince's name—such as Richard the Lionheart ([[Richard I of England]]), or [[Charles the Fat]] alongside [[Charles the Bald]]. The same epithet can be used repeatedly joined to different names, e.g. [[Alexander the Great]] as well as [[Constantine the Great]].

Other epithets can easily be omitted without serious risk of confusion, and are therefore known (again in Latin) as ''epitheton ornans''. Thus the classical Roman author Virgil systematically called his main hero ''pius Aeneas'', the epithet being ''pius'', which means religiously observant, humble and wholesome, as well as calling the armsbearer of Aeneas ''fidus Achates'', the epithet being ''fidus'', which means faithful or loyal.

There are also specific types of epithets, such as the ''[[kenning]]'' which appears in works such as ''[[Beowulf]]''. An example of a kenning would be using the term ''[[whale-road]]'' instead of the word "sea".

==Literature==
Epithets are characteristic of the style of ancient [[epic poetry]], notably in that of [[Homer]] or the northern European sagas (see above, as well as ''[[Epithets in Homer]]'').  When [[James Joyce]] uses the phrase "the snot-green sea" he is playing on Homer's familiar epithet "the wine-dark sea". The phrase "Discreet Telemachus" is also considered an epithet.

The Greek term [[antonomasia]], in rhetoric, means substituting any epithet or phrase for a proper name, as ''Pelides'', signifying the "son of Peleus", to identify Achilles. An opposite substitution of a proper name for some generic term is also sometimes called ''antonomasia'', as a Cicero for an orator. The use of a father's name or ancestor's name, such as "Pelides" in the case of Achilles, or "Saturnia" in the case of the goddess Juno in Vergil's ''Aeneid'', is specifically called a patronymic device and is in its own class of epithet.

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', epithets are used in the prologue, used in "star-cross'd lovers" and "death-mark'd love."

Epithets were in layman's terms glorified nicknames that could be used to represent one's style, artistic nature, or even geographical reference. They originated to simply serve the purpose of dealing with names that were hard to pronounce or just unpleasant.&lt;ref name=LKW&gt;Wheeler, L. K. "Epithets", web.cn.edu, [[Carson-Newman College]]; accessed 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It from there went to something that could be very significant assigned by elders or counterparts to represent one's position in the community or it could be a representation of whomever one wanted to be or thought he was.&lt;ref&gt;Headlam, W. "The Classic Review." jstor.org. Cambridge University Press, accessed 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The elegance of this movement was used throughout history and even modern day with many examples ranging from "Aphrodite the Heavenly &amp; Zeus the Protector of Guests" all the way to "Johnny Football &amp; King James".&lt;ref name=LKW /&gt;

[[American comic book]]s tend to give epithets to [[superhero]]es, such as [[The Phantom]] being "The Ghost Who Walks", [[Superman]] called "The Man of Steel", and "The Dynamic Duo" [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], who are individually known as "The Dark Knight" and "The Boy Wonder".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Don. ''All in Color for a Dime'', Volume 25, p. 77. Arlington House, 1970. {{ISBN|0870000624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, epíteto, the Spanish version of epithet, is commonly used throughout poems in Castilian literature.

==Religion==
In many [[polytheistic]] religions, such as those of ancient Greece and Rome, a deity's epithets generally reflected a particular aspect of that god's essence and role, for which his influence may be obtained for a specific occasion: Apollo ''Musagetes'' is "[[Apollo]], [as] leader of the [[Muse]]s" and therefore patron of the arts and sciences&lt;ref&gt;Hence the word ''mouseion'' = [[museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Phoibos'' Apollo is the same deity, but as shining sun-god. "[[Athena]] protects the city as ''polias'', oversees handicrafts as ''ergane'', joins battle as ''[[Athena Promachos|promachos]]'' and grants victory as ''nike''."&lt;ref name=special&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard University Press, 1985) III.4.4. "The special character of Greek anthropomorphism", especially p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively the epithet may identify a particular and ''localized'' aspect of the god, such as a reference to the mythological place of birth or [[Numen|numinous presence]] at a specific sanctuary: sacrifice might be offered on one and the same occasion to Pythian Apollo (''Apollo Pythios'') and Delphic Apollo (''Apollo Delphinios''). A localizing epithet refers simply to a particular center of veneration and the cultic tradition there, as the god manifested at a particular festival, for example: Zeus Olympios, Zeus as present at Olympia, or Apollo Karneios, Apollo at the Spartan [[Carneian festival]].

Often the epithet is the result of fusion of the Olympian divinity with an older one: [[Erectheus|Poseidon Erechtheus]], [[Artemis Orthia]], reflect intercultural equations of a divinity with an older one, that is generally considered its pendant; thus most Roman gods and goddesses, especially the [[Twelve Olympians]], had traditional counterparts in Greek, Etruscan, and most other Mediterranean pantheons, such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as head of the Olympian Gods with [[Zeus]], but in specific cults there may be a different equation, based on one specific aspect of the divinity. Thus the Greek word ''Trismegistos'': "thrice grand" was first used as a Greek name for the Egyptian god of science and invention, [[Thoth]], and later as an ''epitheton'' for the Greek [[Hermes]] and, finally, the fully equated Roman Mercurius [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (both were messenger of the gods). Among the Greeks, T. H. Price notes&lt;ref&gt;Price, T. H. ''Kourotrophos'', 1978, noted by Burkert 1985:184.&lt;/ref&gt; the nurturing power of ''Kourotrophos'' might be invoked in sacrifices and recorded in inscription, without specifically identifying [[Hera]] or [[Demeter]].

Some epithets were applied to several deities of a same pantheon rather accidentally if they had a common characteristic, or deliberately, emphasizing their blood- or other ties; thus in pagan Rome, several divinities gods, and heroes were given the ''epitheton'' ''[[Comes]]'' as companion of another (usually major) divinity. An epithet can even be meant for collective use, e.g. in Latin ''pilleati'' 'the felt hat-wearers' for the brothers [[Castor and Pollux]]. Some epithets resist explanation.&lt;ref name=special /&gt;

Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, and other Christians practice the use of epithets in the veneration of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] (e.g., "Christ"; "[[Christian messianic prophecies|Prince of Peace]]"; "[[Good Shepherd|The Good Shepherd]]"), of [[Mary, Mother of Jesus]] (e.g. "[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]"; "[[Panagia]]"), and of the saints (e.g. "[[Pope John Paul II|Pope Saint John Paul the Great]]"). "[[Our Lady of Lourdes]]" is essentially [[periphrasis]], except where some aspect of the Virgin is invoked.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Rhetoric==

An epithet is an adjective or adjectival phrase that characterizes a place, a thing, or a person that helps make the characteristics of this thing more prominent. These descriptive phrases can be used in a positive or negative way that benefits the orator. "It will generally happen, that the Epithets employed by a skillful orator, will be found to be, in fact, so many abridged arguments, the force of which is sufficiently conveyed by a mere hint; e.g. if any one says, 'We ought to take warning from the bloody revolution of France,' the Epithet suggests one of the reasons for our being warned; and that, not less clearly, and more forcibly, than if the argument had been stated at length."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whately|first1=Richard|title=Elements of Rhetoric|date=1841|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With persuasion being a key component of rhetoric, it is rational to use epithets. The use of persuasive wording gives leverage to one's arguments. Knowledge along with descriptive words or phrases can be a powerful tool. This is supported in Bryan Short's article when he states, "The New Rhetoric derives its empiricist flavor from a pervasive respect for clarity and directness of language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Short|first=Bryan|title=Figurative Language in the Scottish New Rhetoric Figurative Language in the Scottish New Rhetoric|journal=Language Sciences|volume=22|year=2000|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetors use epithets to direct their audience to see their point of view, using verbal forms of imagery as a persuasive tactic.

Orators have a variety of epithets that they can employ that have different meanings.  The most common are fixed epithets and transferred epithets. A fixed epithet is the repetitive use of the same word or phrase for the same person or object. A transferred epithet qualifies a noun other than the person or thing it is describing.  This is also known as a hypallage. This can often involves shifting a modifier from the animate to the inanimate; for example, "cheerful money"and "suicidal sky".

Orators take special care when using epithets as to not use them as smear words.  Orators could be accused of racial or abusive epithets if used incorrectly. American journalist [[William Safire]] discussed the use of the word in a 2008 column in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "'I am working on a piece about nationalism with a focus on epithet as a smear word,' writes David Binder, my longtime Times colleague, 'which was still a synonym for 'delineation' or 'characterization' in my big 1942 Webster’s but now seems to be almost exclusively a synonym for ‘derogation’ or ‘smear word.’ . . . In the past century, [epithet] blossomed as 'a word of abuse,' today gleefully seized upon to describe political smears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Safire|first1=William|title=Presents of the Mind|journal=The New York Times|date=June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and military==
In historical, journalistic, and other writings, epithets often carry a political message. These differ from official titles as they express no legal status; however, they may confer prestige, especially if bestowed by an authority or legislature, and may be used for propaganda purposes. Examples of such epithets are the various traditions of [[victory title]]s awarded to generals and rulers or to entire military units, such as the adjective 'Fidelis' ('loyal') bestowed on various Roman legions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">A '''flow show''' is a device on a [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] that is attached to the [[flow line]] and has a paddle that swings out as the flow of [[drilling fluid]] passes by it. The angle of the paddle increases as the volume of drilling fluid increases and pushes it out further and vice versa.

The purpose of the flow show is to allow the driller (and other rig personnel) to monitor the flow of drilling fluid as it comes out of the hole. The reason for monitoring the flow:

*If a high pressure zone is drilled and overcomes the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the fluid or gas in the high-pressure zone will begin to enter the [[borehole]] and increase the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before the flow becomes critical.
*If a low pressure zone is drilled and is overcome by the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the low pressure zone may begin to ''take'' fluid and decrease the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before losing too much drilling fluid (which is typically very expensive) down the hole and/or losing so much fluid that the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the (decreasing) column of mud becomes so low that a blowout situation becomes imminent.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram of a drilling rig.

A '''forwarding agent''' was an intermediary who facilitated the routing of [[international mail]] before the development of the modern [[postal system]].

==History==
In the early days of postal communications it was often necessary for international mail to pass through a number of hands before reaching its eventual destination. At each stage the agent would add their own mark. For instance, a letter might pass first through the sender's domestic post office's hands, then to a forwarder for a sea journey and then to the post office of the destination country.

The study of the marks of forwarding agents on mail is a popular branch of [[postal history]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2632">'''Francesc Candel Tortajada''' (May 31, 1925 in [[Casas Altas]] &amp;ndash; November 23, 2007 in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]), usually known as well as '''Paco Candel''', was a Valencian-born writer and journalist who lived most of his life in [[Barcelona]].

He was born in a town of the Spanish-speaking comarca of [[Rincón de Ademuz]], Valencia. When he was a little child, his family moved to Barcelona.

Most of his contributions are devoted to studying the 20th-century Spanish migrations in the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]].

The book which made him famous was ''Els altres catalans'' (''The Other Catalans'' in Catalan), a journalistic and sociological study about the immigration, which heavily influenced final decisions of the [[Assemblea de Catalunya]] in 1971.
He wrote severals novels, tales, essays and articles. He also collaborated in several newspapers and magazines such as [[Tele/eXprés]], [[Serra d'Or]] or [[Avui]]. He collaborated with [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (PSUC). In 1977, he was elected as senator in the [[Spanish Courts]] for Barcelona demarcation in [[Entesa dels Catalans]] candidature. In 1979, he became town councilor of [[Hospitalet de Llobregat]] as independent for PSUC, where he assumed the Culture department.

In 1983 he received the [[Creu de Sant Jordi]]. In 2003, [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] conceded him its Golden Medal.

He died, after a long illness.

{{Politics sidebar}}
In politics, '''gridlock''' or '''deadlock''' or '''political stalemate''' refers to a situation when there is difficulty passing laws that satisfy the needs of the people. A government is gridlocked when the ratio between bills passed and the [[Political agenda|agenda]] of the legislature decreases. Laws may be considered as the supply and the legislative agenda as demand. Gridlock can occur when two legislative houses, or the executive branch and the legislature are controlled by different political parties, or otherwise cannot [[Consensus decision-making|agree]].

==United States==
{{See also|United States Presidents and control of Congress}}
[[File:Justice Antonin Scalia on Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances.webm|thumb|300px|[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] about the Gridlock caused by the [[separation of powers]] and checks and balances of the U.S. Government]]
George Brown, John A Macdonald, George Etienne Cartier, Francis Hinks, Robert Baldwin says in [[politics of the United States|United States politics]], gridlock frequently refers to occasions when the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate]] are controlled by different parties, or by a different party than the party of the [[President of the United States|President]]. Gridlock may also occur within the Senate, when no party has a [[filibuster]]-proof majority.

"Political Gridlock" by author Ned Witting identifies many of the causes of gridlock in the United States and outlines ways to get government working again.

Law professors such as [[Sanford Levinson]] and [[Adrian]], as well as political commentators such as [[Matthew Yglesias]], have criticized the U.S. Constitution and Senate voting rules for enVerme,{{elucidate|date=March 2015}} as well as political commentators such as [[Debbie Parks]], have criticized the U.S. Constitution and Senate voting rules for enabling situations of legislative gridlock. Along these lines, David Brady, a professor of [[Political Science]] at [[Stanford University]], and Craig Volden, a professor of Public Policy and Politics at the [[University of Virginia]], explain gridlock by pointing to two interrelated factors: first, "the preferences of members of Congress regarding particular policies" and second, "supermajority institutions - the Senate [[filibuster]] and the presidential [[veto]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=David|last2=Volden|first2=Craig|title=Revolving Gridlock: Politics and Policy from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush|date=2006|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they argue, gridlock is not determined by party control of the government, but rather by an interplay between the existing policy and the spectrum of individual preferences held by congressional representatives. They maintain, in essence, that "the policy preferences of Members of Congress at or near the median are among the crucial determinants of policy outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=David|last2=Volden|first2=Craig|title=Revolving Gridlock: Politics and Policy from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush|date=2006|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus Ethridge, an emeritus professor of Political Science at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], argues in a 2011 policy analysis published by the [[libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] that the [[US Constitution]] was designed to foster gridlock in order to increase "the likelihood that policies will reflect broad, unorganized interests instead of the interests of narrow, organized groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ethridge|first1=Marcus|title=The Case for Gridlock|date=Jan 27, 2011|publisher=The Cato Institute|location=Washington, DC|page=1|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA672.pdf|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethridge presented an extended version of his analysis in "The Case for Gridlock: Democracy, Organized Power, and the Legal Foundations of American Government" (2010), which argues that "progressive reformers sought to shift the power to shape policy from the legislative branch to the executive bureaucracy" in an attempt to limit the power of special interests, but that this strategy backfired because of "the ability of interest groups to infiltrate the bureaucracy and promote their interests, often in ways diametrically opposed to the reformers' intentions" and "the capacity of Congress to overcome the influence of groups and generate policy change." In order to counter this, Ethridge suggests a "return to the 'constitutional principle' of gridlock, in which special interests must compete in a legislative forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=SQ|title=The case for gridlock: democracy, organized power, and the legal foundations of American government [review]|journal=Choice|date=Nov 2010|volume=48|issue=3|page=593|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/762460946/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Westminster systems==
In parliamentary systems based on the [[Westminster system]], parliamentary deadlocks may arise when an election results in neither or none of the major political parties having the numbers in the lower house (the house where the government is formed) to form a government, or when the votes in a lower house of parliament are so close that a government cannot be sure of getting its legislation passed through the house, or when another party (usually referred to as the opposition party) controls a majority of votes in the upper house. 
(Example, Two friends in a group of two, both have different ideas but neither one wants to do the others idea, that is what you could call political deadlock)

A recent innovation has been to remove the power of the upper house to block supply, as well as some other bills.

The [[Australian Constitution]] provides a mechanism for breaking a deadlock between the two houses of Parliament, by means of a [[double dissolution]] and, if the deadlock is still not resolved, by a [[joint sitting]] of both houses of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Section 57 of the Australian Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11604">'''GrubStreet, Inc.''' is a non-profit creative writing center located in the heart of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Through various workshops, seminars, events and programs, GrubStreet supports writers at all stages of development. According to GrubStreet's website, its mission is "to be an innovative, rigorous, and welcoming community for writers who together create their best work, find audience, and elevate the literary arts for all."&lt;ref name="whatIsGrubStreet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=2 | title=What Is Grub Street? | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was founded, 53 instructors and 22 students have successfully published their books.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/07/04/empowering_writers/ | title=Empowering writers | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=July 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Gardner, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those include [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestselling]] author [[Jenna Blum]].

==History==

GrubStreet was founded in 1997 in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. Founder [[Eve Bridburg]] opened GrubStreet as a place for anyone interested in creative writing to gain instruction and guidance. At first, GrubStreet only offered fiction workshops, had two instructors (Bridburg one of them) and eight students. GrubStreet demonstrated early success when, a year later in 1998, [[HarperCollins]] published student [[Jamie Katz]]'s mystery novel ''Dead Low Tide''. By 2001 GrubStreet had nearly 100 students, more than a dozen instructors, and courses in poetry, screenwriting, nonfiction, and playwriting. GrubStreet became a fully accredited nonprofit in 2002.&lt;ref name="phoenix"/&gt;

Since then, GrubStreet has taught over 10,000 Boston-area writers of all levels and has put over $1 million into the pockets of writers. It has a fully staffed office overlooking [[Boston Common]] in downtown Boston and operates on an annual budget of $800,000, funded by grants, donations, and membership dues. New books affiliated with GrubStreet include: [[Jenna Blum]]'s ''The Stormchasers''; [[Jonathan Papernick]]'s ''There is No Other''; [[Lynne Reeves Griffin|Lynne Griffin]]'s ''Sea Escape''; [[Michelle Hoover]]'s "The Quickening;" [[Marianne Leone]]'s ''Knowing Jesse''; [[Bruce Machart]]'s ''The Wake of Forgiveness''; [[Randy Susan Meyers]]'s ''The Murderer's Daughters'' and ''The Comfort Of Lies''; [[Amy MacKinnon]]'s ''Tethered''; [[Lisa Genova]]'s ''[[Still Alice]]''; and [[Daphne Kalotay]]'s ''Russian Winter'', Nichole Bernier's ''The Unfinished Work of Elizabeth D'', Julie Wu's forthcoming ''The Third Son'' and [[Henriette Power Lazaridis]]' forthcoming ''Clean Monday''.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

==Workshops==

GrubStreet does not offer any writing degrees. Rather, it provides writing instruction that is comparable to an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] program. The pedagogy is, in effect, to offer classes in both the "muse" (inspiration) and "marketplace" (how to get published). The writing workshops --- courses in poetry, fiction, essay, narrative nonfiction, as well as screen and playwriting --- are run like traditional writing workshops, with weekly group critiques of student work, led by the instructor. Classes in the "Writing Life" (time management, blogging, writer's block, etc.) and publishing and promotion (such as classes on submitting to agents or planning book tours) help writers address the marketplace aspects of their writing careers. Courses can be one-night seminars, weekend workshops, or 6- or 10-week-long workshops.

==Membership==

GrubStreet classes are open to all, however the membership provides discounts and benefits. Members, called “Grubbies,” are given discounts on courses, as well as benefit from discounts at all Boston [[independent bookstore]]s. Further benefits include discounts on theatre tickets, magazine subscriptions, free access to the GrubStreet space and library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=34 | title=join grub street | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muse &amp; the Marketplace==

GrubStreet’s signature event, The Muse and the Marketplace, is a three-day, weekend-long writer’s symposium. It is known for attracting acclaimed authors, agents, and editors to its programs.  Hugely successful, the [[Boston Globe]] calls it the “highlight of the Boston literary scene”.&lt;ref name="bostonGlobe2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/05/04/novices_peek_at_literary_world/ | title=Novices peek at literary world | work=The Boston Globe | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=McKenna, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attended by over 900 writers and publishing professionals.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

Over the three days, prominent authors lead craft seminars, while agents, editors, and publicists lead sessions on the business aspects of writing. There is also a Manuscript Mart, where writers meet one-on-one with an agent or editor for personalized feedback.  Various seminars, lectures, and panels about creative writing and the business of writing are held.

Many bestselling authors and renowned agents and editors have been involved with GrubStreet’s Muse and the Marketplace. In 2010, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] was the keynote speaker. Other people of note include: [[Steve Almond]], Jessica Shattuck, Jeanne Leiby, Richard Abate, Elyse Cheney, Lynne Barrett, Martha Southgate, Christina Thompson, Jenni Ferrari-Alder, Lisa Grubka, [[Maud Casey]], [[Ben Percy]], Miriam Altshuler, PJ Mark, Vestal McIntyre, Michael Downing, Joseph Olsham, Elizabeth Evans, Tim Bartlett, Susan Tiberghien, Lauren Grodstein, Leslea Newman, Reagan Arthur, Regina Brooks, Joanna Volpe, [[Ann Hood]], Allison Winn Scotch, Christine Pride, Stephany Evans, Mitchell Waters, [[Jennifer 8.

==Programs==

===Memoir Project===

Working with the city of Boston, GrubStreet founded the Memoir Project in 2006, which involves older residents in 10 Boston neighborhoods, including [[Nantucket]], to write. The joint effort aims at teaching and encouraging the elderly to use writing as a creative outlet as well as document and preserve their stories for future generations.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt; Neighborhoods involved include: Chinatown, Charlestown, East Boston, Mattapan, Roxbury, [[South Boston]], and the [[North End, Boston|North End]]. Two anthologies of collected works have been published: ''Born Before Plastic'' and “My Legacy Is Simply This: Stories From Boston’s Most Endearing Neighborhoods.” Another anthology is to be published.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt;

===Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP)===

GrubStreet’s Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP) offers free writing workshops for all Boston-area teenagers. The program consists of monthly, 4-hour workshops during a Saturday at the downtown offices. Workshops range from poetry and fiction to graphic novel and are taught by Grub Street instructors.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=22 | title=Young Adult Writers Program | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; YAWP has been recognized as the hub for creative writing teenagers in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ethangilsdorf.com/storage/portrait%20of%20young%20bards.pdf | title=Portrait of the young bards | work=The Boston Globe | date=December 24, 2006 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Junge, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer Teen Fellowship===

GrubStreet runs the YAWP Teen Writing Fellowship, an intensive three-week creative writing program during the summer. Accepted teens are immersed in the writers’ life of craft and publishing: they work with published authors, meet with agents and editors, and receive a stipend for their commitment. GrubStreet aims to mimic writers’ residencies, thus the YAWP Fellowship is by application only. About 20 students are accepted each summer.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP" /&gt;

==National Book Prize==

The GrubStreet Book Prize is awarded three times a year to a writer publishing his/her second or beyond.  As the goal of the prize is to bring writers to Boston, only writers whose primary residence is not Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, or Rhode Island are eligible. Though merit is the most important criterion, authors publishing with small presses, writers of short stories, and writers of color are encouraged to apply. 
Winners of the Book Prize each receive $1000, as well as a book party at GrubStreet’s downtown location and co-sponsored by an independent bookstore. Winners will also lead a seminar of his or her choice, with accommodations, travel, and board provided for by GrubStreet. Fiction and non-fiction winners are invited as guest authors to the next Muse and the Marketplace.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP" /&gt;

'''Gwara''' is a newly discovered [[Plateau languages|Plateau language]] of [[Nigeria]]. It was first reported by [[Roger Blench]] in 2009. There are marked similarities with the related language [[Idun language|Idun]], but some of these may be due to borrowing.&lt;ref name=Blench&gt;Roger Blench (2009), "[http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/BC/Plateau/Koro/Gwara%20wordlist.pdf Gwara, an unknown language of Central Nigeria]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In functional-[[cognitive linguistics]], as well as in [[semiotics]], '''iconicity''' is the conceived [[wikt:similarity|similarity]] or [[analogy]] between the form of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] (linguistic or otherwise) and its [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], as opposed to [[arbitrariness]].

Iconic principles:
*Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexity
*Proximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distance
*Sequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chain

==Quantity principle==
The use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as "{{not a typo|looong}}". It is also common to use [[reduplication]] to iconically mark increase, as [[Edward Sapir]] is quoted, “The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance” (1921:79). This has been confirmed by the comparative studies of Key (1965) and Moravcsik (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen, for example, in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], where ''{{lang|am|täsäbbärä}}'' means "it was broken" and ''{{lang|am|täsäbb'''ab'''ärä}}'' means that "it was shattered".

Iconic coding principles may be [[natural]] tendencies in language and are also part of our [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[biology|biological]] make-up. Whether iconicity is a part of language is an open debate in linguistics. For instance, [[Haspelmath]] has argued against iconicity, claiming that most iconic phenomena can be explained by frequency biases: since simpler meanings tend to be more frequent in the language use they tend to lose phonological material.

[[Onomatopoeia]] (and [[mimesis]] more broadly) may be seen as a kind of iconicity, though even onomatopoeic sounds have a large degree of arbitrariness.

==The evolution of language==
[[Derek Bickerton]] has posited that iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the evolution of human language. [[Animal communication]] systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of [[Indexicality|indexical]] (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, "most words are symbolic, and&amp;nbsp;... without symbolic words we couldn’t have language". The distinction Bickerton draws between these categories is one of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], with the indexical signs of animal communication systems having no capacity for displacement, and the symbolic signs of human language requiring it. Iconic signs, however, "may or may not have it depending on how they’re used&amp;nbsp;... iconicity, therefore, is the most probable road that our ancestors took into language".

Using a [[Niche construction|niche-construction]] view of human evolution, Bickerton has hypothesized that human ancestors used iconic signs as recruitment signals in the scavenging of dead [[megafauna]]. This process "would have created new words and deployed old words in new contexts, further weakening the uncoupling of words from situations, from current occurrence—even from fitness", and thus allowing for the creation of symbolic language.&lt;ref name="Bickerton (2009)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bickerton |first=Derek |title=Adam's Tongue: How Humans Made Language, How Language Made Humans |year=2009 |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780809022816 |pages=52–53, 218–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'', [[Terrence Deacon]] argues that the emanation of symbolic capacities unique to language was a critical factor in the evolution of the human brain, and that these symbolic capacities are vital to differentiating animal from human forms of communication, processes of learning, and brain anatomy. "The doorway into this virtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language, because language is not merely a mode of communication, it is also the outward expression of an unusual mode of thought—symbolic representation."&lt;ref name="Deacon (1997)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deacon |first=Terrence |title=The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Human Brain |year=1997 |publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press |isbn=978-0-393-03838-5 |chapter=1 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls and gestures==
Iconic calls and gestures mimic the forms of the things they stand for (such as outlining shapes or moving your hands back and forth multiple times to show repetition.) Iconic calls and gestures are not formally considered [[language]], or language-like communication in that they do not contrast or possess arbitrary characteristics. Noises that imitate sounds of the surrounding environment ([[ideophone]]s) are also iconic. Though humans possess a repertoire of iconic calls and gestures, other [[mammal]]s produce few iconic signals. Despite this, a few captive [[chimpanzee]]s have shown the beginning stages of iconicity. Burling ''et al.'' states: "Chimpanzees in the wild do not point, and rarely do so in captivity, however there is a documented case of one named [[Kanzi]], described by Savage-Rumbaugh et al., who could indicate direction of travel by "extending his hand". Another chimpanzee, Viki (Hayes and Nissen 1971:107) made motions of kneading or ironing when she wanted to knead dough or iron napkins. [[Waggle dance|Bee dances]] are another example of iconicity in [[animal communication|animal communication systems]].&lt;ref name="Burling1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burling |first=Robbins |title=Primate Calls, Human Language, and Nonverbal Communication {{bracket|and Comments and Reply}} |journal=Current Anthropology |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=February 1993 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=30–31 |jstor=2743729 |doi=10.1086/204132 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sign languages==
Iconicity is often argued to play a large role in the production and perception of [[gesture]]. Proposed ways in which iconicity is achieved is through [http://jeroenarendsen.nl/2007/04/hands-that-act-embody-model-and-draw/ Hands that Act, Embody, Model, and Draw]. In sign languages iconicity was often argued to be largely confined to sign formation (comparable to [[onomatopoeia]]). Some proponents believe that iconicity does not play an actual role in perception and production of signs once they have undergone phonological reduction and become part of the conventionalized vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Frishburg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, as sign language researchers gain confidence (and the fear of losing linguistic status subsidies), the possible role of iconicity is being evaluated again. Current research on sign language phonology acknowledges that certain aspects are semantically motivated. Further, the ability to modify sign meaning through phonological changes to signs is gaining attention. The ability to work creatively with sign language in this way has been associated with accomplished, or native signers.

Iconicity is expressed in the grammatical structure of [[sign languages]] called classifiers. These are used to give descriptive information about a subject or verb. In [[American Sign language]] (ASL) a grammatical marker denoting “intensity” is characterized by a movement pattern with two parts: an initial pause, followed by a quick completion. When this pattern is added to the adjective GOOD the resulting meaning is VERY-GOOD.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The ASL marker for "intensity" is iconic in that the intended meaning (building of pressure, a sudden release) is matched by the articulatory form (a pause, a quick completion).

Like in vocal languages, developmental trends in ASL shy away from iconicity in favor of arbitrariness. These changes "contribute toward symmetry, fluidity, locational displacement and assimilation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frishberg |first=Nancy |title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language |journal=Language |date=September 1975 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=696–719 |doi=10.2307/412894 |jstor=412894 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sign WE used to contain the sign for each individual being described by the WE. So the signer would sign ME + YOU&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; + YOU&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; + YOU &lt;small&gt;n&lt;/small&gt; + ME. Now the sign has turned into a smooth symbolic sign where the signer makes two touches on the chest, one on each side, with a sweep of the wrist in between.

==Poetry==
Iconicity often occurs within poetry through the use of onomatopoeia, which may be called auditory iconicity. Sometimes, though, the form of the poem resembles or enacts the poem's content, and in this case, a visual iconicity is present. One poet well known for his visual poems, and therefore visual iconicity, is [[E. E. Cummings]]. A subset of visual iconicity involves a spatial iconicity. For instance, in Cummings's grasshopper poem ("r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r") the word "arriving" begins on the far right of the poem with the "a", the "r" is near the middle of the poem, and the rest of the word is on the left of the poem. The reader must travel a great distance across the poem, therefore, in order to "arrive". The spatial dimension, then, can relate to a temporal dimension. In the poems "The Fish" and "The Moose" by Elizabeth Bishop, temporal iconicity is at work. The amount of time it takes to read "The Fish" coincides with the length of time a fish could live outside of water; likewise, the duration of the long bus ride in "The Moose" coincides with the poem's long first sentence as well as the twenty-some stanzas it takes before the passengers on the bus (and the reader) actually encounters the moose.

==Folk etymology==
Iconicity occurs in rejective [[phono-semantic matching]]. "Consider Lithuanian [[Ashkenazic Hebrew]] רע דם ''ra dom'' (cf. [[Yiddish]] ''ra dam''), lit. 'of bad blood' (from [[Hebrew]] רע דם ''ra` dam'' 'of bad blood'). This is a toponymic rejective phono-semantic matching of [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[Radom]]'', the name of a town in Poland (approximately {{convert|100|km}} south of [[Warsaw]]), or of its [[Yiddish]] adaptation ''ródem'' (see [[Uriel Weinreich]] 1955: 609, [[Paul N. Wexler|Paul Wexler]] 1991: 42). Thus, if a pogrom had occurred in Radom, it would surely have been rationalized by ''ra dam'' ‘of bad blood’. Obviously, providing such an [[folk etymology|etymythological]] explanation for the pogrom was regarded by some Jews as a mere play on words. However, others might have conceived of ''ra dam'' as having deep intrinsic truth, which might have been religiously and homiletically based. One should not forget that at that time it was a common belief that all languages were God-created and that Hebrew was the divine ''Ursprache''."&lt;ref name="See p 2006 pp. 237-258"&gt;See p. 246 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]] (2006), "'[[folk etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective", ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'', edited by [[Tope Omoniyi]] and [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language acquisition==
It has been suggested that iconicity can be used in the teaching of languages. There are two ways this has been suggested. The first being “Horizontal-Iconicity” and the second being vowel magnitude relationships. Horizontal-Iconicity is the phenomenon of opposition of meaning and spelling. For example, in [[Egypt]]ian mer, which means right hand and rem, which means left hand. Because people are more likely to remember things they have more [[Mnemonic]] tags for, it is suggested that it may be helpful to point these things out in the teaching of language.&lt;ref name="Croft 1978"&gt;Croft (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowel magnitude==
Vowel magnitude relationships suggest that, the larger the object, the more likely its name has open vowels such as {{IPAslink|ɒ}}, {{IPAslink|eɪ}}, and {{IPAslink|æ}}; the smaller the object, the more likely its name has closed vowel sounds such as {{IPAslink|iː}}, {{IPAslink|ʊ}}, and {{IPAc-en|j|uː}}. Open vowel sounds are also more likely to be associated with round shapes and dark or gloomy moods, where closed vowel sounds are more likely to be associated with pointed shapes and happy moods.&lt;ref name="Croft 1978"/&gt;

A test run by [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]] asked subjects to differentiate between two different sized tables using invented word pairs such as "mal" and "mil". He discovered a word containing {{IPA|[a]}} was at four times more likely to be judged as larger if paired with a word containing {{IPA|[i]}}. Nuckolls states: "Newman discovered that&amp;nbsp;... as the tongue recedes in articulating vowels from the front to the back of the mouth, and as acoustic frequencies become lower, the vowels are judged to be larger and darker". Bentley and Varron (1933) ran tests asking subjects to differentiate between vowel sounds without providing them, beforehand, contrasting attributes (such as bright and dark.) They found only moderate success rates that decreased when vowel sounds were closer in tone. However, they still found that {{IPA|[a]}} sounds were judged larger or lower than {{IPA|[i]}} sounds.&lt;ref name="Nuckolls 1999 230, 231, 246"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nuckolls |first=Janis B. |title=The Case for Sound Symbolism |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |year=1999 |volume=28 |pages=230–231, 246 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], examples from degree adjectives, such as long, longer, longest, show that the most extreme degree of length is iconically represented by the word with the greatest number of [[phoneme]]s. [[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]] cites examples of word order mimicking the natural order of ideas. In fact, iconicity is now widely acknowledged to be a significant factor at many levels of linguistic structure.&lt;ref name="Nuckolls 1999 230, 231, 246"/&gt;

==Digital media==
Over a seven-year span, [[Marc Davis (academic)|Marc Davis]], Brian Williams, and Golan Levin have managed to develop their own iconic visual language. The creation of their program called [[Media Streams]] was derived from a need and a desire to have a universal language when creating videos. Media accessibility is becoming easier to obtain by the day, and with this growth new development in the field is bound to happen.

Media production was once limited to an elite group of individuals who spent a large portion of their time taking courses and specializing in the art. Now with the technological advancements and internet use of today, much of the skill can be learned out of your own home. As Marc Davis would say, just as the [[printing press]] was given to the users via [[Desktop Publishing]], media production can now, also, be given to these same users. [[Streaming media]] is vastly growing and the manipulation and reconstruction of this hot trend is more than needed and necessary to keep the diversity coming.

From 1991 to 1997, Marc Davis and his colleagues worked out of the Machine Understanding Group of the MIT Laboratory and the [[Interval Research Corporation]] to create their media streams program.

Media Streams "{{bracket|i}}s a system for annotating, retrieving, repurposing, and automatically assembling digital video". (Davis; Media Streams) The system uses a stream based, semantic representation of video content with an [[iconic visual language]] interface of hierarchically structured and searchable primitives.

The goal of this system is to address the problems of annotation convergence and human-computer communication. Developing the iconic visual language was necessary to assist the computational reading and writing of representational consensual interpretations of video content in a standardized way. Illiterate, diverse languages and the like will all be able to work with this system due to its [[universal language]].

'''John Henry Mackay''' (6 February 1864 &amp;ndash; 16 May 1933) was an [[egoist anarchist]], thinker and writer. Born in Scotland and raised in Germany, Mackay was the author of ''[[Die Anarchisten]]'' (The Anarchists, 1891) and ''Der Freiheitsucher'' (The Searcher for Freedom, 1921). Mackay was published in the United States in his friend [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s magazine, ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]''. He was a noted [[homosexuality|homosexual]].

==Life==
Mackay was born in [[Greenock]] on February 6, 1864. His mother came from a prosperous [[Hamburg]] family. His father was a Scottish marine insurance broker who died when the child was less than two years old, at which point mother and son returned to Germany, where Mackay grew up.&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;*{{Cite web

Mackay lived in Berlin from 1896 onwards, and became a friend of scientist and Gemeinschaft der Eigenen co-founder [[Benedict Friedlaender]].

Mackay died in Stahnsdorf on 16 May 1933, ten days after the [[Nazi]] [[book burnings]] at the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] had become [[Reichskanzler]] on 30 January 1933, and soon all activities of the German homosexual emancipation movement ceased. Allegations that Mackay's death may have been a suicide have been disputed:

Using the pseudonym '''Sagitta''', Mackay wrote a series of works for [[pederasty|pederastic]] emancipation, titled ''Die Bücher der namenlosen Liebe'' (''Books of the Nameless Love''). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the ''Fenny Skaller'', a story of a pederast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RichardStraussAndJohnHenryMackay "Richard Strauss and John Henry Mackay" by [[Hubert Kennedy]]. Thamyris 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; Under his real name he also published fiction, such as ''Der Schwimmer'' (1901) and, again as Sagitta, he published a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, ''Der Puppenjunge'' (literally "The Boy-Doll", but published in English as ''The Hustler'') (1926). In a note to the American publisher of this book, [[Christopher Isherwood]] said, "It gives a picture of the Berlin sexual underworld early in this century which I know, from my own experience, to be authentic."

[[Richard Strauss]]'s well-known songs from his ''Vier Lieder'' (Op. 27), a wedding gift to his wife in 1894, include settings to music of two of Mackay's poems: ''"[[Morgen!]]"'' and ''"[[Heimliche Aufforderung]]"''.  Other uses of Mackay's poems by Strauss include ''"Verführung"'' (Op. 33 No. 1) and ''"In der Campagna"'' (Op. 41 No. 2).

[[Arnold Schoenberg]] set music to his poem "Am Wegrand."

'''Kembra''' is an [[unclassified language|unclassified]] [[Papuan language]] spoken in [[Western New Guinea]] by some twenty persons. It is used by between 20% and 60% of the ethnic population and is no longer passed down to children.

In 2007, on a  Papuan language website, a Mark Donohue reported that,
:''[[Murkim language|Murkim]] [and] [[Lepki language|Lepki]] [and] Kembra are, along with a number of other languages, unclassified groups living between the main cordillera and Mt. 6234, in the north of Papua near the PNG border (where 'near' = up to about 6 days' walk). They don't appear to be related to each other, based on wordlists, and they don't appear to show external affiliations.''[http://mailman.anu.edu.au/pipermail/papuanlanguages/2007-May/000142.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8647">The '''Linguistic Survey of India''' ('''LSI''') is a comprehensive survey of the [[language]]s of [[British India]], describing 364 languages and [[dialect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-342414/Linguistic-Survey-of-India  "Linguistic Survey of India", ''Britannica Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey was first proposed by [[George Abraham Grierson]], a member of the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] and a linguist who attended the Seventh International Oriental Congress held at Vienna in September 1886. He made a proposal of the linguistic survey and it was initially turned down by the Government of India. After persisting and demonstrating that it could be done using the existing network of government officials at a reasonable cost, it was approved in 1891. It was however formally begun only in 1894 and the survey continued for thirty years with the last of the results being published in 1928.

An on-line searchable database of the LSI&lt;ref&gt;See [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/lsi/ DSAL]&lt;/ref&gt; is available, providing an excerpt for each word as it appeared in Grierson's original publication.  In addition, the [[British Library]] has [[gramophone record]]ings in its sound archive&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpsubject/socsci/socioling/soundrec/sociolingsound.html British Library Sound Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; which document the [[phonology]].

== Method and critiques ==
Grierson made use of Government officers to collect data from across India. He made forms and guidance material for the officers who gathered the information. There were numerous problems in ensuring uniformity of data gathering and clarity of understanding. One officer noted the difficulty even of noting the name of the language from a household. Interviewees would name their language after their caste.&lt;ref name=patil&gt;{{cite book |author=Pandit, Prabodh B. |chapter=The linguistic survey of India - perspectives on language use |pages=71–85 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED104170.pdf#page=77 |year=1975 |editor=Ohannessian, Sirarpi |editor2=Charles A Ferguson |editor3=Edgar C. Polome |title=Language surveys in developing nations: papers and reports on sociolinguistic surveys |place=Arlington, Va. |publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maps and boundaries indicated by Grierson have often been used by political groups seeking reorganizations of state boundaries.&lt;ref name=patil /&gt;

==Subsequent surveys==
A second Linguistic Survey of India project was initiated by the Language Division of Office of the Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner of India in 1984. This project is ongoing and at the end of year 2010 approximately 40% of the survey has been completed. This survey has a limited objective to trace the changes in the linguistic scenario after Grierson’s study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-common/2Sikkim%20pg-i-xvii%20pg-1-23.pdf "Preface, Linguistic Survey of India Sikkim Part-I", ''Language Division, Office of the Registrar General'', INDIA, (November, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Several professional linguists have criticized the project for repeating Grierson's methodological mistakes – like choosing local language teachers or government officials as informants rather than laypersons for collecting the linguistic data.

The 1991 census of India found 1,576 "[[mother tongue]]s" with separate grammatical structures and 1,796 languages classified as "other mother tongues".  Calls for a more complete and exact Linguistic Survey of India soon followed.  It was noted that Grierson's works had relied on untrained field workers and neglected the former province of [[Burma]], [[Madras]] and the then [[princely State]]s of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] and [[Mysore]].  The result was that South India was under-represented in the LSI.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/11/16/stories/2006111603050600.htm   Sharath S. Srivatsa, "New Linguistic Survey of India to begin in April next year", ''The Hindu'' (November 16, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/india/news/article_1236858.php  "New linguistic survey from April 2007", ''Monsters and Critics'' (Dec 26, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of India announced an ambitious project to expand and revise the Linguistic Survey of India.  In the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (India)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (2007–12) Rs. 2.8 billion was sanctioned for the project. It was classified into two sections: a New Linguistic Survey of India and a Survey of Minor and Endangered Languages.  Under the auspices of the Central Institute of Indian Languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciil.org/  Central Institute of Indian Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213203632/http://www.ciil.org/ |date=2004-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mysore, and under the direction of Udaya Narayana Singh, the project was expected to involve over 54 universities, 2,000 investigators and 10,000 linguists and language specialists working over a period of ten years.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"/&gt;

An April 2010 article in the online Times of India&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-04-04/vadodara/28117996_1_survey-report-institute-of-indian-languages-conduct Darshana Chaturvedi, "Phase 1 of survey to map Himalayan languages to begin soon", ''The Times of India'' (April 4, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that the above project has been abandoned but then announces a new initiative following up on the original Grierson survey: the [[People's Linguistic Survey of India]] (PLSI) under the auspices of an NGO called the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, and with [[G N Devy|Ganesh N. Devy]] as Chairperson. The project will begin with a survey of Himalayan languages. Rajesh Sachdeva, director of CIIL at the Bhasha Confluence, said the exercise of New Linguistic Survey of India had to be abandoned with “the government developing cold feet”, in the fear that this survey may lead to revival of [[linguicism]] or [[linguistic imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html  Anosh Malekar, "The case for a linguistic survey", ''Infochange: media,'' August 1, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927215058/http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''local post''' is a [[mail]] service that operates only within a limited geographical area, typically a [[city]] or a single transportation route. Historically, some local posts have been operated by governments, while others, known as '''private local posts''' have been for-profit companies.  Today, many stamp collectors operate '''hobbyists' local posts''', issuing their own postal "stamps" for other collectors but rarely carrying any mail.

== Official local posts ==
Government local posts go back to at least 1680, when the [[Penny Post]] was established in [[London]] to handle intra-city mail delivery at a uniform rate of one penny.

From 1840 onwards, when [[postage stamp]]s were first introduced, special stamps were often issued; for instance the [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s of [[Switzerland]] issued stamps for use within a canton, and inscribed them "Poste-Local" or "Orts-Post". The [[Russia]]n province of [[Cēsis|Wenden]] issued stamps for a local post from 1862 to 1901, while [[Nicaragua]] issued stamps for [[Zelaya (Nicaragua)|Zelaya]] only, due to its use of a different currency.

In rural Russia [[Zemstvo Post]] handled local mail independently of the central government; some of these lasted until the 1917 revolution.

== Private local posts ==
Many countries have had private local posts at one time or another.  Usually these operated with the acquiescence of the government, and at other time in competition. Types of local posts included intra-city systems, transcontinental delivery (such as the [[Pony Express]]), and riverboat routes. Many of these existed for only short periods, and little is known of their operations. Some of their stamps are among the great rarities of philately.

In 1865 the local post distribution company ''Liannos et Cie'' was established in Constantinople to distribute mail arriving in the city which was not addressed in Arabic as the staff of the Ottoman Postal Service were unable to read the Latin alphabet. The stamps were printed by [[Perkins Bacon]] from plates that are now held in the museum of the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]].&lt;ref name=LP1434&gt;"Museum &amp; Archives News: Liannos City Post", ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. 125, No. 1433, March 2016, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 a second service was set up on behalf of the Egyptian post office operating in the city to solve the same problem. Both services were short lived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6HGohkpQI?url=http://www.maidenheadphilatelic.co.uk/index_files/levant.htm The Local Mail Stamps of the British Levant] by Tony Stanford, Maidenhead &amp; District Philatelic Society, 2010. Retrieved 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''Welly Post'' was established as a private carrier of local mail by EJ Teare Newsagents in Wellington, Somerset, United Kingdom. Local delivery was limited to the village of Wellington and 2 1/2 miles outside the village. The service was established after customers complained about the high price of postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Somerset-newsagent-sets-Welly-Post-customers/story-20348613-detail/story.html |title=Somerset newsagent sets up 'Welly Post' after customers complain about the Royal Mail - Western Morning News |publisher=westernmorningnews.co.uk |author=Western Morning News |date=Dec 20, 2013 |accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private local posts of the United States==
Private local posts typically issue their own stamps, which can become collectors' items. These stamps are typically cancelled with special cancellations, and their [[first day of issue]] can be thus commemorated.

===American Letter Mail Company===
In 1844, [[Lysander Spooner]] founded the [[American Letter Mail Company]], competing with the legal monopoly of the United States Post Office (USPO), now the United States Postal Service ([[USPS]]), in violation of the Private Express Statutes. It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.

===Hawai'i Post===
An example of a private modern day local post currently in operation is Hawai'i Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii-post.com/ |title=Hawai'i Post |publisher=Hawaii-post.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Postal System of America===
In 1968, Thomas M. Murray (1927–2003) founded the Independent Postal System of America (IPSA)&lt;ref name="wichitastampclub1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wichitastampclub.org/IPSA.html |title=Independent Postal System of America |publisher=Wichitastampclub.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517115720/http://www.wichitastampclub.org/IPSA.html |archivedate=May 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a nationwide commercial carrier of Third and Fourth Class Mail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838569,00.html |title=A New Postman Cometh - TIME |publisher=Time.com |author=Friday, Aug. 16, 1968 |date=Aug 16, 1968 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in direct competition with the United States Post Office (USPO), now the United States Postal Service (USPS).&lt;ref name="wichitastampclub1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alphabetilately.org/L.html |title=Alphabetilately: L is for Local stamp |publisher=Alphabetilately.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907081,00.html |title=The Private Postmen - TIME |publisher=Jcgi.pathfinder.com |author=Monday, Apr. 02, 1973 |date=Apr 2, 1973 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But in 1971, when the company entered the First Class delivery business, they endured a number of lawsuits brought against them, which finally led to the company's collapse in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/431768 |title=CIO v.

===Rattlesnake Island===
[[Rattlesnake Island (Lake Erie)|Rattlesnake Island]] is an {{convert|85|acre|km2|sing=on}} island located on [[Lake Erie]] near Put-In-Bay, {{convert|11|mi|km}} northeast of [[Port Clinton, Ohio]], and has the only USPS-sanctioned local post operating in the United States. For many years, service was provided by way of a [[Ford Trimotor]] which shuttled mail between the island and the mainland. From 1966 to 1989, USPS mail was routed by way of Port Clinton, Ohio. Today, outgoing mail from the island enters the USPS mail stream by way of [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. Local Post service began in 1966 and continued through 1989, when the island was sold and the new owners discontinued the service. It was restarted in 2005 and continues to the current day.

== Hobbyists' local posts ==
Today's Local Posters issue their local post "stamps", and issue a variety of commemorative "stamps" covering a wide range of events or personal interests, of subjects that are not normally issued by their own countries' postal services.

In some cases these modern day local posts have issued stamp subjects before their own country issued the same subject. The Free State Local Post issued an Audie Murphy stamp long before the U.S. Postal Service issued one of the same subject. The Ascension AAF Local Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacecovers.com/misc/asc_lp_info.htm |title=ASCENSION AAF Local Post Information Sheet - Joe Frasketi's Space Covers |publisher=Spacecovers.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
located on the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean, in 1972 commemorated the anniversary of the first aircraft to land at Ascension Island. This same subject was commemorated by the Ascension Island postal system in 1982.

This sort of local post is effectively a "home-brewed" postal system, and the typical hobbyist carries little, if any, mail (though some do carry mail over a short distance for themselves or a few people).

The Local Post Collectors' Society established in 1972, coordinates communication among local posters. The LPCS issues a regular Bulletin ''The Poster'' to its members around the world, relating stories of local posts, showing new issues and other related items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localcollectorspost.org/ |title=Local Post Collectors Society |publisher=localcollectorspost.org|date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Libs''' is a [[phrasal template]] [[word game]] where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a [[party game]] or as a [[pastime]].

The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of ''Mad Libs'' books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;.

==History==
Mad Libs was invented in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/24160656#.Tx1pFaUS01I |title=As Mad Libs turn 50, play an exclusive game – books – Humor – TODAY.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Leonard B.

While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a [[talent agent]] and an [[actor]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt; According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to "[[ad-lib]]" an upcoming [[interview]]. The agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor's suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be "mad".&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Stern and Price used that [[eavesdrop]]ped conversation to finally create the name "Mad Libs".&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The duo released the first ''Mad Libs'' book themselves in 1958. The first ''Mad Libs'' resembled the earlier games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weekend Edition Saturday |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7584979 |title='Revelations' About a Precursor to 'Mad Libs' |publisher=NPR |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Consequences (game)|consequences]] and [[exquisite corpse]].

Stern was head writer and comedy director for ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', and suggested to the show's host that guests be introduced using Mad Libs completed by the audience. Four days after an episode introduced "our guest NOUN, Bob Hope", bookstores sold out of ''Mad Libs'' books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Leonard|title=The History of Mad Libs|url=http://www.madlibs.com/history/|website=www.madlibs.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern and Price next partnered with [[Larry Sloan]], a high school friend who was working as a [[publicist]] at the time, to continue publishing ''Mad Libs''.&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite news|first=Wendy|last=Werris|title=Obituary: Larry Sloan, 89 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/obituaries/article/54394-obituary-larry-sloan-89.html |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |publisher= |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, the three founded the publishing firm [[Price Stern Sloan]] in the early 1960s as a way to release ''Mad Libs''.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;  In addition to releasing more than 70 editions of ''Mad Libs'' under Sloan, the company also published 150 softcover books, including such notable titles as ''[[How to Be a Jewish Mother]]'', first released in 1964; ''[[Droodles]]'', which was also created by Roger Price; ''The VIP Desk Diary''; and the series, ''World's Worst Jokes''.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;

Price died in 1990, and three years later, Sloan and Stern sold Price Stern Sloan, including ''Mad Libs'', to the former Putnam Berkley Group, which is now known as [[Penguin Random House]].&lt;ref name=pw/&gt; ''Mad Libs'' books are still published by [[Price Stern Sloan]], a division of the [[Penguin Random House]].

Stern, Creator of Mad Libs, Dies at 88 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sloan died on October 14, 2012.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title=Larry Sloan dies at 89; co-founder of 'Mad Libs' publisher|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/17/local/la-me-larry-sloan-20121017 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 110 million copies of ''Mad Libs'' have been sold since the game series was first published in 1958.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==Format==
Mad Libs books contain [[short stories]] on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a [[lexical category|lexical]] or other category, such as "[[noun]]", "[[verb]]", "place", or "part of the body".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/01/09/mad-libs-and-dangling-participles/ |title=Mad Libs and Dangling Participles – SchoolBook |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually [[comedy|comic]], [[surrealism|surreal]] and somewhat [[nonsense|nonsensical]].

Stern and Price's original Mad Libs book gives the following sentence as an example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Roger|title=The Original Mad Libs 1|year=1974|publisher=Price Stern Sloan|isbn=978-0-8431-0055-6|page=3|author2=Leonard Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  "_____________! he said ________ as he jumped into his convertible
    ''exclamation            adverb''
   ______ and drove off with his ___________ wife."
 ''   noun                          adjective''

After completion, they demonstrate that the sentence might read:
&lt;!-- Note that "ouch he said stupidly as he jumped into his convertible cat and drove off with his brave wife." is given here as a direct quote from the original Mad Libs book. Do not change it to something funnier or more fitting. --&gt;
  "&lt;u&gt;'''Ouch'''&lt;/u&gt;! he said &lt;u&gt;'''stupidly'''&lt;/u&gt; as he jumped into his convertible &lt;br&gt;  &lt;u&gt;'''cat'''&lt;/u&gt; and drove off with his &lt;u&gt;'''brave'''&lt;/u&gt; wife."

A [[Mad Libs (game show)|game show called ''Mad Libs'']], with some connections to the game, aired on the [[Disney Channel]] in 1998 and 1999.

Several imitations of Mad Libs have been created, most of them on the [[Internet]]. Imitation Mad Libs are sometimes used in educational settings to help teach the [[parts of speech]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZrUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=80EEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3172,5992183&amp;dq=mad-libs&amp;hl=en |title=Schools Scramble to Prepare Students |publisher= |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=Oct 7, 2002 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">'''Anna Margareta Momma''' [[née]] '''von Bragner''' (1702–1772), was a Swedish [[publisher]], managing [[editing|editor]] and [[journalist]]. She was the writer of the political [[essay]] ''[[Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga]]'', and the editor of the ''[[Stockholm Gazette]]''. Chronologically, she may be counted as the first female journalist in [[Sweden]].

==Early years==
Margareta Momma was born in the Netherlands, possibly as a descendant of French [[Huguenot]]s.

In 1735, she married the Swedish publisher Peter Momma (d. 1772), himself of a Swedish family of Dutch origin, and settled in the Swedish capital of [[Stockholm]]. She was the mother of Petter (1738-1758), Wilhelm (1740-1772) and [[Elsa Fougt]]. Peter Momma was the publisher and editor of popular papers such as the ''Stockholm Gazette'' (1742) and the ''[[Stockholms Weckoblad]]'' (1745), and she played an active part in his business. 

==Career==
Momma was identified as the author behind the French language essay paper ''[[Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga]]'' (English: 'Conversation between the Shadow of Argus and the unfamiliar Shadow of a Female'), or popularly ''Samtal'' (Conversation), which has become her most known work. As a female journalist, she was rare in Europe and possibly the first identifiable one in Sweden. The essay aroused great attention in contemporary Sweden, but the author was anonymous and unknown during her own lifetime. 
The essay was published in ten issues in connection with the Riksdag of 1738-1739. Essay papers was a new form of media in contemporary Europe, and hers was among the first to introduce this media form in Sweden. The paper was contemporary to similar publications in Sweden such as ''[[Skuggan Af den döda Argus]]'' (The Death Shadow of Argus), ''[[Samtal, I The Dödas Rijke, Emellan Den Sedo-Lärande Mercurius]]'' (Conversation, In the Kingdom of the Dead, With the Instructive Mercurius) and ''[[Den Swänska Argus]]'', and was likely inspired by them.

''Samtal'' discussed foreign policy, social policy, morality, and independence and subjects of the [[age of enlightenment]]. The essay numbers were written in the form of a fictive argumentative conversation - hence the name of the paper - between two fictions figures, the male ''Argi skugga'' (Shadow of Argi) and the female ''Fruentimbers skugga'' (Shadow of a Female), of various topics. Other characters sometimes participate in the conversation, such as ''Muselmanen'' (The Moslem) and ''Philosophen'' (The Philosopher). Criticism against the Catholic church within the subject of enlightenment, until then uncommon in Sweden but common in the Netherlands, was often presented. In the conversations, the essay promoted [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion]], advocated to translate knowledge to the Swedish language to make it available to more people rather than to restrict most such literature to foreign languages in the universities, and stated that women should also been given higher education and participate in public debate. In it, she satirizes the letters from some readers who criticize the thought of a woman discussing [[philosophy]]. Affected strongly by the continental ideas of enlightenment, it was regarded as radical and progressive and came in conflict with the contemporary censorship laws. It was not banned by the censorship, but discontinued for unknown causes after ten issues in 1739, despite having planned further issues. 

During the 18th-century [[Age of Liberty]] and the Gustavian Age, there were several publications in Sweden written by and for women which, except for the more common topics of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], discussed and questioned the rights and status of women in society, often written in the form of essays, letters and fictions conversations, of which the publication of Margareta Momma was arguably the first. Most of the female journalists and writers in 18th-century Sweden wrote under pseudonym (normally a French name), and therefore, they have seldom been identified: also in this aspect, Momma is one of the first identified female journalists in Sweden.   

Momma is also identified as the editor behind the French language edition of the ''Stockholm Gazette'', which she published between 1742 and 1752. 
In 1772, she died along with her spouse and her remaining son, and the family business was inherited by her daughter Elsa Fought.

==Legacy==
The award "Mommapriset - Årets Utgivare" ('Momma Award - The Publisher of the Year') is named after Margareta Momma.

'''Panamanian Spanish''' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Castilian) language as spoken in the country of [[Panama]]. It is closely related to other varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]].

The variations among different speaker groups of the same language can be [[lexicon|lexical]] (vocabulary), [[phonological]] (pronunciation), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] (word forms), or in the use of [[syntax]] (grammar).

[[History of Panama|Historically]], [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]] were part of the same political entity. Colombia, governed from the [[Real Audiencia of Panama]] during the 16th century, then part of [[Castilla de Oro]], with its capital in Panama, during the 17th century, and after independence from Spain, Panama voluntarily became part of the [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] along with Venezuela and Ecuador, with its capital in Bogota. From the colonial times and periods and also during most of the 19th century and until 1903, and even though there are still lexical similarities shared by the two countries (e.g., ''pelao'' in both [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] means "kid" or "child"), phonetically, Panamanian Spanish is very similar with the Spanish as spoken in the coastal areas around the [[Caribbean]], specifically [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and the Atlantic coast of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]].

== Phonology ==
The main characteristic of [[Caribbean Spanish]] is the [[debuccalization]] of the {{IPA|/s/}} sound at the end of a syllable or word, such as in the word ''cascada'', pronounced {{IPA|[kahˈkaða]}} (like "h" in the English word "he") instead of {{IPA|[kasˈkaða]}}. The aspiration is also observed in the coastal regions of Peru and Ecuador and in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, and in Andalusia and the Canary Islands of Spain.

Another change observed in Panamanian Spanish is the deaffrication of {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (as "ch" in the English word "chips") to {{IPAblink|ʃ}} (as "sh" in the English word "she") so ''muchacho'' is pronounced {{IPA|[muˈʃaʃo]}}, rather than {{IPA|[muˈtʃatʃo]}}. It is found primarily among less-educated speakers, but it can sometimes be observed among better-educated speakers, as in [[Andalusian Spanish]].

The {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as glottal {{IPAblink|h}}, as in [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] and other [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin American Spanish dialects]], [[Canarian Spanish|Canarian]], and [[Andalusian Spanish]] dialects.

== Vocabulary ==
Lexically, Panamanian Spanish presents a variety of new terms introduced and being incorporated into the daily language all the time. The following quotation shows some common Panamanian expressions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Vecina, yo no soy ''vidajena'', y no me gusta esa ''vaina'' ... pero te voy a contar un ''bochinche''... &lt;br&gt;
pero si me das de comer un poco de ''chicheme'',  ''concolón'', ''carimañola'', sancocho y mondongo....&lt;br&gt;
Ese ''man'' flacuchento y ''ñato'' vestido de ''guayabera'' azul y ''sombrero montuno'' que viene allí ... Su ''motete'' ya no tiene ñame, guineo ni ''guandú''. Lo que tiene es un ''pocotón'' de ''chécheres''. Según la comadre ''fula'' ''radiobemba'', el cambio en ese ''laopé'' no se debe a una ''macuá'' ..." ¹
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

¹From Carlos "Cubena" Guillermo Wilson,  "El aporte cultural de la etnia negra en Panamá"[http://diadelaetnia.homestead.com/cubena.html]

[Note: ''laopé'' = ''pelao'' ("boy")]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5426">{{About|the phrase|other uses|Pardon my French (disambiguation)|and|Excuse My French (disambiguation)}}

"'''Pardon my French'''" or "'''Excuse my French'''" is a common [[English language]] phrase ostensibly disguising [[profanity]] as words from the [[French language]]. The phrase is uttered in an attempt to excuse the user of profanity, swearing, or curses in the presence of those offended by it, under the pretense of the words being part of a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;Rory T. Cornish, Margueritte Quintelli-Neary, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=n7cwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22pardon+my+French%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pardon%20my%20French%22&amp;f=false Phrases.org.uk: "Crafting Infinity: Reworking Elements in Irish Culture"], Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the phrase is often used without any explicit or implicit intention of insulting the French people or language, it can nevertheless be perceived as offensive and belittling by Francophone speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Treps, [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Oh+l%C3%A0+l%C3%A0%2C+ces+Fran%C3%A7ais+%21+Du+pire+au+meilleur%2C+comment+le+monde+parle+de+nous: "Oh là là, ces Français ! Du pire au meilleur, comment le monde parle de nous."] La Librairie Vuibert, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, most users of the term intend no such belittlement, but rather a light-hearted way of apologizing on-the-fly for having used a somewhat profane comment. In other words, it can be (and usually is) used as a very effective oral English device to indicate that the speaker does not intend to escalate the general level of profanity use.

==Usage==
At least one source&lt;ref name="Meaning"/&gt; suggests that the phrase "derives from a literal usage of the exclamation. In the 19th century, when English people used French expressions in conversation they often apologized for it - presumably because many of their listeners (then as now) wouldn't be familiar with the language". The definition cites an example from ''The Lady's Magazine'', 1830:&lt;ref&gt;Frances White, [https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/people-politics/why-do-we-say-excuse-my-french/ Why do we say “Excuse my French”?] on ''historyanswers.co.uk'', 11th March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote
| text = Bless me, how fat you are grown! - absolutely as round as a ball: - you will soon be as ''embonpoint''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Embonpoint'' is French for "plumpness"; state of being well-nourished.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meaning"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/130800.html Phrases.org.uk: "Excuse my French"]&lt;/ref&gt; (excuse my French) as your poor dear father, the major.}}

The phrase has been used in [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]] and family films where less offensive words are preceded by "pardon my French" to intensify their effect without violating [[censorship]] or [[Motion picture rating system|rating guidelines]]. A good example is in the movie ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. Cameron calls Mr. Rooney and says, "Pardon my French, but you're an asshole".&lt;ref&gt;Melissa, [http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/10/tradition-saying-pardon-french-saying-swear-words-started/ How the Tradition of Saying “Pardon My French” After Saying Swear Words Started], on ''todayifoundout.com'', October 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidentally, several expressions are used by both the English and the French to describe the same culturally unacceptable habit, but attributing the habit to the other people:
* "[[French leave|to take a French leave]]" (to depart a party or other gathering without taking polite leave of one's host) is referenced in French as ''filer à l'anglaise'' (lit. "leave English-style").&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Jones, [http://www.everywordcounts.co.uk/popular-european-sayings/ “Excuse my French!” and other popular European sayings], on ''everywordcounts.co.uk'', May 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* "French letter" (now somewhat archaic; referring to a [[condom]]) is rendered in French as ''capote anglaise'' ("English hood" or "English cap").&lt;ref&gt;Matt Soniak , [http://mentalfloss.com/article/12866/why-do-we-say-%E2%80%9Cpardon-my-french%E2%80%9D-when-we-curse Why Do We Say “Pardon My French” When We Curse?], on ''mentalfloss.com'', October 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelocal.fr/20160819/french-things-that-arent-actually-french Twelve 'French' things that aren't actually French at all], on ''thelocal.fr'', 19 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 16th century in England, [[genital herpes]] was called the "French disease" and "French-sick" was a term for [[syphilis]], while at the same time, it was called ''le Mal de Naples'' (the [[Napoli]] disease), hence attributing the belief that syphilis came from the south, into France, and then into England.&lt;ref name=Eatough&gt;{{cite book | author=Eatough G | title=Fracastoro's Syphilis | location=Liverpool | publisher=Francis Cairns | date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Girolamo Fracastoro]], ''Ibid.'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16350">[[Japanese language|Japanese]] has one [[Liquid consonant|liquid]] [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/r/}}, realized usually as an [[Alveolar flap|apico-alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and sometimes as an [[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}}. [[English language|English]] has two: [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] {{IPA|/r/}} and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|/l/}}, with varying [[phonetic]] realizations centered on the [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}} and on the alveolar lateral approximant {{IPA|[l]}}, respectively. Japanese speakers who learn English as a second language later than childhood often have difficulty in hearing and producing {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} of English accurately.

==Phonetic differences==
{{further|Pronunciation of English /r/|Japanese phonology}}
The Japanese liquid is most often realized as an [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, though there is some variation depending on phonetic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Bloch|1950}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Vance|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/r/}} of American English (the dialect Japanese speakers are typically exposed to) is most commonly a postalveolar [[Central consonant|central]] [[approximant]] with simultaneous [[pharyngealization|secondary pharyngeal constriction]] {{IPA|[ɹ̠ˤ]}} or less commonly a [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{IPA|/l/}} involves contact with the [[alveolar ridge]] as well as some raising of the tongue dorsum (velarization), especially when syllable-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perception ==
Evidence from {{Harvcoltxt|Best|Strange|1992}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Yamada|Tohkura|1992}} suggests that Japanese speakers perceive English {{IPA|/r/}} as somewhat like the compressed-lip velar approximant {{IPA|[w͍]}} and other studies&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Flege|Takagi|Mann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Takagi|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown speakers to hear it more as an ill-formed Japanese {{IPA|/r/}}.
{{Harvcoltxt|Goto|1971}} reports that native speakers of Japanese who have learned English as adults have difficulty perceiving the acoustic differences between English {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, even if the speakers are comfortable with conversational English, have lived in an [[English-speaking country]] for extended periods, and can articulate the two sounds when speaking English.

Japanese speakers can, however, perceive the difference between English {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} when these sounds are not mentally processed as speech sounds. {{Harvcoltxt|Miyawaki|Strange|Verbrugge|Liberman|1975}} found that Japanese speakers could distinguish {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} just as well as native English speakers if the sounds were acoustically manipulated in a way that made them sound less like speech (by removal of all acoustic information except the F3 component).{{clarify|date=April 2017}}
{{Harvcoltxt|Lively|Pisoni|Yamada|Tohkura|1994}} found that speakers' ability to distinguish between the two sounds depended on where the sound occurred. Word-final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} with a preceding vowel were distinguished the best, followed by word-initial {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}. Those that occurred in initial consonant clusters or between vowels were the most difficult to distinguish accurately.

{{Harvcoltxt|Bradlow|Pisoni|Yamada|Tohkura|1997}} provide evidence that there is a link between [[perception]] and production to the extent that [[perceptual learning]] generally transferred to improved production. However, there may be little correlation between degrees of learning in perception and production after training in perception, due to the wide range of individual variation in learning strategies.

== Production  ==
{{Harvcoltxt|Goto|1971}} reports that Japanese speakers who cannot hear the difference between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} may still learn to produce the difference, presumably through articulatory training in which they learn the correct places and manners of articulation required for the production of the two sounds. In this sense, they learn to produce {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} in much the same way a deaf person would. Although they have only a single acoustic image corresponding to a single phoneme intermediary between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, they can determine they are producing the correct sound based on the tactile sensations of the speech articulators (i.e. tongue, alveolar ridge, etc.) coming into contact with each other without any auditory feedback or confirmation that they are indeed producing the sound correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Goto|1971|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations in acquisition==
There is some indication that Japanese speakers tend to improve more on the perception and production of {{IPA|/r/}} than {{IPA|/l/}}.

{{Harvcoltxt|Aoyama|Flege|Guion|Akahane-Yamada|2004}} conducted a longitudinal study that examined the perception and production of English /l/, /r/, and /w/ by adults and children who were native speakers of Japanese but living in the United States. Over time, the children improved more on English /r/ than English /l/.

Similarly, {{Harvcoltxt|Guion|Flege|Akahane-Yamada|Pruitt|2000}} found that Japanese speakers who received training in distinguishing English sounds improved more on {{IPA|/r/}} than on {{IPA|/l/}}. They suggest that English {{IPA|/l/}} is perceived as more similar to Japanese {{IPA|/r/}} than English {{IPA|/r/}} is, and hence it is harder for Japanese speakers to distinguish Japanese {{IPA|/r/}} from English {{IPA|/l/}} than Japanese {{IPA|/r/}} from English {{IPA|/r/}}.

{{Harvcoltxt|Kuzniak|Zapf|2004}} found differences between the second and third formants in {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} of a native Japanese speaker and a native English speaker. The results showed that the Japanese speaker had a hard time producing an English-like third formant, especially that which is required to produce an {{IPA|/l/}}.

==Effects of training==
There have been a number of experiments in training Japanese subjects to improve their perception of {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}.

{{Harvcoltxt|Lively|Pisoni|Yamada|Tohkura|1994}} found that monolingual Japanese speakers in Japan could increase their ability to distinguish between /l/ and /r/ after a 3-week training period, which involved hearing [[minimal pair]]s (such as 'rock' and 'lock') produced by five speakers, and being asked to identify which word was which. Feedback was provided during training, and participants had to listen to the minimal pairs until the correct answer was given. Participants performed significantly better immediately after the 3-week training, and retained some improvements when retested after 3 months and after 6 months (although there was a decrease in recognition ability at the 6-month test). Reaction time decreased during the training period as the accuracy went up. Participants could "generalize" their learning somewhat: when tested they could distinguish between new /l/ and /r/ minimal pairs, but performed better when the pairs were said by one of the five speakers they had heard before rather than by a new speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lively|Pisoni|Yamada|Tohkura|1994|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvcoltxt|Lively|Logan|Pisoni|1993}} also found that subjects who were trained by listening to multiple speakers' production of {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} in only a few phonetic environments improved more than subjects who were trained with a single talker using a wider range of phonetic environments.

{{Harvcoltxt|McClelland|Fiez|McCandliss|2002}} argue that it is possible to train Japanese adults to distinguish speech sounds they find difficult to differentiate at first. They found that speech training results in outcomes indicating a real change in the perception of the sounds as speech, rather than simply in auditory perception.

However, it is not clear whether adult learners can ever fully overcome their difficulties with {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Takagi|Mann|1995}} found that even Japanese speakers who have lived 12 or more years in the United States have more trouble identifying {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} than native English speakers do.

==Examples==
There are numerous minimal pairs of words distinguishing only {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}. For their study, {{Harvcoltxt|Kuzniak|Zapf|2004}} used the following ones:
*''right/light''
*''red/led''
*''road/load''
*''arrive/alive''
*''correct/collect''
*''crime/climb''
*''bread/bled''
*''froze/flows''

The Japanese adaptation of English words is largely [[non-rhotic]], in that English {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is realized either as a vowel or as nothing and therefore is distinguished from {{IPA|/l/}} in the same environment. So ''store'' and ''stole'' or ''stall'', for example, are distinguished as ''sutoa'' and ''sutōru'', respectively.

'''Pere Antoni Beuter''' (1490–1554) was a Spanish [[historian]] and writer who spent most of his life in [[Valencia]].

Originally from Germany, he studied Humanities at the [[University of Valencia]]. He was secretary to Archbishop Erhard of [[Marche]]. In 1540 he was sent to Rome where he was appointed apostolic preacher by [[Pope Paul III]]. After returning to Valencia, he was rector and professor of Old Testament Scripture.

His major works were historiographical, among which its first part of the [[Valencia#History|history of Valencia]] in 1538 that addresses the issue of the founding of Valencia. The work was successful so he drafted a new version in Spanish in 1546. The second part of the work was written entirely in Spanish and published in 1550 under the name Second part of the general chronicle of Spain. The third part is still unpublished and has not been found.

'''Perzines''' are a genre of [[zines]]; the "per" meaning "personal". Although most zines could be considered personal in that they represent the opinionated work of one person, this term describes zines that are written about one's own personal experiences, opinions and observations. This genre has become increasingly popular within the zine community and is probably the largest used format for zines today.

In many ways, the perzine could be considered the paper predecessor to the [[blog]]. Yet for many zine creators, the paper format is still the preferred medium, despite the blog phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Dumais, Susan, "Low-tech Zines in a High-tech World," ''College Letter'', University of New Hampshire, College of Liberal Arts, September, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''The process theory of composition''' (hereafter referred to as "process") is a field of [[composition studies]] that focuses on writing as a process rather than a product. Based on Janet Emig's breakdown of the [[writing process]],&lt;ref&gt;Emig, Janet. The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders. Urbana: NCTE, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; the process is centered on the idea that students determine the content of the course by exploring the craft of writing using their own interests, language, techniques, voice, and freedom, and where students learn what people respond to and what they don't.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray, Donald. "Teach Writing as a Process Not a Product." 1972. Reprinted in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory: A Reader''. Ed. Victor Villanueva. 2nd ed. Urbana: NCTE, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. "Writing Without Teachers." Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Classroom activities often include peer work where students themselves are teaching, reviewing, brainstorming, and editing.&lt;ref name="murray" /&gt;

== How process began ==
Historically, the ideas behind process were born out of increased college enrollment thanks to the GI Bill following World War II. Writing instructors began giving students more group work and found that, with guidance, students were able to identify and recognize areas that needed improvement in other students' papers, and that criticism also helped students recognize their own areas to strengthen [cite]. Composition scholars such as Janet Emig, Peter Elbow, and Donald Murray began considering how these methods could be used in the writing classroom. Emig, in her book, The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders, broke down writing into distinct parts; these were later simplified into a basic three-step process by Murray: prewriting, writing, and rewriting (also called "revision").[2]

Process also gained prominence in the collegiate world as a reaction against the formalism composition methods, sometimes called "current-traditional" methods, that encouraged adherence to established modes of writing, such as the five-paragraph essay.

== Teaching methods and implications ==
Process can be taught using a variety of methods intended to strengthen the relationship between students and instructor. In other words, classroom discussion and activities center on students' ability to mimic what has come before in hopes that they will understand what good writing is and learn to mimic it. Some of the methods include:
&lt;br /&gt;'''Prewriting activities.''' These could include brainstorming and/or other freewriting activities, drawing conceptual maps, participating in an ethnographic study, research, and more.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Drafting.''' Class time can be spent writing papers, and students can ask instructors for ideas or help.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Revision.''' Instructors can designate class time for the revision of drafts and direct students to focus on rhetorical strategies.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Portfolio-based assessment.''' Students are given a deadline, such as the end of a semester, and a goal, such as demonstrating skills like rhetorical awareness, conventional thinking, and source acceptance and integration. The intervening time is spent drafting and revising papers. Composition instructors serve as final authorities on the quality of work, helping students explore areas foreign to them, rather than more free wheeling teachers who tell students how to express their individuality. From among the papers they work on in the semester, students choose the papers the instructor considers to be their best and put them in a portfolio, which is graded by the instructor. Often students are graded on their drafts during the semester as well as on the work they produce at the end of it.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Reflection''' on the writing process.

== Critiques of Process ==
Thomas Kent argues that process theories insist, “writing can be captured by a generalized process or a Big Theory,” and that process theory makes three central claims about writing: “(1) writing is private; (2) writing is not up for interpretation; and (3) writing can, and should be, highly organized.” &lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Kent, Thomas. "Post-Process Theory: Beyond the Writing Process Paradigm." Southern Illinois University: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

When writing is conceived of and taught as a prescriptive and generalizable “process,” according to Gary Olson, useful implications arise in the creation of a Theory of Writing, a master narrative that attempts to “systematize something that simply is not susceptible to systematization.” &lt;ref name="kent" /&gt;

Similarly, George Pullman positions the writing process movement as a rhetorical narrative, positioned in history as a result of writing as an undervalued, utilitarian skill that could be universally transmitted in higher education (17). This emerged from “current traditional rhetoric” that originated at Harvard in the 1880s and peaked in the late 1960s. Writing became a highly scientific affair, rooted exclusively in empirical observation. Post-process theorists argue, however, that if the writing process “were really the way all successful writers write regardless of context, then unless all writing is somehow supportive of a single ideological system, there would be no obfuscatory ideological baggage attending the process." &lt;ref name="kent" /&gt;

Theorists continue to discuss pedagogical and systemic implications of both process and post-process approaches to composition.

Process theorists themselves have had to identify and work around certain constraints the process method brings with it; namely:

=== Constraints for students ===
If papers are not graded throughout the semester, students don't have any idea of the grade they are earning. Also, students might not be inclined to take control of the class content and decide what they want to explore; they may expect the instructor to provide material for them. Additionally, students may not improve their grammar and other writing conventions if content is emphasized over form.

=== Constraints for composition instructors ===
Composition classes are often overfilled, so instructors have to spend much of their time reading through drafts. Power can also be a struggle, for if student grades depend on a portfolio, then instructors have to find ways of encouraging and/or enforcing attendance.
And if there are no rules as to what students may and may not write about, instructors have to be well-versed in a variety of discourses and ready to deal with conflict that may arise when two or more discourses meet (sometimes called a [[contact zone]]). Instructors must also find ways to encourage each student to explore and bring content to the course and must deal with diversity and a range of opinions on what should be done in the course.

Process rose to prominence in composition classrooms during the late 1960s and enjoyed its status as the gold standard method of teaching through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Many of its tenets are still used today; however, its popularity and methods have brought criticism from different composition theorists, such as [[post-process (theory of composition)|post-process]] theorists, who charge that:
*Process theory is rules-oriented just like the current-traditional method it had sought to escape.&lt;ref name="tobin"&gt;Tobin, Lad. "Process Pedagogy." A Guide to Composition Pedagogies. Ed. Tate, et al. Oxford UP: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*It doesn't teach basic skills and conventions (grammar, style, etc.).&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;
*It doesn't acknowledge issues of race/class/gender because it was so focused on the writer's language and experience.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;
*It doesn't recognize the significance of context, again because it was focused on the writer's experience.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;

{{Revolution sidebar}}
A '''revolutionary wave''' or '''revolutionary decade''' is a series of [[revolution]]s occurring in various locations within a similar time span. In many cases, past revolutions and revolutionary waves have inspired current ones, or an initial revolution has inspired other concurrent "affiliate revolutions" with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;Mark N. Katz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pLrnRMI2tmgC ''Revolution and Revolutionary Waves''], Palgrave Macmillan (October 1, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader Sohrabi, ''Revolution and Constitutionalism in the Ottoman Empire and Iran'', Cambridge University Press, 2011 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4c0EFd7BfhAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Revolution+and+Constitutionalism+in+the+Ottoman+Empire+and+Iran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rz0gT4LpDK_H0AHYt4i3Ag&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=revolutionary%20wave&amp;f=false pp. 74, 83, 87, 90, 94, 96], {{ISBN|0-521-19829-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-19829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The causes of revolutionary waves have been studied by historians and [[political philosopher]]s, including [[Robert Roswell Palmer]], [[Crane Brinton]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Eric Hoffer]], and [[Jacques Godechot]].&lt;ref&gt;*Colin J. Beck, Dissertation submitted to Stanford University Department of Sociology graduate Ph.D program, March 2009, "Ideological roots of waves of revolution," ProQuest, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qxRNGu8Pf1wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ideological+roots+of+waves+of+revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K0cgT_vxFYO90AHt5KAG&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ideological%20roots%20of%20waves%20of%20revolution&amp;f=false pp. 1-5], {{ISBN|1-109-07655-X}}, 9781109076554.

[[Marxism|Marxists]] see revolutionary waves as evidence that a [[world revolution]] is possible.  For [[Rosa Luxemburg]], "The most precious thing… in the sharp ebb and flow of the revolutionary waves is the proletariat's spiritual growth. The advance, by leaps and bounds, of the intellectual stature of the proletariat affords an inviolable guarantee of its further progress in the inevitable economic and political struggles ahead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosa Luxemburg]], ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Collected Works), quoted in [[Tony Cliff]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1985/patterns/part1.htm#s2 "Rosa Luxemburg, 1905 and the classic account of the mass strike"] in "[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1985/patterns/index.htm Patterns of mass strike]", ''International Socialism'', vol. 2, no. 29 (Summer 1985), pp. 3-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "revolutionary wave" has also been used by non-Marxist writers and activists, including [[Justin Raimondo]] and [[Michael Lind]], to describe discrete revolutions happening within a short time span.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Raimondo]], [http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2011/01/27/the-revolutionary-wave/ The Revolutionary Wave: Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen – is the West next?], [[Antiwar.com]], January 28, 2011.

==Typology==

[[Mark N. Katz]]&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p4&lt;/ref&gt; identified six forms of revolution;
* rural revolution
* urban revolution
* Coup d'état, e.g. Egypt, 1952
* revolution from above, e.g. Mao's [[Great leap forward]] of 1958
* revolution from without, e.g. the allied invasions of Italy, 1944 and Germany, 1945.
* revolution by osmosis, e.g. the gradual Islamization of several countries.

These categories are not mutually exclusive; the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] began with urban revolution to depose the Czar, followed by rural revolution, followed by the [[Bolshevik]] coup in November. Katz also cross-classified revolutions as follows;
* Central; countries, usually [[Great powers]], which play a leading role in a Revolutionary wave; e.g. the [[USSR]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[Iran]] since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspiring revolutions, which follow the Central revolution
* subordinate or puppet revolutions
* rival revolutions, e.g. communist Yugoslavia, and China after 1969
Central and subordinate revolutions may support each other militarily, as for example the USSR, Cuba, Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and other Marxist regimes did in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

A further dimension to Katz's typology&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p12&lt;/ref&gt; is that revolutions are either '''against''' (anti-monarchy, anti-dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-democratic) or '''for''' (pro-fascism, communism, nationalism etc.).In the latter cases, a transition period is often necessary to decide on the direction taken.

==Periodisation==
There is no consensus on a complete list of revolutionary waves.  In particular, scholars disagree on how similar the ideologies of different events should be in order for them to be grouped as part of a single wave, and over what period a wave can be considered to be taking place – for example, [[Mark N. Katz]] discussed a "Marxist-Leninist wave" lasting from 1917 to 1991, and a "fascist wave" from 1922 to 1945, but limits an "anti-communist wave" to just the 1989 to 1991 period.&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;[[Mark N. Katz]] , "Cycles, waves and diffusion", in: Jack A. Goldstone, ''The Encyclopedia of Political Revolutions'', pp. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential revolutionary waves==

Mark Katz theorises that Buddhism (in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indochina, Burma, Tibet) and Confucianism (to replace Marxism in China and promote unity with Chinese in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia) might be the revolutionary waves of the future. In the past, these religions have been passively acquiescent to secular authority; but so was Islam, until recently.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Katz also suggests that nationalisms such as [[Pan-Turanianism]] (in Turkey, Central Asia, Xinjiang, parts of Russia), 'Pan-native Americanism' (in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay) and [[Pan-Slavism]] (in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) could also form revolutionary waves.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p 139&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruya''' is a Chinese word for an [[ancient]] scholar's wise, modest, and self-cultivating nature. It is also used to describe Chinese generals holding those same traits while defeating their enemies with ease.

== Ruya and Rafa ==
In popular culture, Ruya was first used to describe tennis star [[Rafael Nadal]] on the Baidu Rafa Post Bar (rafa Bar of [[Baidu Tieba]]). The post pointed out that Nadal never curses against his opponent; instead, he always gives credit to them. He never abuses his racquet, never gives up, and uses all means possible to achieve victory. These traits fit the meaning of the word "Ruya".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tieba.baidu.com/p/951206260?pn=1| title=【儒雅】0502：纳达尔比费德勒更儒雅}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the close resemblance of the pronunciation of Ruya and Rafa, many message board posters started to use Ruya as Nadal's nickname.

== The phenomenon of Ruya ==
The phenomenon of spreading Ruya continues through the Chinese sporting world. Besides Rafael Nadal, other tennis players have been considered as Ruya,  including [[Australian]] [[Bernard Tomic]] and former [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] World No.1 [[Victoria Azarenka]]. Today, the word generally describes individuals with conflicting sides of being modest in public, but yet using all means to self-serve in their personal nature.

{{Anthropology of religion | Basic |image=[[File:Devimahatmya Sanskrit MS Nepal 11c.jpg|center|300px]]|caption=The oldest surviving manuscript in the sacred [[Sanskrit]] language: [[Devi Mahatmya|Devi Māhātmya]], on palm-leaf, in an early [[Bhujimol]] script, [[Bihar]] or [[Nepal]], 11th century.}}
A '''sacred language''', "'''holy language'''" (in religious context) or '''liturgical language''' is any [[language]] that is cultivated and used primarily in [[Church service|religious service]] or for other [[religion|religious]] reasons by people who speak another, primary language in their daily life. The oldest sacred language is [[Sanskrit]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Concept==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
A sacred language is often the language which was spoken and written in the society in which a religion's sacred texts were first set down; however, these texts thereafter become fixed and holy, remaining frozen and immune to later linguistic developments. Once a language becomes associated with religious worship, its believers may ascribe virtues to the language of worship that they would not give to their native tongues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the case of sacred texts, there is a fear of losing authenticity and accuracy by a translation or re-translation, and difficulties in achieving acceptance for a new version of a text. A sacred language is typically vested with a solemnity and dignity that the vernacular lacks. Consequently, the training of clergy in the use of a sacred language becomes an important cultural investment, and their use of the tongue is perceived to give them access to a body of knowledge that untrained lay people cannot (or should not) access.

Because sacred languages are ascribed with virtues that the vernacular is not perceived to have, the sacred languages typically preserve characteristics that would have been lost in the course of language development. In some cases, the sacred language is a [[Extinct language|dead language]]. In other cases, it may simply reflect [[archaism|archaic]] forms of a living language. For instance, 17th-century elements of the English language remain current in [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] worship through the use of the ''[[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]]'' or older versions of the [[Anglican]] ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. In more extreme cases, the language has changed so much from the language of the [[sacred text]]s that the liturgy is no longer comprehensible without special training.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The concept of sacred languages is distinct from that of [[divine language]]s, which are languages ascribed to the divine (i.e. God or gods) and may not necessarily be natural languages.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The concept, as expressed by the name of a script, for example in ''[[Devanāgarī]]'', the name of a script that roughly means "[script] of the city”, and is used to write many Indian languages.

==Hinduism==
[[Hinduism]] is traditionally considered to have [[Sanskrit]] as its principal liturgical language. [[Sanskrit]] is the language of the [[Veda]]s, [[Bhagavadgita]], [[Puranas]] like [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavatam]], the [[Upanishad]]s, the Hindu epics like [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] and various other liturgical texts such as the [[Sahasranama]], [[Shri Rudram Chamakam|Chamakam]] and [[Rudram]]. 

Sanskrit is also the tongue of most [[Hindu]] rituals. It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language and therefore a member of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. It therefore has some similarities with [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], as well as with many vernacular languages of Europe and south Asia. Like Latin and Greek, it also has secular [[literature]] along with its religious canon. Most Hindu theologians of later centuries continued to prefer to write in Sanskrit even when it was no longer spoken as a day-to-day language. 

While Sanskrit has often been associated with [[Brahmanism]], it remains as the only liturgical link language which connects the different strains of Hinduism that are present across [[India]]. The ''de facto'' position that Sanskrit enjoyed, as the principal language of Hinduism, enabled its survival not only in India but also in other areas where Hinduism thrived like [[South East Asia]]. Apart from Sanskrit, several Hindu spiritual works were composed in the various regional languages of India such as [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]], and [[Tulu language|Tulu]].

==Buddhism==
[[Theravada]] Buddhism uses [[Pali language|Pali]] as its main liturgical language, and prefers its [[Pali Canon|scriptures]] to be studied in the original Pali. Pali is derived from the Indian language [[Prakrit]], which in turn is a derivative of [[Sanskrit]]. In Thailand, Pali is written using the Thai alphabet, resulting in a Thai pronunciation of the Pali language.

[[Mahayana]] Buddhism makes little use of its original language, Sanskrit. In some Japanese rituals, Chinese texts are read out or recited with the Japanese pronunciations of their constituent characters, resulting in something unintelligible in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Buswell|editor-first=Robert E.|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|year=2003|page=137|location=London|publisher=Macmillan}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan language]] is used, but [[mantra]]s are in [[Sanskrit]].

==Christianity==
[[File:US Navy 040411-N-1290G-005 Navy Chaplain Milton Gianulis conducts an Easter morning Orthodox Liturgy candlelight service aboard USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75).jpg|thumb|180px|Navy Chaplain Milton Gianulis conducts an Easter morning Orthodox Liturgy candlelight service aboard USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75)]]
Christian rites, rituals, and ceremonies are not celebrated in one single sacred language. The Churches which trace their origin to the Apostles continued to use the standard languages of the first few centuries AD.

These include:
* [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] in the [[Latin liturgical rites]] of the [[Catholic Church]]
* [[Koine Greek]] in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]]
* [[Church Slavonic]] in several of the [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]
* [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]] in the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Georgian Catholic Church]]
* [[Classical Armenian]] in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]
* [[Ge'ez]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean Orthodox Church]]
* [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and [[Coptic Catholic Church]]
* [[Syriac language|Syriac]] in [[Syriac Christianity]] represented by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Maronite Church]] and [[Saint Thomas Christian Churches]]
* [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in [[Saint Thomas Christian Churches]]

The extensive use of [[Greek language|Greek]] in the Roman Liturgy has continued, in theory; it was used extensively on a regular basis during the [[Papal Mass]], which has not been celebrated for some time. by the reign of Pope Saint [[Damasus I]], the continuous use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy had come to be replaced in part by Latin. Gradually, the Roman Liturgy took on more and more Latin until, generally, only a few words of [[Hebrew]] and Greek remained. The adoption of Latin was further fostered when the [[Vetus Latina]] (old latin) version of the [[Bible]] was edited and parts retranslated from the original Hebrew and Greek by [[Saint Jerome]] in his [[Vulgate]]. Latin continued as the Western Church's language of liturgy and communication. One simply practical reason for this may be that there were no standardized vernaculars throughout the Middle Ages. [[Church Slavonic]] was used for the celebration of the Roman Liturgy in the 9th century (twice, 867-873 and 880-885).{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In the mid-16th century the [[Council of Trent]] rejected a proposal to introduce [[national language]]s as this was seen, among other reasons, as potentially divisive to Catholic unity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

During the Reformation in England, when the Protestant authorities banned the use of Latin liturgy, various schools obtained a dispension to continue to use Latin, for educational purposes.

From the end of 16th century, in coastal Croatia, the vernacular was gradually replacing Church Slavonic as the liturgical language. It was introduced in the rite of the Roman Liturgy, after the Church Slavonic language of [[glagolitic]] liturgical books, published in Rome, was becoming increasingly unintelligible due to linguistical reforms, namely, adapting Church Slavonic of Croatian recension by the norms of Church Slavonic of Russian recension.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} For example, the vernacular was used to enquire of the bride and bridegroom whether they accepted their marriage vows.

[[Jesuit]] missionaries to China had sought, and for a short time received permission, to translate the Roman [[Missal]] into scholarly Classical Chinese. (See [[Chinese Rites controversy]]). However, ultimately permission was revoked. Among the Algonquin and Iroquois, they received permission to translate the propers{{clarify|date=September 2018}} of the Mass into the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Salvucci, Claudio R. 2008. [http://mysite.verizon.net/driadzbubl/IndianMasses.html The Roman Rite in the Algonquian and Iroquoian Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008092144/http://mysite.verizon.net/driadzbubl/IndianMasses.html |date=2012-10-08 }}. Merchantville, NJ:Evolution Publishing. See also &lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Pope Pius XII]] granted permission for a few vernaculars to be used in a few rites, rituals, and ceremonies. This did not include the Roman Liturgy of the Mass.

The [[Catholic Church]], long before the [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II), had accepted and promoted the use of the non-vernacular liturgical languages listed above; while vernacular (i.e. modern or native) languages were also used liturgically throughout history; usually as a special concession given to religious orders conducting missionary activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=2786|title=Library : Liturgical Languages|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of vernacular language in liturgical practice after 1964 created controversy for a minority of Catholics, and opposition to liturgical vernacular is a major tenet of the Catholic [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist]] movement.

In the 20th century, Vatican II set out to protect the use of Latin as a liturgical language. To a large degree, its prescription was initially disregarded and the vernacular not only became standard, but was generally used exclusively in the liturgy. Latin, which remains the chief language of the [[Roman Rite]], is the main language of the [[Roman Missal]] (the official book of liturgy for the Latin Rite) and of the [[Code of Canon Law]], and the use of liturgical Latin is still encouraged. Large-scale papal ceremonies often make use of it. Meanwhile, the numerous [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in union with Rome each have their own respective "parent-language". As a subsidiary issue, unrelated to liturgy, the Eastern Code of Canon Law, for the sake of convenience, has been promulgated in Latin.

[[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches vary in their use of liturgical languages in Church services. [[Koine Greek]] and [[Church Slavonic]] are the main sacred languages used in the Churches of the Eastern Orthodox communion. However, the Eastern Orthodox Church permits other languages to be used for liturgical worship, and each country often has the liturgical services in their own language. This has led to a wide variety of languages used for liturgical worship, but there is still uniformity in the liturgical worship itself. So one can attend an Orthodox service in another location and the service will be (relatively){{clarify|date=September 2018}} the same.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Liturgical languages used in the Eastern Orthodox Church include: [[Koine Greek]], [[Church Slavonic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], several African languages and other world languages.

[[Oriental Orthodox]] churches outside their ancestral lands regularly pray in the local vernacular; but some clergymen and communities prefer to retain their traditional language or use a combination of languages.

Many Anabaptist groups, such as the [[Amish]], use High German in their worship despite not speaking it amongst themselves.

==Islam==
[[Classical Arabic]] aka Quranic Arabic is the language of the [[Quran]] and is considered the holiest language in Islamic thought.

==Judaism==
The core of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], referred to by some [[Jew]]s as ''[[Lashon Hakodesh]]'' ({{lang|he|לשון הקודש}}, "The Holy Language"). Hebrew (and in the case of a few texts such as the [[Kaddish]], [[Judeo-Aramaic languages|Aramaic]]) remains the traditional language of [[Jewish services|Jewish religious services]], although its usage today varies by denomination: [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] services are almost entirely in Hebrew, [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] services make more use of the national language and only use Hebrew for a few prayers and hymns, and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] services usually fall somewhere in between. [[Rabbinic Hebrew]] and Aramaic are used extensively by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] for writing religious texts. 

Among many segments of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]], [[Yiddish]], although not used in liturgy, is used for religious purposes, such as for [[Torah study]]. In contemporary [[Israel]], where Yiddish has virtually disappeared as a spoken language among the general public, it is cultivated and extensively used by some Haredi groups - partly in protest against [[Hebrew]], the traditional sacred language having been "profaned" by [[Zionism]], making it the main language of modern secular Israeli society.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Moreover, in these circles Yiddish is associated with the memory of the great Torah sages of Eastern Europe, who spoke it and whose communities were destroyed in the [[Holocaust]].

Among the [[Sephardi]]m [[Ladino language|Ladino]], a [[calque]] of Hebrew or Aramaic syntax and [[Castilian language|Castilian]] words, was used for sacred translations such as the [[Ferrara Bible]]. It was also used during the Sephardi liturgy. Note that the name ''Ladino'' is also used for [[Judeo-Spanish]], a dialect of Castilian used by Sephardim as an everyday language until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Sephiha"&gt;&lt;!-- The link http://www.vallenajerilla.com/berceo/florilegio/vidalsephiha/ladino1.htm triggers the spam filters. --&gt; ''EL LADINO: Lengua litúrgica de los judíos españoles'', Haim Vidal Sephiha, [[Sorbonne|Sorbona]] (París), Historia 16 - AÑO 1978:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;[http://www.cryptojews.com/clearing_up_ladino.htm  "Clearing up Ladino, Judeo-Spanish, Sephardic Music"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142720/http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1596 |date=2008-04-16 }} Judith Cohen, HaLapid, winter 2001; [http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1596 Sephardic Song]  Judith Cohen, Midstream July/August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He also stated the language was widely used as a ''lingua franca'' "understood by the chief men of many nations, as Latin is in many parts of Europe"—even though, as he says, the Occaneechis "have been but a small nation, ever since those parts were known to the English". Scholars believe that the Occaneechi spoke a [[Siouan]] dialect similar to [[Tutelo language|Tutelo]].
* [[Palaic language|Palaic]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]], cultivated as a religious language by the [[Hittites]].
* [[Pāli|Pali]], the original language of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].
* Some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Latin]] prayers are retained by the [[Kakure Kirishitan]] (Hidden Christians) of Japan, who recite it without understanding the language.
* [[Sant Bhasha]], a mélange of archaic [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and several other languages, is the language of the [[Sikh]] holy scripture [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref name="Dass2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=Nirmal Dass | title=Songs of Saints from Adi Granth | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZSndbFnrVIC&amp;pg=PA13 | accessdate=29 November 2012 | year=2000 | publisher=SUNY Press | isbn=978-0-7914-4684-3 | page=13 | quote = Any attempt at translating songs from the Adi Granth certainly involves working not with one language, but several, along with dialectical differences. The languages used by the saints range from Sanskrit; regional Prakrits; western, eastern and southern Apabhramsa; and Sahaskrit.  More particularly, we find sant bhasha, Marathi, Old Hindi, central and Lehndi Panjabi, Sindhi and Persian. There are also many dialects deployed, such as Purbi Marwari, Bangru, Dakhni, Malwai, and Awadhi.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is different from the various dialects of Punjabi that exist today.
*  [[Vedic]] &amp; Classical [[Sanskrit]], the dialects of the [[Veda]]s and other sacred texts of [[Hinduism]] as well as the original language of several sects of early [[Buddhism]] and a language of [[Jainism]].
* [[Old Church Slavonic]], which was the liturgical language of the Slavic [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]
* [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] is the current liturgical language of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]]  and the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and certain [[Byzantine]] ([[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian]]) [[Eastern Catholic]] churches.
* [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], cultivated and preserved in [[Assyria]] and [[Babylon]] long after its extinction as an everyday language.
* [[Syriac language|Syriac]], a type of [[Aramaic]], is used as a liturgical language by [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] who belong to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], and [[Maronite Church]].

The Yoruba descendants in these communities, as well as non-descendants that have adopted one of the Yoruba-based religions in the diaspora, no longer speak any of the Yoruba dialects with any level of fluency.  And the liturgical usage also reflects the compromise of the language whereby there isn't an understanding of correct grammar nor proper intonation.  Spirit possession by the Yoruba deities in Cuba shows that the deity manifested in the devotee at a Cuban orisa ceremony delivers messages to the faithful in [[Bozal]], a type of Spanish-based creole with some words of Yoruba language as well as those of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] origin with an inflection similar to the way Africans would speak as they were learning Spanish during enslavement.
* [[Habla Congo]] (or ''Habla Bantu'') is a [[Kongo language|Kongo]]-based [[liturgical language]] of the [[Palo religion]] with origins in Cuba, later spreading to other countries in the [[Caribbean Basin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6207">The '''Seven Sisters''' refers to a collection of seven leading [[law firm]]s with offices in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/28/drew-hasselback-seven-sisters-no-longer-rule-the-bay-street-roost/| title=Drew Hasselback: 'Seven sisters' no longer rule the Bay Street roost| first=Drew|last=Hasselback|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=Financial Post|publisher=Postmedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Legal Week]]'', these firms have "fundamentally dominated" the Canadian legal market for the last several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/analysis/1163926/canada-canada-sisters-law|title=Canada: Canada's sisters in law|first=Mark|last=Goddard|date=27 May 2009|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=Legal Week|publisher=ALM Media}}{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

The term was coined by John Alexander Black, founder of Lexpert magazine, now owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]. In 2006, Black noted that "the moniker may have run its course and that some people argue the Seven have shrunk to two or possibly three."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/clouds-darken-legal-horizon-black-warns/article728433/ |title= Clouds darken legal horizon, Black warns |publisher=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only five of the seven have expanded to become national law firms in Canada. The 'club of nine' was a similar term used in the UK until it was replaced by the [[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]. 

==Members==
In alphabetical order the Seven Sisters are:

*[[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon|Blakes]]
*[[Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg|Davies]]
*[[Goodmans|Goodmans]]
*[[McCarthy Tétrault|McCarthy]]
*[[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt|Osler]]

'''Workplace communication''' is the process of exchanging information and ideas, both verbal and non-verbal, within an organization. An organization may consist of employees from different parts of the society. These may have different cultures and backgrounds, and can be used to different norms. To unite activities of all employees and restrain from any missed deadline or activity that could affect the company negatively, [[communication]] is crucial. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved. Workplace communication is tremendously important to organizations because it increases productivity and efficiency. Ineffective workplace communication leads to communication gaps between employees, which causes confusion, wastes time, and reduces productivity. Misunderstandings that cause friction between people can be avoided by effective workplace communication.Effective communication, also called open communication, prevents barriers from forming among individuals within companies that might impede progress in striving to reach a common goal. For businesses to function as desired, managers and lower-level employees must be able to interact clearly and effectively with each other through verbal communication and non-verbal communication to achieve specific business goals. Effective communication with clients plays a vital role in development of an organization and success of any business. When communicating, [[nonverbal communication]] must also be taken into consideration. How a person delivers a message has a lot of influence on the meaning of this one. 

Another important aspect to have effective workplace communication is taking into consideration the different backgrounds of employees. "While diversity enriches the environment, it can also cause communication barriers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=Kristina L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Yesenia|last3=Borkowski|first3=Nancy|title=Organizational Behavior in Workplace|date=Dec 23, 2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties arise when a coworker’s cultural background leads him or her to think differently than another. It is for this reason that knowing about [[intercultural communication]] at work and learning how to treat others without offending them can bring several benefits to the company.

==Method of communication==

Different people absorb information in different ways. To make sure that the information conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication must be simple, clear, and precise. When presenting vital information, using pictures will make way for easy understanding. The presence of trust inside a corporation will also simplify the use of communication. Relationships must be established between coworkers to create a tension-free workplace. Messages should be sent and received with no alterations. To achieve healthy relationships in the workplace, behaviors such as bullying, taking credit for someone else's work and [[Free rider problem|free riding]] should be avoided. These will create toxic relationships that will, in the long run, impact negatively a company and the productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeIuliis|first1=David, PhD.|title="Workplace Communication"|journal=Communication Research Trends.|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferring [[two-way communication]] is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henson|first=Baden|title=Communication in the workplace|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Milton, Old|ISBN=0-7314-0650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The content of the information plays a major role in workplace communication. The level of detail must be according to the grasping capacity of the audience. Giving too much detail may get the audience bored and too little detail won’t make them involved. Use of [[jargon]] while communicating is not considered good for effective workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sudden|first=Marsha|title=Effective workplace communication : skills for success in life and on the job|year=2007|publisher=JUST Works|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|ISBN=1-59357-433-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency==

While formal workplace communication that is done too rarely or too often is not good for an organization, frequent informal workplace communication has its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Steve |author2=David Frolic |author3=Owen Day-Jones|title=Informal workplace communication: what is it like and how might we support it?|journal=CHI '94 Proceedings of the SIGHS conference on Human factors in computing systems: celebrating interdependence|date=April 24–28, 1994|pages=131–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A perfect balance is required for the proper functioning of an organization. Information must be communicated as and when required rather than holding unnecessary meetings frequently. At the same time crucial information must not be held till the last hour or day, instead they must be communicated early to engage employees in the objectives of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Picardi|first=Richard P.|title=Skills of workplace communication : a handbook for T &amp; D specialists and their organizations|year=2001|publisher=Quorum Books|location=West port, Conn.|ISBN=978-1-56720-362-2|edition=[Online-Gauss.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==

Getting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills, negotiation and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This requires providing the employees some basic financial literacy like financial statements, sales, profitability, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Person|first=Sharon J. Person, Steven M.|title=Workplace communication : process and product|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|ISBN=0-13-228808-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When selecting a candidate, most employers seek for those who have strong speaking and writing skills. Problem solving and self- motivation are also highly necessary skills among the workplace. These allow rapidly changing environments to become less of a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=B|title=What communication skills do employers want? Silicon Valley Recruiters Respond|journal=Journal of employment counseling|date=March 2005|volume=42|issue=1|pages=2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

With the fast evolution of technology, companies have to stay up to date with communication tools that facilitate the workplace communication. Some of these include email, blogs, instant messaging and even social media sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. It is important to keep in mind that sending an email, a fax or a letter does not necessarily mean that communication has taken place. Only when a message has been sent, received and understood by the intended receiver, it can be said that communication has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=Kristina L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Yesenia|last3=Borkowski|first3=Nancy|title=Organizational Behavior in Workplace|date=Dec 23, 2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they facilitate communication, studies have shown that communication tools may distract employees from their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=T|last2=Dawson|first2=R|last3=Wilson|first3=D|title=Reducing the effect of email interruption on employees|journal=International Journal of Information Management|date=2003|volume=21|issue=1|page=55-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the interrupt effect, methods such as employee training and changing of environment can be implemented. Employees making themselves unavailable during specific times of the day or week can also help resolve this issue. This will increase concentration and as a result, productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Conaill|first1=Brid|last2=Frohlich|first2=David|title=Timespace in the workplace: dealing with interruptions|journal=Conference Companion on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=1995|volume=CHI 95|pages=262-263|doi=10.1145/223355.223665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to have effective communication in a workplace can be achieved by having a central portal where everybody can access all the relevant information, communications, documents, and contracts in one place. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramadas|first1=Nidhin|title=Effective tools for workplace communication|url=https://axerosolutions.com/blogs/timeisenhauer/pulse/283/5-foolproof-business-communication-tools-every-company-should-be-using|website=axerosolutions|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers==

Common barriers to effective communication at workplace:

Physical barriers: Physical structure, location and construction of the workplace acts as a barrier to effective communication. Employees seated remotely from each other hinders effective interaction. 

Language barriers: Employees with different native languages will be working in an organization. As everyone in organization are not comfortable with native language of the other person, language acts as a barrier for effective workplace communication. 

Cultural barriers: Employees from different cultures, following different practices will be working in an organization. This cultural diversity among the employees can act as barrier for effective communication at workplace. 

Emotional barriers: Emotional barriers like fear, inferiority, shyness, lack of self confidence and skills will stop an employee in communicating effectively with his colleagues.

Perception barriers: Employees will have different experiences, values, preferences and attitudes.These may lead to a variety of assumptions and can act as a communication barrier.

[[Image:Apollo 11 map notations.jpg|thumb|right|Notes on a map written with a felt-tip pen by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] while in orbit around the Moon]]
Several instruments have been used to write in [[outer space]], including different types of [[pencil]]s and [[pen]]s. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space conditions.

A common [[urban legend]] states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the conditions experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was developed independently by a private organization in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that NASA spent thousands of dollars developing a space pen, whereas the Russians just took a pencil?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/apollo-nasa-pen.asp|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fisher Space Pen|url=https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html|publisher=Steve Garber, NASA History Web Curator|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov testing out his first Fisher Space Pen back in 1968 | url=http://www.pinterest.com/pin/71987294015259014/ | accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission requirements==
Space versus ground recordkeeping presents several serious issues:

===Contamination control===
{{main|Contamination control}}
{{also|Apollo 1}}
As with submarines before them, space capsules are closed environments, subject to strict contamination requirements. Incoming material is screened for mission threats.  Any shedding, including wood, graphite, and ink vapors and droplets, may become a risk.  In the case of a manned capsule, the much smaller recirculating volume, combined with [[microgravity]] and an even greater difficulty of resupply, make these requirements even more critical.

Release of wood shavings, graphite dust, broken graphite tips, and ink compounds are a dangerous flight hazard.  Lack of gravity makes objects drift, even with air filtration.  Any conductive material is a threat to electronics, including the electromechanical switches in use during early manned space programs.  Nonconductive particles may also hamper switch contacts, such as normally-open and rotary mechanisms.  Drifting particles are a threat to the eyes (and to a lesser extent an inhalation threat), which may risk execution of a critical procedure.  Personnel may don protective gear, but both ground and flight crews are more comfortable and more productive "[[Shirt-sleeve environment|in shirtsleeves]]".  Paul C. Fisher of Fisher Pen Company recounts that pencils were 'too dangerous to use in space'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Pen History | url = http://www.allwrite.com/Space-Pen-History.html | accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the [[Apollo 1|Apollo 1 fire]], the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|CM crew cabin]] was reviewed for hazardous materials such as paper, velcro, and even low-temperature plastics.  A directive was issued but poorly enforced.  When combined with high oxygen [[Partial pressure|content]], the Apollo 1 cabin burned within seconds, killing all three crew members.

Cosmonaut [[Anatoly Solovyev]] flew with Space Pens starting in the '80s and states "pencil lead breaks...and is not good in space capsule; very dangerous to have metal lead particles in zero gravity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Just the FAQ Ma'am | url = http://www.thewritersedge.com/faq.cfm | accessdate = October 4, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224752/http://www.thewritersedge.com/faq.cfm | archivedate = October 4, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission assurance and quality records===
{{main|Mission assurance}}
{{also|Life-critical system|System engineering}}
Strict documentation requirements accompany anything as complex as a large-scale aerospace demonstration, let alone a manned spaceflight.  [[Quality assurance records]] document individual parts, and instances of procedures, for deviances.  Low production and flight rates generally result in high variance; most spacecraft designs (to say nothing of individual spacecraft) fly so infrequently that they are considered [[experimental aircraft]].  When combined with the stringent [[Mass ratio|weight drivers]] of orbital and deep-space flight, the quality-control demands are high.  [[Change control]] records track the evolution of hardware and procedures from their ground testing, [[Flight test|initial flights]], through [[Shakedown (testing)|necessary corrections]] and midlife revision and upgrades, and on to [[Organizational memory|retention of engineering knowledge]] for later programs, and any [[Forensic science|incident investigations]].

When the flight also has scientific or engineering science objectives, [[Dirty data|low-quality data]] may affect mission success directly.

Faced with these requirements, pencils or other non-permanent recordkeeping methods are unsatisfactory.  The act of taking [[Transparency (behavior)|permanent, high-integrity documentation]] itself deters [[kludge]]s, [[workaround]]s, and "[[go fever]]".  The Apollo 1 investigation uncovered procedural and workmanship deficiencies in multiple areas, up to procedures on the pad.

===Pressure and temperature===

At sea level, temperature is moderated by the thick atmosphere.  As air pressure falls, temperatures can swing more dramatically.  Many early manned missions operated at below standard pressure, to decrease the stresses (and thus, mass) of their [[Pressure vessel|capsules]].  Many did not have separate airlocks, instead exposing the entire cabin to hard vacuum at times.  Low pressures also exacerbate contamination issues, as substances acceptable at standard conditions may begin outgassing at lower pressures or higher temperatures.  While the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] had a {{convert|14.7|psi|abbr=on}} design pressure, and could use its [[orbital module]] as an airlock, the orbital module would be deleted for planned [[Zond program|lunar missions]].  In any case, a pen which was insensitive to pressure and temperature would eliminate the issue (including accidental depressurizations), provide a [[Factor of safety|margin]], and allow the ability to record during extravehicular activities.

==Pre-existing writing instruments==
The wood [[pencil]] has been used for writing by [[NASA]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space programs from the start. It is simple with no moving parts, except for the [[pencil sharpener|sharpener]]. However, wood, graphite, and rubber (in the [[eraser]]) are all [[combustible]] and create dust. Graphite, in particular, both burns and produces dust that conducts [[electricity]].

The [[mechanical pencil]] has been used by NASA starting in the 1960s [[Gemini program]]. It can be made to be as wide as the width of astronauts' gloves, yet maintain its light weight. There are no wooden components which might catch fire and create dust. However, the pencil lead still creates graphite dust that conducts electricity.

[[Grease pencil]]s on plastic slates were used by the Soviet space program as an early substitute for wood pencils. It is simple with no moving parts. The paper shroud is peeled back when needed. The disadvantage is that the paper wrapper has to be disposed of. Writing done with the grease pencil is also [[Data integrity|not as durable]] as ink on paper.

[[Ballpoint pen]]s have been used by Soviet and then Russian space programs as a substitute for grease pencils as well as NASA and ESA. The pens are cheap, use paper (which is easily available), and writing done using pen is more permanent than that done with graphite pencils and grease pencils, which makes the ball point pen more suitable for log books and scientific note books. However, the ink is indelible, and depending on composition is subject to [[outgassing]] and [[Viscosity|temperature variations]].

[[Marker pen|Felt-tip pens]] were used by NASA astronauts in the [[Apollo missions]].  However, wick-based instruments are designed around low viscosity, and thus [[operating temperature]] and pressure.

==Writing instruments specifically intended for space writing==
The Fisher Space Pen is a gas-charged ball point pen that is rugged and works in a wider variety of conditions, such as [[zero gravity]], [[vacuum]] and extreme temperatures. Its [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] ink and vent-free cartridge release no significant vapor at common temperatures and low pressures. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa), and it functions at altitudes up to 12,500 feet (3800 m) and at temperatures from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C). However, it is more expensive than the aforementioned alternatives.
