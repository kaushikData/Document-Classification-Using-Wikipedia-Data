The '''2010 Russian wildfires''' were several hundred [[wildfires]] that broke out across [[Russia]], primarily in [[European Russia|the west]] in summer 2010. They started burning in late July and lasted until early September 2010. The fires were associated with record-high temperatures, which were attributed to [[climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = J. | authorlink1 = James Hansen| last2 = Sato | first2 = M. | last3 = Ruedy | first3 = R. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1205276109 | title = PNAS Plus: Perception of climate change | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume = 109 | issue = 37 | pages = E2415 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = 3443154}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the summer had been the hottest recorded in Russian history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/Russia-Wildfires-Rage-Amid-Record-Heat-99850004.html?refresh=1|title=Russia Wildfires Rage Amid Record Heat &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; English|publisher=.voanews.com|date=3 August 2010|accessdate=10 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804205402/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/Russia-Wildfires-Rage-Amid-Record-Heat-99850004.html?refresh=1| archivedate= 4 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and [[drought]].&lt;ref name="lenta_2_avg_smoke"/&gt;

Russian [[President of Russia|President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in seven regions, and 28 other regions were under a state of emergency due to [[crop failures]] caused by the drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kramer|first=Andrew|title=A smoky curtain falls on Moscow|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/a-smoky-curtain-falls-on-moscow-20100807-11pcw.html|accessdate=7 August 2010|newspaper=theage.com.au|date=8 August 2010|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fires cost roughly $15 billion in damages.

A combination of the smoke from the fires, producing heavy [[smog]] blanketing large urban regions and the record-breaking [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave#Russia|heat wave]] put stress on the Russian [[healthcare system]]. [[Munich Re]] estimated that in all, 56,000 people died from the effects of the smog and the heat wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Writers|first=Staff|title=Natural disasters killed 295,000 in 2010: reinsurer|url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Natural_disasters_killed_295000_in_2010_reinsurer_999.html|work=Agence Presse-France|publisher=Disaster Management – Terra Daily|accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 wildfires were the worst on record to that time.

==Prelude==
{{Main article|2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave}}
[[File:NOAA Temperature anomalies June 2010.gif|thumb|Global temperature anomalies in June 2010, showing a concentrated region of temperatures about 4–5 °C+ above average in Western Russia.]]

During 2010 Russia experienced dry, hot weather starting around late May and lasting until early June. Temperatures of {{Convert|35|°C}} first occurred after 12 June, which alone was an abnormality for the country (average mid-June temperatures seldom rise above {{Convert|30|°C}}). In late June, Russian regions such as the Eurasian [[Sakha Republic]], as well as areas of partial [[taiga]], had temperatures of {{Convert|38|-|40|°C|°F}}. The warm [[ridge (meteorology)|ridging]] pattern then slowly moved westward to the [[Ural Mountains]], and by July settled in European Russia.

On 25 June a new temperature record was set in the Asian portion of Russia, at [[Belogorsk, Amur Oblast]], at {{Convert|42.3|C}}. The previous record in the Asian portion was {{Convert|41.7|C}} at [[Aksha, Russia|Aksha]] on 21 July 2004. A new record for the highest nationwide temperature in Russia was set on 11 July, at {{Convert|44|°C}}, in [[Yashkul]], [[Kalmykia]] (in the European portion), beating the previous record of {{Convert|43.8|°C}} set on 6 August 1940, in Kalmykia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters |first=Jeff |title=Russia records its hottest temperature in history; 97L develops near Puerto Rico |url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1546 |publisher=Weather Underground |accessdate=19 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722041822/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1546 |archivedate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average temperatures in the region increased to over {{Convert|35|°C}}. The mean high for European Russia recorded on 26 July reached {{Convert|40|°C}} during the day. During July 2010, a large portion of European Russia was more than 7&amp;nbsp;°C (12.6&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than normal.&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters |first=Jeff |title=Bermuda eyes a weak Colin; new extreme heat record for Belarus |url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1569#commenttop |publisher=Weather Underground |accessdate=7 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820002618/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1569 |archivedate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the director of the Global Fire Monitoring Centre (GFMC) Johann Goldammer, the wildfires were caused by "negligent [human] behaviour", such as lighting barbecues and fireworks in a densely wooded area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Russia counts environmental cost of wildfires|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100812/full/news.2010.404.html|journal = Nature News|date = 2010-08-12|doi = 10.1038/news.2010.404|language = en|first = Natasha|last = Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such human activity, coupled with the unusually high temperatures over the Russian territories, catalyzed this record disturbance.

===29 July===
[[Peat|Peat fires]] causing significant loss of properties and an unverified number of human fatalities started in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]], the [[Voronezh Oblast]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Ryazan Oblast]] and across central and western Russia due to unseasonably hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/08/russian_wildfires.html|title=Russian wildfires – The Big Picture|work=Boston Globe |accessdate=7 August 2010|date=2 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804162604/http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/08/russian_wildfires.html| archivedate= 4 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of [[EMERCOM]], [[Sergey Shoygu]], reported on 31 July 2010 that the fire situation in the seventeen [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] of Russia, especially in [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]] and [[Moscow Oblast]]s, may be complicated. He claimed that in [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] the velocity of fires was 100 meters per minute, and the fiery air flow tore trees from the root, like a hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/01/infire/ area of forest fires in Russia decreased]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouTube]] video was uploaded, showing a group of men escaping from a burning village in [[Vyksa]] district by driving their car over a burning road.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOI6OCHerUI Youtube video of car driving through fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1 August===
On 1 August 2010, the area of the forest fires was {{convert|114000|ha|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="lenta_2_avg_fires"/&gt;
The Central Regional Center MOE Russia website reported that in Moscow Oblast 130 foci of natural fires were detected, covering the area of 880 hectares. Of those, 67 fires covered an area of 178 hectares.&lt;ref name="lenta_2_avg_smoke"/&gt;

===2 August===
[[File:Moscow Smog 08-2010.jpg|thumb|Smoke of the wildfires over Moscow.]]

According to "[[Interfax]]" referring to the head of the National Center for Crisis Management of [[EMERCOM]] Vladimir Stepanov, as of {{Nowrap|2 August}} 2010, Russia revealed approximately 7,000 fires in the area over {{convert|500000|ha|km2|abbr=on}}. Fire was also burning in 14 federal subjects of Russia, and on {{Nowrap|2 August}} 2010, officials reported the death of 34 people.&lt;ref name="lenta_2_avg_fires"&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/02/fires/ Area fires in Russia increased to {{Nowrap|500 thousand}} hectares]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow on Monday was covered in smoke, with reduced road visibility.&lt;ref name="lenta_2_avg_smoke"&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/02/smoke "Moscow once again enveloped with smoke from fires"]&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 2 August 2010, [[Vladimir Putin]] scheduled a meeting with the [[List of heads of federal subjects of Russia|Governors]] of [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Samara Oblast|Samara]], Moscow, [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], and [[Vladimir Oblast]]s, as well as the Head of the [[Mordovia|Republic of Mordovia]].&lt;ref name="lenta_2_avg_smoke"/&gt;

===4 August===
By 4 August, the wildfires were still burning over {{convert|188525|ha|km2|abbr=on}}, with a death toll of at least 48. Some fires burned in areas near the nuclear research center in [[Sarov]]. However [[Rosatom]] head [[Sergey Kiriyenko]] dismissed apprehension of an atomic explosion.&lt;ref name="rosatom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Media Group|first=Rambler|script-title=ru:"Росатом" призвал не бояться ядерного взрыва в Сарове|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/04/noapocalypse|accessdate=5 August 2010|newspaper=Lenta.ru|date=4 August 2010|agency=ООО "Лента.Ру" (1999–2012)|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] cut short his summer break to return to Moscow for an emergency meeting of the national security council to address the crisis.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10865316 |work=BBC News |title=Medvedev cuts holiday as Russian wildfires kill 48 |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805042717/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10865316 |archivedate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At an international meeting on 30 July, amid the ongoing heat wave and wildfires, Medvedev announced on television that "practically everything is burning. The weather is anomalously hot. What's happening with the planet's climate right now needs to be a wake-up call to all of us, meaning all heads of state, all heads of social organizations, in order to take a more energetic approach to countering the [[global warming|global changes to the climate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuster |first=Simon |title=Will Russia's Heat Wave End Its Global-Warming Doubts? |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2008081,00.html?hpt=T2 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |newspaper=TIME |date=2 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806163358/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C2008081%2C00.html?hpt=T2 |archivedate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JR-pcc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/perception-climate-change/ | title=Perception of Climate Change: Examining Extreme Temperatures}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-pcc"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = James | last2 = Sato | first2 = Makiko | last3 = Ruedy | first3 = Reto | year = 2012 | title = Perception of climate change | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1205276109  | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/07/30/1205276109.abstract| pmc = 3443154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental groups, such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], and "non-systemic" opposition politicians suggested firefighting has been slowed down by the Forest Code law passed by the [[Duma]] in 2006 at the order of Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The New Forest Code of Russia (2006): WWF’s Comments|url = http://www.wwf.ru/about/what_we_do/forests/codecs/forestcode/eng|website = www.wwf.ru|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation transferred responsibility for the country's vast woodlands to regional authorities, putting 70,000 forestry guards out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bryanski, Gleb|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE6723BL20100803|title=Opposition says Putin law cripples Russia fire-fighting|date=3 August 2010|work=[[Reuters|Reuters Africa]]|accessdate=3 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100806115558/https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE6723BL20100803| archivedate= 6 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5 August===
According to the Emergencies Ministry, there were 843 reported outbreaks of fires, including 47 peat fires. There were 73 large fires.&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt; The fires threatened an animal sanctuary for over 1,800 animals, including dogs and retired [[circus]] animals. Almost 600 fires were still burning in the country, and around 2,000 homes had been destroyed. The President fired several high-ranking military officials after fires burned through a secret military base.&lt;ref name="UKPA"&gt;{{cite news|last=UKPA|first=Google|title=Wildfires threaten animal sanctuary|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gu1saKQUPFvbXWiVr7XE1Wqie6Gg|accessdate=5 August 2010|newspaper=The Press Association|date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon monoxide]] pollution in Moscow was four times above normal. Firefighters fought to prevent the wildfires from reaching [[Bryansk]], an area bordering Ukraine contaminated with radioactive material, including [[cesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], in the soils following the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Emergencies Minister [[Sergey Shoygu]] warned that fires could release [[radionuclide]]s into the air. He said that a new zone of [[radioactive pollution]] could emerge.

Early in the afternoon of 10 August [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace Russia]] stated that fires were raging in radioactive polluted areas near [[Bryansk]], which is quite polluted due to the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986. This area is still heavily contaminated and has no inhabitants. In the Moscow area a heavy thunderstorm broke over the city. NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rates decreased from 8 times normal to normal NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rates. Unfortunately expectations are not favorable with temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius. Experts stated that the polluted air would continue again within a few days. Environmental scientists stated that the [[brown cloud]] produced by the fires may cause [[soot]] to land on [[Arctic sea ice]], causing faster melting. The release of industrial [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] from the fires and [[cryoconite]] causing melting on the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] were also concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Alister|title=Russia fires cause "brown cloud", may hit Arctic|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67937Y20100810|accessdate=22 August 2010|newspaper=Reuters|date=10 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100815024101/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67937Y20100810| archivedate= 15 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Moscow Times]]'' wrote on 17 August 2010:&lt;blockquote&gt;Volunteers, widely snubbed by professional firefighters because of their lack of experience, have saved several villages by using basic shovels and buckets of water and sand. Even after a larger fire is suppressed with a fire hose, the [[underbrush]] often continues to burn, and a gust of wind can ignite it into a blaze once again. Using shovels and water backpacks, volunteers in Yuvino isolated burning [[groundcover]], cleared a fire line around the village, and loaned firefighters a pump to fill their trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/volunteers-take-fires-into-own-hands/412473.htm "Volunteers Take Fires Into Own Hands" by Maria Antonova, ''The Moscow Times'', 17 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteer casualties===
One volunteer died in action in the [[Lukhovitsy]] District on 29 July 2010; the body was found on 15 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifenews.ru/news/34770 В Луховицах найдено тело тракториста, пропавшего во время тушения лесного пожара.] (''In [[Lukhovitsy]] found the body of the tractor driver, who disappeared while fighting a forest fire.

==Censorship==
Local Russian commercial and governmental mass media did not provide real-time information for the general public. In the case of a fast-moving [[wildfire]] there would be no chance to inform people via mass media about emergency evacuation. Furthermore, there was no official of [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev's]] administration personally responsible for providing emergency information of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evgen2.livejournal.com/66501.html "В администрации президента никто персонально не отвечает"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120722174627/http://evgen2.livejournal.com/66501.html |date=22 July 2012 }} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a piece under his byline on the ''[[Moscow Times]]'' website, "Right Cause" party co-founder [[Georgy Bovt]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;State-controlled television revealed as little information as possible to the public about the fires and smog. Its primary goal was to prevent panic. This eerily reminded me of how the Soviet government reacted to the [[Chernobyl]] explosion in April 1986. In a similar manner, the authorities withheld information about the extent of the nuclear fallout to “avoid panic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/putins-vertical-power-disaster/412296.html "Putin's Vertical Power Disaster" by Georgy Bovt, ''The Moscow Times'', 13 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some cases, no information about villages affected by wildfire was available for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=385249 О сгоревшей деревне Александровке узнали только спустя 2 недели (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors from several medical institutions in Moscow, interviewed by an [[Interfax]] correspondent, acknowledged that medical professionals were now forbidden to make a diagnosis of "[[Heat illness|thermal shock]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/society/news.asp?id=149306 В Москве врачам запретили ставить диагноз "тепловой удар" (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Vedomosti]]'' poll on information about the fires in the newspapers, 68% of people said that they trusted online media such as [[blogs]], 28% independent media, and only 4% government media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedomosti.ru/poll/opinions/48/748 Какому источнику информации о пожарах в Центральной России Вы больше доверяете? "Which source of information about fires in central Russia you most trust?", 4 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Government [[Radio Mayak]] broadcast on 13 August:&lt;blockquote&gt;Vice-minister of [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] Alexander Chupriyan said on Friday (13 August 2010) that the peat fires were extinguished completely in the [[Noginsk]], [[Kolomna]], [[Pavlovsky Posad]] and [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]] areas near Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomayak.ru/doc.html?id=197924 14 August 2010 11:55 "радио "Маяк" Помощь добровольцев для тушения пожаров больше не требуется] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928113842/http://www.radiomayak.ru/doc.html?id=197924 |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A volunteer wrote about the same events on 13 August 2010 in the [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]] area in his blog:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have never seen such...Along the roads—the burned forest.

Independent radio [[:ru:Русская служба новостей|РСН]] on 14 August:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|MOE]] said that nothing is burning...TV show that nothing is burning...Civilians forced to buy fire equipment for firemen&amp;nbsp;...

Another volunteer wrote about the events on 15 August 2010 in the same [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]] area in his blog:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The situation in [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo|Orekhovo]] is stable, i.e. a stable grassroots fire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120711072242/http://community.livejournal.com/pozar_ru/208102.html Новости из Орехово-Зуево], News from [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]] 15 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Russian policies==
The [[swamps]] and bogs surrounding Moscow had been drained in the 1960s for agricultural use and mining of [[peat]] to generate energy.&lt;ref name=wildfire/&gt; In 2002, a series of hard-to-extinguish peat fires led the government to recognize that the peat fields needed to be re-watered to prevent wildfires.&lt;ref name=wildfire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildfiremag.com/tactics/russia_institutes_peat |author=Serghey Stelmakovich |title=Russia institutes peat fire prevention program |accessdate=9 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618114909/http://wildfiremag.com/tactics/russia_institutes_peat/ |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, however, large expanses of peat areas had not been rewatered and were kindling wildfires.

Government officials said they could not have anticipated the heatwave, but critics blamed complacent officials for ignoring warnings of blazes near villages.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Parfitt in Moscow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/06/russia-fires-moscow|title=Smoke from Russian fires blankets Moscow &amp;#124; World news|work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=10 August 2010|date=6 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100816034053/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/06/russia-fires-moscow| archivedate= 16 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergey Robaten, Vadim Tatur, and Maksim Kalashnikov argued that the fires and the inability to contain and extinguish them was due to "the inaction of bureaucrats" and Putin's elimination of the [[Russian State Fire Service]] in 2007. Putin had transferred responsibility for fighting fires to those renting state property and the subjects of the federation, with the assumption that owners or renters would invest in whatever was necessary to prevent forest fires. However, the reality was more complex; Russian companies were seeking to turn a quick profit and thus neglected forest firefighting. Putin's spokesman remarked, "this is a well-functioning system which only needs some minor adjustments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goble |first=Paul |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/201008076634/putins-destruction-of-forest-service-in-2007-behind-russias-current-fire-disaster.html |title=Putin's Destruction Of Forest Service In 2007 Behind Russia's Current Fire Disaster |publisher=Eurasiareview.com |accessdate=10 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822000638/http://www.eurasiareview.com/201008076634/putins-destruction-of-forest-service-in-2007-behind-russias-current-fire-disaster.html |archivedate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryanski|first=Gleb|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6723BL20100804|title=Opposition says Putin law cripples Russia fire-fighting &amp;#124; Reuters|publisher=Uk.reuters.com|accessdate=10 August 2010|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the [[Arab Spring]]==
The wildfires destroyed one-third of Russia's [[wheat]] harvest. The [[Russian government]] refused to export the rest of its harvest and set a [[grain]] export ban to fight [[inflation]]. This led to extremely high food prices, which led to panicking on the global markets. Many experts including from the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] say that the Russian wildfires in summer 2010 played a leading role in triggering the Arab Spring starting in 2010, especially in [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egypt's case]]. Higher food prices helped to make oppression, poverty, and corruption under autocratic leaders even more aching for the local population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/content/article-2011-food-price-spikes-helped-trigger-arab-spring-135576278/149523.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzyXYoZbyK4#t=199&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as Russia was not even a member of the [[WTO]] at the time, banning exports was not a problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/rr-impact-russias-grain-export-ban-280611-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8726">The number of new [[Psychiatric medication|psychiatric drugs]], and especially [[antidepressants]] on the market in [[Japan]], is significantly less than [[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanba S |title=Disparities in drug development: the Japanese paradox |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=13–4 |date=Jan 1999 |pmid=9987203 |pmc=1188972 |url=http://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/12758/la_id/1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest barriers to antidepressants coming to the market is that the [[Social welfare in Japan|medical insurance system in Japan is national]], and the authorities are keen to contain a potentially explosive market for drugs like antidepressants that could be used or abused by persons in various forms of distress.&lt;ref name="Sep 2005"/&gt;

Although large [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies have not been done in Japan, it is thought that up to 6 million Japanese suffer from [[major depressive disorder|depression]], with a lifetime prevalence of 13 to 17.3%, which is similar to that seen in Western countries.&lt;ref name="Sep 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger D |title=Antidepressant clinical development in Japan: Current perspectives and future horizons |journal=Clinical Research Focus |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=32–5 |date=Sep 2005 |url=http://www.japanpsychiatrist.com/Abstracts/AntiDepJap.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market==
While the market has seen the entry of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) [[fluvoxamine]] (Luvox-Fujisawa, Depromel-Meiji Seika), [[paroxetine]] (Paxil-GSK), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft-Pfizer), and the [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]] [[milnacipran]] (Toledomin-Asahi Kasei-Janssen), other antidepressants including [[citalopram]] ([[Cipramil]]/Cipralex-Lundbeck), [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac-Eli Lilly), [[venlafaxine]] (Effexor-Wyeth) and others are either still under investigation in Japan or have dropped their pursuit on gaining entry into the Japanese market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berger D, Fukunishi I |title=Psychiatric drug development in Japan |journal=Science|volume=273 |issue=5273 |pages=318–9 |date=Jul 1996 |pmid=8685717 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8685717 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5273.318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although none of the antidepressants on the market in Japan have been studied using [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo controls]], this had begun to change since the beginning of the 2000s. Prior clinical developments have pitted the new drug against a drug already on the market using a non-inferiority method of comparison, however, this method is known to be subject to placebo effects, e.g. depressive symptoms lifting due to effects other than [[pharmacologic]] drug effect.&lt;ref name="Sep 2005" /&gt; In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, [[fluvoxamine]] was superior to placebo for [[Generalized anxiety disorder|General Anxiety Disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asakura|first=Satoshi|last2=Tajima|first2=Osamu|last3=Koyama|first3=Tsukasa|date=2006-03-30|title=Fluvoxamine treatment of generalized social anxiety disorder in Japan: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study|url=https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/10/2/263/655972|journal=The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=10|issue=02|pages=263|doi=10.1017/S1461145706006602|issn=1461-1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Japanese medical report in 2002, [[Trazodone]] and [[Tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) were widely available in Japan while only two [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] ([[paroxetine]] and [[fluvoxamine]]) were marketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.or.jp/english/pdf/2002_01/028_033.pdf|title=Drug Therapy for Depression in Japan|last=Kamimura|first=Makoto|last2=Aoba|first2=Anri|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]], [[sertraline]], received approval in April 2006 after over 15 years of clinical trial development in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesciencesworld.com/news/view/7395 Life Sciences World - Online resource for biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical devices and life sciences industries.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmda.go.jp/files/000153730.pdf|title=FY2006 List of Approved Products: New Drugs|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|publisher=Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency|format=pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three most sold antidepressants in Japan were by the end of 2010 were [[paroxetine]] with a value market share of 37%, [[sertraline]] with a share of 20% and [[fluvoxamine]] with a share of 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asianscientist.com/2011/08/pharma/lundbeck-mochida-mitsubishi-lexapro-escitalopram-japan/|title=Lundbeck Launches Antidepressent Lexapro In Japan|date=2011-08-27|work=Asian Scientist Magazine {{!}}  Science, technology and medical news updates from Asia|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citalopram]] (Lundbeck), an SSRI on the market since the late 1980s is not available in Japan, however on April 22, 2011 [[escitalopram]] (the S-isomer [[enantiomer]] of [[citalopram]]), was approved for use in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/22/lundbeck-japan-idUSLDE73L03X20110422 | work=Reuters | first=Mette | last=Fraende | title=Lundbeck gets Lexapro approval in Japan | date=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little news, however, on the status of [[bupropion]] ([[GlaxoSmithKline|Glaxo Smith-Kline]]), used widely in Western countries since the early 1990s and long in clinical trials in Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5423">'''Armenicum''' is a drug invented in [[Armenia]] in 1998 that its developers claim is an effective treatment for [[HIV]] infection and a number of associated diseases. No rigorously monitored clinical trials of Armenicum have been published, and most HIV experts outside of Armenia do not endorse its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/564867.stm|title=Scepticism over Aids 'cure'|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a [[BBC]] investigation involving interviews with scientists involved in administering the drug, patients and creator [[Alexander Ilyen]] raised serious doubts about the drug's efficacy, concluding that Armenicum might do more harm than good. Dr. [[Manfred Dietrich]] of the [[Institute for Tropical Medicine]] in [[Hamburg]] told the BBC "I would not recommend at all to take such a drug." while an American patient said "we’re in a worse state than we were before we went." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/highlights/000720_armenicum.shtml|title=Access Armenicum|last=|first=|date=20 July 2000|website=BBC World Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, the most effective treatment for HIV are antiretroviral drugs, which in internationally accepted clinical trials have been the only proven way to keep patients alive, often for years. The drugs work by directly attacking and reducing the amount of HIV in the body, keeping the patient from developing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a complete immune system failure that leads to death. The drugs, offered in cocktails of three or four at a time, are often changed as the virus becomes resistant.

Alternatively, the makers of Armenicum claim it boosts the immune system, allowing the body to fight the virus. Armenicum clinic doctors also contend the drug has been shown to reduce a patient’s viral load—the amount of HIV in the body—and that HIV never becomes resistant to it. The problem is that company scientists have never tried to prove any of these claims. They admit to not even formally monitoring the 250 patients who have been treated with the drug during the period from 2004 to 2008.&lt;ref name="eur"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav112508.shtml|title=Ten Years On, Armenia's So-Called "Miracle Cure" for AIDS Still Unproven|last=Khojoyan|first=Sara|date=2008-11-24|work=EurasiaNet|access-date=2017-06-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Kohlenberg|first2=Leah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main ingredient of Armenicum is [[iodine]], a general [[antiseptic]]. According to the manufacturers it also contains [[dextrin]], [[polyvinyl alcohol]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[lithium]] cations and [[chloride]] anions. It is described as a "blue-violet liquid with specific odor, packed in orange glass bottles per 20ml and corked tightly by a rubber plug clutched by aluminum caps."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenicum.am/instruction.html ARMENICUM is a highly promising drug for treatment of HIV infection and AIDS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205051229/http://www.armenicum.am/instruction.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Armenicum was first introduced in Armenia in 1998, founders called it a "revolutionary cure for AIDS," and it immediately captured Armenia's high-ranking government officials’ interest. Early on, initial payments for Armenicum treatments came from the Armenian Defense Ministry, hoping to promote the drug’s research and development. Armenicum’s possibilities caused a buzz of excitement in the tiny country. Businessmen, it was reported in some newspapers in 1999, were buying up property so that they could rent it to all the people who would fly to Armenia to take the cure. However, as of November 2008, only about 800 people have taken Armenicum, which is financed by the Armenian government at a cost of around $6,000 per patient per year.&lt;ref name="eur"/&gt;

==Kolesnikov Controversy==
On 8 September 2000, Nikolai Kolesnikov, who had received treatment for AIDS in "Armenicum" center in Armenia was reported dead in one of [[Kaliningrad]] hospitals. According to his doctors, Armenicum turned out to be a simple immunity modular, without any effect on the virus which continues to damage the cells in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbarez.com/2000/09/08/patient-treated-with-armenicum-dies/ Patient Treated With Armenicum Dies]. Asbarez.com, September 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005 Kolesnikov was reported to have frozen to death in his native Kaliningrad. There have been several other reports on his death over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armradio.am/news/?part=soc&amp;id=2124 Nikolay Kolesnikov Dead Having Reportedly Frozen To Death].

'''Auditory-verbal therapy''' is a method for teaching [[hearing impairment|deaf]] [[children]] to [[Wiktionary:listen|listen]] and [[speech|speak]] using their residual hearing in addition to the constant use of amplification devices such as [[hearing aid]]s, FM devices, and [[cochlear implant]]s. Auditory-verbal therapy emphasizes speech and listening.

Auditory verbal therapy enables deaf and hard of hearing [[children]] to participate more fully in mainstream school and hearing society. In 2006, Rhoades&lt;ref&gt;Rhoades E. (2006) Research Outcomes of Auditory-Verbal Intervention: Is the Approach Justified? Deafness Educ. Int. 8(3), 125–143&lt;/ref&gt; published an article looking at whether the Auditory Verbal approach was justified. Using Frattali’s system for weighing the strength of treatment evidence based on the degree of scientific rigour, she found 7 studies concerning the AV approach of class II level evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan D, Hickson L, Murdoch B, Houston T, and Constantinescu G. (2010). Is Auditory-Verbal Therapy Effective for Children with Hearing Loss?  Volta Rev. 110(3), 361–387

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg DM, Flexer C (September 2001). "Auditory-verbal graduates: outcome survey of clinical efficacy". J Am Acad Audiol 12 (8): 406–14. {{PMID|11599875}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhoades E, Chisholm T. (2000) Global language progress with an Auditory-Verbal approach for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Volta Rev. 102, 5–24&lt;/ref&gt; She concluded that even with the minimal number of studies, there was evidence "for the validity and effectiveness of the A-V intervention model". Following on from Rhoades’ work, Hogan et al. (2008;&lt;ref&gt;Hogan S, Stokes J, White C, Tyszkiewicz E, Woolgar A. (2008) An evaluation of Auditory Verbal Therapy using rate of early language development as an outcome measure. Deafness Educ Int. 10,143–167&lt;/ref&gt; 2010&lt;ref&gt;Hogan S, Stokes J and Weller I. (2010) Language Outcomes for Children of Low-Income Families Enrolled in Auditory Verbal Therapy. Deafness Educ Int. 12 (4) 204-216&lt;/ref&gt;) published outcomes for children in an AV programme which were essentially quasi-experimental studies in that the assessment tool used had been standardised on typically developing children and so a comparison could be drawn between the age equivalence scores obtained by the children on the study and their chronological or ‘hearing’ age. (The hearing age of a child is the duration of time since the child has had optimal access to sound.) In these studies, the average rate of language development increased significantly during the time on the programme compared to the average rate of language development prior to embarking on the programme. Dornan et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Dornan D, Hickson L, Murdoch B, Houston T. (2009) Longitudinal study of speech and language for children with hearing loss in Auditory-Verbal Therapy programs. Volta Rev. 109,1–25&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the evidence for Auditory Verbal Therapy and concluded that while it was not possible to demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between the intervention and the outcome, increasing the strength of evidence for outcomes was vital. In 2010, Dornan et al. published a longitudinal study comparing the outcomes of 29 children enrolled on an AV programme with age-matched controls. They found AV to be an effective intervention.

First Voice (a membership body which represents organisations that provide listening and spoken language therapy in Australia and New Zealand) published a study in February 2015 based on information on more than 600 children with hearing loss. When listening and spoken language outcomes of children with a hearing loss were compared to those with typical hearing most children attending AVT had ‘scores within or above the average range for typical hearing children for language (74.4%-75.6%), vocabulary (79.6%) and speech performance (71.5%). When children with additional disabilities were removed from the analysis, the number of children within or above the average range for typical hearing children increased, except for speech performance (language performance=77.9%-80.2%; vocabulary performance= 83.1%; speech performance=73.1%).’ (First Voice, 2015 pp 5).&lt;ref&gt;First Voice (February 2015). "Sound Outcomes: First Voice speech and language data.http://www.firstvoice.org.au/userfiles/file/150302_Sound_Outcomes_First_Voice_Speech_and_Language_Data.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, access to auditory verbal therapy is currently available at two cochlear implant centres (Paediatric Cochlear Implant Programme, Manchester Auditory Implant Programme and Midlands Hearing Implant Programme - Children's Service). Outside of the NHS AVT is available via award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avuk.org/our-awards|title=Auditory Verbal {{!}} Our awards|website=www.avuk.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; national charity [[Auditory Verbal UK|Auditory Verbal&lt;sup&gt;UK&lt;/sup&gt; (AV&lt;sup&gt;UK&lt;/sup&gt;)]](Oxfordshire and London); The Speech and Hearing and Language Centre, Christopher Place in London; and at the Auditory Verbal Lounge in Nottingham.

It has gained wider recognition after being described in a bestselling novel, ''[[The Constant Gardener]]'' by [[John le Carré]]. BUKO was mentioned explicitly in the author's afterword as a real counterpart to the novel's fictitious Hippo organisation (also based in Bielefeld, Germany).

BUKO is partially financed by the [[European Union]] and mostly by private supporters.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7301">Injuries in [[rock climbing]] may occur due to falls, or due to overuse (see [[Sports injury]]). Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; the vast majority of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Training for Climbing: The Definitive Guide to Improving Your Climbing |last=Hörst |first=Eric J. |authorlink=|coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Falcon Publishing |location=Guilford, Connecticut, Helena, Montana |isbn=0-7627-2313-0 |page=151 |pages= |url=http://www.trainingforclimbing.com/ |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such injuries are often no worse than torn [[callus]]es, cuts, burns and bruises. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage (esp. to [[tendon]]s, [[tendon sheath]]s, [[ligament]]s, and [[joint capsule]]s).

==Risk groups==
The climbers most prone to injuries are intermediate to expert within lead climbing or bouldering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climbing.com.au/Who%20gets%20injured%20in%20the%20gym.pdf |title=Indoor rock climbing: who gets injured? |last1=Wright |first1=D. M. |last2=Royle |first2=T. J. |last3=Marshall |first3=T |year=2001 |work= |publisher=Br J Sports Med |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overuse injuries in climbing==
In terms of overuse injuries a British study found that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Science of Rock Climbing and Mountaineering |type=A collection of scientific articles |chapter=Injuries and associated training and performance characteristics in recreational rock climbers |last1=article by: Doran |first1=D. A. |last2= Reay |first2=M. |date=2000 |isbn=0-7360-3106-5 |publisher= Human Kinetics Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 40% occurred in the fingers
* 16% in the shoulders
* 12% in the elbows
* 5% in the knees 
* 5% in the back 
* 4% in the wrists

One injury that tend to be very common among climbers is [[Carpal tunnel syndrome]]. It is found in about 25% of climbers.&lt;ref name=preston&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/hha/a.climb.htm |title=Rock Climbing Reaching New Heights |last1=Preston |first1=Dayton |date= |work= |publisher=Hughston health alert|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finger injuries ===
604 injured rock climbers were prospectively evaluated from January 1998 to December 2001, due to the rapid growth of new complex finger trauma in the mid-1980s. Of the most frequent injuries, three out of four were related to the fingers: pulley injuries accounted for 20%, tendovaginitis for 7%, and joint capsular damage for 6.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12825883 |title=Pulley injuries in rock climbers |last1=Schöffl |first1=V. |last2=Hochholzer |first2=T. |last3=Winkelmann |first3=H.P. |last4=Strecker |first4=W. |date=Summer 2003 |work= |publisher=Wilderness &amp; environmental medicine |volume=14 |issue=2 |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |pages=94–100 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2003)014[0094:piirc]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pulleys ====
Damage to the [[flexor tendon pulley]]s that encircle and support the tendons that cross the finger joints is the most common finger injury within the sport (see [[climber's finger]]).&lt;ref name=preston /&gt;
The main culprit for pulley related injuries is the common crimp grip, especially in the closed position. The crimp grip requires a near ninety-degree flexion of the middle finger joint, which produces a tremendous force load on the A2 pulley. Injuries to the A2 pulley can range from microscopic to partial tears and, in the worst case, complete ruptures. Some climbers report hearing a pop, which might be a sign of a significant tear or complete rupture, during an extremely heavy move (e.g. tiny crimp, one- or two-finger pocket). Small partial tears, or inflammation can occur over the course of several sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicros.com/archive/A2_pulley_injury.cfm |title=Finger Tendon Pulley Injury |last1=Hörst |first1=Eric J |year=2008 |work= |publisher=Nicros |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Grade I''' – Sprain of the finger ligaments (collateral ligaments), pain locally at the pulley, pain when squeezing or climbing.
* '''Grade II''' – Partial rupture of the pulley tendon. Pain locally at the pulley, pain when squeezing or climbing, possible pain while extending your finger.
* '''Grade III''' – Complete rupture of the pulley, causing bowstringing of the tendon. Symptoms can include: Pain locally at the pulley (usually sharp), may feel/hear a 'pop' or 'crack', swelling and possible bruising, pain when squeezing or climbing, pain when extending your finger, pain with resisted flexion of the finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climbinginjuries.com/page/fingers |title=DIAGNOSIS: Pulleys |last1=Roseborrough |first1=Aimee |last2=Roseborrough |first2=Kyle  |year=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Knuckle ====
*Stress fractures
*Collateral ligament injuries

=== Shoulder injuries ===
Shoulder related injuries include [[rotator cuff]] tear, strain or [[tendinitis]], biceps tendinitis and [[Slap lesion|SLAP lesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climbinginjuries.com/page/shoulders |title=Climbing Injuries: Shoulders |last1=Roseborrough |first1=Aimee |last2=Roseborrough |first2=Kyle  |year=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elbow injuries ===
[[Tennis elbow]] (Lateral Epicondylitis) is a common elbow injury among climbers, as is [[Golfer's elbow]] (Medial Epicondylitis, which is similar,  but occurs on the inside of the elbow).

===Calluses, dry skin===
Climbers often develop calluses on their fingers from regular contact with the rock and the rope. When calluses split open they expose a raw layer of skin that can be very painful. This type of injury is commonly referred to as a flapper.

The use of [[magnesium carbonate]] (chalk) for better grip dries out the skin and can often lead to cracked and damaged hands &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kletterretter.com/en/about-us/ |title=Hand cream for rock climbers |website=Kletter Retter |accessdate=5 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206023238/http://www.kletterretter.com/en/about-us/ |archivedate=February 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of skincare products available for climbers that help to treat calluses, moisturise dry hands and reduce recovery time.

[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]], in particular, non-insulin dependent diabetes, is prevalent in the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander]] populations of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Dea|first1=K|title=Diabetes in aboriginal Australians|volume=37|issue=3|pages=25–8|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 1 in 20&lt;ref name="Diabetes AIHW"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Diabetes (AIHW)|url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/diabetes/|website = www.aihw.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australians are said to suffer from diabetes, and of this amount, Aboriginals are three times as likely to succumb to this disease, in comparison to non-Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4727.0.55.001 -  Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey: First Results, Australia, 2012-13|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/CD58150AC0A36286CA257C2F0014591C?opendocument|website = www.abs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], which is a predisposed autoimmune condition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Type 1 diabetes|url = https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/type-1-diabetes|website = www.diabetesaustralia.com.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] or insulin resistant diabetes, is a preventable disease, heavily influenced by a multitude of socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diabetes in australian aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples|author1=Rowley, K.

== History ==
The history of Aboriginal Australians is said to have spanned some 60,000 years prior to colonization,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sydney's Aboriginal Past|last = Attenbrow|first = V|date = 2010|journal = Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet they were first cited by Europeans in 1606.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url = |title = Doing Aboriginal History|last = Broome|first = R|date = 2014|journal = Agora|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|edition = |pages = 40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigations of the land over the years leading to [[James Cook|James Cook's]] arrival in 1788, suggested that the Aboriginals were hunter gatherers, who were described as beasts who roamed the land.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fully utilising the resources at their disposal, the diet of the early Aboriginals was predominantly made up of land animals, fish and shellfish, as well as birds and plant foods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Post colonisation, the Aboriginals experienced excessive disruptions to their socioeconomic circumstances and thus, this has seen a rapid decline in their health status.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trying to keep a balance: the meaning of health and diabetes in an urban Aboriginal community|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953600000460|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2000-11-16|pages = 1457–1472|volume = 51|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00046-0|first = Samantha J|last = Thompson|first2 = Sandra M|last2 = Gifford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to assimilate into a white, European Society, Aboriginals abandoned their traditional way of living and reluctantly adopted those of the colony.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Over time this has seen the introduction of sugar and refined foods into the diet of Aboriginal Australians, initially to sever existing connections to the land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Aboriginals have since viewed sugar as an important cultural food, bringing with it, family identities and reinforcing connections.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Hence, Aboriginals have since become highly vulnerable to suffering from conditions such as diabetes.

== Causes ==

=== European influence ===
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity and the corresponding diseases that are associated with this condition, are often attributed to the European influences at the time of colonisation.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in Aboriginal Australians: prevalence and risk|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168822702000062|journal = Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice|date = 2002-01-01|volume = 57|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/s0168-8227(02)00006-2|first = M.|last = Daniel|first2 = K.G.|last2 = Rowley|first3 = R.|last3 = McDermott|first4 = K.|last4 = O'Dea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar and refined foods were used at this time as a means of detaching Aboriginals from the land and assimilating them into white society. Consequently, Aboriginal Australians have likened certain traditions and memories to the use of sugar. Thus, the ‘westernisation’ of Aboriginal communities forced the neglect of a nutrient-dense diet and thus, cemented the foundation for this prevailing condition.

=== Remoteness ===
Remoteness of Aboriginal communities and disparity in socioeconomic circumstances has also contributed to the prevalence of diabetes in Aboriginal Australians. Consequently, refined foods have seemingly replaced healthy alternatives, as communities are denied access to fresh and healthy foods due to limited available resources.&lt;ref name="King 147–155"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The diabetes health care of Aboriginal people in South Australia (Part 1)|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.5172/conu.10.3-4.147|journal = Contemporary Nurse|date = 2001-06-01|issn = 1037-6178|pages = 147–155|volume = 10|issue = 3-4|doi = 10.5172/conu.10.3-4.147|first = Merilyn|last = King}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many Aboriginals are said to live in poverty, with community’s dependant on welfare and most being plagued by unemployment. Thus, recognising their need to be frugal with their money, and in turn, only being able to afford energy dense, filling foods, which are often high in fats and sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diabetes in Indigenous Australians: possible ways forward|author1=Brown, A. |author2=O'Dea, K. |author3=Rowley, K.G. |date = 2007|journal = The Medical Journal of Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there is a direct correlation between the disparity of wealth, obesity and subsequent morbidity. Consequently, this is a main contributor to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders being 2-4 more times likely to suffer from this condition.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Health inequalities ===
Health inequalities in society and lack of education can also contribute to the higher diagnosis of diabetes among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Characteristics and outcome of type 2 diabetes in urban Aboriginal people: the Fremantle Diabetes Study|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1445-5994.2006.01247.x/abstract|journal = Internal Medicine Journal|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1445-5994|pages = 59–63|volume = 37|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2006.01247.x|first = T. M. E.|last = Davis|first2 = D.|last2 = McAullay|first3 = W. A.|last3 = Davis|first4 = D. G.|last4 = Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unutilised resources ===
Similarly, Aboriginal people are recognised as not utilising the health resources at their disposal.&lt;ref name="King 147–155"/&gt; As a result, Australian Aboriginals are said to be lacking in diabetes education and the subsequent monitoring of glucose levels,&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; making them more susceptible to diabetes related problems as well as lack of educational knowledge and ill-informed in making decisions in regards to their health.

=== Low birth weights ===
Aboriginal infants are also said to have relatively lower birth weights than normal, which can also contribute to early incidences of type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

=== Lifestyle ===
As well as being genetically predisposition are found commonly in young-onset diabetic patients. Diabetes is not a single gene disease, autoimmunity, rare gene variants and a common variant may be present in a single individual. type 2 diabetes is also associated with obesity and other cardiovascular factors and lifestyle influences.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Rosenberg M,&amp;nbsp;Lawrence A.&amp;nbsp;Review of primary prevention of type 2 diabetes in Western
Australia. [cited 2006 March]. Available from URL: http://www.health.wa.gov.au/publications/documents/9755type2diabetesreview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, those with high blood pressure, a poor diet, insufficient physical activity and are overweight/ obese, and in the case of Aboriginal Australians, are over the age of 35, are increasingly more susceptible to suffering from type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Type 2 diabetes|url = https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/type-2-diabetes|website = www.diabetesaustralia.com.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy===
[[Gestational diabetes]] refers to gluten intolerance diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy and is highly common among Aboriginal Australians.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Australia: a systematic review and meta-analysis |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dmrr.2570/abstract |journal=Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews |date=2015-03-01 |issn=1520-7560 |pages=234–247 |volume=31 |issue=3 |doi=10.1002/dmrr.2570 |first=Catherine |last=Chamberlain |first2=Grace |last2=Joshy |first3=Hang |last3=Li |first4=Jeremy |last4=Oats |first5=Sandra |last5=Eades |first6=Emily |last6=Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==
Type 2 diabetes is a detrimental condition commonly affecting Aboriginal Australians. It is closely associated with obesity and is often a precursor for subsequent preventable diseases, including cardiovascular and renal disease. Hence, diabetes is a major cause of the premature mortality of many Aboriginal Australians.&lt;ref name="Daniel"/&gt;

Increased occurrence of renal complications among Aboriginals is attributed to environmental and genetic factors,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Placing aboriginal kidney disease in context.|last = McDonald, S.|date = 2014|journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as poor monitoring of glucose levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prevalence of treated end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (AIHW)|url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/diabetes-indicators/prevalence-of-eskd/|website = www.aihw.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low birth weight causing lower renal volume, post infectious renal damage and obesity are also characteristically associated with [[chronic kidney disease]] and end stage renal failure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Consequently, Australian Aboriginals are 8 times more likely to suffer from incidences of kidney failure than non-Aboriginal Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The perspectives of Aboriginal patients and their health care providers on improving the quality of hemodialysis services: A qualitative study|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hdi.12201/abstract|journal = Hemodialysis International|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1542-4758|pmc = 4309474|pmid = 25056441|pages = 80–89|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/hdi.12201|first = Elizabeth F.|last = Rix|first2 = Lesley|last2 = Barclay|first3 = Janelle|last3 = Stirling|first4 = Allison|last4 = Tong|first5 = Shawn|last5 = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[cardiovascular disease]] is the single greatest contributor to the disparity in life expectancy between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early identification and preventive care for elevated cardiovascular disease risk within a remote Australian Aboriginal primary health care service|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/11/24/abstract|journal = BMC Health Services Research|date = 2011-01-31|issn = 1472-6963|pmc = 3045287|pmid = 21281520|pages = 24|volume = 11|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-11-24|first = Christopher P.|last = Burgess|first2 = Ross S.|last2 = Bailie|first3 = Christine M.|last3 = Connors|first4 = Richard D.|last4 = Chenhall|first5 = Robyn A.|last5 = McDermott|first6 = Kerin|last6 = O'Dea|first7 = Charlie|last7 = Gunabarra|first8 = Hellen L.|last8 = Matthews|first9 = Adrian J.|last9 = Esterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity and increased waist circumference is an important risk factor,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; along with other modifiable influences including smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, low levels of physical activity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; All of which contribute to the incidence of diabetes and consequently, cardiovascular disease.Moreover Gestational Diabetes is also a complication in pregnant women which not not only causes harm to pregnant women but it leads to the birth complication of the fetus as well as it also transfres diabetes to the fetus from mother .

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Aboriginal Australians can also lead to retinotherapy, whereby blood vessels in the eye are damaged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Diabetic Retinopathy|url = http://www.visionaustralia.org/eye-health/eye-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy|website = www.visionaustralia.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a direct result of this condition. Peripheral neuropathy is also common in diabetes patients and in some cases can lead to chronic foot problems and even amputations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Review of diabetes among Indigenous peoples « Reviews « Diabetes « Chronic conditions « Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|url = http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/chronic-conditions/diabetes/reviews/our-review#fnl-30|website = www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10461 A selection of fruit and vegetables.jpg|thumb]]
Health issues affecting Aboriginal Australians, including the incidence of type 2 diabetes, are often likened to disparities in socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Often, the greater the social and economic disadvantage, the greater the occurrence of diabetes and other associated conditions.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Thus, improvements in the socioeconomic status and the decrease in disparity and health inequality are detrimental if the incidence of diabetes and the associated conditions are to be reduced.

Early detection programs and diabetes screenings are essential in reducing the frequency of diabetes and its long-term effects.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Moreover regular weight assessment should be done. Promotion of healthy eating and physical activity, smoking cessation and the safe consumption of alcohol&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;(2011). ''Diabetes in rural Australia''. [Phamphlet]. Deakin West, Australia: National Rural Health Alliance&lt;/ref&gt; are also vital to reduce and prevent type 2 diabetes. The Australian government has addressed the need for such intervention by implementing the National Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes program. Arguably,{{According to whom|date=November 2016}} such programs need to be supported by efforts to provide greater employment and educational opportunities for Aboriginal Australians and health programs tailored to their favoured holistic approach to health and wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Statistics ==
One in 20 Australian adults had diabetes in 2011–2012.&lt;ref name="Diabetes AIHW"/&gt;

Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are 2–4 times more likely to suffer from diabetes than other non-indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

Evidence of diabetes among Aboriginals is apparent as early as 25 years of age. Approximately 18% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders over the age of 25 reported having diabetes or high blood sugar levels. The rates range from 5% for those in the 25 years age bracket and increasing to 39% for those aged 55 years and over.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4727.0.55.001 -  Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey: First Results, Australia, 2012-13|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/CD58150AC0A36286CA257C2F0014591C?opendocument|website = www.abs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012–2013, approximately 8% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders reported that they had diabetes or high blood sugar levels. Females were more likely than men to suffer from diabetes, with 10% claiming to suffer from the condition, in comparison to 7% of males.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[File:Stages of Childbirth.png|thumb|Normal Stages of Labor]]
'''Emergency childbirth''' is the birth of an infant in places or situations other than what was planned. In most cases the location of childbirth is planned ahead of time and may be at home, a hospital, a medical facility or a birthing center. In other situations, the birth occurs on the way to these facilities. Oftentimes, no trained medical personnel are present, other times there may be police or other first responders. Emergency measures for delivery are indicated when childbirth is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/17001.htm|title=Emergency Childbirth: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Image|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Each year more than 250,000 women around the world die from complications due to [[childbirth]] or pregnancy, with [[Postpartum bleeding|bleeding]] and [[Hypertensive states of pregnancy|hypertension]] as the leading causes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many of these deaths are preventable by emergency care, which include antibiotics, [[Uterotonic|drugs that stimulate contraction of the uterus]], [[Magnesium sulfate|anti-seizure drugs]], [[blood transfusion]], and delivery of baby with assistance (vacuum or forceps delivery) or [[Caesarean section|C-section]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmer|first=H|last2=Oyerinde|first2=K|last3=Meara|first3=Jg|last4=Gillies|first4=R|last5=Liljestrand|first5=J|last6=Hagander|first6=L|date=2015-01-01|title=The global met need for emergency obstetric care: a systematic review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.13230/abstract|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|language=en|volume=122|issue=2|pages=183–189|doi=10.1111/1471-0528.13230|issn=1471-0528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 1.36% of births took place outside of a hospital, and this number has been increasing over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDorman|first=Marian F.|last2=Matthews|first2=T. J.|last3=Declercq|first3=Eugene|date=March 2014|title=Trends in out-of-hospital births in the United States, 1990-2012|journal=NCHS data brief|issue=144|pages=1–8|issn=1941-4927|pmid=24594003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely a combination of more home deliveries and deliveries at [[Birthing center|birth centers]], with 66% occurring at home and 29% in birthing centers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In a study of home deliveries in the US and Canada, about 12% of attempted home deliveries required urgent transport to hospital for more specialized care. Reasons for transfer include failure of labor to progress, maternal exhaustion or need for more pain medication, or maternal/fetal complications (see below).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Preparation==
Pregnant women usually seek medical care throughout pregnancy and plan for the birth of a baby with a healthcare team.  In an emergency childbirth situation, it is recommended to seek further education and make a plan.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Early Preparation'''

Many childbirth education classes cover emergency birth procedures. Parents are trained to learn the signs of early labor or other indications that may require assistance. Caregivers can take a class on infant and child life support. Some recommend having a kit of emergency supplies in the home such as: clean towels, sheets, clean scissors, sterile gloves, sanitary pads, diapers, and instructions for infant-rescue breathing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/pregnantfactsheet.asp|title=Information for Pregnant Women-What You Can Do|website=emergency.cdc.gov|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/emergencies-and-first-aid-childbirth|title=Emergencies and First Aid - Childbirth - Harvard Health|first=Harvard Health|last=Publications|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Late Preparation'''

Additional help may be found by calling 911 (in the United States) or an applicable number to get emergency medical services or nearby medical staff.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit?source=search_result&amp;search=emergency%20childbirth&amp;selectedTitle=1~150|title=Precipitous birth not occurring on a labor and delivery unit|website=uptodate.com|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vehicle driven safely toward medical care may be considered an acceptable option during the first stage of labor (dilation and effacement).  During the second stage of labor (pushing and birth), a vehicle is usually stopped unless imminently arriving at a medical facility.  If a vehicle is taken, additional occupants can support the mother and baby should assist in delivery.  The mother and baby are kept warm throughout.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emergency Obstetric Care|last=Blouse|first=Ann|last2=Gomez|first2=Patricia|publisher=United States Agency forvInternational Development|year=2003|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnacy580.pdf|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If unable to reach a medical facility, a safe building with walls and a roof are sought that will provide protection from the environment.  A warm and dry area with a bed is preferable.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Improvised Medicine: Providing Care in Extreme Environments, 2e|last=Iserson|first=Kenneth|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-184762-9|location=|pages=Chapter 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplies are collected for both the mother and the baby. Possible supplies may include blankets, pillows, towels, warm clean water, warm water bottles, soap, clean towels, baby clothes, sheets, sterile gloves, sanitary pads, diapers, identification tags for mother and baby, and instructions for infant-rescue breathing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  A bed may be prepared for the baby with a basket or box lined with a blanket or sheets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Items are needed to clamp or tie the umbilical cord in two places.  Shoestrings or strips of a sheet folded into narrow bands may be used.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  These items can be sterilized by boiling (20 minutes) or soaking in alcohol (up to 3 hours).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Scissors or a knife are needed to cut the umbilical cord and may be sterilized with the same procedure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A background obstetric history should be obtained: how many prior births has the patient had (if this is not her first birth, the patient's labor could be short), how many weeks along is she or what is her estimated date of delivery, any special concerns related to this pregnancy such as being told she has twins, being told she has a complication, or even if she has received regular prenatal care. Any other relevant medical history, allergies, drugs, recent signs of infections (fever) should be asked.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?aid=1121506213|title=Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide|last=Frasure|first=Sarah Elisabeth|date=2016|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|editor-last=Tintinalli|editor-first=Judith E.|edition=8|location=New York, NY|editor-last2=Stapczynski|editor-first2=J.

'''Signs and Symptoms''' 
* ''Any gush of fluid?'' This would indicate that the [[rupture of membranes]] has occurred releasing amniotic fluid and that labor will probably begin soon if the patient is near term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/content.aspx?bookid=1057&amp;sectionid=59789162|title=Williams Obstetrics, Twenty-Fourth Edition|last=Cunningham|first=F. Gary|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Any vaginal bleeding?'' Could indicate a [[bloody show]], a small amount of bloody discharge prior to labor, or if large amounts of bleeding occurred it could indicate potentially life-threatening complications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''How frequent are her contractions?'' One common recommendation is the patient may be in active labor if contractions are 5 minutes apart for one hour (if rupture of membranes has not occurred).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* ''Does she feel the urge to push with her contractions?'' This is an indication delivery will occur soon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
'''Physical Exam'''

If time permits and if trained: one should obtain vital signs to include maternal heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The patient should be draped with available blankets for privacy.

The patient's abdomen should be examined and felt for the presence of contractions,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the intensity, frequency, and length of contractions should be noted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the patient's permission and privacy, an exam of the pelvic area should be performed; in general, one would:
* Inspect to see if there is any presenting part of the baby. The baby's head will feel hard versus their buttocks will feel soft.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* If the baby's head is presenting out of the vagina (crowning), then delivery will be happening soon and preparation should begin to deliver the baby&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Trained physicians would conduct a manual cervical exam to determine the patient's [[cervical dilation]].
After the physical exam and if the patient is not crowning, the patient should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position (laying on her left side).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==  Delivery of term baby in normal position ==
'''First stage of labor:''' '''dilation and effacement of the cervix (before the baby comes out)'''

This stage of labor may last from 2 to 18 hours.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CURRENT Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, 11e|last=Carol|first=Archie|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|year=2013|isbn=978-0-07-163856-2|location=|pages=chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further care may be sought during this time. 
# Evaluation (above) is repeated, assessing for change in stage of labor.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Williams Obstetrics, Twenty-Fourth Edition|last=Cunningham|first=F|last2=et al.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2014|isbn=978-0-07-179893-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# The mother is encouraged to walk or sit in a comfortable position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
'''Second stage: cervix is dilated (the baby is coming out)'''

This stage may last from 5 minutes to 3 hours.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;   
# Position. The mother is positioned in the [[lithotomy position]], lying on her back, with her feet above or at the same level as the hips.  The [[perineum]] (the space between the vagina and anus) is positioned at the edge of a bed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
# Wash. The perineum is cleaned with antiseptic solution or soap and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Any assistants will wash hands with soap and water and put on sterile or clean gloves. 
# Pushing. Pushing is encouraged during contractions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# Head. The head of the baby is delivered.  Delivery of the head is controlled to prevent rapid expulsion.  One hand is placed on the perineum while the other applies gentle pressure to the baby’s head as it comes out.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Soft pressure can be applied to the baby’s chin through the perineum to help expel the head.  Rapid expulsion is still prevented with soft head pressure to reduce vaginal lacerations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;    
# Cord check. A check is made to look for the presence of an umbilical cord ([[nuchal cord]]) around the baby’s neck.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If it is present, an index finger is used to attempt to pull it over the baby’s head.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If this cannot be done, the cord is clamped/tied in two places.  Then the cord is carefully cut, avoiding injury to the baby or mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  
# Front shoulder. The front shoulder is delivered.  This is the shoulder on the mother's front side, towards her belly.  The assistant holds the baby's head with two hands and may need to apply slight downward pressure (towards her anus) to help the front shoulder out.  Firm pressure can injure the baby.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  If the shoulder gets stuck this is called shoulder dystocia.  See procedure for relief of [[shoulder dystocia]] (below).  
# Back shoulder. The back shoulder is then delivered by providing slight upward pressure (away from her anus).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   
# Catch baby.  The baby usually comes out right away after both shoulders.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The baby is caught noting that babies are slippery.  The assistant holds the baby at the level of the vagina.   
# Cut cord. The [[umbilical cord]] is clamped and cut.  The cord is clamped in two places about 6&amp;nbsp;cm to 8&amp;nbsp;cm from the baby.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The clamps or ties are tight in order to stop the blood flow.  The cord is cut between the two clamps or ties.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Sterilized scissors or a sterilized knife is used.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Another assistant may help with this.   
# Dry baby. The baby is dried, wrapped, and kept warm.  Appropriate neonatal care is provided or the baby is placed to the mother's breast on her bare skin.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Operations Forces Medical Handbook|last=Yevich|first=Steve|publisher=US Government|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=3–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An identification band may be placed on the baby.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
'''Third stage of labor: the delivery of the placenta'''

The baby is attached to the [[placenta]] by the umbilical cord.  After the cord is cut, the placenta is usually still inside the mother.  The placenta usually comes out in 2–10 minutes, but it may take up to 60 minutes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# Before the placenta is delivered there is a gush of blood as the cord gets longer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# The umbilical cord can be held taut, but must not be pulled with much force.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# The placenta is delivered and is be inspected for completeness. The placenta should be stored in a bag for inspection by trained medical personnel.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  
# The mother will need to have a trained physician inspect for vaginal lacerations that will need suture repair.

== Maternal complications ==
Complications of emergency childbirth include the complications that occur during normal childbirth. Maternal complications include perineal tearing during delivery, excessive bleeding ([[postpartum hemorrhage]]), retained products of conception in the uterus, hypertension, and seizures.

=== Vaginal Bleeding and Shock ===
In a pregnant woman, 40% of the circulating blood volume is in the uterus. This creates a large bleeding potential and high risk of [[Shock (circulatory)|hemorrhagic shock]] (low blood pressure from loss of circulating blood). For this reason, constant vigilance is important if any of the following occur:

-      Vaginal bleeding early or late in pregnancy

-      Severe abdominal pain

-      Trauma (such as a fall or car accident) while pregnant

-      Uncontrolled vaginal bleeding after the baby is delivered

-      Inability to remove the entire placenta after the baby is delivered

==== First trimester bleeding ====
Causes of vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy include [[miscarriage]] (inevitable or incomplete abortion), embryo implantation and growth outside the uterus ([[ectopic pregnancy]]), and placenta attachment at the bottom of the uterus over the cervix ([[Placenta praevia|placenta previa]]), all of which can cause significant bleeding.

'''Bleeding after the first trimester and during delivery'''

Prior to and during delivery, bleeding can also occur from tears in the cervix, vagina, or perineum, sudden placental detachment ([[Placental abruption|abruptio placenta]]) and placental attachment over the cervix ([[placenta previa]]), and [[uterine rupture]].

'''Bleeding after delivery (postpartum hemorrhage)'''

After delivery of the baby, a uterus that is not contracting (atonic uterus), ruptured uterus, remaining parts of placenta or baby or infected remaining parts of placenta or baby can cause severe bleeding. Postpartum bleeding is usually managed preventatively by massaging the lower abdomen ([[fundal massage]]), which increases contraction of the uterus and stops bleeding. Additionally, steady traction is applied to the cord to prevent trauma, cord avulsion (tearing of the umbilical cord), uterine inversion, and retained placental products, all of which can increase blood loss and/or the risk of infection.

Postpartum hemorrhage is defined by loss of more than 500 mL blood within 24 hours after delivery. It is difficult to predict with few known risk factors and occurs in 3% of women, leading to ~150,000 annual deaths worldwide.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Once uncontrolled bleeding occurs, management can be manual (fundal massage from the outside, packing the uterus, tamponading bleeding from the inside with balloon or condom catheter), and pharmacological (with [[Oxytocin (medication)|oxytocin]], [[ergotamine]], [[misoprostol]]). Alongside these treatments, shock should be addressed with IV fluids or blood transfusions as discussed below.

'''Severe blood loss leading to shock'''

In shock, you may see cold clammy skin, pale skin (especially around eyes, mouth, and hands), sweating, anxiousness, and loss of consciousness. You may note a fast heartbeat (110 beats per minute or more), low blood pressure (90mmHg systolic or less), and decreased urine output.

The woman should be laid on her left side, with legs and buttocks elevated to encourage blood flow back to the heart with gravity. If available, IV fluids (Ringer’s lactate or normal saline) should be started with monitoring of her heart rate, blood pressure, and appearance. If available, two large bore IV catheters (16-gauge or largest available) should be used to rapidly infuse 1L in 15–20 minutes, with a goal of giving 2L in the first hour. If unable to start an IV and the woman is able to drink and is conscious with no recent convulsions, give 300-500 mL of fluid by mouth. If the woman is unable to drink, is unconscious, or has recently had convulsions, fluid can be given rectally with an enema bag or can. Fill the enema with 500mL IV fluid, clamp the end of the tube and insert 10&amp;nbsp;cm (3-4inches) into the rectum. If filling an enema, run water slowly or cramping can occur, pushing the water back out.

=== Convulsions (Seizures) ===
Convulsions (Seizures) in pregnancy can be caused by pregnancy specific causes of seizures such as [[eclampsia]] and by normal causes of seizures such as [[epilepsy]]. Warning signs that may lead to convulsions include [[Pre-eclampsia|pre-eclamsia]], which is a condition that pregnant women can get after 20 weeks of pregnancy that is characterized by new-onset high blood pressure, headaches, blurry vision, [[Pulmonary edema|trouble breathing from fluid in lungs]], [[Proteinuria|protein in urine from kidney failure]], and elevated liver enzymes from liver dysfunction, and possibly coagulation defects from platelet dysfunction.

If a pregnant woman begins to have convulsions, additional help and assistance should be sought. One should not restrain the patient, but lie her down on her left side and check the airway (mouth, nose, throat). Turning the patient on her side decreases risk of [[Pulmonary aspiration|breathing in vomit and spit]]. If available, magnesium sulfate is the preferred treatment for seizures in pregnant women, starting with a dose of 4&amp;nbsp;mg IV over 5 minutes.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A sensation of warmth during infusion is normal, however, there is also a risk of stopping breathing with magnesium sulfate use, which would indicate the dosage is too high. If this occurs, calcium gluconate can be used to reverse the effects (1g IV over 10 minutes, often in solution).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In general, make sure the breathing rate is at least 16 breaths per minute and the knee jerk reflex is still intact before giving more magnesium sulfate. If magnesium sulfate is unavailable, diazepam can be used to treat convulsions in pregnancy. The first dose, the loading dose, should be 10&amp;nbsp;mg of diazepam IV given over 2 minutes.&lt;ref name=QuickRef&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnacy580.pdf|title=Emergency Obstetric Care: Quick Reference Guide for Frontline Providers|last=United States Agency for International Development|first=Editors: Ann Blouse and Patricia Gomez|date=Sep 2003|website=USAID|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the loading dose can be repeated. The maintenance dose is 40&amp;nbsp;mg of diazepam in 500mL IV fluids. The amount of diazepam used should never be more than 100&amp;nbsp;mg in 24 hours and it should be dosed in order to keep the woman awake, rousable, and breathing rate above 16 breaths per minute&lt;ref name=QuickRef/&gt;

== Fetal care ==
Almost 10% of newborns require some resuscitative care. Common complications of childbirth that relate to the baby include [[Breech birth|breech presentation]], [[shoulder dystocia]], [[Chorioamnionitis|infection]], and umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck ([[nuchal cord]]).

'''Evaluation'''

The newborn is evaluated at 1 and 5 minutes after birth using the [[Apgar score|Apgar]] score, which assigns points based on appearance (color), pulse, grimace (cry), activity (muscle tone), and respiration (breathing effort), with each component scored from 0 to 2. Scores below 7 generally require further care (see resuscitation below).

'''Routine care'''

After initial evaluation, babies with good Apgar scores are dried and rubbed, any obstruction of breathing is cleared, and they are warmed either with skin-to-skin contact with the mother or under a heat source.

=== Complications ===
With United States home births as an estimate, neonatal complications are common, with cord wrapped around the head 12-37% of the time ([[nuchal cord]]), insufficient oxygenation ([[Perinatal asphyxia|birth asphyxia]]) 9% of the time, pulselessness 6% of the time, and breech presentation 3% of the time&lt;ref&gt;"Obstetrics/Gynecology." ''''Improvised Medicine: Providing Care in Extreme Environments, 2e'''' Ed. Kenneth V. Iserson. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, , &lt;nowiki&gt;http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/content.aspx?bookid=1728&amp;sectionid=115697898&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breech Presentation'''
[[File:Frank breech.jpg|thumb|
Frank Breech Presentation (buttocks first) is the most common type of breech presentation
]]

Normally, the head is the first part of the body to present out of the birth canal. However, other parts such as the buttocks or feet can present first, which is referred to as [[Breech birth|breech presentation]]. Risk for breech presentation may increase with multiple pregnancies (more than one baby), when there is too little or too much fluid in the uterus, or if the uterus is abnormally shaped.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Babies in breech presentation can be delivered vaginally depending on the experience of the provider and if the fetus meets specific low risk criteria, however C-section is recommended if available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Mode-of-Term-Singleton-Breech-Delivery|title=Mode of Term Singleton Breech Delivery - ACOG|website=acog.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, vaginal breech delivery should not be performed without the availability of nearby emergency C-section capabilities and extensive efforts should be made to bring a woman in labor with breech presentation to a hospital. There are many variations of breech presentations and multiple ways the baby can get stuck during delivery. If a breech delivery is occurring, the provider will guide the hips out by giving light, downward traction holding the pelvis until the scapula is present. Then at the level of the armpits, each shoulder is delivered by rotating the baby as required, then subsequently rotating 180 degrees to deliver the other shoulder. The head is delivered with careful attention to the baby's arms. The arms will be delivered downwards through the vulva and may have to be gently held downwards by the provider's fingers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Pre-term labor'''

Incidence of preterm delivery is approximately 12%, and preterm births are a significant contributing cause of unplanned emergency delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pre-term labor is defined as occurring before 37 weeks, and risks for pre-term labor include pregnancy with multiple fetuses, prior history of premature labor, structural abnormalities of the cervix or uterus, urinary tract, vaginal, or sexually transmitted infections, high blood pressure, drug use, diabetes, blood disorders, or pregnancy occurring less than 6 months after a prior pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The same principles of term emergency delivery apply to emergency delivery for a [[Preterm birth|preterm fetus]], though the baby will be at higher risk of other problems such as [[low birth weight]], trouble breathing, and infections. The newborn will need additional medical care and monitoring after delivery and should be taken to a hospital providing neonatal care, which may include antibiotics and breathing treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-and-complications-of-labor-and-delivery/preterm-labor|title=Preterm Labor - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shoulder dystocia'''

In [[shoulder dystocia]], the shoulder is trapped after the head is delivered, preventing delivery of the rest of the baby. The major risk factor (other than prior history of shoulder dystocia) is the baby being too large ([[Large for gestational age|macrosomia]]), which can result from the mother being obese or gaining too much weight, diabetes, and the pregnancy lasting too long ([[Postterm pregnancy|post-term pregnancy]]).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Shoulder dystocia can lead to further fetal complications such as nerve compression and injury at the shoulder ([[Brachial plexus injury|brachial plexus]]), fracture of the collarbone, and low oxygen for the fetus (whether due to compression of the umbilical cord or due to inability of the baby to breathe). Shoulder dystocia is often signaled by retreat of the head between contractions when it has already been delivered ("turtle sign"). Treatment includes the [[McRoberts maneuver]], where the mother flexes her thighs up to her stomach with her knees wide apart as pressure is applied on her lower abdomen, and [[Woods' screw maneuver]], where the deliverer inserts a hand into the vagina to rotate the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-and-complications-of-labor-and-delivery/fetal-dystocia|title=Fetal Dystocia - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If all maneuvers fail, then C-section would be indicated.

'''Prolapsed Cord'''
[[File:Cord.prolaps.jpg|thumb|Umbilical Cord Prolapse]]

A prolapsed cord refers to an umbilical cord that is delivered from the uterus while the baby is still in the uterus and is life-threatening to the baby. Cord prolapse creates a risk of decreased blood flow (and oxygen flow) to the baby as delivery will cause cord compression. However, if the cord delivers before the baby, the cord should not be placed back into the uterus through the cervix since this increases risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Kahana  B, Sheiner  E, Levy  A  et al.: Umbilical cord prolapse and perinatal outcomes. ''Int J Gynaecol Obstet'' 84: 127, 2004. [PubMed: 14871514]&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent obstetric care for C-section would be indicated, and in the meantime, one should elevate the foot of the bed if possible to attempt to keep the baby above the level of the cord.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If no specialized care is available, one may attempt to reduce pressure of the cord manually and continue delivery, but also being prepared to clamp and cut the cord if needed.

'''Nuchal Cord'''

After the baby crowns, the umbilical cord may be found to be wrapped around the neck or body of the baby, which is known as nuchal cord. This is common, occurring in up to 37% of term pregnancies, and most do not cause any long-term problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peesay|first=Morarji|date=2012-08-28|title=Cord around the neck syndrome|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=12|issue=Suppl 1|pages=A6|doi=10.1186/1471-2393-12-S1-A6|issn=1471-2393|pmc=3428673}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wrapped cord should be slipped over the head so it is not pulled during delivery. If the wrap is not removed, it can choke the baby or can cause the placenta to detach suddenly which can cause severe maternal bleeding and loss of blood and oxygen to the baby. The cord may also be wrapped around a limb in breech presentation, and should similarly be reduced in these cases.

'''Resuscitation'''

If the baby is not doing well on its own, further care may be necessary. Resuscitation typically starts with warming, drying, and stimulating the newborn. If breathing difficulty is noted, the airway is opened and cleared with suction and oxygen is monitored; if necessary, one may consider using a positive airway pressure ventilator (which gives oxygen while keeping the airway open) or intubation. If the heart rate is below 60 beats per minute, CPR is started at 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio, with compressions given at the lower breastbone. If this fails to revive the newborn, epinephrine will be given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Resuscitation is not indicated for newborns below 22 weeks of gestation and weighing below 400 grams. Resuscitation may also be discontinued if the baby's heart does not start after 10–15 minutes of full resuscitation (including breathing treatments, medications, and CPR).

==In culture==
The reports of emergency childbirth are typically of general interest. A mobile app was developed in Ethiopia that guides users through the procedures of assisting with an emergency birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/548047/a-mobile-app-could-make-childbirth-safer-in-ethiopia-one-of-the-deadliest-countries-to-have-a-baby/|title=A mobile app could make childbirth safer in Ethiopia, one of the deadliest countries to have a baby|first=Lily|last=Kuo|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gấc''' (''[[Momordica cochinchinensis]]'') is a type of perennial vine grown throughout [[Southeast Asia]]n countries and [[Northeastern Australia]]. Gấc is notable for its orange-reddish color resulting from its rich content of [[beta-carotene]] and [[lycopene]].

== Etymology ==
As gac was originally discovered in Vietnam, it is commonly called by its [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] name (gấc, {{IPA-vi|ɣək˦˥|pron}}). The fruit may also be called "quả gấc" as "quả" means "fruit" in English, and has various common names.&lt;ref name="grin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxonomydetail.aspx?id=24521|title=Taxon: ''Momordica cochinchinensis'' (Lour.) Spreng. U.S. National Plant Germplasm System.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By its [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]], ''cochinchinensis'' originates from the name for southern Vietnam during the period of [[French colonial empire|French colonization]], [[Cochinchina]]. [[Momordica]] is a genus belonging to the [[Cucurbitaceae]] family, including [[Momordica charantia|bitter cucumber]].&lt;ref name=grin/&gt;

== History ==
Around 200 years ago, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] priest, J. Lourciso, visited Vietnam and discovered the plant.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} He gave it the name ''Muricia cochinchinensis'' in the book ''Flora Cochinchinesis'' published in 1790.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Later, Sprengel found that the plant belonged to the Linnean genus ''Momordica'' and changed its name in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuong|first=Le|date=2000|title=Underutilized β-Carotene–Rich Crops of Vietnam|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233584507_Underutilized_b-Carotene-Rich_Crops_of_Vietnam|journal=Food &amp; Nutrition Bulletin|volume=21|pages=173–181|doi=10.1177/156482650002100211|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Gac grows as [[Dioecy|dioecious]] vines, meaning its male and female flowers are on separate plants, producing flowers typically {{convert|5-10|cm|in}} in length. Its vines can extend to {{convert|20|m|ft}} long, and its flowers blooms once a year, single or in bundle, around 2–3 months after the vines are planted. In one season, a plant can produce from 30 to 60 fruits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osman|first=Mohamad|last2=Sulaiman|first2=Zulkefly|last3=Saleh|first3=Ghizan|last4=Shahril Ab Rahman|first4=Mohd.|last5=Mohd. Zainuddin|first5=Zulkifli|last6=Abu Sin|first6=Maizura|last7=Arina ab halim|first7=Anna|last8=Hamidon|first8=Azimah|vauthors=|date=|year=2017|title=Gac fruit, a plant genetic resource with high potential.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323846407_Gac_fruit_a_plant_genetic_resource_with_high_potential|journal=Transactions of Persatuan Genetik Malaysia|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately five months after flowering, the ripe bright-red fruits can be harvested, usually over September to December annually.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Fruit ===
[[File:Gac Fruit.jpg|thumb|Gac fruit, [[Philippines]]]]
[[File:Momordica sp Blanco2.380.png|thumb|150px|Gac fruit]]

Typically, gac fruits are round or oblong, about {{convert|13|cm|in}} in length and {{convert|10|cm|in}} in diameter, covered with small spines on the [[exocarp]]. Upon ripening, gac gradually changes colors, from green to yellow, orange and finally red when it can be harvested. At this time, the fruit is hard, but turns soft quickly, creating a challenge for storage and transportation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gac fruit has a mild taste and dense flesh ([[mesocarp]]). The inside of a gac fruit comprises two parts: fruit (yellow) and seed membrane (red color). Larger fruits have a higher percentage of edible [[aril]] than smaller fruits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parks|first=Sophie|last2=Murray|first2=Carly|last3=Gale|first3=David|last4=AL-Khawaldeh|first4=B|last5=Spohr|first5=Lorraine|date=|year=2013|title=Propagation and production of Gac (Momordica Cochinchinensis Spreng.), A greenhouse case study.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259431185_Propagation_and_production_of_Gac_Momordica_Cochinchinensis_Spreng_A_greenhouse_case_study|journal=Experimental Agriculture|volume=49|issue=2|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0014479712001081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeding and cultivation==
As gac plant is [[Dioecy|dioecious]], both male and female plants are needed; hence, farmers must have at least one corresponding male plant growing in or around the gardens for the fruit-bearing female plants to be pollinated. In order to breed, gac can change sex, and may change from one season to the next.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} When grown from seed, the ratio of male to female plants is unpredictable.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Pollination]] may be facilitated by insects, but hand pollination results in a higher fruit yield. New plants can also be generated from root tubers as a more reliable method to yield fruits, because [[germination]] by seeds can be difficult due to several environmental factors such as [[dormancy]] or plant age.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} An alternative method is to [[grafting|graft]] female material onto the main shoot of a male plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gacfruit.weebly.com/propagation-and-cultivation-of-gac-plant.html|title=Propagation and cultivation of Gac plant|website=Gac Research&lt;br /&gt;University of Newcastle, Australia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For maximum insect-aided pollination, the recommended ratio is about 1 male for every 10 female plants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If propagating from vines, farmers make diagonal cut (around {{convert|15-20|cm|in}} long and {{convert|3-6|mm|in}} wide), then root the tubers in water or well-aerated, moist potting media before planting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Apart from Southeast Asian countries where the fruits are native, gac can be grown in [[Subtropics|sub-tropical]] climate regions.&lt;ref name=grin/&gt; Cool temperatures inhibit growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Xôi gấc.JPG|thumb|Glutinous rice made with extract of ripe fruits of ''Momordica cochinchinensis'', Vietnamese style]]

Gac has been commonly used in its native countries, mainly as food and [[traditional medicine]]. Its use as medicine dated back to over 1200 years ago in China and Vietnam&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.jcu.edu.au/bmdt/news-and-updates/researchers-use-nature-to-fight-cancer|title=Researchers use nature to fight cancer|website=Research@JCU|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gac seeds, known as ''[[wikt:mù|mù]] [[wikt:biē|biē]] [[wikt:zǐ|zǐ]]'' (meaning 'wooden turtle seed'), are used for a variety of internal and [[topical medication|topical]] purposes in traditional medicine.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuyen|first=Hoang|last2=Nguyen|first2=Minh|last3=Roach|first3=Paul|last4=Golding|first4=John|last5=Parks|first5=Sophie|date=Spring 2015|title=Gac fruit (''Momordica cochinchinensis'' Soreng,): a rich source of bioactive compounds and its potential health benefits|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijfs.12721/abstract|journal=Food Science and Technology|volume=50|pages=567–577|doi=10.1111/ijfs.12721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aril]] surrounding gac seeds when the fruits are ripe is cooked with sticky rice to make “[[Xôi]] Gấc”, a traditional Vietnamese dish in red color served at weddings and New Year celebrations. In addition, the immature green fruit is also used as a vegetable in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tran|first=Xuan T.|last2=Parks|first2=Sophie E.|last3=Roach|first3=Paul D.|last4=Golding|first4=John B.|last5=Nguyen|first5=Minh H.|date=2015-10-06|title=Effects of maturity on physicochemical properties of Gac fruit (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng.)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779482/|journal=Food Science &amp; Nutrition|volume=4|issue=2|pages=305–314|doi=10.1002/fsn3.291|issn=2048-7177|pmc=4779482|pmid=27004120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spiny skin is removed and the fruits are sliced and cooked sometimes with potato or bottle gourd.

Due to the high contents of [[Beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] and [[lycopene]], [[extract]]s from gac aril are used to manufacture [[dietary supplement]]s in soft [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] or included in a juice blend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lawrence Goodman|title=The Next Big Fruit Juice?|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/3960/32/|publisher=Brown Alumni Magazine|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese children fed a rice dish containing gấc had higher blood levels of beta-carotene than those not fed gac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vuong LT, Dueker SR, Murphy SP | title = Plasma β-Carotene and Retinol Concentrations of Children Increase After a 30-d Supplementation with the Fruit ''Momordica cochinchinensis'' (Gac) | journal = Am.

The Halali River is a tributary of the [[Betwa River]]. It was formerly known as Thal River. In the 18th century, [[Dost Mohammad Khan, Nawab of Bhopal|Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s forces killed a rival [[Rajput]] force near Jagdishpur (later renamed to [[Islamnagar, Bhopal|Islamnagar]]) on the bank of the river. The river was renamed to "[[Halal]]i river" (the river of slaughter), because it appeared red with the blood of the victims.&lt;ref name="Shaharyar_Begums_2000"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Begums of Bhopal | author = Shaharyar M.

'''Hatzalah''' ("rescue" or "relief" in {{lang-he-n|הצלה}}) is a volunteer [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical service]] (EMS) organization serving mostly [[Jew]]ish communities around the world. Most local branches operate independently of each other, but use the common name. The Hebrew spelling of the name is always the same, but there are many variations in transliteration, such as Hatzolah, Hatzoloh and Hatzola.&lt;ref name="Affiliates"&gt;{{cite web |title=Affiliates|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/affiliates.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often called Chevra Hatzalah, which loosely translates as "Company of Rescuers" or "Group of Rescuers."

==History==

The original Hatzalah EMS was founded in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], USA by Rabbi Hershel Weber in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name="Willie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzolahw.org/ourmission.html |title=Williamsburg Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve rapid emergency medical response in the community, and to mitigate cultural concerns of a [[Yiddish]]-speaking, religious [[Hasidic]] community.

Hatzalah branches are currently being organized in other states as well.

In Israel, there are two Hatzalah organizations operating on the national level, [[United Hatzalah|Ichud Hatzalah]] ({{lang-he|איחוד הצלה}}), Hebrew for, "[[United Hatzalah]]", and Tzevet Hatzalah (Hebrew: צוות הצלה). While [[United Hatzalah]] is unarguably the larger of the two organizations, their volunteers are limited to direct response on scene care, versus Tzevet Hatzalah volunteers which are additionally licensed and authorized to provide emergency transport utilizing [[Magen David Adom]] ambulances.

==Operations==
Hatzalah uses a [[fly-car]] system, where members are assigned [[Ad hoc|ad-hoc]] to respond to the emergency. The dispatcher requests any units for a particular emergency location. Members who think they will have best response times respond via [[Walkie-talkie|handheld radios]], and the dispatcher confirms the appropriate members. Two members will typically respond directly to the call in their private vehicles. A third member retrieves an [[ambulance]] from a base location.&lt;ref name="NYC Ops"/&gt;

Each directly dispatched Hatzolah volunteer has a full medical technician "jump kit," in their car, with oxygen, trauma, and appropriate pharmaceutical supplies. Paramedic (EMT-P) members carry more extensive equipment and supplies, including [[EKG]], [[Intravenous therapy|IV]], injection, intubation, and more pharmaceuticals.  Each volunteer is called a ''unit'' (as in, a crew of one), and is assigned a unit number that starts with a neighborhood code, followed by a [[serial number]] for that neighborhood (e.g., "Q-381" means "Queens unit number 381"&lt;ref name="Madrich"&gt;{{cite book |title=Madrich L'Chevra Hatzalah |last=Handler |first=Mechel |author2=Rabbi Dovid Weinberger |publisher=Feldheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Ambulances also have unit numbers in the same format, with the first few numbers for each neighborhood reserved for the ambulance numbers.&lt;ref name="NYC Ops"/&gt; Some neighborhoods have begun to assign 3-digit unit numbers to their ambulances, using numbers out of the range assigned to human member units (e.g. 900-numbers).

In some areas there may be periods where coverage is not strong enough, for example on a summer weekend. When this happens, coordinators may assign an on-call rotation. The rotation may still respond from their houses, or they may stay at the garage through their shift. In such periods, Hatzalah functions closer to a typical EMS crew setup, though the dispatchers may still seek non-on-call members to respond, and there will still often be a non-ambulance responder as first dispatched, even if that responder starts from the base.&lt;ref name="Madrich"/&gt;

In [[Israel]], [[United Hatzalah]] relies upon mobile phone technologies which include an SOS [[Mobile app|app]] and a special emergency phone number, 1221, with messages to news organizations distributed by [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wootliff|first1=Raoul|title=After blogs and Facebook, military censor sets sights on WhatsApp|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/after-blogs-and-facebook-military-censor-sets-sights-on-whatsapp/|accessdate=17 February 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response times===
Hatzalah's model provides for speedy [[Certified first responder|first responder]] response times. Each Hatzalah neighborhood's response time varies.  For example, in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] daytime response  in life threatening emergency are between 1-2 minutes and nighttime response times are 5-6 minutes.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt;  In the Beverly-La Brea neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]] response times average at sixty to ninety seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=7785 | title= Jewish Journal | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
Hatzalah is not a single organization. Each chapter operates autonomously, or in some cases, with varying levels of affiliation with neighboring Hatzalah chapters.&lt;ref name=Affiliates/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYC Branches"/&gt;

In New York City's Hatzalah, there is a very simple operational hierarchy. Usually, there are two or three members who are "coordinators,"&lt;ref name="NYC Struct"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/central.php|title=Regional Locations - Central Coordination}}&lt;/ref&gt; managing all operations aspects of the chapter.

As Orthodox Jews, many volunteers see each other daily during [[Jewish services|prayers]], and especially on [[Shabbat]]. This allows them to remain organized despite the lack of an extensive formal hierarchy.

The coordinators are responsible for recruitment, interaction with municipal agency operations (police, fire, and EMS), first-line discipline, and day-to-day operations. The coordinators often are responsible, directly or via delegation, for arranging maintenance crews, who are often called service members or service units, and for purchasing supplies, ambulances, and other equipment. There is also an administrative function, often separate from the coordinator function. The chief administrator is often called a director or [[executive director]], and this is sometimes a paid position. All other positions in Hatzalah, including coordinators, are held by unpaid volunteers.

Most of the New York State branches have some centralized administration and dispatch functions, known as "Central Hatzalah," or simply, "Central." The neighborhood organizations under Central are nevertheless independent. Most Hatzalah organizations pattern themselves after the Williamsburg and Central models (see operational descriptions below).

Formally, the New York City-area "Central Hatzalah" is called Chevra Hatzalah of New York. It combines dispatch and some other functions for over a dozen neighborhood organizations, including&lt;ref name="NYC Branches"&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Branches|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/localBranches.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]],&lt;ref name=Willie/&gt; [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Canarsie]], [[Lower East Side]], [[Upper West Side]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[Queens]], Rockaways &amp; Nassau County, [[Seagate, Brooklyn|Seagate]], [[Catskills]], [[Staten Island]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], and others. As each of these areas is otherwise independent, each has its own fundraising, management, garages, ambulances, and assigned members. [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County, NY]] branches have a centralized dispatch system as well, but their [[central organization]] is separate from the other New York State centralized functions, and they have a looser relationship with their New York State brethren, though there is a great deal of cooperation among them.  Together, the combined New York State branches have grown to become the largest all-volunteer ambulance system in the United States.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2005a%2Fpr138-05.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 | title=Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg Announces Two Initiatives To Redevelop Underutilized Land In The Culver El Section Of Borough Park, Brooklyn | first=M. | last=Bloomberg | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Israel]] the largest local organization is [[Magen David Adom]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Outside of New York and Israel, there are many smaller Hatzalah organizations. Each of these operates as a self-contained unit, with no centralized organization or coordination. However, where there are other Hatzalahs nearby, there is often a great deal of cooperation.

==Legal status==
In the [[United Kingdom]], Hatzalah use [[Emergency vehicle equipment in the United Kingdom|blue lights]] and sirens on their ambulances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/436272/photo-essay-london-ribbon-cutting-ceremony-for-unveiling-of-a-4th-ambulance-for-hatzolah-photos-by-jdn.html|title=Photo Essay: London – Ribbon Cutting Ceremony For Unveiling Of A 4th Ambulance For Hatzolah (Photos by JDN)|date=30 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cannot legally do so on private vehicles.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2579800/High-Court-upholds-blues-twos-charge-volunteer-paramedics-Jewish-emergency-medical-service.html | title=High Court upholds 'blues-and-twos' charge for volunteer paramedics from Jewish emergency medical service| year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
Hatzalah organizations are often involved in other community activities, on top of their primary mission of emergency medical work. Many neighborhood chapters sponsor and participate in community events, both within the local Jewish community, and in the broader community.

Flatbush Hatzalah frequently plays softball against teams from local police precincts, firehouses, and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haztalah Softball |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=21146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatzalah of Passaic/Clifton works with the local Bikur Cholim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passaic/Clifton Health and Safety Fair |url=http://passaichealthandsafetyfair.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to put on a yearly Health &amp; Safety Fair at no charge to the community, with participation from both Jewish and non-Jewish presenters, said to get a turnout possibly exceeding 25% of the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Safety Fair Press Release |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/35385/PHOTOS:+Passaic-Clifton+Health+and+Safety+Fair.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Hatzalahs worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hatzolah Australia Fire Safety|url=http://www.hatzolah.org.au/include/chanukah.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canadian Hatzoloh Chanukah Safety |url=http://www.hatzoloh.ca/Docs/Chanukah_Safety.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NYC Haztalah Purim Drinking Campaign |url=http://www.hakhel.info/archivesPublicService/HatzalahPurimSafety.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; run public relations campaigns related to safe drinking on Purim and fire safety on Chanukah and during Passover preparations. Chevra [[Hatzolah]] in New York works closely with the [[FDNY]] on this matter.

==Specialization of Hatzolah EMS==
A number of items that are either unique to Hatzalah, or that are relatively unusual for an EMS include: Thumper


===Direct response===
Most EMS rely on crews with scheduled shifts operating from a known location.  Due to its members and the communities they serve usually living in proximity, Hatzolah relies little on scheduled crews and stations and rather has all service members on call 24/7 and members responding from wherever they are.&lt;ref&gt;A brief description of their Two-Tier system can be found at [https://www.hatzalah.org/twotiered.php Chevra Hatzalah Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural sensitivities and discrimination ===
Language, religion, and culture barriers create challenges for an emergency medical service.  Hatzalah is built to consider these challenges, especially with regard to [[halacha]] (Jewish law) and communities that only speak [[Yiddish]] or [[Hebrew]].

A Jew reluctant to violate Sabbath rules when receiving medical attention may be more at ease and easily convinced of the medical urgency, when the EMT or paramedic is a fellow [[Orthodox Jew]].  A female worried about physical modesty and contact is helped by knowing that a Jewish provider is aware of the details of her concerns, and will act to reduce the problem as much as possible.

Hatzalah was the subject of controversy as articles in the ''[[New York Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/jewish_siren_ladies_Ax71jq2CgYYdWPcFmCzwWN |work=New York Post |first=Reuven |last=Fenton |title=Jewish ‘siren' ladies |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''JEMS Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jems.com/article/news/jewish-female-emts-plan-join-all-male-am |title=Jewish Female EMTs Plan to Join All-Male Ambulance Corps - News - @ |publisher=Jems.com |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticize the organization for its discriminatory practice of not allowing women to join. The group of Orthodox women founded an organization called “Ezras Nashim” an all-female Orthodox Jewish volunteer [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] ambulance service,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/jewish-women-brooklyn-launch-ambulance-service-expecting-moms-article-1.1029605|title=Jewish Women in Brooklyn Launch EMT Service|first=Simone|last=Weichselbaum|date=February 27, 2012|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; they cited the need for modesty and sensitivity to the needs of fellow Orthodox women, with the goal of preserving women’s modesty in emergency medical situations, especially [[childbirth]]. "This is a woman's job. Historically, women have always delivered babies in traditional Jewish values, pointing to the [[Hebrew Bible]] Book of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] where the first midwives were women [[Shiphrah]] and [[Puah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/manhattan/2012/05/28/woman-works-to-form-all-female-hasidic-jewish-emt-service-NYC_162015.old.html|title=Woman Works To Form All-Female Hasidic Jewish EMT Service|first=Michael|last=Herzenberg|date=May 28, 2012|work=[[NY1]]|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131200318/http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/manhattan/2012/05/28/woman-works-to-form-all-female-hasidic-jewish-emt-service-NYC_162015.old.html|archive-date=2017-01-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In our community, women also have a very strong motivation to seek female doctors," said their lawyer, [[Rachel Freier]], a Brooklyn Civil Court Judge and Orthodox Jewish mother of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Levin |url=http://privateinvesigations.blogspot.com/2011/09/orthodox-women-demand-to-join-hatzalah.html |title=T.O.T.

===Cost===
In areas where the EMS charges a fee, lower income clientele lacking health insurance may have a reluctance to call for an ambulance unless the evidence of urgency is overwhelming.  A volunteer service, with less overhead costs, tends to reduce that reluctance.  Hatzolah will often handle "check-out" cases, without charge. In this way, the true emergencies among those check-outs may be recognized and treated quickly, where the caller might have otherwise not sought treatment.&lt;ref name=WhenToCall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzolahofla.org/when-to-call |title=Hatzolah LA When To Call Us |publisher=Hatzolah of Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient advocacy===
In contrast with most other EMS agencies, many Hatzalah volunteers will remain at the hospital with the patient long after bringing them to the emergency department. This is especially true during serious cases in order to help the patient and/or their families navigate the sometimes confusing series of events that occur during an emergency. Members will stay to explain, advocate and sometimes help make arrangements to bring in other specialists or arrange transfer to higher care facilities.

==Interaction with other agencies==
At times there have been difficulties in dealing with outside organizations, including other first-responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crownheights.info/index.php?itemid=35532|title=CrownHeights.info – Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch News|work=CrownHeights.info - Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch News|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=editor, on August 8th, 2012 |url=http://www.catskillscoop.com/2012/08/breaking-hatzolah-members-illegally-ticketed-while-responding-to-life-threatening-emergency.html |title=BREAKING: Hatzolah Members Illegally Ticketed While Responding To Life-Threatening Emergency |publisher=Catskill Scoop |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813025250/http://www.catskillscoop.com/2012/08/breaking-hatzolah-members-illegally-ticketed-while-responding-to-life-threatening-emergency.html |archivedate=2012-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, branches have excellent relations with state and local police and EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=16819 |title=Missing 12 Year-Old Boy Found |publisher=Collive.com |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of those operating in uneven&lt;ref&gt;e.g. seasonal&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise especially challenging situations&lt;ref&gt;Israel's [[United Hatzalah]], see below&lt;/ref&gt; is Catskills Hatzolah, handling the swelling summer crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twitpic.com/photos/911BUFF?page=6 |title=Twitpic / 911BUFF |publisher=Twitpic.com |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Catskills: A Century of the Jewish Experience, {{ISBN|0-231123-612}}, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's [[United Hatzalah]] has shared its expertise with a group of [[Arab]] volunteers from [[East Jerusalem]] to form an emergency first response unit called Nuran. The group since has been dismantled and the volunteers were incorporated in United Hatzalah.

United Hatzalah's relationship with [[Magen David Adom]], however, is strained, and MDA has banned its members and volunteers from also volunteering in other rescue organizations, including Hatzalah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3685792,00.html |title=Haredi Rescue Organizations Collapsing |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |author=Gilhar, Uri |date=March 13, 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chevra NYC Central affiliates boast an excellent relationship with New York City and New York State agencies.&lt;ref name="NYC Ops"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fastest Response Times in the World |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/twotiered.php |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2013, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted Chevrah Hatzalah's request for a waiver to obtain calling party numbers (CPN) even when callers have [[Caller ID blocking#Blocking|caller ID blocking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition of Chevrah Hatzalah Volunteer Ambulance Corps Inc. for Waiver of Section 1601(b) of the Commission’s Rules – Blocked Telephone Numbers|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2013/db0220/DA-13-227A1.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls to [[9-1-1|911]] are exempt from CPN blocking but calls to Chevrah Hatzalah do not go through 911. Other Hatzalah dispatch numbers, including other New York State Hatzalah groups, do not have this waiver, but some are working on it.

==September 11, 2001==
Hatzalah members were among the first responders to the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on [[September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref name=102m&gt;A number of Hatzoloh volunteers wearing "Flatbush Hatzoloh Paramedics" uniforms are featured in the documentary film ''[[102 Minutes That Changed America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside other rescue workers, Hatzalah volunteers rescued, treated, and transported countless victims of the terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="102m"/&gt; In the process they earned great respect from their peers in the emergency service community.&lt;ref name="kelty"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jimmy Kelty |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/duringAttack.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68E8KP0Ss?url=http://www.hatzalah.org/duringAttack.php |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatzalah was not dispatched by the city's 911 system, and a printout of the 911 job from FDNY EMS does not list them as responding units.&lt;ref&gt;FDNY Call 0727 MCI40P Aircraft Incident/ Crash PDJob#01225500590 Date 9/11/01&lt;/ref&gt; However, audio recordings exist of Hatzalah's own dispatch, including members calling for help during the collapse of the first tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=23347 |title=The Yeshiva World Audio Of Hatzolah Radio &amp; Video: 7 Years Since 9/11 |publisher=Theyeshivaworld.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also well-known photos of destroyed Hatzalah ambulances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bphatzolah.org/911hatzalah011.jpg|title=Image: One of the Hatzolah ambulances destroyed on 9-11] (JPG 650x425 77.0 KB), from [http://www.bphatzolah.org/911album.html Boro Park Hatzolah – Sept. 11 Album|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225256/http://www.bphatzolah.org/911hatzalah011.jpg|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hatzalah ambulance donated by NYS Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver in memory of his parents protected early Hatzalah responders, but was subsequently destroyed by falling debris after they were evacuated.

On page 231 of the first edition he wrote: "I met two guys from Engine 39. They brought me to EMS, the Hezbollah [sic] ambulance." This was corrected in later editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8497">Germany ranked 20th in the world in [[life expectancy]] in 2014 with [[List of countries by life expectancy|76.5 years for men and 82.1 years for women]]. It had a very low [[infant mortality rate]] (4.3 per 1,000 [[Live birth (human)|live births]]), and it was eighth place in the number of practicing physicians, at per 1,000 people (3.3).

A new measure of expected [[human capital]] calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by [[The Lancet]] in September 2018. Germany had the twenty-fourth highest level of expected human capital with 25 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Stephen |last2=et |first2=al |title=Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31941-X/fulltext |accessdate=5 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

At the end of 2004, some 44,900 Germans, or less than 0.1 percent of the population, were infected with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS]]). In the first half of 2005, German health authorities registered 1,164 new infections; about 60 percent of the cases involved homosexual men. Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, about 24,000 Germans have died from the disease.

According to a 2013 micro-census survey, 24.5% of the German population aged 15+ are smokers (29 percent in men, 20 percent in women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2014/11/PD14_386_239.html |title=Jeder zweite Erwachsene in Deutschland hat Übergewicht |author= |date=2014-11-05 |language=de |website=destatis.de |page= |publisher=Statistisches Bundesamt |access-date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 18- to 25-year-old age group, 35.2% are smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/german-youths-smoking-less-tobacco-industry-remains-powerful-1320561 |title=German Youths Smoking Less, But Tobacco Industry Remains Powerful |author=Palash Ghosh |date=2013-06-24 |website= |page= |publisher=IBT Media Inc. |access-date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obesity]] in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2007 study shows Germany has the highest number of overweight people in Europe.&lt;ref name="DW1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Topping the EU Fat Stats, Germany Plans Anti-Obesity Drive|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2449356,00.html|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany launches obesity campaign|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6639227.stm|publisher=BBC |date=9 May 2007|accessdate =25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United Kingdom, Greece and certain countries in Eastern Europe have a higher rate of "truly obese" people.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans Are Fattest People in Europe, Study Shows|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,478303,00.html|work=Der Spiegel |date=19 April 2007|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes.com ranks Germany as the 43rd fattest country in the World with a rate of 60.1%.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|title=World's Fattest Countries|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat_2.html|work=Forbes|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the end of the nineteenth century Berlin had the highest urban density of any city in Europe.Only 8% of dwellings in the city had a toilet. There were repeated outbreaks of cholera and typhus. [[Rudolf Virchow]] promoted sewage works, called [[Rieselfel]]der, after the cholera epidemic of 1868.  In 1871 a smallpox epidemic killed 6478 people.  Virchow estimated that 5% of the Berlin population were infected by venereal disease. 

Tuberculosis was estimated to be the cause of about 15% of all deaths in Prussia in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richie |first1=Alexandra |title=Faust's Metropolis |date=1998 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |location=New York |isbn=0-7867-0510-8 |page=164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccination==
In Germany, the [[Standing Committee on Vaccination]] is the federal commission responsible for recommending an immunization schedule. The [[Robert Koch Institute]] in Berlin (RKI) compiles data of immunization status upon the entry of children at school, and measures vaccine coverage of Germany at a national level.&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany|url=http://venice.cineca.org/documents/germany_ip.pdf|website=Vaccination European New Integrated Collaboration Effort|publisher=Venice III}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1972, the STIKO is composed of 12–18 volunteers, appointed members by the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Health]] for 3-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The German Standing Committee of Vaccination|url=http://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/Vaccination/Vaccination_node.html|publisher=Robert Koch Institut}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent advisory group meets biannually to address issues pertaining to preventable infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccinations|url=http://www.english.g-ba.de/special-topics/vaccinations/|website=G-BA|publisher=Bermeinsamer Bundesausschuss|access-date= 15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the STIKO makes recommendations, immunization in Germany is voluntary and there are no official government recommendations. [[States of Germany|German Federal States]] typically follow the Standing Vaccination Committee's recommendations minimally, although each state can make recommendations for their geographic jurisdiction that extends beyond the recommended list.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; In addition to the proposed immunization schedule for children and adults, the STIKO recommends vaccinations for occupational groups, police, travelers, and other at risk groups.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; Vaccinations recommendations that are issued must be in accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act ([[:de:Infektionsschutzgesetz|Infektionsschutzgesetz]]), which regulates the prevention of infectious diseases in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerwat K, Just M, Wulf H | title = [The German Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG))] | journal = Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 182–3 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19266418 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1215548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a vaccination is recommended because of occupational risks, it must adhere to the [http://www.cgerli.org/index.php?id=50&amp;tx_vmdocumentsearch_pi2%5BdocID%5D=1502 Occupational Safety and Health Act involving Biological Agents].&lt;ref name="STIKO at the Robert Koch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccinations STIKO at the Robert Koch Institute|url=http://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/Vaccination/recommandations/34_2015_engl.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|website=Epidemiologisches Bulletin|publisher=Robert Koch Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event of vaccination related injuries, federal states are responsible for monetary compensation.&lt;ref name="STIKO at the Robert Koch"/&gt;  Germany's central government does not finance childhood immunizations, so 90% of vaccines are administered in a private physician's office and paid for through insurance. The other 10% of vaccines are provided by the states in public health clinics, schools, or day care centers by local immunization programs.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; Physician responsibilities concerning immunization include beginning infancy vaccination, administering booster vaccinations, maintaining medical and vaccination history, and giving information and recommendations concerning vaccines.&lt;ref name="STIKO at the Robert Koch"/&gt;

'''Health information on the Internet''' refers to all communication related to health done on the [[Internet]].

==Types==
As a general communication channel, various Internet products serve every type of general health information.

===Targeting types of information to different audiences===
In the late 1990s researchers began to note that huge numbers of people were using the Internet to seek health information, despite various problems with the quality of information or inefficiencies in accessing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Risk | first1 = A. | last2 = Petersen | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.20.2713 | title = Health Information on the Internet | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 20 | pages = 2713–2715 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12020308| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various problems have been identified for those using [[search engines]] to seek health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berland | first1 = G.

There is a premise that patients with access to their personal health information presented in a form they can understand will be able to interpret and learn from this information in a way that benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=JS|author2=Intille, SS |author3=Morris, ME |title=To track or not to track: user reactions to concepts in longitudinal health monitoring.|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e29|pmid=17236264|pmc=1794006|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.4.e29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians worry that patients using their own medical history records as a starting point for personal research on the Internet are at risk for being overwhelmed and misinformed when seeking health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robeznieks|first=A|title=Getting personal.

As of 2013 opinions about the relationship health care providers should have with online health information were still being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnan|first=Jeanne M.|title=Online Medical Professionalism: Patient and Public Relationships: Policy Statement From the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=16 April 2013|volume=158|issue=8|pages=620–7|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-8-201304160-00100|pmid=23579867}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one 2014 study, "The flow of information has fundamentally changed, and physicians have less control over health information relayed to patients. Not surprisingly, this paradigm shift has elicited varied and sometimes conflicting views about the value of the Internet as a tool to improve health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonsaker|first=Tabitha|last2=Bartlett|first2=Gillian|last3=Trpkov|first3=Cvetan|date=2016-11-14|title=Health information on the Internet|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=60|issue=5|pages=407–408|issn=0008-350X|pmc=4020634|pmid=24828994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Doctor–patient relationship}}
Physicians have difficulty explaining complicated medical concepts to their patients and patients have difficulty understanding complicated things which physicians tell them. One reasons for this is that a patient's visit to a physician is likely to be less than 15 minutes, and in any case, physicians are unable to spend the amount of time which patients that patients typically desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechanic|first=David|author2=McAlpine, Donna D. |author3=Rosenthal, Marsha |title=Are Patients' Office Visits with Physicians Getting Shorter?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 January 2001|volume=344|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1056/NEJM200101183440307|pmid=11172143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians use medical terms which patients do not understand, but which they would like to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=CM|author2=Wilson, C |author3=Wang, F |author4= Schillinger, D |title=Babel babble: physicians' use of unclarified medical jargon with patients|journal=American journal of health behavior|date=Sep–Oct 2007|volume=31 Suppl 1|pages=S85–95|pmid=17931142 |doi=10.5993/ajhb.31.s1.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is consensus that patients should have [[shared decision making]], which means that they make informed decisions about the direction of their health care in collaboration with their physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock III|first=Clarence H.|author2=Edwards, Kelly A. |author3=Hasenberg, Nicole M. |author4=Laidley, Tracy L. |author5= Levinson, Wendy |title=Informed Decision Making in Outpatient Practice|journal=JAMA|date=22 December 1999|volume=282|issue=24|pages=2313–20|doi=10.1001/jama.282.24.2313|pmid=10612318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich, educated, socially advantaged patients enjoy many more benefits of shared decision making than patients who have disadvantages in getting healthcare, including lower socioeconomic class or having a minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiscella|first=Kevin|author2=Epstein, Ronald M.|title=So Much to Do, So Little Time:care for the socially disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=22 September 2008|volume=168|issue=17|pages=1843–52|doi=10.1001/archinte.168.17.1843|pmid=18809810|pmc=2606692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of patient understanding of health contributes to a range of problems including tendency to not adhere to the physician's medical advice and missing medical appointments.&lt;ref name="Wicks 2010"&gt;A better source should be used to support this claim, although this source is good enough for how it is used here.

Various social forums exist in which anyone can have conversations about health with their peers. Such forums are especially popular among patients who seek to have conversations with other patients with a shared medical concern.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G.|title=Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions|journal=BMJ|date=15 May 2004|volume=328|issue=7449|pages=1166–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166|pmid=15142921|pmc=411092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who participate in online communities which discuss health issues report feeling relief about their health worries, perceiving more control over their health and medical condition, having more medical knowledge, and having more personal agency overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barak|first=Azy|author2=Boniel-Nissim, Meyran |author3=Suler, John |title=Fostering empowerment in online support groups|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=September 2008|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1867–1883|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic medical literature===
The written record of medical consensus is stored in [[scientific journals]]. Since the advent of [[electronic publishing]] there has been [[academic journal publishing reform]] which had a range of effects, including more researchers and physicians having greater access to professional information in medical journals through the Internet.

===Patients' personal health information===
Through various sources both publicly and privately available, datasets containing health information about large numbers of patients are available on the Internet to an extent which was impossible to manage before the Internet.

==Quality==
Measures and standards for ensuring quality control on the Internet have been criticized and no one standard is universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jadad | first1 = A.

The nature and quality of online health-related information seeking on the web is challenging and complex and many researchers investigated this issue benefiting from a wide range of theories from different disciplines.&lt;/ref&gt; Among all sources there is a wide variance in quality of health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Khosrowjerdi, M. (2016). A review of theory-driven models of trust in the online health context. IFLA Journal, 42(3): pp. 189-206. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0340035216659299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal health information==
For many applications people wish to use health information on the Internet to give insight about a personal health concern. Because of this, the goal is often to use the Internet to find information described in a person's [[medical record]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since the advent of [[electronic media]], medical records have been increasingly kept as [[electronic medical records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} If electronic medical records were shared online then it would be easy to match those with information and conduct a range of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagliari|first=C|author2=Detmer, D |author3=Singleton, P |title=Potential of electronic personal health records.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Aug 18, 2007|volume=335|issue=7615|pages=330–3|pmid=17703042|doi=10.1136/bmj.39279.482963.AD|pmc=1949437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, all medical records are [[protected health information]] because sharing personal health information exposes an individual to a range of harms which result from violation of their [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There is currently broad international debate about how to balance patient and commercial medicine demands for personal health information with individual's needs for safety and respect.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Electronic medical records===
{{main article|Electronic medical record}}
An electronic medical record is a [[medical record]] stored as [[electronic media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=P. C|author2=Ash, J. S |author3=Bates, D. W |author4=Overhage, J M. |author5= Sands, D. Z |title=Personal Health Records: Definitions, Benefits, and Strategies for Overcoming Barriers to Adoption|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=1 March 2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=121–126|doi=10.1197/jamia.M2025 |pmid=16357345 |pmc=1447551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-identification===
{{main article|De-identification}}
De-identification is an attempt to divide a collection of information about a particular person so that all information which identifies the person is removed, and with intent to distribute whatever information is left. The closer the data is to [[anonymization]] the less valuable the data is to those who want it, so in general, data is only de-identified somewhat and rarely anonymized. There are many controversies in de-identification.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Research using personal health information===
There is a large demand for access to large collections of various types of personal health information.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Almost all of this demand is commercial.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Distribution of collections of personal health information===
Various groups have expressed worry over danger to the public which results from the distribution of collections of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/05/data-protection-eu-anonymous |title=Data protection in the EU: the certainty of uncertainty |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |work=theguardian.com |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom proposed to sell datasets of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/19/nhs-patient-data-available-companies-buy |title=NHS patient data to be made available for sale to drug and insurance firms |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |work=theguardian.com |date=19 January 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/04/care-data-nhs-healthcare |title=Thanks to Care.data, your secrets are no longer safe with your GP (Wired UK) |first=Asher |last=Wolf |work=wired.co.uk |date=7 February 2014|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Healthy Life Years''' indicator (HLY) is a European structural indicator computed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301003227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=HLTH_HLYE Eurostat]. It is one of the summary measures of population health, known as health expectancies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu/pdf/Glossary_v4.pdf Glossary EurOhex website]&lt;/ref&gt; composite measures of health that combine [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] data to represent overall population health on a single indicator.&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Robine. ''Summarizing health status''. In: Pencheon D, Guest C, Melzer D, Gray JAM, editors. Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;160-168&lt;/ref&gt; HLY measures the number of remaining years that a person of a certain age is expected to live without disability. It is actually a disability-free [[life expectancy]].

== History ==
The European Union has decided to include a small set of health expectancies among its European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) to provide synthetic measures of disability, chronic morbidity, and perceived health. Therefore the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM), composed of 3 general questions covering these dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;B. Cox, H. Van Oyen, E. Cambois, C. Jagger, S. Le Roy, J-M Robine, I.Romieu. The reliability of the Minimum European Health Module. ''International Journal of Public Health'' 2009;(54):55-60 (DOI 10.1007/s00038-009-7104-y), p57&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced into the Eurostat EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1177:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)]&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the comparability of health expectancies between countries. In addition life expectancy without long term activity limitation, based on the disability question, was selected in 2004 to be one of the structural indicators to be examined every year, during the European Spring Council for assessing the EU strategic goals ([[Lisbon Strategy]]) under the name of “Healthy Life Years” (HLY)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/indicators/lifeyears_en.htm Health Life Years in the core of the Lisbon Strategy ]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Furthermore the European Union is co-funding a Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (CHRODIS-JA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chrodis.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to promote and facilitate a process of exchange and transfer of good practices between European countries and regions, addressing chronic conditions, with a specific focus on health promotion and prevention of chronic conditions, multi-morbidity and diabetes.'''   

Detailed information on the Health Expectancies in Europe are available from the EurOhex Advanced research on European health expectancies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu EurOhex]&lt;/ref&gt; while latest Healthy Life Years values can be found on the general public website devoted to the Healthy Life Years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthy-life-years.eu healthy-life-years.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Dramatic increases in [[life expectancy]] in the most developed countries - and therefore in the countries of the European Union - constitute one of the most remarkable advances of the last decades. But why prolong life if this is to be accompanied by increases in severe mental and physical impairment? Thus a further challenge confronts the European Community:
:''increasing life expectancy in good health.''

In this context, the classical mortality indicators are no longer sufficient to monitor the health status of European populations. The availability of health expectancy indicators dividing life expectancy into life spent in different states of health is useful to health authorities in the field of [[public health]] and [[health policy|health policies]] provided that these indicators allow comparisons over time and between geographic areas and between socio-economic groups in society. As the post-war generation reaches retirement, the pace of ageing will increase dramatically in our European societies, with profound social effects. HLY is an important indicator :
* Health of a population is inherently difficult to measure because it is often defined differently among individuals, populations, cultures, and even across time periods.
* Many studies focus on measures such as physical impairment or disability in functional tasks or presence of a specific chronic disease. Self-assessed health, being much more global and subjective in nature, can incorporate a variety of aspects of health including cognitive and emotional as well as physical status, and therefore provide insights into the needs of an [[ageing]] society. Hence, self-assessed health measures as HLY may be a particularly important indicator of the potential demand for health services and long-term care needs.
* The two components of the calculation of the HLY are life tables and self-perceived disability assessed by health surveys. From 1995 to 2001, data from the Eurostat European Community Household Panel (ECHP) survey have been used for the EU-15 Member States. Its successor, the Eurostat EU-SILC has been used from 2005 onwards for the EU-25 and then 27 Member States.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

== Example ==
[[File:HLY 2010.jpg|thumb|Healthy Life Years in Europe - 2010]]
* The HLY estimates are provided for the 27 EU Member States using the EU-SILC data for 2010 (see graph above)
* The first analyses of the healthy life years values disclose significant inequalities among the European countries.&lt;ref&gt;C. Jagger, C. Gillies, F. Mascone, E. Cambois, H. Van Oyen, W.J. Nusselder, J.-M. Robine, EHLEIS team. Inequalities in healthy life years in the 25 countries of the European Union in 2005: a cross-national meta-regression analysis. ''The Lancet'' 2008;372(9656):2124-2131 (DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61594-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical Findings==
Different estimations are made for men and women. In 2015, the number of healthy years of women in the EU-28 was estimated to be at 63.3 years and of men to be at 62.6 years. The interesting part of this is that the gender gap was considerably smaller in regards to healthy life years than to overall life expectancy. This would imply that biologically, gender would not really affect the rate and time at which humans would become healthy yet gender would play a role in how long human beings would be able to live in an unhealthy state. 

==Data Sources and their Availability==
Eurostat calculates information about the healthy life years at three different ages during a person's life. One is at birth, another is at age 50, and the third is at age 65, with an indicator used separately for men and women. The data is calculated and collected by using mortality statistics as well as self perceived longstanding activity limitations- a dimension that captures longstanding limitation in regards to health and/or disability to perform usual and frequent activities. 
An example of a question that might be asked concerning the longstanding activity limitation is: "For the last six months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities that people usually do?" Some available answers are "severely limited", "limited but not severely", or "not limited at all".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2499">The '''Hispanic Health Council''' (HHC), was established in 1978 in response to the [[health]] care [[crisis]] in the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] community. HHC is a nationally recognized community-based [[research]], service, [[training]], and advocacy organization, is committed to developing and providing a comprehensive approach to improving the health and social well-being of Latinos and other low income inner city [[population]].

== History ==
The Hispanic Health Council, which is based in [[Hartford, CT]], has a long year track record of successfully translating its research findings into prevention, intervention, and [[community]] [[education]] programs. Since the founding of the HHC in 1978, the organization has grown to be the largest Hispanic social service organization in the state of Connecticut, with special expertise in maternal and [[child health]], family [[nutrition]], risk reduction, youth development, substance abuse, and [[HIV/AIDS]].

== Goal ==
The central mission of the Hispanic Health Council is to use research to enhance the effectiveness of community intervention and education programs and to use long term involvement in the community to develop health research programs. The organization’s efforts to achieve these goals are characterized by: 
* The use of state-of-the art research methodology in identifying, assessing, tracking, and responding to emergent and enduring public health problems; 
* A commitment to community participation and an activist/involved approach to scholarship; * building broad-based community collaborators and consumer participation in prevention/intervention research; 
* Technology transfer and the creation of research capacity at the grassroots level; 
* A strong track record of both professional publication and the community dissemination of research findings through conferences, workshops, presentations, health fairs, fact sheets, newsletters, and related media; 
* A deep concern with the development of culturally and socially competent prevention/intervention models; 
* Interdisciplinary collaboration; and 
* Health policy and advocacy. The Hispanic Health Council is organized in five Centers of Excellence: Maternal and Child Health, Nutrition, Youth and Family Health and Development, Risk Reduction, and Research.

'''John Allen Burden''' (1862–1942) was a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], [[Administration (business)|administrator]], and [[medical missionary]] instrumental in founding [[Sanatorium|sanitariums]], restaurants, and health food factories. At the age of 9, John attended Adventist meetings for the first time and was introduced to the writings of [[Ellen G. White]], which left a lifelong impression upon him. Five years later he was baptized, and at the age of 18 (1880) moved with his family to [[Oregon]]. John met [[Eleanor A. Baxter]] (1865–1933) as a student at Healdsburg College (now [[Pacific Union College]]). They were married in 1888 while working for the Rural Health Retreat (later [[St. Helena Sanitarium]]), of which John became manager in 1891.

In 1901 the Burdens went to [[Australia]] where they helped [[Merritt G. Kellogg]] who was founding the Wahroonga Sanitarium (now the [[Sydney Adventist Hospital]]) in [[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga]], [[Sydney]]. By March 1904 the Burdens returned to the United States. [[Ellen G. White]] encouraged them not to unite with [[John Harvey Kellogg]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]]. Instead, John sought to establish a sanitarium near [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Eight miles from the city he discovered the Glendale Hotel that had cost $60,000 to build in 1886. However, because of local business failures, property value had declined so that he was able to purchase it for $12,500. When it opened in 1905, Burden was the manager of the sanitarium, and Eleanor the bookkeeper. The sanitarium prospered under Burden's careful management.

In 1904 [[Ellen G. White]] urged for the establishment of another sanitarium in [[southern California]]. A resort hotel at [[Loma Linda, California|Loma Linda]] was found that was available for $110,000, a price too high. On May 4, 1905 she met with the Burdens and others at the railroad station in Los Angeles on her way to the [[General Conference Session]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Burden told her of the property, and she expressed definite interest in it, asking him to write her about it after his next visit to the property. When Burden's letter&lt;ref&gt;John Burden to Ellen G. White, May 7, 1905, [[Ellen G. White Estate]]&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in Washington, she urged him by telegram to

&lt;blockquote&gt;secure the property by all means. . . .  This is the very property we ought to have. Do not delay; for it is just what is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen G. White, Letter 139, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Borrowing the down payment, Burden succeeded in purchasing the property for $40,000 and was put in charge of the new sanitarium.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen G. White, Letter 169, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The final price, with discounts for early payment, came to $38,900. After Ellen White found out that the property was secured she wrote in her diary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am surprised more and more that the Lord has in His abundant mercy wrought in our behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen G. White, Manuscript 176, 1905, Aug. 25, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Founded as the College of Medical Evangelists, the institution exists today as [[Loma Linda University]]. A building on campus, Burden Hall, remains named for John Burden. At one time, it was home to the [[Loma Linda University Church]] of [[Seventh-day Adventists]] until the congregation outgrew it. Burden Hall now houses the Office of University Relations, is used for classes during the week, and is home to a Sabbath School class each Saturday.

Burden continued to manage the facilities at Loma Linda until 1915 when he became manager, and Eleanor the matron, of [[Paradise Valley Sanitarium]] (1916–1924; 1925–1934). After Eleanor's death in 1933, John retired, but in 1939 he returned to Loma Linda to serve as chaplain, counseling young medical missionaries and the staff of the College of Medical Evangelists. Burden died as the result of a car accident on his return from a Bible study in [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], California. Burden's personal collection of some 650 pages of Ellen White's letters (half of them addressed to him) was published as ''Loma Linda Messages'' (Loma Linda, CA: College of Medical Evangelists, 1934).

Methanol has a high toxicity in humans. If as little as 10&amp;nbsp;ml of pure methanol is ingested, for example, it can break down into [[formic acid]], which can cause permanent [[blindness]] by destruction of the [[optic nerve]], and 30&amp;nbsp;ml is potentially fatal,&lt;ref name="Vale"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vale A |title=Methanol |journal=Medicine |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=633–4 |year=2007|month= |pmid= |doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the median lethal dose is typically 100&amp;nbsp;ml (3.4&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz) (i.e. 1–2&amp;nbsp;ml/kg body weight of pure methanol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methanol Poisoning Overview|url=http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm|publisher=Antizol|accessdate=4/10/11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043548/http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}} dead link&lt;/ref&gt;). This does not happen with [[ethanol]], which breaks down into [[acetic acid]], which is non-toxic on small amounts. [[Reference dose]] for methanol is 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0305.htm Methanol (CASRN 67-56-1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic effects take hours to start, and effective antidotes can often prevent permanent damage.&lt;ref name="Vale"/&gt; Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to [[ethanol]] (the alcohol in beverages), it is difficult to differentiate between the two.

==Brazil==
In 1999, 35 people died, in ten cities of the state of Bahia as a result of drinking [[cachaça]] contaminated with methanol. Further investigation revealed concentrations as high as 24.84% methanol.

'''Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound''' ('''LIPUS''') is a medical technology, generally using 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency pulses, with a pulse width of 200 μs, repeated at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, at a spatial average and temporal average intensity of 30&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=2009rev/&gt; As of 2009 research for the use of LIPUS to treat soft tissue injuries were in the early stages.&lt;ref name=2009rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khanna|first1=A|last2=Nelmes|first2=RT|last3=Gougoulias|first3=N|last4=Maffulli|first4=N|last5=Gray|first5=J|title=The effects of LIPUS on soft-tissue healing: a review of literature.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=2009|volume=89|pages=169–82|pmid=19011263|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldn040}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 it was being studied for dental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2174/1874210601206010220| title = Current Status of Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound for Dental Purposes| journal = The Open Dentistry Journal| volume = 6| pages = 220–5| year = 2012| last1 = Rego | first1 = E.

Starting around the 1950s this technology was being used as a form of physical therapy for ailments such as tendinitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Douglas|last2=Smith|first2=Nadine|last3=Bailey|first3=Michael|last4=Czarnota|first4=Gregory|last5=Hynynen|first5=Kullervo|last6=Makin|first6=Inder|date=April 2012|title=Overview of Therapeutic Ultrasound Applications and Safety Considerations|journal=Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine|volume=31|issue=4|pages=623–634|doi=10.7863/jum.2012.31.4.623|issn=0278-4297|pmc=3810427|pmid=22441920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Manliness''''' is a book by [[Harvey Mansfield|Harvey C. Mansfield]] first published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2006. Mansfield is a professor of [[Political science|government]] at [[Harvard University]]. In this book, he defines manliness as "confidence in a situation of risk" and suggests this quality is currently undervalued in Western society.

He suggests the quality is more common in men than in women, but doesn't strictly exclude women, for example he names [[Margaret Thatcher]]. He also suggests the quality is "good and bad", not all good, but not all bad. His main point is that [[gender neutral]] ideology denies both the reality of sex-specific qualities, and the valuable components of these, to the detriment of society.

Mansfield attributes the rise of gender neutral ideology firstly to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and then to [[feminists]] who repackaged the ideas as part of a political program. He names [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Betty Friedan]] and [[Germaine Greer]].

== Overview ==
{{Rquote|right|Today the very word ''manliness'' seems quaint and obsolete. We are in the process of making the English language gender-neutral, and manliness, the quality of one gender, or rather, of one sex, seems to describe the essence of the enemy we are attacking, the evil we are eradicating.|Harvey Mansfield, ''Manliness''}}
Mansfield evaluates the concept of manliness as it has been expressed over the course of Western civilization, and considers its virtues. As Mansfield stated to [[NPR]]'s [[Tom Ashbrook]], "Some people say manliness doesn't exist. Others say it does exist and it's bad. I say it exists and it's good ... and bad."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Mansfield, [http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2006/08/20060830_a_main.asp "Manliness,"] ''[[NPR]]'s [[On Point]]'', August 30, 2006. Accessed November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on classical philosophy, literature, and science, Mansfield argues that manliness is a virtue primarily associated with the male sex which is preferable to widespread institutional gender-neutral ideology.

Beginning with modern scientific discoveries, Mansfield appropriates them for insights on how these innate biological realities might exert an influence on [[gender identity]] and [[gender role]] preferences. Mansfield then proceeds to literature, drawing on [[Homer]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] to support his thesis that manliness has been a perpetual component of the male psyche and behavior.

Mansfield then offers an analysis of the historical forces in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, singling out [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Germaine Greer]] as the key writers to have influenced, what he considers to be, the dismantling of manliness. These writers shared two common hypotheses they derived from earlier writers: from Marx they drew the theory of economic exploitation, and from Nietzsche their flirtations with [[nihilism]]. Finally, Mansfield turns to [[Aristotle]] as the archetypal expounder of manliness to identify the quality of "philosophical courage," which Mansfield concludes is the ideal understanding of manliness.

According to the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC), Malaysia reportedly received 641,000 foreign patients in 2011, 728,800 in 2012, 881,000 in 2013, 882,000 in 2014, 859,000 in 2015, and 921,000 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgemedicalgetaway.com/|title=Statistics|publisher=George Medical Getaway, Medical Tourism Facilitator in Malaysia|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia's medical tourism statistics derive from the reported numbers of all foreign patients treated by [http://www.mhtc.org.my/ Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC)]–endorsed medical facilities. These figures encompass all registered patients with a foreign passport, which by default also encompass expatriates, migrants, business travellers, and holiday-makers for whom health care may not be the main motive for their stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medical tourism in Malaysia: how can we better identify and manage its advantages and disadvantages?|author=Meghann Ormond, Wong Kee Mun &amp; Chan Chee Khoon|year=2014|publisher=Global Health Action|url=http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/25201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC)]–endorsed medical facilities in Malaysia has increased over the years (e.g., 35 in 2009, 49 in 2011, 63 in 2012, 72 in 2013 and 78 in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Directory|author=Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council|year=2012|publisher=Healthcare Malaysia Magazine|url=http://www.medicaltourism.com.my/en/malaysia-healthcare-magazine/2012/en/HealthCare%20Malaysia%202012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Directory|author=Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council|year=2013|publisher=Healthcare Malaysia Magazine|url=http://www.medicaltourism.com.my/en/malaysia-healthcare-magazine/2013/Healthcare%20Malaysia%20Magazine%202013_English.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Directory|author=Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council|year=2014|publisher=Healthcare Malaysia Magazine|url=http://www.mhtc.org.my/en/malaysia-healthcare-magazine/2014/Healthcare_Malaysia_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;), playing a role in increasing the official figures on foreign patients.

==Origin of patients==
The majority of the foreign patients seeking medical treatments in Malaysia are from Indonesia, with smaller numbers of foreign patients coming from India, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Europe, the USA and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Medical tourism in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and India', in C.

==Government measures==
As with [[Tourism in Thailand#Medical tourism|Thailand]], [[medical tourism]] started to receive attention from the Malaysian government in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian Financial crisis]] as a tool for economic diversification in the healthcare and tourism industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ghazali Musa|title=Going Global Medical Tourism|url=http://www.mpc.gov.my/mpc/images/file/Highlights/APIC_Paper%20Presentation/Going_Global_Medical_Tourism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neoliberal Governance and International Medical Travel in Malaysia|author=Meghann Ormond|year=2013|publisher=London: Routledge|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415502382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Committee for the Promotion of Medical and Health Tourism (NCPMHT) was
formed by the Ministry of Health in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medical tourism and the state in Malaysia and Singapore|author=Chee Heng Leng|year=2010|publisher=Global Social Policy|url=http://gsp.sagepub.com/content/10/3/336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following on this, private hospitals (and some corporatised government-owned hospitals, like the [[Institut Jantung Negara]]) – concentrated mainly in the states of [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], [[Selangor]], [[Sarawak]], and [[Johor]] – worked alongside and through their respective state governments; private hospital associations; and the Malaysian Ministries of Health, Tourism, and Trade and Industry to promote medical tourism. In 2009, the [[Ministry of Health Malaysia|Ministry of Health]] set up the [http://www.mhtc.org.my/ Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC)] to replace the NCPMHT and to serve as the primary agency to promote and develop the country's medical tourism industry as well as position Malaysia as a healthcare hub in the Southeast Asian/[[ASEAN]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Council to promote medical tourism|url=http://www.malaysiahealthcare.com/22072009.htm|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
The Malaysian government's investment tax allowance has encouraged private health care facilities promoting medical tourism to invest in internationally recognized accreditation schemes (e.g. [[Joint Commission International]] and [http://www.msqh.com.my/msqh/ Malaysian Society for Quality in Healthcare]) and medical equipment in order to develop ‘world-class’, technology-intensive private health care facilities and ensure care standards considered necessary to attract medical tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medical tourism in Malaysia: how can we better identify and manage its advantages and disadvantages?|author=Meghann Ormond, Wong Kee Mun &amp; Chan Chee Khoon|year=2014|publisher=Global Health Action|url=http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/25201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For-profit hospitals are expected to invest MYR 335 million in hospital infrastructure in order to be prepared for 1.9 million foreign patients annually by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ETP annual report, 2013.

The '''New South Wales Physical Disability Rugby League Association''' (NSWPDRLA) is an [[amateur]] open age [[rugby league]] competition for people with a [[Physical disability]].

==History==
The NSWPDRL was formed in 2010 by George Tonna, a former Australian paralympian [[association football|football]] player. They then affiliated with the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] and established two teams the Eastern Sydney Stingrays and Western Sydney Outlaws and were playing exhibition matches from 2010-12. Two new clubs entered in 2013 the Manly Sea Eagles and Newtown Jets for players based in the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]] and [[City of Sydney|Sydney City]] areas.

The Manly Sea Eagles are the current champions as they defeated South Sydney 12-4 in the 2015 grand final.

==Rules==
The rules are the same as top level rugby league but have been modified to make the game safer for disabled bodied and younger players;
*9 a side although in some cases 13 are used.
*Scoring is the same as usual, 4 points for a try and 2 for a conversion.
*Red shorts players play touch in both attack and defence.
*Black shorts players play standard tackle rules.
*Knock ons are counted as a tackle.
*No scrums.
*Able bodied players can participate but no more than 2 are allowed on the field at any time, they cannot score tries, kick goals or kick in general play.

==Current Clubs==
There are currently 4 teams in the competition but there are plans to expand the competition further across NSW, Australia and overseas.

'''Narva Reservoir''' ({{lang-et|Narva veehoidla}}, {{lang-ru|На́рвское водохрани́лище}}) is a [[reservoir]] by [[Narva River]], shared by [[Russia]] and [[Estonia]].

The reservoir was constructed during 1955-1956, during the [[Soviet era]]. It provides water to [[Narva Hydroelectric Station]] (installed capacity 125 MW, located on the Russian side and owned by the power company [[TGC-1]]) and cooling water to the Estonian [[Narva Power Plants]]. Its surface area at normal [[headwater]] level of {{convert|25|m}} is {{convert|191|km2}}, of which {{convert|40|km2}} belongs to Estonia. Its [[drainage basin]] is {{convert|55848|km2}}.&lt;ref name="ourw"&gt;''Our Waters: Joining Hands Across Borders : First Assessment of Transboundary Rivers, Lakes and Groundwaters'', by [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], Rainer Enderlein, Published by ''[[United Nations Publications]]'', 2007, {{ISBN|92-1-116972-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L73CJCH-ZuIC&amp;pg=RA3-PA13-IA2&amp;pg=RA3-PA13-IA2 p. 237]&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall water exchange rate is high (about 30&amp;nbsp;times year), with some almost stagnant areas. The ecological status is estimated as "good" (as of 2007).&lt;ref name=ourw/&gt;

This observance began in October 1984, and was created by Gerry Durnell, the publisher of ''[[Pizza Today]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="NPM"/&gt; Some people observe National pizza month by consuming various types of [[pizza]]s or pizza slices, or going to various pizzerias.&lt;ref name="Genovese"/&gt; During the month, some [[pizzerias]] give away free pizzas or pizza slices to customers or offer reduced-price promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/October-2014/Pie-Five-Pies-It-Forward-For-National-Pizza-Month/|title=Pie Five Pizza pays it forward|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/26685710/pizza-restaurant-gives-away-free-pies-in-honor-of-national-pizza-month|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141016021105/http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/26685710/pizza-restaurant-gives-away-free-pies-in-honor-of-national-pizza-month|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 October 2014|title=Pizza restaurant gives away free pies in honor of National Pizza|date=2 October 2014|publisher=DC News FOX 5|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/23598725/happys-pizza-celebrating-national-pizza-month|title=Happy's Pizza celebrating National Pizza Month|date=3 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031195926/http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/23598725/happys-pizza-celebrating-national-pizza-month|archivedate=31 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/September-2014/Dominos-Pizza-to-Offer-Weeklong-Carryout-Special-Just-in-Time-for-National-Pizza-Month/|title=Domino's has deal for national pizza month|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses run fundraising drives, donating proceeds of pizza sales to benefit various organizations or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/October-2012/Pizza-Pizza-Closes-National-Pizza-Month-With-Fundraiser-for-Childrens-Miracle-Network/|title=Pizza Pizza Closes National Pizza Month With Fundraiser for Children's Miracle Network|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODgtAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22National+pizza+month%22+fundraiser&amp;dq=%22National+pizza+month%22+fundraiser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3C0_VOKZCMHCigLr3IGQBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA|title=Pizza Today|publisher=Pizza Today|accessdate=16 October 2014|pages=8, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restaurantnews.com/old-chicago-pizza-taproom-donating-1-from-select-specialty-pizzas-to-benefit-childrens-hospital-medical-center-this-month/|date=October 14, 2014|title=Old Chicago Pizza &amp; Taproom Donating $1 From Select Specialty Pizzas To Benefit Children’s Hospital &amp; Medical Center This Month|work=|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=Restaurant News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pizzerias create unique pizzas that they don't routinely offer.

'''NewsRx''' is a [[media (communication)|media]] and [[technology]] company focusing on [[digital media]], printed media, news services, and knowledge discovery through its BUTTER platform.  In 1995 the company was the world’s largest producer of health news.&lt;ref name="Let the Reader Beware"&gt;Fernandes, Manuela. "Health Letters: Let the Reader Beware." ''The New York Times'' News Service 18 Aug, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The company publishes 194 newsweeklies in health and other fields, which are distributed to subscribers and partners including [[Factiva]], the ''[[Wall Street Journal]] Professional Edition'', [[Thomson Reuters]], [[ProQuest]], and [[Cengage Learning]].&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"&gt;Bellury, Phillip. ''Enlightening The World''. Atlanta, GA: The Storyline Group, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "siaa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siia.net/blog/index/Post/65283/SIPA-Member-Profile-Henderson-Has-It-All-Covered-With-NewsRx |title=SIPA Member Profile|website=siia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C W Henderson]] founded the company in 1984 and its first publication was ''AIDS Weekly.'' &lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"&gt;Taylor, Ron. "Private Enterprise Jumps into AIDS Marketplace." ''Atlanta Constitution''. February 4, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 2000s, the firm added the imprint, VerticalNews to publish newsweeklies in non-health fields.&lt;ref name="86 Titles"&gt;"NewsRx's VerticalNews Division Launches 86 Titles in Tech, Science and General Interest." ''Newsletter on Newsletters'' September 10, 2008 http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NewsRx's+VerticalNews+division+launches+86+titles+in+tech,+science...-a0186874438&lt;/ref&gt;   Now based in Atlanta, Georgia, the company reports through its daily news service and publishes reference books through its partner, [[ScholarlyEditions]].&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScholarlyEditions Brochure"&gt;Hasty, Susan. "Take Control of the News." ''ScholarlyNews and ScholarlyEditions''. ScholarlyMedia, 2011 http://www.scholarlyeditions.com/assets/pdf/scholarlyeditions-brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NewsRx launched its BUTTER platform in 2015, which is a knowledge discovery engine that delivers its content to academics, researchers, and professionals.&lt;ref name="siaa"/&gt;

==History==

The idea for the first newsletter originated at an international conference on [[AIDS]] sponsored by the [[Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention]] (CDC). A staff member commented to CW Henderson on the need for a publication to condense the rapid rise in information about the disease.&lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/&gt;  In 1984, Henderson created CW Henderson Publisher,&lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/&gt; which became NewsRx in 2004.&lt;ref name= "Who.is."&gt;[http://www.who.is/domain_archive-com/newsrx.com/]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the company distributed its first journal, ''CDC AIDS Weekly'', (which split into ''AIDS Weekly'' and ''Medical Letter on the CDC &amp; FDA'') to an international audience.&lt;ref name="6 Men"&gt;Zimmerman, David, Lou Ziegler, and Patrick O'Driscoll. "6 Who Made a Difference." ''USA Today'' December 11, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"&gt;Goss, Fred. "Charles Henderson Quietly Built one of the Largest and Most Successful Operations in Newsletter HIstory, Title by Title, Week by Week." ''Newsletter on Newsletters'' May 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The first subscriber was the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/&gt; Other subscribers include physicians, educators, government agencies, and pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Health-Care Newsletters"&gt;Allison, David. "Atlanta's a Center for Health-care Newsletters." ''Atlanta Business Chronicle''. April 21, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles in ''AIDS Weekly'' discussed social issues of the disease to medical research.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt; The newsweekly included “shorts” to explain as much as was known about unfolding information and events.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;

Before the World Wide Web, NewsRx coordinated with the National AIDS Information Clearinghouse to provide information on the disease.&lt;ref name="AIDS Bulletin"&gt;Moore, Lisa. "AIDS Bulletin." ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''. June 6, 1988: 83&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''CDC AIDS Weekly Infoline'' provided a list of upcoming AIDS seminars as well as names and addresses of over 65 AIDS periodicals published worldwide.&lt;ref name="AIDS Bulletin"/&gt;

The information published in ''AIDS Weekly'' came primarily from the government organization [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC).&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;  Though the newsweekly had no direct ties to the CDC other than as a source for information, a CDC official described the publication as “highly informative.” &lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt;  Other sources of information for this and other titles were the nearby [[Emory University]] medical library and international agencies.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;  Articles included summaries of peer-reviewed research, conference reports, news releases, and compilations from other health and medical organizations.&lt;ref&gt;"NewsRx Weekly Reports." Dialog, November 10, 2003. Web. 24 Aug 2011. http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0135.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the beginning, some critics were offended by the fact that NewsRx was a non-governmental agency distributing statistics that were available for free in official versions frrm the government.&lt;ref name="Source of News"&gt;Laermer, Richard. "A Source of News on AIDS." ''Editor and Publisher'' September 5, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  (see Controversy)

In 1988, the firm added ''Cancer Weekly''&lt;ref name="86 Titles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIDS Therapies"&gt;Ricklefs, Roger. "Medical Newsletters on AIDS Therapies Crop Up Across U.S." ''The Wall Street Journal''. October 4, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and it added ''Blood Weekly'' in 1993.&lt;ref name="86 Titles"/&gt; The company added ''Vaccine Weekly'' in 1995, followed by over 100 more medical-related titles.&lt;ref name="Let the Reader Beware"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;

In 1999, the firm also adopted ''[[Artificial Intelligence]] Journalist'' (AIJ) which uses robotics, [[machine learning]], [[algorithms]], logic, and [[automated reasoning]] to provide [[computer-assisted reporting]] and [[data driven journalism]].&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt;   This software program shortens the time from news event to news distribution.&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt;

In 2007, the firm introduced VerticalNews, a group of newsweeklies that included 86 new non-medical related titles, thus expanding the company’s reader-base.&lt;ref name="86 Titles"/&gt;   The initiative also emphasized the distribution of information on a global scale (more than 50 countries).&lt;ref name="6 Men"/&gt;   Electronic versions of the publications are available.&lt;ref name="86 Titles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peddle or Perish"&gt;Oliver, Suzanne. "Peddle or Perish." ''Forbes''. October 23, 1995: 222-232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauerman, Connie. "Today's Prescription for Medical Advice: Take 2 Aspirin and See a Newsletter." ''Chicago Tribune'' August 8, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;     In addition to the 103 newsweeklies in medical, legal, and business fields within the healthcare industry, the firm publishes 88 newsweeklies within the VerticalNews imprint.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;

The firm also adopted site licenses, including  the ability for users to download reports showing the types of information used in a given organization—information previously restricted to the NewsRx staff.&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt;  The system recognizes IP addresses to facilitate research activities.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Health-Care Newsletters"/&gt;

On April 22, 2015, NewsRx announced hiring new VP and Publisher Kalani Rosell.&lt;ref name= "PRnewswire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newsrx-expands-team-for-butter-launch---kalani-rosell-new-vp-business-development-300069451.html|title=NewsRx™ Expands Team for BUTTER™ Launch - Kalani Rosell New V.P. Business Development|first=NewsRx,|last=LLC|website=www.prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business development office opened in 2016 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], headed by Rosell.&lt;ref name= "siaa"/&gt;

== BUTTER ==
In 2015, NewsRx started BUTTER, which stands for Better Understanding Through Technology &amp; Emerging Research, a business intelligence and data analytics platform with emerging research and new discoveries.&lt;ref name="PRnewswire"/&gt; It has content for researchers, academics, and investors, using a New Discovery Index (NDI) that analyzes discoveries worldwide by quarter and new discoveries within specific topic areas.&lt;ref name= "Butter.business"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butterbusiness.com/BUTTERbusiness/#!about|title=NewsRx®|website=www.butterbusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BUTTER uses a search engine and publishes 10,000 new articles a day (11.4 million articles as of March, 2016).&lt;ref name="PRnewswire"/&gt;

BUTTER’s platform creates content 30 minutes after stock markets close, monitoring all market movements, new SEC and patent filings, trademarks, and financial and investment decisions.&lt;ref name= "siaa"/&gt;

==Editors==

Throughout most of its operating history, the NewsRx staff included board-certified medical editors with bachelor's degrees in journalism or related fields and experience in writing and editing.&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt; NewsRx editors condense news so that each article is less than 1000 words, while including key sentences of the original report and full bibliographic references and citations to original source material.&lt;ref name="CW Quietly Built"/&gt;

==Controversies==

NewsRx is staffed by journalists rather than medical professionals.&lt;ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reading All About It"&gt;Fernandes, Manuela. "Reading All About It: Newsletters growing in number, but not all information is reliable." ''Atlanta Journal''. August 16, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;    At the company’s beginnings, ''Newsweek'' magazine commented that ''AIDS Weekly'', as a non-government entity, should not be reporting on topics that included policy, research, and statistics that some{{who|date=October 2015}} considered exclusive to the government.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;   The head of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) AIDS task force at the time was misquoted as stating that he disagreed with having the CDC name associated with the newsweekly.&lt;ref name="Source of News"/&gt;  On the contrary, every issue of the ''CDC AIDS Weekly'' included an advisory caption, “…not sponsored by, endorsed by, affiliated with, or officially connected with the CDC.”&lt;ref name="Source of News"/&gt;   Other staffers within the CDC supported NewsRx’s view to bring AIDS awareness to the public eye.&lt;ref name="Source of News"/&gt;   The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that ''AIDS Weekly'' was a necessary “watchdog” publication providing needed information to the public.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;   Other articles appeared supporting NewsRx in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]'', for what they said to be its impact in AIDS awareness and investigative journalism.&lt;ref name="Anniversary Book"/&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}

CW Henderson’s role as executive editor at the firm was discussed in an article in ''Editor and Publisher'', focusing on the influence of pharmaceutical companies on news publications.&lt;ref name="Mice and Men"&gt;Nicholson, Joe. "Of Mice &amp; Men: Is there too much hype in media's medical stories?." ''Editor and Publisher''. October 3, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Henderson opposed pharmaceutical company influence on reporters as well as premature reporting of experiments.&lt;ref name="Mice and Men"/&gt;
 
The firm was also involved with ''The New York Times'' in controversial breaking news about AIDS studies that had purposely been tampered with at the CDC.&lt;ref name="Tampering"&gt;Schneider, Keith. "Tampering Uncovered at AIDS Research Lab." ''The New York Times'' p.1 September 17, 1986 https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/17/us/tampering-uncovered-at-aids-research-lab.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On at least 5 occasions, research on the causes of AIDS and other viral diseases might have been tampered with.&lt;ref name="Tampering"/&gt;   ''CDC AIDS Weekly'' published an internal CDC memorandum on the incident.&lt;ref name="Tampering"/&gt;

In 2010, the firm's VerticalNews China was the subject of a [[denial of service attack]] that originated from China as a result of controversial news reported.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Kelly. "More Victims of Chinese Hacking Attacks Come Forward." ''Dark Reading''. January 14, 2010 http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/attacks/222301032&lt;/ref&gt;  The attack was halted when the company’s IP service identified the source and blocked it.&lt;ref&gt;"NewsRx; China News from U.S. Hit by Denial of Service Cyber Attack Originating from China." ''Wall Street Journal Professional Edition with Factiva''. January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
In 2011, the firm partnered with [[ScholarlyMedia]]’s [[ScholarlyEditions]] imprint, publishing 4,000 reference books, which replaced the EncyK line.&lt;ref name="ScholarlyEditions Brochure"/&gt; The president of NewsRx is also president of ScholarlyMedia.&lt;ref name="ScholarlyMedia"&gt;"ScholarlyEditions." ''ScholarlyEditions''. ScholarlyMedia, 2011. http://www.scholarlyeditions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  The company’s book imprint is ScholarlyEditions, and its peer reviewed news service is ScholarlyNews.&lt;ref name="ScholarlyMedia"/&gt;

[[File:Cat eyes rheum 001.jpg|thumb|right|Rheum in a cat's eyes]]
'''Rheum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|uː|m}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]]: [[wikt:ῥεῦμα|ῥεῦμα]] ''rheuma'' "a flowing, rheum"), also known as '''gound''', is thin mucus naturally discharged from the [[Human eye|eye]]s, [[Human nose|nose]], or [[mouth]] during sleep (cf. [[mucopurulent discharge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=Rheum (discharge)  | url=http://www.memidex.com/rheum+discharge | encyclopedia=Memidex Dictionary/Thesaurus | date=2009 | accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amodio families.com"&gt;Amodio, Aimee.[http://health.families.com/blog/where-do-eye-boogers-come-from "Where Do Eye Boogers Come From?"], Families.com blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hiskey&gt;Hiskey, Daven. [http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/02/what-the-sleep-in-your-eyes-is/ "What the 'Sleep' In Your Eyes Is"], ''Today I Found Out'', 23 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Rheum dries and gathers as a crust in the corners of the eyes or the mouth, on the eyelids, or under the nose.&lt;ref name=hiskey /&gt; It is formed by a combination of [[mucus]] (in the case of the eyes, consisting of [[mucin]] discharged from the [[cornea]] or the [[Conjuctiva|conjunctiva]]), nasal mucus, [[blood cell]]s, [[Skin|skin cell]]s, or dust. Rheum from the eyes is particularly common. Dried rheum is commonly called '''sleep''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920687-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''sleepy-seeds''',&lt;ref name="partridge"/&gt; '''sleepy buds''',&lt;ref name="partridge"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ed., ''A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', 8th edition, 1984, ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; '''sleepy sand''', '''sleepers''', '''eye goop''', '''cheese''', '''eye boogers''', '''eye wappies''', or '''sleepy dust'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/are-yours-crusty-or-wet-truth-behind-eye-boogers-ew-f1C6437167&lt;/ref&gt;

When the individual is awake, blinking of the eyelid causes rheum to be washed away with tears via the [[nasolacrimal duct]]. The absence of this action during sleep, however, results in a small amount of dry rheum accumulating in corners of the eye, most notably in children.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

A number of conditions can increase the production of rheum in the eye.  In the case of [[allergic conjunctivitis]], the buildup of rheum can be considerable, many times preventing the sufferer from opening the eye upon waking without prior cleansing of the eye area.  The presence of [[pus]] in an instance of heavy rheum buildup can indicate [[dry eye]] or conjunctivitis, among other infections.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

In infants, the [[tear duct]]s (that drain the tears) occasionally fail to open, resulting in the overflow of tears onto the cheeks ([[Epiphora (medical)|epiphora]]) and rheum deposition on the surrounding skin.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Until his death, Levins was a university professor at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] and a long-time [[activism|political activist]]. He was best known for his work on [[evolution]] and complexity in changing [[ecosystem|environments]] and on [[metapopulation]]s.

Levins' [[Writing style|writing]] and [[Public speaking|speaking]] is extremely condensed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This, combined with his [[Marxism]], has made his analyses less well-known than those of some other ecologists and [[evolutionists]] who were adept at [[Popularity|popularization]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} One story of his [[Chicago]] years is that, in order to understand his lectures, his graduate students each needed to attend Levins' courses three times: the first time to acclimate themselves to the speed of his delivery and the difficulty of his [[mathematics]]; the second to get the basic ideas down; and the third to pick up his subtleties and profundities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Levins also had written on philosophical issues in [[biology]] and [[scientific modelling|modelling]]. One of his influential articles is "The Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology". He has influenced a number of contemporary [[philosophers]] of biology.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Levins often boasted publicly that he was a 'fourth generation [[Marxist]]' and often had said that the methodology in his ''Evolution in Changing Environments'' was based upon the introduction to [[Marx]]'s ''[[Grundrisse]]'', the rough draft of ''[[Das Kapital]]''. With the evolutionary geneticist [[Richard Lewontin]], Levins had written a number of articles on methodology, philosophy, and social implications of biology. Many of these are collected in ''[[The Dialectical Biologist]]''. In 2007, the duo published a second thematic collection of essays titled ''Biology Under the Influence: Dialectical Essays on Ecology, Agriculture, and Health''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Under-Influence-Dialectical-agriculture/dp/1583671579 Lewontin, R., and Levins, R. 2007 (November 1).

Also with [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]], Levins had co-authored a number of satirical articles criticizing [[sociobiology]], [[systems modeling]] in [[ecology]], and other topics under the [[pseudonym]] [[Isadore Nabi]]. Levins and [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] managed to place a ridiculous biography of Nabi and his achievements in ''American Men of Science'', thereby showing how little editorial care and fact-checking work went on in that respected reference work.

==Biography==
Richard Levins was of Ukrainian Jewish heritage and was born  on June 1, 1930, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurora Levins Morales Blog: http://www.AuroraLevinsMorales.com/blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded reminiscences of his politically and scientifically precocious childhood in an article in [[Red Diapers: Growing Up in the Communist Left|''Red Diapers'']]. He reportedly had read [[Paul de Kruif]]'s Microbe Hunters (1926) at age 8 (in 1938) and his first of [[Charles Darwin]]'s books at age 12 (in 1942). At the age of 10, Levins had been inspired by the essays of the Marxist biological polymath [[J. B. S. Haldane]], whom Levins considers to be the equal of [[Albert Einstein]] in scientific importance.

Levins studied [[agriculture]] and mathematics at [[Cornell University|Cornell]]. He married Puerto Rican writer [[Rosario Morales]] in 1950.  Blacklisted on his graduation from Cornell, he and Rosario moved to [[Puerto Rico]], where they farmed and did rural organizing. They returned to New York in 1956, where he earned his PhD at [[Columbia University]] (awarded 1965). Levins taught at the [[University of Puerto Rico]] from 1961 to 1967 and was a prominent member of the Puerto Rican independence movement.  He visited [[Cuba]] for the first time in 1964, beginning a lifelong scientific and political collaboration with Cuban biologists. His active participation in the [[Puerto Rican independence|independence]] and [[anti-war movements]] in Puerto Rico led to his being denied tenure at the University of Puerto Rico, and in 1967 he and Rosario and their three children - [[Aurora Levins Morales|Aurora]],&lt;ref name="cengage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/contemporary/morales_au.html|title=Heath Anthology of American LiteratureAurora Levins Morales - Author Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo,&lt;ref name="rlmartstudio.com"/&gt; and Alejandro&lt;ref name="linkedin.com"/&gt; - moved to Chicago, where he taught at the University of Chicago and constantly interacted with [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]].  Both Richard and Rosario later moved to [[Harvard]] with the sponsorship of [[E. O. Wilson]], with whom they had later disputes over [[sociobiology]]. Levins was elected member of the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] but resigned because of the Academy's role in advising the US military during the war. He had been a member of the US and Puerto Rican Communist Parties, the Movimiento Pro Independencia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capaprieto.tripod.com/id12.html|title=Historia del Movimiento Pro Independencia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/01/28/americas-summit-sans-united-states-venezuela-argentina-to-push-for-puerto-rican/|title=Americas Summit Sans United States: Venezuela, Argentina To Push For Puerto Rican Independence|work=Fox News Latino}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico]]), and the [[Puerto Rican Socialist Party]], and he was on an [[List of Americans under surveillance|FBI surveillance list]].

Until his death, Levins was John Rock Professor of Population Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/8124728|title=John Rock Professor of Population Sciences - Harvard Catalyst Profiles - Harvard Catalyst|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140903121746/https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/8124728|archivedate=2014-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and head of the Human Ecology program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/stephen-jay-gould-what-does-it-mean-be-radical|title=Stephen Jay Gould: What Does it Mean to Be a Radical?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalhealth.harvard.edu/course/human-ecology Human Ecology, Course #: GHP253-01, basic course in the HSPH Program in Human Ecology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911221256/http://globalhealth.harvard.edu/course/human-ecology |date=2014-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/global-health-and-population/ Department of Global Health and Population] of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/richard-levins/|title=Home - Richard Levins - Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Levins and others formed the Harvard Working Group on New and Resurgent Diseases. Their work showed that alarming new infections had sprung from changes in the environment, either natural or caused by humans (Wilson et al. 1994).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.1994.740.issue-1/issuetoc Wilson, M.E., Levins, R., Spielman, A. (eds). 1994. Disease in Evolution: Global Changes and Emergence of Infectious Diseases. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Series. Volume 740. New York Academy of Sciences, New York, NY.  Accessed 1/22/2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his final two decades, Levins had concentrated on application of [[ecology]] to [[agriculture]], particularly in the economically less-well-developed nations of this planet.  As a member of the OXFAM-America Board of Directors and former chair of their subcommittee on Latin America and the Caribbean, Richard Levins worked from a critique of the industrial-commercial pathway of development and promoted alternative development pathways which focused attention upon (a) economic viability with (b) population equity, (c) ecological and social sustainability, and (d) empowerment of the dispossessed.

When his wife Rosario died in 2011, his [[Aurora Levins Morales|daughter Aurora]] moved in with her father in his [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] home.

One of Levins's grandchildren is [[Minneapolis]]-based hip hop artist [[Manny Phesto]].&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Kyle "New Local Music" [http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/blog/kyle-tran-myhre/new-local-music-manny-phesto-kraydio-psymun-medium-zach-lioness-and-more MN Daily Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Eric "Top 10 Must See Music Videos This Week" retrieved (8/4/15) [http://www.citypages.com/music/top-10-must-see-minnesota-music-videos-this-week-6638302 City Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levins died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], on January 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/in-memoriam-richard-levins-ecologist-biomathematician-and-philosopher-of-science/ In memoriam: Richard Levins, ecologist, biomathematician, and philosopher of science, Harvard Chan School faculty memorial announcement, January 22, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rdln.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/richard-levins-1930-2016/ Richard Levins, 1930-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution in changing environments==
{{About|the oceanic phenomenon|the electrical signaling schemes|Current loop|the network analysis variable|loop current}}

[[File:Loop current2.jpg|thumb|A Map of the Loop Current]]
Prior to Levins' work, [[population genetics]] had assumed the environment to be constant, while [[mathematical ecology]] assumed the genetic makeup of the species involved to be constant. Levins modelled the situation in which evolution is taking place while the environment changes. One of the surprising consequences of his model is that selection need not maximize adaptation, and that species can select themselves to extinction. He encapsulated his major early results in ''Evolution in Changing Environments'', a book based on lectures he delivered in Cuba in the early 1960s. Levins made extensive use of mathematics, some of which he invented himself, although it had been previously developed in other areas of pure mathematics or economics without his awareness of it. For instance, Levins makes extensive use of [[convex set]] theory for fitness sets, (resembling the economic formulations of [[J. R. Hicks]]) and extends [[Sewall Wright]]'s path analysis to the analysis of [[Causal loop diagram|causal feedback loops]].

==Metapopulation theory==
[[File:Complex_adaptive_system.svg|thumb|right]]
The term [[metapopulation]] was coined by Levins in 1969 to describe a "population of populations".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{citation | last = Levins | first = R. | year = 1969 | title = Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control | journal = Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America | volume = 15 | pages = 237–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Populations inhabit a landscape of suitable habitat patches, each capable of hosting a local sub-population. Local populations may become extinct and be subsequently recolonized by immigration from patches; the fate of such a system of local populations (i.e., the metapopulation) depends on the balance between extinctions and colonizations. Levins introduced a model consisting of a single [[differential equation]], nowadays known as [[Metapopulation#The Levins model|the Levins model]], to describe the dynamics of average patch occupancy in such systems. Metapopulation theory has since become an important area of spatial ecology, with applications in conservation biology, population management, and pest control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology, genetics, and evolution of metapopulations |last1=Hanski |first1=Ilkka (ed.) |authorlink=Ilkka Hanski |last2=Gaggiotti |first2=Oscar E.

==Quotations==
* "The world is stranger than we can imagine and surprises are inevitable in science. Thus we found, for example, that pesticides increase pests, antibiotics can create pathogens, agricultural development creates hunger, and flood control leads to flooding.  But some of these surprises could have been avoided if the problems had been posed big enough to accommodate solutions in the context of the whole."   -  Dr. Richard Levins

The '''RoughRider''' [[wheelchair]] is a low-cost, durable and [[appropriate technology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.web.media.mit.edu Smith, Amy, 2001 in "Design that Matters"], Feb, 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; wheelchair designed for use in developing countries.  The design of the RoughRider originally was [[open-source]] and has been revised with input from wheelchair users in over 40 countries since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, R. 1985," Independence through Mobility" A Guide to the Manufacture of the ATI-Hotchkiss Wheelchair, published by Appropriate Technology International, Wash. D.C. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The RoughRider was created to fill the demand for a reliable wheelchair for over 20 million disabled people in the developing world who need a wheelchair and do not have one.&lt;ref&gt;Perlman,J, Cooper, R.A. and McCartney, M.(2006) "Towards the development of an effective technology transfer model of wheelchairs to developing countries" ''Disability and Rehabilitation'': Assistive Technology 1(1-2) 103-110, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest recorded history of a wheelchair was inscribed in stone on a Chinese [[Sarcophagus]] in the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R.A. 1998, "Wheelchair Selection and Configuration", pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been many variations on the basic design since then but standard features always included rear wheels, front caster wheels, footrests, side frames and seating features.  Until recently wheelchairs were designed for relatively smooth surfaces and paved streets and were not designed for rugged environments. Thirty years ago, [[Ralf Hotchkiss]], an engineer with [[paraplegia]] and a frequent traveler to developing countries, saw the need for a high quality and rugged chair that could withstand conditions in rough terrain.  He began a thirty year process of collaborative design using locally available parts with a cost low enough to be affordable to disabled persons in developing regions.&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss,R. Independence through Mobility&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, Ralf and a team would travel to small machine shops in developing countries to teach the  technical skills necessary for local production of the RoughRider model.  Several of these shops are developing to scale in parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union.

==Design features==
RoughRider functional design features include: low armrests to enable easy lateral transfers from chair to other surfaces, [[Pneumatic]] rear tires which are replaceable in bicycle shops worldwide, and adjustable rear wheel position which optimizes mechanical stability and performance for riders of different abilities.  The design includes a long wheelbase with extra-wide front caster wheels that fit under the footrests and prevents tipping forward and is easier to push than standard wheelchair models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whirlwindwheelchair.org |title=Whirlwind Wheelchair International - Home |publisher=Whirlwindwheelchair.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extra wide "Zimbabwe" caster wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardware21.com |title=Hardware Directory: DIY Manufacturers &amp; Suppliers, Building Hardware, Hardware Tools, Hardware Supplies |publisher=Hardware21.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a smooth ride over rough ground surfaces while still being able to "float" over soft surfaces like sand without getting stuck.  The foldable X-brace allows for storage and transport and allows the seat width to be adjustable.&lt;ref&gt;Pilloton, Emily 2009,Design Revolution:100 products that empower people, pg 210&lt;/ref&gt; Additional modifications to shorten or lengthen the seat depth and back height are accomplished by adding foam cushions under or behind the [[wheelchair cushion|seat cushion]].  Footrest adjustments are made by loosening one bolt on the footrest arm.

==Problems and future design improvements==
Due to the 7/8" steel tubing used for the sideframes, chosen for low cost and universal availability, the RoughRider weighs about 40&amp;nbsp;lbs which may be too heavy for some newly injured riders to navigate up steep hills.  The RoughRider does not have an anti-tip bar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novita.org.au/library/Factsheet-anti-tip_bars ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016094635/http://www.novita.org.au/library/Factsheet-anti-tip_bars |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would make the rider safer during a backwards [[wheelie]] and has only recently added wheelguards that reduce mud and water splatter on the rider.  Both of these features is currently under development.  There is also a need for a rugged active chair for disabled children in developing countries and a child's version of the RoughRider is currently being tested in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whirlwindwheelchair.org |title=Whirlwind Wheelchair International - Home |publisher=Whirlwindwheelchair.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scent hounds''' (or '''scenthounds''') are a [[Dog type|type]] of [[hound]] that primarily hunts by [[scent]] rather than [[visual perception|sight]]. These [[Dog breed|breeds]] are [[hunting dog]]s and are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive [[noses]] among [[Dog|canines]].

Hounds are hunting dogs that either hunt by following the scent of a game animal (''scenthounds'') or by following the animal by sight (sighthounds). There are many breeds in the ''scenthound type'', and scenthounds may do other work as well, so exactly which breeds should be called ''scenthound'' can be controversial. Kennel clubs assign breeds of dogs to ''Groups'', which are loosely based on breed ''types''. Each kennel club determines which breeds it will place in a given group.

Scent hounds specialize in following a smell or scent. Most of these breeds have long, drooping ears. One theory says that this trait helps to collect scent from the air and keep it near the dog's face and nose. They also have large nasal cavities, which helps them smell better. Their typically loose, moist lips are said to assist in trapping scent particles.

Most of these breeds have deep, booming voices and use them actively when running, and especially when following a [[scent trail]]. Although this can be a nuisance in settled areas, it is a valuable trait that allows the dog's handler to follow the dog or pack of dogs during a hunt even when they are out of sight, such as when following a [[Fox hunting|fox]] or [[raccoon]] through woodland.

Scent hounds do not need to be as fast as [[sight hound]]s, because they do not need to keep prey in sight, but they need endurance so that they can stick with a scent and follow it for long distances over rough terrain. The best scent hounds can follow a scent trail even across running water and even when it is several days old. Most scent hounds are used for hunting in packs of multiple dogs. Longer-legged hounds run more quickly and usually require that the hunters follow on horseback; shorter-legged hounds allow hunters to follow on foot. Hunting with some breeds, such as [[German Bracke]], [[American Foxhound]]s, or [[coonhound]]s, involves allowing the pack of dogs to run freely while the hunters wait in a fixed spot until the dogs' baying announces that the game has been "treed". The hunters then go to the spot on foot, following the sound of the dogs' baying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/tv/columns/story?columnist=sutton_keith&amp;page=g_col_Sutton_case-for-coon-hunting Coon hunting on ESPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (FCI) places scent hounds into their classification "Group 6". This includes a subdivision, "Section 2, Leash Hounds", some examples of which are the [[Bavarian Mountain Scenthound]] (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217), the [[Hanoverian Scenthound]] (Hannover'scher Schweisshund, no. 213), and the [[Alpine Dachsbracke]] (Alpenländische Dachsbracke, no. 254). In addition, the [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] and the [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]] are placed in Group 6 as "Related breeds".

The [[United Kennel Club]] divides its [[Scenthound Group]] into two categories. The first, Tree Hounds, includes the American hunting dogs known as [[coonhound]]s and the European hounds from which they were developed. The second category is named Trailing Scenthounds, and includes dogs used for the [[Tracking (dog)|tracking]] of [[game animals]], and of humans (as in [[Search and rescue dog|search-and-rescue]], and [[fugitive]] capture). They are also used for [[explosives detection]]. The Trailing group are reputedly descended from a type of [[bloodhound]] kept by monks in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/LrnBreedInfo United Kennel Club (US) breed information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103093417/http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/LrnBreedInfo |date=2011-01-03 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic history ==
Genetic studies indicate that the scent hounds are more closely related to each other than they do with other branches on the dog family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=vonHoldt|first=Bridgett M. |author2=John P.

== United Kennel Club Scenthound Group ==

The  ''Scenthound Group'' is the group category used by the [[United Kennel Club]] (US), which it divides into two categories. The first includes the American hunting dogs known as [[coonhound]]s and the European hounds from which they were developed. These are referred to as Tree Hounds. The category also includes [[cur]]s, American dogs bred for hunting bears, feral pigs, and similar large game. The second category is referred to as trailing scenthounds, and includes dogs used for tracking of humans, reputedly descended from the St. Hubert Hounds (ancestor of today's [[Bloodhound]] breed) kept by monks in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/LrnBreedInfo United Kennel Club (US) breed information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103093417/http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/LrnBreedInfo |date=2011-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other registries ==
This article only covers the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, but there are national clubs in many countries where many of these breeds may also be listed in similar or other Breed Groups.

Many of the regional breeds recognised by the United Kennel Club are very few in number in the United States. As a US-based club they have specialised in the registry of North American breeds, especially hunting and working/utility dogs. The United Kennel Club also lists internationally recognised (Fédération Cynologique Internationale) breeds that are few in number outside their native areas. Many of these are called [[Rare breed (dog)|rare breeds]] in the United States, and breeders and dog owners may register their dogs with any of the very large number of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses, in order to participate in the club's or business' activities. For breeds not yet recognised by one of the major kennel clubs, there are usually numerous competing breed clubs for each individual breed.

== Not recognised ==
A breed that is not recognised by a kennel club means that it has not been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. It does not mean that the breed is not a breed. A kennel club usually requires a breed to have a large enough breed club to warrant the training of judges for the breed, as well as a specific amount of documentation, to accept a breed.

On 3 November 2009, Singapore General Hospital and SingHealth Group launched the inaugural issue of Singapore Health – a newspaper reporting on health-related matters affecting Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sgh.com.sg/about-us/newsroom/news-release/2009/Pages/SGH-and-SingHealth-launch-Singapore%E2%80%99s-first-bilingual-health-newspaper,-Singapore-Health-20091103.aspx|title=SGH and SingHealth launch Singapore's first bilingual health newspaper, Singapore Health - Singapore General Hospital|website=www.sgh.com.sg|access-date=2017-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926090117/https://www.sgh.com.sg/about-us/newsroom/news-release/2009/Pages/SGH-and-SingHealth-launch-Singapore%E2%80%99s-first-bilingual-health-newspaper,-Singapore-Health-20091103.aspx|archive-date=2018-09-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khalik|first=Salma|title=New alliance boosts quality of health care in the east|url=http://www.easternhealth.sg/EasternHealthAlliance/downloads/20111118-TheStraitsTimes.jpg|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2011, Changi General Hospital left SingHealth and formed the [[Eastern Health Alliance]] along with St. Andrew’s Community Hospital, SingHealth Polyclinics and The Salvation Army Peacehaven Nursing Home.&lt;ref name="Yong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressRoom/speeches_d/2011/speech_by_mr_gankimyongministerforhealthattheofficiallaunchofthe.html|title=Speech by Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Health, at the Official Launch of the Eastern Health Alliance, Friday, 18 November 2011, 10.30am|last=Yong|first=Gan Kim|date=18 November 2011|publisher=MOH Media|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2017, SingHealth announced that it would be merging with the Eastern Health Alliance, bringing [[Changi General Hospital]] back into the SingHealth cluster.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.singhealth.com.sg/TomorrowsMed/Article/Pages/singhealth-eha-public-healthcare-restructuring.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==
=== Data breach ===
Between 27 June and 4 July 2018, the personal particulars of 1.5 million SingHealth patients, and records of outpatient dispensed medicines for 160,000 of those patients, were stolen in a [[cyberattack]]. The names, [[National Registration Identity Card|NRIC numbers]], addresses, dates of birth, race, and gender of patients who visited specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics between 1 May 2015 and 4 July 2018 were maliciously accessed and copied. Information relating to patient diagnosis, test results and doctors' notes were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most|title=Personal info of 1.5m SingHealth patients, including PM Lee, stolen in Singapore's worst cyber attack|access-date=2018-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822080833/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most|archive-date=2018-08-22|dead-url=no|df=|date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] was specifically targeted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-health-system-hit-serious-cyberattack-pm-lee-target-10548318|title=Singapore health system hit by 'most serious breach of personal data' in cyberattack; PM Lee's data targeted|last=Kwang|first=Kevin|date=2018-07-20|website=Channel NewsAsia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726060044/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-health-system-hit-serious-cyberattack-pm-lee-target-10548318|archive-date=2018-07-26|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Discovery and investigation ====
The database administrators for the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHIS), the public healthcare IT provider, detected unusual activity on one of SingHealth’s IT databases on 4 July, and implemented precautions against further intrusions. Network traffic monitoring was enhanced; additional malicious activity was detected after 4 July, but did not result in the theft of any data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having ascertained that a cyberattack occurred, administrators notified the ministries and involved the [[Cyber Security Agency (Singapore)|Cyber Security Agency]] (CSA) on 10 July to carry out forensic investigations. The agency determined that perpetrators gained privileged access to the IT network by compromising a front-end workstation, and obtained login credentials to assess the database, while hiding their [[Digital footprint|digital footprints]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hackers stole data of PM Lee and 1.5 million patients in 'major cyberattack' on SingHealth |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/hackers-stole-medical-data-pm-lee-and-15-million-patients-major-cyber-attack-singhealth |work=TODAYonline |date=20 July 2018 |access-date=2018-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721121130/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/hackers-stole-medical-data-pm-lee-and-15-million-patients-major-cyber-attack-singhealth |archive-date=2018-07-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the attack was made public in a statement released by the [[Ministry of Communications and Information]] and [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]] on 20 July.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ten-day delay between the discovery of the attack and the public announcement was attributed to time needed to fortify the IT systems, conduct preliminary investigations, identify affected patients and prepare the logistics of the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ministers-answers|title=Ministers' answers|last=Baharudin|first=Hariz|date=2018-08-07|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023234/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ministers-answers|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text messages were subsequently sent to patients whose data was affected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In Parliament, S. Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information, attributed the attack to sophisticated state-linked actors who wrote customized [[malware]] to circumvent SingHealth's antivirus and security tools. Iswaran did not name any state, in the interest of national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/08/06/world/asia/ap-as-singapore-cyberattack.html|title=Singapore Minister: Major Cyberattack May Be State-Linked|last=|first=|date=2018-08-06|work=The Associated Press|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023254/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/08/06/world/asia/ap-as-singapore-cyberattack.html|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Committee of Inquiry was convened to investigate the causes of the attack and identify measures to help prevent similar attacks. The four-member committee is chaired by former chief district judge Richard Magnus, and comprise leaders of a cyber-security firm, a healthcare technology firm and the [[National Trades Union Congress]] respectively. The committee called on the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General's Chambers]] to lead evidence, and the Attorney-General's Chambers appointed the Cyber Security Agency to lead the investigations with the support of the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Singapore)|Criminal Investigation Department]]. The committee will hold closed-door and public hearings from 28 August, and will receive public submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coi-hearings-on-singhealth-cyber-attack-from-aug-28|title=COI hearings on SingHealth cyber attack from Aug 28|last=Baharudin|first=Hariz|date=2018-08-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023337/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coi-hearings-on-singhealth-cyber-attack-from-aug-28|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aftermath ====
Following the cyberattack, Internet access was temporarily [[Air gap (networking)|removed]] from all public healthcare IT terminals with access to the healthcare network, and additional system monitoring and controls were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-internet-surfing-delinked-all-public-10555094|title=SingHealth cyberattack: Internet surfing delinked at all public healthcare clusters|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023401/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singhealth-cyberattack-internet-surfing-delinked-all-public-10555094|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack led to a two-week pause in Singapore's [[Smart Nation]] initiatives and a review of the public sector's cyber-security policies during that time. The review resulted in implementation of additional security measures, and urged public sector administrators to remove Internet access where possible and to use secure [[Information Exchange Gateway|information exchange gateways]] otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singhealth-cyber-attack-pause-on-smart-nation-projects-lifted-11-critical-sectors-told-to|title=SingHealth cyber attack: Pause on Smart Nation projects lifted; 11 critical sectors told to review untrusted external connections|last=Tham|first=Irene|date=2018-08-03|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023348/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singhealth-cyber-attack-pause-on-smart-nation-projects-lifted-11-critical-sectors-told-to|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack also renewed concerns among some healthcare practitioners regarding ongoing efforts to centralize electronic patient data in Singapore. Plans to pass laws in late 2018 making it compulsory for healthcare providers to submit data regarding patient visits and diagnoses to the National Electronic Health Record system were postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/doctors-raise-concerns-again-over-national-e-records-system-after-data-breach-singhealth|title=Doctors raise concerns again over national e-records system after data breach at SingHealth|last=Wong|first=Pei Ting|date=2018-07-23|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023232/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/doctors-raise-concerns-again-over-national-e-records-system-after-data-breach-singhealth|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of studies on sleep creativity have shown that sleep can facilitate insightful behavior and flexible reasoning, and there are several hypotheses about the creative function of dreams. On the other hand, a few recent studies have supported a theory of creative insomnia, in which creativity is significantly correlated with sleep disturbance.

==Anecdotal accounts of sleep and creativity==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
* [[Jack Nicklaus]] had a dream that allowed him to correct his golf swing.
* German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] stated that the idea for the ring structure of [[benzene]] came to him in a day-dream, in which he saw snakes biting their own tails. This story has been disputed.
* [[Jasper Johns]] was inspired to paint his first flag painting as a result of a dream.
* [[Aphex Twin]] wrote much of the music on his album ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'' by going to sleep in the studio, and then recreating the sounds he heard in dreams as soon as he woke up.
* [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] came up with the plot of ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' during a dream.
* [[Paul McCartney]] discovered the tune for the song "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" in a dream and was inspired to write "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" during [[hypnagogia]].
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' was inspired by a dream at [[Lord Byron]]'s villa.
* British poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote "[[Kubla Khan]]" after finding inspiration from an opium induced dream. 
* [[Otto Loewi]], a German physiologist, won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1936 for his work on the chemical transmission of nerve impulses. He discovered in a dream how to prove his theory.
* [[Giuseppe Tartini]], a composer, gained inspiration for his Devil's Trill Sonata in a dream where the Devil appeared to him and played the melody on Tartini's violin. 
* An alternate interpretation of [[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]] considers [[Francisco Goya]]'s commitment to the creative process and the Romantic spirit—the unleashing of imagination, emotions, and even nightmares as made possible by the unconscious.

==Sleep and creativity studies==

===REM sleep as a state of increased cognitive flexibility===
In a study on cognitive flexibility across the sleep-wake cycle, researchers discovered that when woken from [[REM sleep]], participants had a 32% advantage on an [[anagram]] task (when compared with the number of correct responses after [[NREM]] awakenings).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P.; Liston, C.; Allan Hobson, J.; Stickgold, R. (2002) Cognitive flexibility across the sleep-wake cycle: REM-sleep enhancement of anagram problem solving. ''Cognitive Brain Research'' 14, 317–324&lt;/ref&gt; This was consistent with the hypothesis that due to the lack of aminergic dominance in REM sleep, this particular sleep state is highly conducive to fluid reasoning and flexible thought. Participant performance after awakening from REM sleep was not better than participants who stayed awake, which indicates that in REM sleep, there is an alternative (but just as effective) mode of problem solving that differs from the mechanism available while awake.

===Sleep facilitates insight===
Participants in a study were asked to translate a string of digits using two simple rules that allowed the string to be reduced to a single digit (number reduction task). Out of three groups of participants (those who slept, those who stayed awake during the day, and those who stayed awake during the night), participants who got eight hours of sleep were two times as likely during retesting to gain insight into a hidden rule built into the task.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, U.; Gals, S.; Halder, H.; Verleger, R.; Born, J. (2004) Sleep inspires insight. ''Nature'' 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of sleep impairs creativity===
Some participants in a study went 32 hours without sleep while the control participants slept normally. When tested on flexibility and originality on figural and verbal tests, the sleep-deprived participants had severe and persistent impairments in their performance.&lt;ref&gt;Home, J.A. (1988) Sleep loss and "divergent" thinking ability. ''Sleep: Journal of Sleep Research &amp; Sleep Medicine'' 11;6, pp. 528–536.&lt;/ref&gt;

===More creativity in humor while asleep===
Under hypnotic-induced sleep, participants were much more likely to produce paraphrases of jokes that they had heard before and to spontaneously create new jokes (when compared with their performance while awake).&lt;ref&gt;Dittborn, J.M. (1963) Creativity during suggested sleep. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'' 16:3, p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration of relational memory===
Recent studies have also shown that sleep not only helps consolidate memory, but also integrates relational memories. In one study, the participants were tested to see if sleep helped in this aspect (Ellenbogen et al., 2007, as cited in Walker, 2009). The subjects of the experiment were taught five "premise pairs", A&gt;B, B&gt;C, C&gt;D, and D&gt;E. They were not aware of the overall hierarchy, where A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;E. The subjects were split into 3 separate groups. The first group was tested 20 minutes after learning the pairs, the second was tested 12 hours later without sleep, and the third was tested 12 hours later with sleep in between. The groups were tested in both first degree pairs (A&gt;B, C&gt;D, etc.) and 2nd degree pairs (A&gt;C, B&gt;D, or C&gt;E). The results were that with the first degree pairs, the first group only performed at around chance levels, and the second and third groups had significantly better performances. With the 2nd degree pairs, the first group still performed at around chance levels, and the second group performed at about the same level as in the 1st degree pair test. However, the third group performed even better than before, gaining a 25% advantage over the group without sleep. The results of this study showed that sleep is a significant factor in integrating memories, or gaining the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M.P. "The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion." Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. 1156. (2009): 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative insomnia==
''Creative insomnia'' refers to the idea that [[insomnia]] can actually spark creativity.

===Anecdotal accounts of creative insomnia===
* [[Marcel Proust]] wrote most of his ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' (In Search of Lost Time) while staying awake in the night due to a chronic illness. In ''Sodome et Gomorrhe'', he suggests that "Un peu d'insomnie n'est pas inutile pour apprécier le sommeil, projeter quelque lumière dans cette nuit. [A little insomnia is useful for appreciating sleep, for projecting some light into this night.]"
* Film-maker [[Alan Berliner]] made a documentary on his lifelong insomnia and its complex role in his creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/wideawake/interview.html HBO: Wide Awake – Interviews&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Insomnia is almost an oasis in which those who have to think or suffer darkly take refuge." – [[Colette]]
* "It's at night, when perhaps we should be dreaming, that the mind is most clear, that we are most able to hold all our life in the palm of our skull. I don't know if anyone has ever pointed out that great attraction of insomnia before, but it is so; the night seems to release a little more of our vast backward inheritance of instincts and feelings; as with the dawn, a little honey is allowed to ooze between the lips of the sandwich, a little of the stuff of dreams to drip into the waking mind. I wish I believed, as J. B. Priestley did, that consciousness continues after disembodiment or death, not forever, but for a long while. Three score years and ten is such a stingy ration of time, when there is so much time around. Perhaps that's why some of us are insomniacs; night is so precious that it would be pusillanimous to sleep all through it! A 'bad night' is not always a bad thing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotatio.com/a/aldiss-brian-w-quotes.html Brian W Aldiss Quotations Index: Quotes at Quotatio&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Brian W. Aldiss]]
* ''Acquainted with the Night: Insomnia Poems'' (edited by Lisa Russ Spaar) is a collection of over eighty poems by famous poets and writers like Walt Whitman, Emily Bronté and Robert Frost, all inspired by sleepless nights. Fifteen of the poems actually have "insomnia" in the title.
* "Si les insomnies d'un musicien lui font créer de belles oeuvres, ce sont de belles insomnies. [If the insomnia of a musician allows him to create beautiful pieces, it is a beautiful insomnia.]" – [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]
* [[Vladimir Nabokov]] believed that insomnia was a positive influence on his work. He once remarked that "sleep is the most moronic fraternity in the world, with the heaviest dues and the crudest rituals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotegarden.com/sleep.html Sleep Quotes, Sayings about Sleeping&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies that support creative insomnia===
Although no studies have actually shown a causal relationship yet, various studies have suggested that the positive relationship between sleep and creativity is more complicated and less clear-cut than previously thought.
* One study with children (ages 10–12) in New Zealand demonstrated a correlation between insomnia and creative thought. This study looked at the incidence of sleep disturbances in thirty ''highly creative children'' when compared with thirty ''control children''. The hypothesis was that there would be a higher incidence of sleep disturbance in the highly creative children than in the control children. Results showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups, with the creative children reporting more sleep disturbance, therefore suggesting that creative ability may indeed affect an individual's sleep patterns. More specifically, out of the sixty children tested on a standard creativity test, seventeen of the ''highly creative'' children indicated that they had higher levels of sleep disturbance (compared to only eight of the ''control'' children).&lt;ref&gt;Healey, D. and Runco, M. (2006). Could Creativity be Associated with Insomnia? ''Creativity Research Journal'' 18:1, 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In another study that examined the interactive relationships between sleep, fatigue, creativity and personality, participants were given the "Sleep Questionnaire", the "Fatigue Inventory", the "Remote Association Test" and the "Probabilistic Orientation Test". The researchers found that arousal measures of sleep and fatigue were meaningfully related to one another, but not to measures of thinking and of attitudinal orientations. Most importantly, they found that creativity was not significantly related to any of the dimensions of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan, S.; Vijayakumar, P.; Govindarasu, S. (1992). Subjective assessment of sleep, fatigue, creativity and personality orientation. ''Psychological Studies'' 37:1, 17–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies that reject creative insomnia===
* In a series of three studies that analyzed the link between creativity, dreams, and sleep behaviors, researchers discovered that: (1) participants who were classified as "fast sleepers" (those who fell asleep quickly) were more likely to score highly on a creativity test, (2) participants who scored highly on a creativity test were more likely to solve their problems through dreams and to fall asleep quickly, and (3) adults in creative occupations have significantly more dream distortion, visual mentation, and regressive dream content.&lt;ref&gt;Sladeczek, I. and Domino, G. (1985) Creativity, sleep and primary process thinking in dreams. ''Journal of Creative Behavior'' 19:1, pp. 38–46, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smoking Vapor''' is a United States company founded by Amir Hakak in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/amir-hakak#section-jobs&lt;/ref&gt; that manufacturers and internationally markets [[e-liquid]] [[vaporizer (inhalation device)|vaporizers]]. 

== History ==

The company started in 2008 as mostly a retail vape kiosk business. After the 2010 lawsuit that overturned the FDA’s blockade on e-cigs, Hakak went about designing and manufacturing cig-a-like products instead of just outsourcing from suppliers.&lt;ref name="b2bwholesalermag.com"/&gt; In 2013, Geoff bought half of the business and rebranded and restructured the business.

'''''The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom''''' is a 2006 [[psychology]] book by [[Jonathan Haidt]] written for a general audience.  In it, Haidt poses several "Great Ideas" on happiness espoused by thinkers of the past – [[Plato]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]] and others – and examines them in the light of contemporary psychological research, extracting from them any lessons that still apply to our modern lives. Central to the book are the concepts of virtue, [[happiness]], fulfillment, and meaning.

==Summary of chapters==

===Ch.0: Introduction:  Too much wisdom===
The Introduction first explains that the author's goal is to reduce the infinite 'wisdom' accessible to modern people into 10 great ideas, one per chapter.  The remainder of the Introduction provides a concise preview of those ten chapters as follows.  The first chapter describes how each person has two parts: the primitive part which includes our basic instincts and the highly evolved part which tries to control the instincts.  This effort to control our instincts is shown in Chapter Two to tend to cause us too much worry, but various techniques, such as meditation, might be employed to detach the worrier from his worries.  The Third Chapter goes to the relationship of the individual to other individuals by beginning with the [[Golden Rule]] of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.  That leads in the Fourth Chapter to a description of the tendency that people have of seeing faults in others more readily than in themselves, which by simply realizing we might go to some length to rectify and thus come closer to living by the Golden Rule.  By the Fifth Chapter, at the half-way point of the book, Haidt introduces the notion of the Happiness Hypothesis.  The Happiness Hypothesis could be that happiness comes from within, as [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] said, or could be that happiness comes from outside.  Haidt argues in Chapter Six that the truth might lie between the two extremes and contends that love depends on more than the self and is crucial to happiness.  The Seventh Chapter asks whether adversity is essential to happiness and provides a nuanced answer which is that it depends on your stage in life.  Achieving happiness is a complex process which includes acting virtuously, and Haidt claims in Chapter Eight that behaving virtuously means to do as [[Aristotle]] said and to develop your strengths and realize your native potential.  Chapter Nine extends the idea that a person's happiness benefits from living virtuously by noting that some feeling of divinity helps where divinity comes through a life-long practice of moral actions.  Chapter Ten takes this idea of a life-long practice yet further and contends that a happy life is one where you get the relationships right between yourself and others, yourself and your work, and between your work and something larger than yourself—you feel a sense of purpose.

===Ch.1: The divided self===
Haidt looks at a number of ways of dividing the self that have existed since ancient times:

*mind vs body
*left brain vs. right brain: ([[Lateralization of brain function|lateralisation of brain function]])
*old brain vs. new brain (frontal cortex)
*controlled vs. automatic

Haidt focuses on this last division, between the conscious/reasoned processes and automatic/implicit processes. His metaphor is a rider on the back of an elephant in which the conscious mind is the rider and the unconscious mind is the elephant. The rider is unable to control the elephant by force: this explains many puzzles about our mental life, particularly why we have such trouble with weakness of will. Learning how to train the elephant is the secret of self-improvement.

===Ch.2: Changing your mind===
The automatic emotional reactions of the "elephant" (affective [[Priming (psychology)|priming]]) guide us throughout our lives. People even tend to choose mates, and professions, whose names resemble their own. Though there is a [[Negativity bias|bias towards negativity]], some people are optimists and others pessimists.  Haidt discusses three ways of changing those automatic reactions: [[meditation]], [[cognitive therapy]], and [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] medications such as [[Prozac]].

Haidt naturally must make simplifications to present in a 300-page book as much of an overview of biology, psychology, philosophy, sociology, and medicine as he attempts.  However, in Chapter 2 he makes a risky oversimplification.  For starters, the approaches to reducing negativity are classified as meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and [[Fluoxetine|Prozac]].  However, those might better be broadly categorized as behavioral and physical interventions.   At that point, one would appreciate that physical interventions go well beyond Prozac or the class of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) of which Prozac is an instance.  For example, research has shown that [[benzodiazepine]] is a better drug for generalized anxiety disorders than SSRIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Gomez  | first = Angelina | last2 = Barthel| first2 = Abigail  | last3 = Hofmann | first3 = Stefan | title = Comparing the Efficacy of Benzodiazepines and Serotonergic Anti-Depressants for Adults with Generalized Anxiety Disorder:  A meta-analytic review | journal = Expert Opin Pharmacother . | volume = 19|  issue=8 | pages = 89–104 | year = 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   More generally, Haidt gives inadequate attention to adverse effects of pharmacologic treatments.  A meta-analytic review of 131 controlled trials done in the 21st century on 25,000 patients said,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Jakobsen | first = J | last2 = Katakam| first2 = K | last3 = Schou | first3 = A | last4 = Hellmuth | first4 = S |last5 = Stallknech | first5 = S | last6 = Leth-Moller | first6 = K | last7 = Iversen | first7 = M | last8= Banke | first8 = M | last9 = Iggiannguaq | first9 = J | last10 = Klingenberg| first10 = S | last11 = Krogh | first11 = J | last12 = Ebert | first12 = Sebastian |last13 = Timm | first13 = A | last14 = Lindschou | first14 = J | last15 = Gluud | first15 = C | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus placebo in patients with major depressive disorder. A systematic review with meta-analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 17|  issue=58 | pages = 1–28 | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "SSRIs might have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but all trials were at high risk of bias and the clinical significance seems questionable. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. The potential small beneficial effects seem to be outweighed by harmful effects."

===Ch.3: Reciprocity with a vengeance===
Many species have a social life, but among mammals, only humans in particular are ultra-social – able to live in very large cooperative groups. [[The Golden Rule]], supplemented with gossip, is the secret of our success. Calling on [[Robert Cialdini]]'s "six weapons of influence", Haidt describes ways in which understanding the deep workings of reciprocity can help to solve problems in our social lives and guard against the many ways that we can be manipulated.

===Ch.4: The faults of others===
Part of our ultra-sociality is that we are constantly trying to manipulate others' perceptions of ourselves, without realizing that we are doing so. As Jesus said, we see the faults of others clearly, but are blind to our own. ("Why do you see the speck in your neighbour's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?") Haidt looks at what [[social psychology]] has to say about this, beginning with the work of [[Daniel Batson]] on cheating and self-justification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.6.1335|last=Batson|first=D|author2=Kobrynowicz D |author3=Dinnerstein JL |author4=Kampf HC |author5=Wilson AD |title=In a very different voice: unmasking moral hypocrisy|journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |date=June 1997|volume=72|issue=6|pages=1335–48.|pmid=9177020}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]]'s description of our "constitutional ignorance" of hypocrisy'' in [[The Moral Animal]]'', and moving on to work by [[Deanna Kuhn]] and David Perkins on [[confirmation bias]] and Roy Baumeister's work on "The Myth of Pure Evil"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F. |title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company Inc |isbn=978-0-8050-7165-8|pages=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt then discusses ways of taking off "the moral glasses" and seeing the world as it really is.

===Ch.5: The pursuit of happiness===
It is a common idea that happiness comes from within and can't be found in external things. For a while in the 1990s, psychologists agreed with ancient sages (such as Buddha and [[Epictetus]]) that external conditions are not what matters. But Haidt argues that we now know that some external circumstances do matter. He identifies ways of improving happiness by altering these, including spending money well, and argues that the Western emphasis on action and striving is not without merit.

===Ch.6: Love and attachments===
[[File:5 steps to a happier life.jpg|thumb|5 Steps to a Happier Life: infographic based on ''The Happiness Hypothesis'']]
There are many kinds of love, but, Haidt asserts, they all begin to make sense when you see where love comes from, and what it does. To do this he examines [[John Bowlby]]'s [[World Health Organization]]-sponsored study and report, [[Maternal deprivation|"Maternal Care and Mental Health"]] in 1950, and the subsequent work with monkeys by [[Harry Harlow]]. Understanding the different kinds of love, he writes, can help explain why people make so many mistakes with love, and why philosophers hate love and give us bad advice about it.

===Ch.7: The uses of adversity===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] wrote, "What doesn't kill me makes me stronger", but this is not true for everyone; adversity may result in [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Haidt discusses how and why some people grow from their suffering, along with ways of improving one's chances of finding post-traumatic growth. Adversity at the right time in life, as [[Robert Sternberg]]'s research on wisdom shows, can make people more compassionate and better able to balance the needs of self and others.

===Ch.8: The felicity of virtue===
Taking [[Benjamin Franklin]] as an example, Haidt looks at how success can follow virtue, in the broad sense of virtue that goes back to the [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'', excellence. The ancients, according to Haidt, had a sophisticated psychological understanding of virtue, using [[Aphorism|maxims]], [[fables]] and role-models to train "the elephant", the automatic responses of the individual. Though the beginnings of Western virtue lie in [[Homer]], [[Aesop]] and the [[Old Testament]], the modern understanding of it has much to do with the arguments of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (the [[categorical imperative]]) and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] ([[utilitarianism]]). With these came a shift from character ethics to quandary ethics, from moral education to moral reasoning.

To address the question of how a common morality can be forged in a diverse society, Haidt turns to [[positive psychology]], specifically to 
[[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Peterson's work on [[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|virtues and strengths.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Christopher

  | title = Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification.
  | location = Oxford
  | isbn = 0-19-516701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ch.9: Divinity with or without God===
Using the metaphor of [[Flatland]], Haidt argues that the perception of sacredness and divinity are two basic features of the human mind; the emotions of disgust, moral elevation, and awe tell us about this dimension, but not everybody listens. The "[[Christian right|religious right]]" can only be understood by acknowledging this dimension, which most liberals and secular thinkers ignore or misunderstand.&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite web|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title= the moral roots of liberals and conservatives|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[William James]] and of [[Abraham Maslow]] (on "[[peak experience]]s") shows ways in which this dimension is also relevant to the non-religious.

===Ch.10: Happiness comes from between===
Haidt discusses "the meaning of life", making the distinction between a purpose ''for'' life and a purpose ''within'' life. Love and work give a sense of meaning to life. A study by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]], [[Howard Gardner]] and [[William Damon]]&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H., Csikszentmihalyi, M., and Damon, W. (2001) ''Good Work: When excellence and ethi''cs meet. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; established the concept of "vital engagement" which characterises work with the most sense of purpose.  "Cross-level coherence" within one's self and life is also vital, coherence between the physical, psychological and socio-cultural levels. Religion is an evolved mechanism for creating this coherence.

===Ch.11: On balance===
Haidt concludes by arguing that the ancient idea of [[Yin and Yang]] turns out to be the wisest idea of all. We need, he writes, the perspectives of ancient religion and modern science; of east and west; even of liberal and conservative. "Words of wisdom really do flood over us, but only by drawing from many sources can we become wise."

==Reception==
''The Happiness Hypothesis'' received positive reviews. [[Daniel Nettle]], reviewing the book in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', accepted its central premise of a "striking similarity between the advice of the ancients on how to live, and the thoughts of modern psychologists on how to have a healthy mind".  He was impressed by the breadth of Haidt's grasp of modern behavioural science, and found the book "by some margin the most intellectually substantial book to arise from the 'positive psychology' movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/441029a|last=Nettle|first=Daniel|title=A search for meaning|journal=Nature|date=4 May 2006|volume=441|pages=29–30|url=http://www.happinesshypothesis.com/review-in-nature.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2010|issue=7089}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Flint (British novelist)|James Flint]] concluded his review of the book in ''[[The Guardian]]'' saying, "I don't think I've ever read a book that laid out the contemporary understanding of the human condition with such simple clarity and sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=James|title=Don't worry, be happy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/22/shopping.philosophy1|accessdate=29 May 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Hart writing in ''[[The Times]]'' described the book as "humane, witty and comforting... brilliantly synthesising ancient cultural insights with modern psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hart|first=Christopher|title=The bright side of life|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article696683.ece|accessdate=29 May 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=6 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torfinnsvatnet''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Voss]] in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|6.41|km2}} lake lies about {{convert|1.7|km}} east of the lake [[Hamlagrøvatnet]].  The lake has a [[dam]] on the west side, which keeps the water level regulated for the local [[hydroelectric power plant]]s.  The river Torfinno connects the lake to the nearby lake Hamlagrøvatnet.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Torfinno|title=Torfinno|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WWT Slimbridge''' is a [[wetland]] [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserve]] near [[Slimbridge]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England. It is midway between Bristol and [[Gloucester]] on the eastern side of the [[estuary]] of the [[River Severn]]. The reserve, set up by the artist and [[Natural history|naturalist]] Sir [[Peter Scott]], opened in November 1946. Scott subsequently founded the [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]], which has since opened eight reserves around the country. Slimbridge comprises some {{convert|800|hectare}} of [[pasture]], [[reed bed]], [[lagoon]] and [[salt marsh]]. Many water birds live there all year round, and others are [[Bird migration|migrants]] on their ways to and from their summer breeding grounds. Other birds overwinter, including large numbers of [[Greater white-fronted goose|white-fronted geese]] and increasing numbers of [[Tundra swan|Bewick's swans]].

Besides having the world's largest collection of captive [[Anatidae|wildfowl]], Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run [[captive breeding]] programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured patterns on the beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from [[Bird hide|hides]] and observatories and take part in educational activities.

==History==
[[File:Peter scott in 1954 arp.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Scott at Slimbridge, 1954]]
The Wildlife and Wetland Trust at Slimbridge was set up by [[Peter Scott]] and opened on 10 November 1946, as a centre for research and conservation. In a move unusual at the time, he opened the site to the public so that everyone could enjoy access to nature.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/history-of-wwt/ |title=History of WWT |publisher=Wildfowl &amp; Wetland Trust |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cotswolds&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cotswolds.info/places/slimbridge.shtml |title=WWW Slimbridge Wetland Centre |publisher=Cotswolds.info |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This modest beginning developed in time into the formation of the [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]], the only United Kingdom charity to promote the protection of wetland birds and their habitats, both in Britain and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bell, Catharine E.|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DT4xOpIzS0C&amp;pg=PA1331 |year=2001 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-57958-174-9 |page=1331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although starting out at Slimbridge, the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust now owns or manages eight other reserves in Britain,&lt;ref name=reserves/&gt; and advocates for wetlands and conservation issues world-wide. WWT Consulting is an offshoot of the Wildlife &amp; Wetland Trust and is based at Slimbridge. It provides ecological surveys and assessments, and offers consultancy services in wetland habitat design, wetland management, biological waste-water treatment systems and the management of reserves and their visitor centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwtconsulting.co.uk/ |title=WWT Consulting |publisher=Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (Consulting) Ltd |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles became the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wwt.org.uk/news/all-news/2015/05/wwt-news/royal-support-for-drains-that-work-with-nature/ |title=Royal support for drains that "work with nature" |date=19 May 2015 |work=Latest from WWT |publisher=WWT |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bust of founder Sir Peter Scott by Jacqueline Shackleton was completed in 1986 and is on display in the grounds.&lt;ref name="clevr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevr.com/pano/326 |title=Panoramic tour of Kathleen Scott Sculpture, WWT Slimbridge |publisher=CleVR |date=11 October 2006|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife [[Philippa Scott|Philippa, Lady Scott]], sat for [[Jon Edgar]] as part of his Environmental Series of heads, and a bronze was unveiled in the visitor centre in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edgar |first=Jon |title=Responses – Carvings and Claywork – Jon Edgar Sculpture 2003–2008 |year=2008 |publisher=Hesworth Press |isbn=978-0-9558675-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sculpture by Peter Scott's mother, Kathleen Scott, entitled: Here Am I, Send Me!, originally commissioned for West Downs Preparatory School, is also on display in the grounds.&lt;ref name="clevr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stocker, Mark |year=2013 |title=‘Young male objects’: the ideal sculpture of Kathleen Scott |journal=Sculpture Journal |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages= |doi=10.3828/sj.2013.20d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site==
[[file:slimbridge.view2.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A winter view across a small part of the reserve, from the Sloane Observation Tower]]
The site consists of {{convert|800|hectare}} of reserve,&lt;ref name=Tipling/&gt; of which part is landscaped and can be visited by the public. At Slimbridge is the largest collection of wildfowl species in the world, and wild birds mingle with these in the enclosures.&lt;ref name=Tipling/&gt; Some of the captive birds form part of international breeding programmes. The reserve includes a mixture of pastureland, much of which gets flooded in winter, lagoons, [[reed bed]]s and [[salt marsh]]es besides the [[Severn Estuary]]. Many wildfowl visit the site including [[greater white-fronted goose|greater white-fronted geese]], [[spoonbill]]s, [[avocet]]s and even [[common crane]]s, the latter being birds that were originally bred here and later released on the [[Somerset Levels]]. There are also some rare species of plant on the reserve including the [[Lythrum hyssopifolia|grass-poly]] (''Lythrum hyssopifolia'') and the wasp orchid, a variant of the [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'').&lt;ref name=reserves&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/our-nature-reserves/ |title=Our nature reserves: Slimbridge |publisher=WWT |accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of ducks, geese and [[swan]]s is greatest in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes with a rare [[lesser white-fronted goose]] amongst them. [[Bewick's swan]]s are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern [[Russia]] to enjoy the milder climate of southern England.&lt;ref name=Cotswolds/&gt; Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. [[bird of prey|Birds of prey]] such as [[peregrine falcon|peregrine]] and [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]] also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, and it is a good place to see the elusive [[water rail]].&lt;ref name=Tipling/&gt;

Species present all year round include [[Little grebe|little]] and [[great crested grebe]]s, [[lapwing]], [[Common redshank|redshank]], [[tufted duck]], [[gadwall]], [[kingfisher]], [[Common reed bunting|reed bunting]], [[great spotted woodpecker]], [[sparrowhawk]] and [[little owl]]. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include [[whimbrel]], [[Common sandpiper|common]], [[Wood sandpiper|wood]] and [[green sandpiper]]s, [[spotted redshank]], [[common greenshank]], avocet, [[godwit]], [[little gull]] and [[black tern]], and other migrants arriving at the reserve include [[wheatear]], [[whinchat]], [[redstart]] and [[black redstart]].&lt;ref name=Tipling/&gt;

Swans and geese usually start to arrive in late October. Passage waders in the autumn include [[red knot]], godwit, [[dunlin]], [[Common ringed plover|ringed]] and [[grey plover]]s, [[ruff]], common greenshank, spotted redshank, [[curlew sandpiper]] and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large waterfowl regularly present in the reserve in winter include the [[Brant goose]], [[pink-footed goose]], [[barnacle goose]] and [[Taiga bean goose]]. The swans tend to fly off in the day and return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of [[Common starling|starlings]]. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include [[Eurasian wigeon|wigeon]], [[Eurasian teal]], [[common pochard]], [[northern pintail]], water rail, dunlin, redshank, [[Eurasian curlew|curlew]], [[European golden plover|golden plover]], [[snipe]] and ruff.&lt;ref name=Tipling/&gt;

==Projects==
[[file:slimbridge.in.july.arp.jpg|thumb|The main buildings and Sloane Observation Tower in July, the majority of the birds are [[mute swan]]s]]
Before the establishment of the WWT reserve at Slimbridge, no Bewick's swans were regularly wintering on the Severn Estuary. In 1948, one arrived at Slimbridge, perhaps attracted by a captive [[whistling swan]]. A mate for this bird was acquired from the Netherlands and the pair eventually successfully bred. More wild Bewick's swans joined the group so that by 1964, more than thirty wild swans were present. So that the birds could be better studied, the tame resident swans were relocated to an easily observable lake. Peter Scott realised that every bird had a unique patterning of black and yellow on its beak by which individual birds could be recognised. These were recorded in small paintings with front and side views (rather like "[[mug shot]]s") to aid recognition. By 1989, over six thousand swans had been recorded visiting the site, and by this means, much research was made possible on the birds.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|author=Bell, Catharine E.|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DT4xOpIzS0C&amp;pg=PA1186 |year=2001 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-57958-174-9 |pages=1186–1187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early success story in the 1950s was the saving of the [[Nene (bird)|nene]] (or Hawaiian goose) from [[extinction]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Birds were brought to the site and breeding at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in [[Hawaii]] were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the [[Predation|predators]] that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kear, Janet|author2=Berger, A.J |title=The Hawaiian Goose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iPqStIw9LIC&amp;pg=PA79 |year=2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-3758-1|pages=79–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]'s 1951 tour of Canada, she was promised a [[Dominion]] gift of [[trumpeter swan]]s, the arrangements to be made by Peter Scott.&lt;ref name=stowe14&gt;[[Leland Stowe]] (1957). ''Crusoe of Lonesome Lake'', Victor Gollancz, Ltd, London, 1958. Chapter 14: "The Saga of the Trumpeter Swans", pg.162–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in [[British Columbia]] as they had been fed for decades by conservationist [[Ralph Edwards (conservationist)|Ralph Edwards]].&lt;ref name=stowe14/&gt; In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos).&lt;ref name=stowe14/&gt; One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.&lt;ref name=stowe14/&gt;

Slimbridge has also been involved in trying to increase population levels of common cranes, which had bred spasmodically in Britain since the late 1970s. A specially built "Crane School" is used where the young birds are taught to forage and avoid danger. This project has led to 23 birds being released onto the Somerset Moors and Levels in September 2013,&lt;ref name=birdwatch&gt;{{cite news |title=Cranes fighting fit and ready for release |url=http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/channel/newsitem.asp?c=11&amp;cate=__14715 |newspaper=Birdwatch |date=23 August 2013 |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93 being released by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcraneproject.org.uk/ |title=The Great Crane Project |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, a researcher from Slimbridge is planning to become a "human swan" and follow migrating Bewick's swans using a powered [[paraglider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Human swan" conservationist takes to skies on 4,600-mile migration |author=McKie, Robin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/human-swan-bewicks-falling-numbers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She plans to try to find out the hazards they face during migration and why their numbers have halved in the last twenty years. The {{convert|4500|mi|km|-2|abbr=on}} mission from the Arctic tundra of Russia to Slimbridge is expected to last for ten weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Human swan' Sacha Dench to join 4,500-mile migration |author= |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36138082 |newspaper=BBC News |date=26 April 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste stabilization ponds''' ('''WSPs''' or '''stabilization ponds''' or '''waste stabilization lagoons''') are [[pond]]s designed and built for [[wastewater treatment]] to reduce the organic content and remove [[pathogen]]s from [[wastewater]]. They are man-made depressions confined by earthen structures. Wastewater or "influent" enters on one side of the waste stabilization pond and exits on the other side as "effluent", after spending several days in the pond, during which treatment processes take place.  

Waste stabilization ponds are used worldwide for wastewater treatment and are especially suitable for [[developing countries]] that have warm climates.&lt;ref&gt;Peña Varón, M., Mara, D. (2004). [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd27/ponds.pdf Stabilisation ponds]. IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre. Delft, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; They are frequently used to treat [[sewage]] and [[industrial effluent]]s, but may also be used for treatment of municipal run-off or [[stormwater]]. The system may consist of a single pond or several ponds in a series, each pond playing a different role in the removal of [[Pollutant|pollutants]]. After treatment, the effluent may be returned to surface water or reused as [[irrigation]] water (or [[reclaimed water]]) if the effluent meets the required effluent standards (e.g. sufficiently low levels of [[Pathogen|pathogens]]).

Waste stabilization ponds involve natural treatment processes which take time because removal rates are slow. Therefore, larger areas are required than for other treatment processes with external energy inputs. Waste stabilization ponds described here use no aerators. High-performance lagoon technology that does use aerators has much more in common with the [[activated sludge]] process. Such [[aerated lagoon]]s use less area than is needed for traditional stabilization ponds and are also common in small towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lagoonsonline.com/technotes.htm|title=Tech Notes Main Page|website=www.lagoonsonline.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concept of stabilization ===
[[Sewage]] and many types of [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewaters]] contain organic matter. If wastewater is discharged untreated into [[surface water]] bodies (for instance, rivers and lakes), their organic matter serves as food for [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] living in the surface waters. These organisms use the organic matter for energy generation for their growth and reproduction. This is done via their [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], in which they convert the organic matter into carbon dioxide and water. These stable components do not cause water pollution problems. Therefore this is frequently called "stabilization" of the organic matter.   

However, these organisms use oxygen in their respiration, thus reducing the oxygen concentration in the surface waters. This is one of the main [[water pollution]] problems, which may affect the surface water [[Life|biota]], including fish.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/open-access-ebooks/3567|title=Basic principles of wastewater treatment|last=von Sperling|first=Marcos|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1843391627|location=London, UK|pages=|oclc=878137398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Waste stabilization ponds reproduce these biological phenomena before they take place in the receiving surface water and cause the pollution problems due to oxygen consumption. The ponds receive wastewater, and, by natural processes similar to those that take place in the surface waters, carry out stabilization of the organic matter inside them, as part of the treatment. This is why they received the name of waste stabilization ponds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878137182|title=Waste stabilisation ponds|last=von Sperling|first=Marcos|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781843391630|location=London|pages=|oclc=878137182|archive-url=https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402109.pdf|archive-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microorganisms ===
The reactions take place by the joint participation of several microorganisms living within the pond. The organic matter is measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). BOD values in the pond effluent are lower than in the influent, reflecting the removal of organic matter. This pond [[biome]] uses organic matter from the wastewater as food. 

Nutrients are converted to cell material and energy for life processes including reproduction and growth of living cells. Some of these living cells will be consumed by organisms at higher [[trophic levels]] within the pond. In ponds, the most important group of microorganisms are [[bacteria]], which utilize most of the organic matter from the wastewater, but also consume oxygen.  

[[Algae]] are another essential group of microorganisms. They do not depend on the organic material from the influent. Instead, they undertake [[photosynthesis]], in which they produce the organic matter for their own consumption and, very importantly here, they release oxygen. The excess oxygen released supports the respiration done by the [[Aerobic organism|aerobic organisms]] in the pond. Atmospheric [[oxygen]] is also dissolved into the liquid, which assists in maintaining an aerobic layer on the top of the pond surface.  

=== Oxygen levels ===
The oxygen concentration varies in the liquid column: Close to the surface, concentrations are high and support the growth of aerobic organisms. Close to the pond bottom, sunlight penetration is low, and thus photosynthetic activity is reduced. This causes oxygen concentrations to be low there. Finally, inside the sediments in the bottom layer, there is no oxygen at all. Here, organic matter is removed by digestion undertaken by [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic organisms]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[File:Anaerobic treatment pond (6910359715).jpg|thumb|A poorly maintained anaerobic treatment pond in [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]], Zimbabwe (sludge needs to be removed)]]

=== Removal of pathogens ===
Pathogens can be efficiently removed in waste stabilization ponds. The process relies mostly on maturation ponds for removal of pathogens, although some removal also takes place in the other ponds of the system. The higher the number of ponds in the series, the more efficient the pathogen removal. 

Removal of pathogenic bacteria and [[Virus|viruses]] occurs mainly by inactivation. Pathogens are inactivated as a result of a complex interaction of mechanisms that involve pH (the pH value in ponds is high because of algal photosynthesis), temperature, [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] present in the sunlight that reaches the pond surface and photooxidative reactions taking advantage of high dissolved oxygen concentrations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conferensum.com/files/30204/IWA%20Ponds%20Conference%20-%20DRAFT%20PROGRAMME.pdf|title=Optimising wastewater ponds for effective pathogen removal|last1=Weaver|first1=L|last2=Webber|first2=J|date=2016|website=|publisher=11th IWA Specialist Group Conference on Wastewater Pond Technology, University of Leeds, March 2016|access-date=|last3=Karki|first3=N|last4=Thomas|first4=K|last5=Mackenzie|first5=M|last6=Lin|first6=S|last7=Inglis|first7=A|last8=Williamson|first8=W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Verbyla, M., von Sperling, M., Ynoussa, M.

[[Protozoa|Protozoan]] pathogens are present in the wastewater in the form of cysts or oocysts. [[Helminths]] (worms) are present in the form of eggs. The protozoan and helminth pathogens can be removed by the mechanism of sedimentation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Very high removal efficiencies may be achieved, especially if maturation ponds are part of the treatment system. In that case, the final pond effluent may be in compliance with [[World Health Organization]] guidelines for irrigating with treated wastewaster (or "[[reclaimed water]]").&lt;ref name="WHO2006"&gt;WHO (2006).

World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; However, sludge (sediment) from the ponds may be heavily contaminated with helminth eggs, which may survive even after several years of storing the sludge inside of the pond.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart M.

[[File:Configurations of pond systems.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Main configurations of waste stabilization pond systems.]]
Waste stabilization ponds consist of man-made basins comprising a single or several series of anaerobic, facultative or maturation ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stabilizationponds.sdsu.edu |title=Design and Performance of Waste Stabilization Ponds |last1=Ramadan |first1=Hamzeh H. |last2=Ponce |first2=Victor M. |date= |website= |publisher=San Diego State University |access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or absence of oxygen varies with the three different types of ponds, used in sequence. Anaerobic waste stabilization ponds have very little dissolved oxygen, thus anaerobic conditions prevail. The second type of pond, facultative stabilization ponds, sustain an aerobic surface habitat above an anaerobic benthic habitat.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerwater.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/43946/wsp_design_manual.pdf|title=Waste Stabilisation Pond Design Manual|last=Ashworth|first=|last2=Skinner|date=19 December 2011|website=Power and Water Corporation|publisher=Power and Water Corporation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maturation ponds offer aerobic conditions throughout, from the surface to the bottom.

If an anaerobic pond is present, part of the [[suspended solids]] from the wastewater settles, thus removing the organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]) contributed by these solids. Additionally, some of the dissolved organic matter is removed by [[anaerobic digestion]]. During the second stage in the facultative pond'','' most of the remaining BOD is removed mainly by the [[heterotrophic]] bacteria that receive oxygen from the photosynthesis undertaken by algae. The main function of the tertiary stage in maturation ponds is the removal of pathogens, although it may also assist in [[nutrient]] reduction (i.e. [[nitrogen]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, [[nitrogen fixation]] by algae living in stabilization pond systems may increase nitrogen levels in stabilization pond effluent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Anaerobic ponds ===
{{main|Anaerobic lagoon}}
Anaerobic ponds receive raw [[wastewater]]. They have a smaller surface area compared to facultative ponds and are also deeper (usually 3.0 to 5.0 m). The depth decreases the influence of oxygen production by photosynthesis, leading to anaerobic conditions. Depending on loading and climatic conditions, these ponds are able to remove between half to two thirds of the influent BOD. This significantly decreases the load of organic matter that goes to the facultative ponds, and thus decreases their required size.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Anaerobic stabilization ponds have the disadvantage of potentially releasing [[malodor]]ous gases. This especially includes [[hydrogen sulfide]] with an odor of rotten eggs, if the system has operational problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/wrd-ot-lagoon-manual_426356_7.pdf|title=Michigan Department of Natural Resources|last=Morris|first=J|date=2010|website=State of Michigan Department of Natural Resources|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first pond biome in a series of stabilization ponds digests the [[putrescible]] solids suspended in the wastewater being treated. Anaerobic ponds allow solids to settle down at the bottom as sludge. This settling removes a portion of the particulate organic material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A large fraction of the settled solids will accumulate close to the point where wastewater enters the pond. Therefore, anaerobic ponds must be designed to be far deeper than either aerobic or facultative ponds. The depth decreases the oxygen levels so anaerobic bacteria can efficiently digest the waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anaerobic ponds contain anaerobic organisms which are able to break down complex organic waste into basic compounds that are less harmful to the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cincinnati, O. (2010, June 29).

Sludge accumulates at the bottom of the anaerobic ponds and needs to be removed every few years.

===Facultative ponds ===
[[File:Facultative pond (6898412198).jpg|thumb|Facultative pond in Ruai, [[Kenya]]]]
{{main|Facultative lagoon}}
Facultative stabilization ponds that receive raw wastewater are called primary facultative ponds. If they are receiving wastewater that has already been treated in anaerobic ponds, they are called secondary facultative ponds. Facultative stabilization ponds may also be used for treatment following other types of treatment processes such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, [[oxidation ditch|oxidation ditches]] or [[aerated lagoon|aerated lagoons]]. Compared with anaerobic ponds, facultative ponds are shallower (1.5 to 2.5 m deep) and have much larger surface areas. The surface area is important because it allows atmospheric oxygen to dissolve and sunlight radiation to penetrate the water. This allows for photosynthetic activity to occur which produces more oxygen.

In most ponds both bacteria and algae are needed in order to maximize the decomposition of organic matter and the removal of other pollutants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Algae produce oxygen (photosynthesis) and also consume oxygen (respiration), but they leave an excess of oxygen that can then be used by aerobic bacteria for respiration and for the processes of oxidation (or stabilization) of the organic matter in the wastewater. 

Several types of invertebrates are present in the ponds where they control the population of [[algae]], which then settles to the bottom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heavy algal growth may block sunlight from penetrating into the pond. This decreases the potential for photosynthesis to contribute oxygen to the pond.  

In the treatment of sewage, systems composed of anaerobic ponds followed by facultative ponds usually have overall BOD removal efficiencies between 75 and 85%. Higher efficiencies are difficult to achieve because the effluent contains high concentrations of particulate organic matter, in the form of algae, naturally produced during treatment. 

The sludge comprising the sediment layer in the pond undergoes anaerobic digestion, and may accumulate for several years without needing removal. 

===Maturation ponds ===

Some additional removal of organic matter and other pollutants may be achieved in maturation ponds. These ponds are only included in the treatment line when high efficiencies of pathogen removal are required, either for discharge of the treated effluent in [[surface water]] bodies, or for use for irrigation or [[aquaculture]]. They are usually used after facultative ponds, but may also follow other treatment processes, such as [[Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion|upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] (UASB) reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/open-access-ebooks/3567|title=Anaerobic reactors. Volume 4. Biological Wastewater Treatment Series|last=Chernicharo|first=C.A.L.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1843391627|location=London, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also be placed after an [[activated sludge]] process.  

Maturation ponds must be shallow (around 1.0 m depth or less) with a great surface area so that more oxygen can dissolve into the water giving the bacteria enough oxygen to properly function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Shallow ponds benefit from high photosynthetic activity arising from the penetration of solar radiation. The pH values are high because of intense photosynthesis, and ultraviolet radiation penetration takes place in the upper layers. Both of these factors promote the removal of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Given the high surface area of the maturation ponds, protozoan cysts and helminth eggs are also removed, with sedimentation as the main mechanism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sludge accumulation is very low in maturation ponds. 

Very high pathogen removal efficiencies may be achieved, depending on several factors: temperature, [[hydraulic retention time]] (the amount of time the liquid remains in the system - from entrance to exit), the number of ponds in the series, the presence of baffles and the depth of ponds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Maturation ponds may be used in combination with a [[rainwater]] [[reservoir]] to form an ecological, self-purifying irrigation reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oieau.fr/ciedd/contributions/atriob/contribution/russian.htm |title=Ecologic water basins used for agriculture/irrigation |publisher=Oieau.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014354/http://www.oieau.fr/ciedd/contributions/atriob/contribution/russian.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SwimPond Incorporated |url=http://www.swimpond.com/pools_or_ponds.html |title=reservoirs made self-purifying through addition of treatment pond |publisher=Swimpond.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716172126/http://www.swimpond.com/pools_or_ponds.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Application and suitability == 
Waste stabilization ponds are very efficient in their primary objective of removing organic matter and, under some conditions, pathogenic organisms. Their design criteria have changed very little over the years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ponds are simple to design, build, operate and maintain, which is very important in remote areas and in [[Developing country|developing countries]] where sophisticated equipment and highly skilled labor is not easily available. Construction may be done by local contractors in small towns. 

Waste stabilization ponds work well in nearly all environments and can treat most types of [[wastewater]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are particularly well-suited for tropical and subtropical countries because the intensity of the sunlight and temperature are key factors for the efficiency of the removal processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ponds are used throughout the world. In many countries and regions ponds are the most widely used treatment process. For this reason, they are one of the processes recommended by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] for the treatment of wastewater for reuse in agriculture and aquaculture, especially because of their  effectiveness in removing [[nematodes]] (worms) and [[helminth]] eggs.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; 

Ponds cannot achieve very high efficiencies in the removal of organic matter, and usually have low capacities for removing nitrogen and [[phosphorus]]. The effluent usually has high concentrations of [[suspended solids]], resulting from algal production in the ponds. Therefore, ponds are not a suitable technology in areas where stringent discharge standards exist, unless additional stages of post treatment are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Sperling|first=Marcos|date=2016-08-01|title=Urban Wastewater Treatment in Brazil|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0000397|language=English|doi=10.18235/0000397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Since ponds require large areas, they may not be practical in proximity to towns where land is expensive. A suitable [[topography]] and a suitable [[soil]] structure are also desired, in order to reduce construction costs. 

== Operation and maintenance ==
Regarding operation and maintenance, the tasks performed by the operational staff are very simple and do not require special skills. Additionally, there is no energy consumption for aeration, no need of heavy equipment maintenance and no frequent sludge removal, [[Sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]] and disposal.

Ponds require very little maintenance, since there is no heavy electric or mechanical equipment that requires attention. The only routine maintenance needed is on the preliminary treatment (cleaning of screens and removal of sand), routine checking of pipes, weirs and other hydraulic structures, and removal of unwanted vegetation growth in embankments. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sludge removal ===
Sludge accumulates inside the ponds. It needs to be removed only in the interval of several years. This is an important advantage of the system. However, when removal is necessary, it is usually an expensive and labor-intensive operation. Removal is more frequent in anaerobic ponds (every few years), because of their smaller volume and lower capacity to store the sludge, compared with facultative ponds. In facultative ponds, sludge removal may be necessary only in intervals around 15 to 25 years. In maturation ponds, sludge accumulation is very low.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sludge removal, also called desludging, may be done in two basic ways: (i) interrupting the operation of the pond for desludging or (ii) keeping the pond in operation while desludging.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the first case, the influent wastewater to the pond to be desludged is closed. Afterwards, the pond is drained and the bottom sludge is left for open drying for several weeks. During this period, the wastewater to be treated needs to be diverted to other ponds in the system. After the sludge has dried, its removal may be done manually (very laborious in large ponds) or mechanically using tractors or mechanical scrapers. In the second alternative, when the pond is left in operation during desludging, the removed sludge will be wet and will require further drying. This is undertaken outside the pond. Sludge removal can be by suction and pumping using [[Vacuum tanker|vacuum trucks]] (only for small ponds), dredging, pumping from a raft or involving other mechanical equipment. In either case, the amount of sludge to be removed is very high, considering its accumulation over a period of years. This process is very laborious, expensive and requires careful planning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Costs == 
In the selection of a wastewater treatment process, besides the technical aspects that are relevant to each alternative, also cost factors play a very important role. The latter can be basically divided into (i) construction costs and (ii) operation and maintenance costs. Waste stabilization ponds are usually considered a cheap alternative in terms of construction costs. However, the final costs will depend essentially on the size of ponds, presence of maturation ponds in the process configuration, topography, soil conditions, groundwater level and land cost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

Because all these elements are site-specific, it is difficult to generalize overall construction costs. In most cases these will be lower compared with other wastewater treatment alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, J.P. (1983). Notes on the design and operation of waste stabilization ponds in warm climates of developing countries. Technical paper No 7. Washington D.C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Depending on the specific situation of the area, construction costs can increase and level up with other technologies. 

Waste stabilization ponds are one of the cheapest wastewater treatment processes in terms of operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Comparison with other infrastructure ==
The following types of water and wastewater infrastructure may superficially resemble waste stabilization ponds, but are not the same:

* [[Aerated lagoon]]s rely upon mechanical aerators to provide oxygen to stabilize organic matter. Aerated lagoons may be used as the first stage in the treatment line instead of anaerobic ponds to limit release of malodorous gases, but with energy and maintenance requirements causing higher operating costs.
* [[Constructed wetland]]s are designed to improve water quality by supporting rooted vegetation arranged to physically remove solids and particulate material while removing soluble nutrients in the water by uptake into plant tissue and supplying oxygen to the water to reduce BOD.
* [[Retention basin|Retention basins]] are used to manage [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] to prevent [[Flood|flooding]] and downstream [[erosion]], and improve [[water quality]] in an adjacent [[river]], [[stream]], [[lake]] or [[bay]]. [[Detention basin]]s are similar but are "dry ponds" designed to temporarily hold runoff as a flood control measure.
* [[Infiltration basin]]s are ponds designed to percolate their contents into underlying permeable soils.
* [[Settling basin]]s are designed to separate solids from wastewaters without provision for treatment of those solids.

[[Water resources]] management is a significant challenge for [[Mexico]]. Furthermore, water management is imposing a heavy cost to the [[Economy of Mexico|economy]]. The arid northwest and central regions contain 77% of Mexico's population and generate 87% of the gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;CONAGUA.  Estadísticas del Agua en México, Edición 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the poorer southern regions have abundant water resources ;however, [[surface water|surface]] and [[groundwater]] are [[overexploited]] and [[Water pollution|polluted]] thus leading to an insufficient water availability to support economic development and environmental sustainability. The country has in place a system of water resources management that includes both central (federal) and decentralized (basin and local) institutions.

==Water management history and recent developments==
Mexico has a long and well-established tradition on water resources management (WRM) which started approximately in the 1930s when the country began investing heavily in water storage facilities and groundwater development to expand irrigation and supply water to the rapidly increasing population.

The 1934 Código Agrario, promulgated during the [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Cárdenas]] administration (1934–1940), granted the federal government powers to define the “public interest” to which water could be harnessed. By virtue of such legislation, between the 1930s and 1970s, the rural community and [[ejido]] sector were subject to direct federal control over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 |author=Sanderson, S.E.
 |title=Agrarian Populism and the Mexican State: The Struggle for Land in Sonora
 |journal=University of California Press
 |year=1981
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private landowners, on the other hand, enjoyed the benefits of federally subsidized irrigation infrastructure and guaranteed market prices. Over time, large landowners became highly capitalized, while small land owners, by the 1970s, were suffering from the effects of water monopolies.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Mexican government entered into a tripartite agreement with the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank]] and the [[United Nations Development Program]] to prepare the 1975 National Water Plan (NWP), which identified the need to enact a New Water Law (NWL) and a National Water Authority (ANA) as well as decentralize responsibilities and promote water user participation in operational and maintenance (O&amp;M). The NWP spurred a significant institutional development and infrastructural achievements: (i) the federal government transfer responsibilities for water supply and sanitation to municipalities and states in 1983, (ii) the Mexican Institute of Water Technology was established in 1986, (iii) the National Commission on Water ([http://www.cna.gob.mx/Default.aspx CONAGUA]) was established in 1988, and (iv) in 1989, the first Basin Council was created in Lerma Chapala, incorporating water users from multiple sectors.

During the 1990s, there was a rapid groundwater development and aquifer pumping for combined agricultural, urban, and industrial demand. Also the federal government decentralized responsibility for large irrigation infrastructure to autonomous agencies (irrigation districts).

In 1992, Mexico adopted the Ley de Aguas Nacionales (LAN), which contained specific provisions for the role of the CONAGUA, the structure and functioning of river basin councils, public participation in water management, etc. In 1993 the Cutzamala system, one of the largest pumping schemes in the world, was completed. The Cutzamala system pumps {{convert|19|m3/s|ft3/s|sp=us}} of water into the [[Mexico City]] metropolitan area.

In 1997 the first technical groundwater committee was created to manage an overexploited aquifer in the state of [[Guanajuato]].

With the 2004 Revision of the National Water Law, the thirteen decentralized CNA regions would become basin organizations serving as the technical arm of more broad-based basin councils that incorporate civil society interests including the private sector and citizens’ groups.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;

==Water resource base==

===Surface and ground water resources===
[[Image:Mexico watersheds.jpg|right|thumb|Watersheds of Mexico. Basins in green drain to the Pacific, in brown to the Gulf of Mexico, and in yellow to the Caribbean Sea. Grey indicates [[endorheic basin|interior basins]] that do not drain to the sea.]]

Mexico's internal renewable water resources per capita is {{convert|4016|m3|cuft}}, which is below the average in the Central American and the Caribbean region, {{convert|6645|m3|cuft|}}.

A volume of {{convert|396|km3|cumi}} of water per year flows through Mexico's rivers, including imports from other countries and excluding exports. A total of 65% of this surface runoff occurs in seven rivers: [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]], [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]], [[Papaloapan River|Papaloapan]], Coatzacoalcos, [[Balsas River|Balsas]], [[Panuco River|Panuco]], Santiago and Tonala, whose total watershed area represents 22% of the country's total land area. The Balsas and Santiago rivers empty on the Pacific Ocean, while the other five empty into the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The historical mean annual precipitation (1941–2004) is {{convert|773|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with 77% of all precipitation accruing between June and October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A little over 70% of rainwater in Mexico is lost through [[evapotranspiration]] and returns to the atmosphere. The rest runs off rivers and streams or infiltrates into the subsoil and recharges groundwater.&lt;ref name=fao-aquastat&gt;{{cite web

Mexico shares three watersheds ([[Colorado River|Colorado]], [[Rio Grande|Bravo]] and [[Tijuana River|Tijuana]]) with the [[United States]], four with [[Guatemala]] (Grijalva, Usumacintam Suchiate, Coatan, and Candelaria) and one with [[Belize]] and Guatemala ([[Hondo River (Belize)|Rio Hondo]]). The waters are shared with the U.S. in accordance with the stipulations included in the [[International Boundary and Water Commission|Treaty on the Utilization of the Waters of the Colorado]], Tijuana and Rio Grande Rivers, signed in 1944.

[[Groundwater]] accounts for 64% of the volume for public water supply, 33% of all water used for agriculture and livestock, and 24% of water utilized by self-supplied industry. There are 653 groundwater aquifers in Mexico. CONAGUA estimates the total amount of groundwater recharge to be around {{convert|77|km3|cumi|}} per year, 36.4% of which, (around {{convert|28|km3|cumi|disp=or|abbr=on}} per year) are actually used. This average rate does not fully represent the situation of the arid region, where a negative balance is threatening the sustainable use of groundwater resources.

Groundwater is a key water supplier for several users in the arid region or in some cities where groundwater is most of the time the sole water resource available. About 71% of the groundwater is used for agriculture, 20% for water urban supply and 3% for domestic and animal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Storage capacity and infrastructure===
Mexico counts with 4,000 dams and other hydraulic infrastructure with a storage capacity of {{convert|180|km3|cumi|}}, which account for 44% of the annual flow. In the arid regions, dams are mostly used for irrigation. In the humid areas, dams are mostly used for electricity generation. Dams are also considered a means for flood protection in Mexico. Approximately 63 dams have a storage capacity of over {{convert|100000000|m3|acre.ft}}, and account for 95% of Mexico's storage capacity.&lt;ref name=fao-aquastat/&gt; The largest reservoirs are [[Angostura Dam (Mexico)|La Angostura]] (20,217&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Nezahualcóyotl (14,0298&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Chicoasén Dam|Chicoasén]] (11,883&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[Infiernillo Dam|Infiernillo]] (11,860&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agua.org.mx/ Centro Virtual de Información del Agua].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico has approximately 70 lakes with a storage capacity of {{convert|14|km3|cumi|abbr=on}}. The largest lake, the Chapala Lake, has a storage capacity of {{convert|8126|hm3|cumi}}.

===Water quality===
According to the Water Quality Index, 96% of Mexico's surface water bodies have different levels of [[water pollution|pollution]]. OECD estimates the economic cost of water pollution in Mexico at US$6 billion per year. The problem is most serious in the [[Valley of Mexico|Valle de Mexico]] region where 100% of the water bodies have different levels of contamination, 18% of which are highly polluted. Low water quality is due to untreated discharge of industrial effluents and municipal wastewater into rivers and lakes, solid waste deposits along river banks, uncontrolled seepage from unsanitary landfills, and non-point pollution mainly from agricultural production.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=March 10, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CONAGUA has also detected infiltration of untreated municipal wastewater in 8 aquifers, iron and manganese in 2, arsenic in 1 aquifer of the Lagunera region. In overexploited aquifers, contamination tends to worsen over time as the groundwater reservoir is depleted. This is the case of the Lagunera region, where concentration of 0.09 to 0.59&amp;nbsp;mg/L of arsenic found in the drinking water, are above of the permissible level of 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L. 
In addition, information regarding water quality, available by the Public Water Rights and Registry, is scarce and often unreliable.&lt;ref name=olson/&gt;

===Drinking water and sanitation===
In 1998, domestic consumption accounted for 17% of surface water withdrawals in Mexico. During the past decade, the Mexican '''[[water supply]]''' and '''[[sanitation]]''' sector made major strides in service coverage. In urban areas almost 100% of the population is estimated to have access to improved water supply and 91% to adequate sanitation. In rural areas, the respective shares are 87% for water and 41% for sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=March 17, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage levels are particularly low in the southern regions. (See also [[Water supply and sanitation in Mexico]])

===Irrigation and drainage===
In 1998, agriculture accounted for 78% of surface water withdrawals in Mexico. A total of 62,000&amp;nbsp;km² (15.3&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;acre) count with irrigation infrastructure (22.9% of the total cultivated area), 55,000&amp;nbsp;km² (13.6&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;acres) of which are actually irrigated. In 1997, 58,000&amp;nbsp;km² (14.3&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;acres) use surface irrigation, 3,000&amp;nbsp;km² use sprinkler irrigation and 1,000&amp;nbsp;km² localized irrigation. Ineffective irrigation has generated salinization and drainage problems in {{convert|3841.63|km2|acre|sp=us}} of a total irrigated area of {{convert|62560|km2|acre|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=fao-aquastat/&gt; (See also [[Irrigation in Mexico]])

===Hydropower===
The electricity sector in Mexico relies heavily on thermal sources (74% of total installed capacity), followed by hydropower generation (22%). The largest hydro plant in Mexico is the 2,300 [[Mega Watt|MW]] Manuel Moreno Torres in Chicoasén, [[Chiapas]]. This is the world’s fourth most productive hydroelectric plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Aquatic ecosystems===
[[Image:Kaimanfische (Lepisosteus).jpg|thumb|A ''Lepisosteus'', one of the endemic species of Mexico]]
There are approximately 70 lakes in Mexico, covering a total area of {{convert|3700|km2|acre|sp=us}}. Some of these lakes, especially in the Eastern side, have a volcanic origin and count with numerous [[endemism|endemic]] species. [[Lake Chapala]], the largest Mexican lake, is considered a hydrological priority region for biodiversity conservation due to its 39 local species, 19 of which are endemic. The [[Laguna Catemaco|Lake Catemaco]], located in [[Veracruz]], has 12 native species 9 of which are endemic.&lt;ref name=mexico-arriaga&gt;{{cite web

Wetlands in Mexico are dynamic, complex and productive ecosystems. Six major wetland are registered in the [[Ramsar Convention|RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands]]: Lagartos River ([[Yucatan Peninsula]]), Cuatrocienagas ([[Coahuila]]), La Encrucijada ([[Chiapas]]), [[Marsh]] [[Nayarit]] and [[Sinaloa]], [[Pantanos de Centla|Centla Swamp]] ([[Tabasco]]), and the [[Colorado River]] ([[Baja California]]). 
 
[[Cenote]]s, sinkholes on the Yucatan peninsula that are filled with groundwater, host a number of unique species from bacteria, algae and protozoa (i.e. [[copepoda]], [[cladocera]] and [[rotifera]]) to vertebrates (i.e.[[lepisosteus]]).&lt;ref name=mexico-arriaga/&gt; Cenotes are the main water source for many ancient and contemporary [[Maya peoples|Maya]] people, as there are no rivers and very few lakes on the peninsula.

==Legal and institutional framework==

===Legal framework===
The main law governing water resources management in Mexico is the National Water Law of 1992 (Ley de Aguas Nacionales -LAN), revised on April 29, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  
 |author=Diario Oficial
 |title=Reforma de la lay de aguas nacionales
 |work=Diario Oficial
 |url=http://www.conagua.gob.mx/conagua/Espaniol/TmpContenido.aspx?Id=Leyes%7CMARCO%20NORMATIVO%7C6%7C0%7C0%7C0%7C0

According to the LAN key functions in the sector are the responsibility of the federal government, through the National Water Commission (CNA or CONAGUA). The LAN made possible to implement a regulatory framework that seeks to encourage greater efficiency and a more accurate perception of the social, economic, and environmental value of water resources. Therefore,  waters users operate within a framework of rights and obligations that are clearly defined in three basic instruments:
*Titles of concession or allocation, which establish the right to withdraw, use or enjoy in usufruct a specific volume of water
*Permits for wastewater discharges. This instrument establishes the concession under which permittees must dispose of resulting wastewater
*Enrollment in the Public Registry of the Water Rights (Registro Público de Derechos de Agua – REDPA) of both titles of concession or allocation and permits for discharging wastewater, which affords the rights granted to water users greater certainty and assistance form a legal standpoint.
The 2004 amended National Water Law (NWL) aims to restructure CONAGUA key functions through the transfer of responsibilities from the central level to subnational entities: the basin agencies (Organismos de Cuenca – BA) and Basin Councils (Consejos de Cuenca – BC). BA and BCs are expected to play an increasing role in the sector limiting CONAGUA’s role to the administration of the NWL, the conduct of national water policy, and planning, supervision, support and regulatory activities.

The NWL also introduced a Water Financing System (Sistema Finaciero del Agua – SFA). CONAGUA will create together with the Ministry of Finance appropriate instruments to determine funding sources, spending guidelines, cost recovery, settling of accounts and management indicators.

===Institutional framework===
Three groups of institutions have been assigned with the main responsibilities for WRM: (i) the National Water Commission (Comisión Nacional del Agua –CONAGUA), at the federal level; (ii) Water Commissions (Comisiones Estatales del Agua – CEAs), at the State level; and (iii) basin authorities and basin councils.

CONAGUA is the highest institution for water resource management in Mexico, including water policy, water rights, planning, irrigation and drainage development, water supply and sanitation, and emergency and disaster management (with an emphasis on flooding). CONAGUA’s mission is to manage and preserve national water resources, with the participation of the society, to reach a sustainable use of the resource.

CONAGUA is formally under the authority of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaria del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales – SEMARNAT) but it enjoys considerable de facto autonomy. It employs 17,000 professionals, has 13 regional offices and 32 state offices and had an annual budget of US$1.2 billion in 2005. It also directly manages certain key hydraulic facilities such as the [[Cutzamala Pipeline|Cutzamala]] Pipeline that supplies a large share of the water used in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City. CONAGUA also owns and operates most dams in Mexico and operates the country’s water monitoring network.&lt;ref name=olson/&gt;

The CEAs are autonomous entities that usually are under the authority of the State Ministry of Public Works. Their attributions are different among states and can include water resources management, irrigation and the provision of water supply and sanitation services.

The recently created Basin Authorities (BAs) will develop from the 13 existing Regional Offices of CONAGUA and are expected to be responsible for formulating regional policy, designing programs to implement such policies, conducting studies to estimate the value of the financial resources generated within their boundaries (water user fees and service fees), recommending specific rates for water user fees and collecting them. Basin Councils (BCs) are expected to guide, together with CONAGUA, BAs work. There are a total of 25 BCs that have been established with the same basin boundaries as the BAs.&lt;ref name=olson/&gt;

===Government strategy===
The '''National Water Plan 2007-2012''', linked to the National Development Plan, aims at ensuring water quality and quantity, recognizing the strategic value of water and promoting sustainable water use and water resources conservation. The Plan has eight objectives, namely: (i) increasing agricultural productivity, (ii) increasing access and quality of water supply and sanitation services, (iii) promoting integrated water resources management at the river basin level, (iv) improving technical, administrative and financial development of the water sector, (v) increase participation of water users and society in general in the management of water resources, (vi) reduce water risks, (vii) evaluate climate change impacts on water resources, and (viii) promote compliance with the National Water Law, especially on administrative matters.

Each objective has a strategy and a set of goals associated. The NWP has a total budget of 227,130 million pesos (about US$21.9 billion), which does not include operational and maintenance costs of hydraulic infrastructure.

==Water pricing, cost recovery and subsidies==
Mexico lacks a coherent national policy framework for setting and linking water and sanitation tariffs, subsidies and cost-recovery goals. The absence of overarching policies produces a wide variation in the degree of cost recovery and subsidies across regions. Tariffs are set below costs – the most common form of user subsidy in water supply and sanitation.

Water service providers charge industrial and commercial user tariffs that are close to full recovery cost, and cross subsidize residential users. The average tariff across users, US$0.32 per cubic meter ($0.24/cu&amp;nbsp;yd), is half the Latin American and the Caribbean average, US$0.65/m³ ($0.50/cu&amp;nbsp;yd).

The level of collection efficiency in Mexico has been estimated at 72%, far below the levels achieved in developed countries (OECD 95%). Water tariff collections in water supply and sanitation have been estimated at US$1.54 billion in 2002. Billed revenues were estimated at between US$2.14 billion and US$2.9 billion.

Approximately 31% of water customers are not metered and are charged a flat rate, independent of consumption, differentiated by neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Water-related risks==
[[Image:HurricaneDean.jpg|thumb|Hurricane Dean photographed by [[International Space Station]] [[astronauts]]]]
Mexico is prone to several weather events including hurricanes on both Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Hurricanes contribute to recharge surface and groundwater reservoirs with increases water supply for cities, irrigation and electricity generation. Hurricanes pose also a threat to service delivery, infrastructure and ultimately to ecosystems and human life. This situation is aggravated by deforestation upstream as well as human settlements located in flood prone areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With more than 85% of the Mexican land area defined as arid or semi-arid and a highly variable interannual rainfall Mexico is also prone to droughts, especially in the northern areas.
The most severe droughts in Mexico in recent decades coincide with the variations in Pacific sea-surface temperatures associated with El Niño. The economic and social and environmental impacts of droughts in Mexico are notable. In 1996, four years of below normal rainfall produced farms losses estimated at US$1 billion and interstate political between Sonora and Sinaloa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Potential climate change impacts==
[[Image:Sea Surface Temperature - November 2007.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sea surface skin temperature anomalies in November 2007 showing La Niña conditions]]
In parts of Mexico climate change is projected to produce a decrease in water flow. Furthermore, an increase on water demand is expected due to increasing temperature and extreme weather conditions such as droughts and floods due to [[El Niño|El Niño Southern Oscillation]] and [[La Niña]] are expected to become more frequent.

The [[IPCC]] considers various scenarios with increases in temperatures ranging between 1 and 6 degrees Celsius. By 2050, the Mexican Institute of Water Technology expects a 7-12% decrease in precipitation in the southern basins, 3% in the Mexican Gulf basin, and 11% in the central basin. Precipitation is estimated to continue to decrease over the next 50 years. An increase in category 5 hurricanes is also expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During some El Niño/La Niña years, winter precipitation may be so great that stream flow and water levels in dams may exceed those observed during summer. In contrast, summer droughts during these events can lead to serious deficits in reservoir levels and in rain-fed maize production. In Mexico during 1997, the estimated costs of climate anomalies associated with El Niño were 900 million US dollars, particularly in agricultural activities, when 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² (5&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;acres) were affected by a severe drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==External cooperation==
The [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank]] is currently contributing with US$28.5 million, to an Adaptation to Climate Change Project in the Gulf of Mexico ([http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/09/24/000021271_20070925143034/Rendered/PDF/Project0Inform1ment010Concept0Stage.pdf]). This project aims at formulating and implementing adaptation policy actions and specific measures in representative systems of Gulf of Mexico wetlands in order to protect their environmental functions and their rich biodiversity from climate change related impacts, and improving the knowledge base to ascertain with a higher level of certainty the anticipated impacts from climate change on the country’s water resources, with a primary focus on coastal wetlands and associated inland basins.

'''Water supply and sanitation in Kenya''' is characterised by low levels of access to water and [[sanitation]], in particular in urban [[slums]] and in [[rural areas]], as well as poor service quality in the form of intermittent [[water supply]].&lt;ref name="impact2"&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=53&amp;Itemid=109 Water Service Quality – WASREB Impact Report 2009], pp.27–31. Retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal and regional [[water scarcity]] exacerbates the difficulty to improve water supply.

The Kenyan water sector underwent far-reaching reforms through the Water Act No. 8 of 2002. Previously service provision had been the responsibility of a single National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation as well as of a few local utilities established since 1996. After the passage of the act service provision was gradually decentralised to 91 local Water Service Providers (WSPs). These were linked to 8 regional Water Services Boards (WSBs) in charge of asset management through Service Provision Agreements (SPAs) with the WSPs. The Act also created a national regulatory board that carries out performance [[benchmarking]] and is in charge of approving SPAs and tariff adjustments. With the Water Bill, 2014, the functions of the 8 WSBs were transferred to 47 Water Works Development Boards in each [[Districts of Kenya|county of Kenya]]. 

The Ministry of Water and Irrigation remains in charge of policies for water supply, while the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation is in charge of policies for sanitation.

Although urban water tariffs are high by regional standards (60 KSh or US$0.60 per m3 on average in 2014), these tariffs only allow the recovery of operating costs, but not the recovery of capital costs. Full cost recovery is not achieved due to various reasons, including a high level of [[non-revenue water]] (average of 42%). Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million.&lt;ref name="Impact 2015 Efficiency"/&gt; Another reason is the need to tap distant water sources at a high cost in some locations. For example, [[Mombasa]] is supplied from a source located 220&amp;nbsp;km from the city. Although 16% of Kenyans in urban areas have access to sewerage, there is no sewerage levy in Kenya, making this expensive service essentially free of charge.

== Data sources and interpretation ==
Collecting reliable data on the Kenyan water and sanitation sector is difficult because reporting is often incomplete and different definitions are being used. Two sources of nationwide representative information are censuses carried out every ten years, with the next one scheduled for 2019,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyacensus.or.ke/ Kenya Census], accessed on 9 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] carried out every five years by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The data thus collected are analysed by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to assess progress towards achievement of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="track"&gt;African Ministers' Council on Water, AMCOW and Water and Sanitation Program (2006) [http://www.wsp.org/UserFiles/file/27200752445_MDGsAfrica.pdf Getting Africa on Track to Meet the MDGs on Water Supply and Sanitation – A Status Review of Sixteen African Countries], pp.33–43. Retrieved 6 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These data only assess the availability of water and sanitation infrastructure. They do not assess whether water is safe to drink, sufficient in quantity, continuously available or affordable. Another important source of information is the annual "impact report" published by the water regulatory agency WASREB since 2008. Through this report much more detailed information is publicly available today on many water service providers than in the past and than in many other countries. However, data in the report refer only to the population served by Water Service Providers, which is not the entire population of Kenya, omitting particularly parts of rural areas.

=== Water supply ===
Estimates from the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) show that 58% of Kenyans (83% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas) had access to [[at least basic water source|at least basic drinking water sources]] in 2015. 22% of Kenyans (45% in urban areas and 14% in rural areas) are reported as having access to piped water through a house or yard connection. According to the JMP estimates, access to improved water sources in urban areas decreased from 92% in 1990 to 82% in 2015. In rural areas, however, access increased from 33% to 57% during the same period.&lt;ref name="JMP table" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]]: [http://www.wssinfo.org/download?id_document=1049 Improved Drinking Water Coverage Estimates – Kenya, March 2010] Retrieved 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of people lacking access to "at least basic" water in 2015 was 19 million people.&lt;ref name="JMP table" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washwatch.org/en/countries/kenya/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Kenya|website=www.washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the 2016-17 WASREB report 55% of the total  population had "access to water".&lt;ref name="Impact 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact: A Performance Review of Kenya’s Water Services Sector 2016 - 2017|url=https://wasreb.go.ke/impact-report-issue-no-10/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, according to the definition called "weighted access" (see above), the 2009 Impact Report had estimated that in 2006–2007 only 37% of Kenyans had access to sufficient and safe drinking water close to their homes at an affordable price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/kenya-population.html Kenya Information Guide] Retrieved 16 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Significant regional differences in access were reported: the highest level was registered in the area served by Tetu Aberdare Water and Sanitation Company (72%) whereas the lowest was recorded in Muthambi in [[Meru South District]] (4%). In the capital [[Nairobi]] access for the same period was reported at 35%, as opposed to a less realistic figure of 46% reported for 2005–2006.&lt;ref name="impact1"&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=53&amp;Itemid=109 Water and Sanitation Coverage – WASREB Impact Report 2009], pp.20–23. Retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor, in particular women and girls, spend a significant amount of time fetching water in both rural and urban areas. For example, the 2007 Citizen Report Card survey showed that users of water kiosks in cities fetch water 4–6 times per day. In Kisumu, this meant that a poor household spent 112 minutes per day to fetch water at normal times, and as much as 200 minutes per day during times of scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;Uwazi InfoShop at Twaweza:[http://www.twaweza.org/uploads/files/Its%20our%20water%20too_English.pdf It’s our water too!

=== Sanitation ===
The total number of people lacking access to at least basic [[sanitation]] in 2015 was 32 million people.&lt;ref name="JMP table" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Countrywide estimates for 2015 by the JMP indicate that 30% (43% of urban and 28% of rural) Kenyans had access to [[at least basic sanitation]], including sewerage. In urban areas an additional 27% of the population used shared latrines. In rural areas, open defecation was estimated to be still practised by 12% of the population.&lt;ref name="JMP table" /&gt; The 2015 report by the Water and Sanitation Regulatory Board did not include any figures on access to sanitation in the broad sense, but only an estimate of access to sewerage in urban areas, which was estimated at 16%.&lt;ref name="Impact 2015" /&gt;

In 2006–2007 it had been reported that half of the Kenyan population within the service area of 55 WSPs had access to [[improved sanitation|improved sanitation facilities]] (this definition includes flush, pour flush toilets connected to a piped system, septic tanks, VIP latrines and pit latrines). In Nairobi, sanitation coverage was about 23% in 2006–2007.&lt;ref name="impact1"/&gt; The Kenyan Integrated Household Budget Survey of 2006 reported a much higher sanitation coverage 84%, including shared latrines and shallow pit latrines.&lt;ref name="review2"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.hackenya.org/documents/details/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=948&amp;Itemid=538 Annual Water Sector Review 2009], pp.35–40 "Water Services, Sanitation" Retrieved 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==
The quality of service of WSPs is closely monitored by the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) with the aim of promoting comparative competition and performance improvements. Some of the most important indicators of service quality are water quality, continuity of water supply and wastewater treatment.

'''Water quality.''' In 2015 WASREB reported that 23 utilities provided good quality water (defined as more than 95% compliance with standards), 15 acceptable quality and for 53 utilities water quality was not acceptable (defined as less than 90% compliance). The two parameters measured were residual chlorine (40% weight) and compliance with bacteriological standards (60% weight). If the number of samples taken was lower than foreseen in the standard, the compliance was rated lower. The highest compliance was achieved in [[Kericho]] and [[Kisumu]] with 100% each. A citizens' report carried out in [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]] and [[Kisumu]] in 2007 provided information about customers' perception of water quality: around 70% of households using water from connections to the mains said they found the taste and smell of water acceptable, and that the water was clear. Even so, the vast majority of respondents treat water prior to consumption, which shows continuing uncertainty about its quality.&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/11/05/000334955_20081105050028/Rendered/PDF/463040WP0Box331Card111Summary1Kenya.pdf Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007] Retrieved 5 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kenya Kisumu Harbour Hyacinths 1997ke09b21.jpg|thumb|300px|In Kisumu, which receives its water from nearby Lake Victoria, over 40% of citizens report scarcity of drinking water.]]

'''Continuity of supply.''' The 2015 Impact Report reports an average supply of 18 hours per day, up from 14 hours in 2006-07. Only in nine mostly small WSPs water is provided continuously 24 hours per day. In [[Nairobi]] water is provided on average for 18 hours a day and in [[Mombasa]] for 6 hours.&lt;ref name=Continuity/&gt; Nonetheless, instances of water scarcity (defined as more than five days without or with insufficient water supply) still occur in Kenya. In 2006 in [[Kisumu]] over 40% of households (both poor and non-poor) connected to water mains reported scarcity. The greatest difference between the poor and non-poor was recorded in Nairobi, where poor households were more than twice as likely to say they experienced scarcity. A higher percentage of kiosk users reported scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections.&lt;ref name="crc" /&gt;

'''Wastewater treatment.''' According to an assessment report carried out in 2009, there are 43 sewerage systems in Kenya and waste water treatment plants in 15 towns (total population served: 900,000 inhabitants). The operation capacity of these wastewater treatment plants is estimated at around 16% of design capacity. The main reasons for this inefficiency are inadequate operation and maintenance and low connection rate to sewers. In Kenya, the estimated connection rate is 19% (12% according to another report).&lt;ref&gt;R. Gakubia, U. Pokorski and P.

Of the wastewater that enters the sewer network, only about 60% reaches the treatment plants.&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt; The most common solution used for wastewater treatment in Kenya are waste [[Stabilization pond|stabilisation ponds]]. One of them is the [[Dandora]] Waste Stabilisation Pond System which treats the industrial and domestic sewage from the city of Nairobi and is the largest pond system in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;H.W.

The Citizen Report Card moreover indicates that [[septic tanks]] are often used for the disposal of wastewater from flush toilets in Mombasa. Pit latrine users from Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa indicated that some wastewater empties into storm sewers, soak-aways and cess pits designed for kitchen waste, thus causing environmental pollution.&lt;ref name="crc" /&gt; In 2001 a pollution incident occurred in the town of [[Embu, Kenya|Embu]]. Raw sewage was discharged from sewage treatment works into a nearby river and caused the death of 28 people who used the water downstream for domestic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[[allAfrica.com]]: [http://allafrica.com/stories/200102260469.html Daily Nation – Typhoid Death Toll Is 28 (27 February 2001)] Retrieved 16 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Kenya experiences every three to four years droughts and floods, which affect a large number of the population. The latest severe drought was from 2007 to the end of 2009, which had impacts on all sectors of the economy. The average annual rainfall is 630&amp;nbsp;mm, but it varies between less than 200&amp;nbsp;mm in northern Kenya to over 1,800&amp;nbsp;mm on the slopes of Mount Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/kenya/kenya_cp.pdf Aquastat Country Profile Kenya], p. 1.

[[Image:KerioRiver-Flowing.JPG|thumb|300px|The Kerio River flowing after heavy spring rainstorms in the area, illustrating the stark difference in water availability between the dry and wet season.]]

Kenya is divided into five [[drainage basin]]s. The [[Lake Victoria]] Basin Drainage area system in Western Kenya is part of the [[Nile River]] Basin. The closed [[East African Rift|Rift Valley]] Inland Drainage system includes a number of rivers and lakes, including large freshwater lakes such as [[Lake Turkana]], [[Lake Baringo]] and [[Lake Naivasha]], rivers such as the [[Kerio River]], as well as a number of salt lakes.

The [[Athi-Galana-Sabaki River|Athi]] Drainage system, the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]] Drainage system and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] North Drainage system all flow towards the Indian Ocean. The water distribution in the basins is highly uneven with the highest water availability in the Lake Victoria Basin (more than 50%) and the lowest in the Athi Drainage system. Only the Tana and Lake Victoria Basins, have surplus water resources while the three other basins face deficits.

The capital city [[Nairobi]] receives its water resources from two drainage systems: The oldest sources, the Kikuyu Springs (used since 1906) and the Ruiru Dam (since 1938) are located in the [[Athi River]] Basin. The Sasumua Dam, the Ndakaini-Thika Dam (since 1996) and Chania-B Dam supply Nairobi through interbasin transfer from the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]] drainage area. About 20% of the supply is from ground water resources which corresponds to around 60,000 to 70,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jyNHmgONtk0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=%22water+resources+kenya%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SV3CbIHfYe&amp;sig=06cQMuRy7qC6JSOiVy_dryIEwHA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEjQS6qKKMGTsQbgjN2aDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=60000&amp;f=false Climate variability and water resources degradation in Kenya], p. 56.

== History and recent developments ==
The history of the water and sanitation sector in Kenya is characterised by institutional fragmentation that led to numerous inefficiencies and by subsequent attempts at reform.

===Beginnings===
The history of piped water supply in Kenya can be traced back to the period of the [[East Africa Protectorate|East African Protectorate]]. At that time water supply was focused on the needs of colonial settlements. The administration of water supply was carried out by the Hydraulic Branch of the Public Works Department, which started operating in the coastal city of Mombasa. The construction of the [[Uganda Railway]] in 1896 provided an important impetus for the development of water pipelines in the interior of the country along the railway line.

===Colonial period===
Between 1920 and independence in 1963 the first attempts were made at regulating water supply in the [[Kenya Colony|colony and protectorate of Kenya]], while responsibility was shared by many institutions. In the 1950s and early 60s, responsibility for the administration of water supply was split between three institutions: the Ministry of Works operating in urban centres with centralised water service provision; Local Authorities that were deemed capable of managing water supply; and the Water Development Department, which was responsible for developing new water supplies for urban and rural centres. Bulk water to Mombasa was provided by the Mombasa Pipeline Work, while day-to-day operations of water pipelines were carried out by the water department. There was no single framework for the administration and management of water. In 1952 the ''Water Act Cap 372'' was enacted, which remained the legal basis for the water sector until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S. Ombongi [https://books.google.pl/books?id=x7Ov-mVPjZ0C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=history+kenya+sanitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkoKTFmzu7&amp;sig=aMTmLOYgbyTrMMI1j_eMTb1IGnI&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=p4WfS6bCJYKcmwO7t5TpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20kenya%20sanitation&amp;f=false History of Water Supply and Sanitation in Kenya, 1895–2002] in Juuti, Katko and Vuorinen (Eds.)

[[File:Ke-map.png|350px|thumb|A map of Kenya.]]
In the sanitation subsector there was no functioning institutional framework either. Officially, the 1921 Public Health Ordinance gave the Ministry of Health the role of administering sanitation, but it was rarely enforced. The local population, moreover, was reluctant to adopt sanitary measures imposed by the colonial government. Between 1929 and 1939 intense public health education campaigns were carried out which led to the diffusion of pit latrines.&lt;ref name="san"&gt;Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S. Ombongi [https://books.google.pl/books?id=x7Ov-mVPjZ0C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=history+kenya+sanitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkoKTFmzu7&amp;sig=aMTmLOYgbyTrMMI1j_eMTb1IGnI&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=p4WfS6bCJYKcmwO7t5TpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20kenya%20sanitation&amp;f=false History of Water Supply and Sanitation in Kenya, 1895–2002] in Juuti, Katko and Vuorinen (Eds.)

By 1954 different types of sanitation were in use in different parts of Kenya: pit latrines were in use in most native reserves, bucket type latrines prevailed in towns while waterborne sanitation was used in the European quarters of major towns. During the [[Mau Mau uprising]] Africans were concentrated in detention camps and local markets were kept closed out of fear of rebellion. This led to the neglect of adequate sanitation and in the proliferation of communal latrines.&lt;ref name="san"/&gt;

===Independent Kenya (1963–1980)===
As Kenya gained independence in 1963, attempts at simplifying the administration of water supply resulted in the transferral of all organisations responsible for water to the Ministry of Agriculture in 1964. The distribution of responsibilities and authority was, however, unclear and led to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. In 1965 the government led by [[Jomo Kenyatta]] stated in the Sessional Paper No. 10 on African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya that government policy had to be directed towards the eradication of poverty, illiteracy and disease.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"&gt;Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S. Ombongi [https://books.google.pl/books?id=x7Ov-mVPjZ0C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=history+kenya+sanitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkoKTFmzu7&amp;sig=aMTmLOYgbyTrMMI1j_eMTb1IGnI&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=p4WfS6bCJYKcmwO7t5TpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20kenya%20sanitation&amp;f=false History of Water Supply and Sanitation in Kenya, 1895–2002] in Juuti, Katko and Vuorinen (Eds.) Environmental History of Water (IWA Publishing 2007), Section on Independent Kenya (1963–1980): pp.280–286. Retrieved 24 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This initiated a period of active involvement in water policy by the government, based on the principle that water is a social good to be either provided free of charge or subsidised. As a result, water tariffs between 1970 and 1981 were heavily subsidised and in contradiction with the principle of operating cost recovery. Throughout the 1960s, the Environmental Sanitation Programme supported by [[WHO]]-[[UNICEF]] was carried out in Kenya with the aims of developing water supplies for small rural communities, improving waste disposal methods and providing sanitary education for the rural population.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt;

The rural water supply schemes set up as part of the programme were operated by County Councils (under the Ministry of Local Government). In 1972 about 560 rural water supply schemes were running in Kenya and provided water to a population of about 664,000, UNICEF reported. Local communities also started developing their own water supplies and set up water committees:  they received training about design systems, hydraulic calculations, costs and submission methods. A follow-up study by UNICEF carried out in 1974 showed the many problems that affected these projects.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt;

In 1970 the Government of Kenya signed a credit agreement with [[Sweden]] to finance Rural Water Supply Development. The [[WHO]] was to provide a study of the water situation in the country. The study, completed in 1973, showed that in Kenya there was a major lack in senior and technical staff; while donors could provide most development funds, current expenditure could not be covered by local funds and the Government lacked a long term plan of water supply development. In response, a fully fledged '''Ministry of Water Resources Management and Development''' was created in 1974. The ministry took over government operated water schemes as well as those operated by county councils.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt; In the same year the National Water Master Plan Initiative was launched. Its primary aim was to develop new water supply schemes and secure access to potable water within reasonable distance to all Kenyans. The initiative bore the slogan, “Water for all by the year 2000.”&lt;ref name="kenya" /&gt;

===Transition period (1980–1992)===
In the 1980s, the government began experiencing budget constraints which put a strain on the ambitious projects of providing universal access to safe water and expanding the water and sewerage systems. Priority was given to the rehabilitation of existing schemes and the construction of large-scale water projects such as the Baricho and Kilimanjaro water schemes.&lt;ref name="kenya" /&gt; In 1980 a National Sanitation Council was established to sensitise the population about the health benefits of sanitation and to advise and guide local authorities on the matter. The council slowly faded without accomplishing its mandate.&lt;ref name="san" /&gt;

In 1983 a Water Use Study carried out by [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]] confirmed that the situation was unsustainable and suggested decentralisation and removing operation and maintenance responsibilities from the Ministry. To improve performance and efficiency and to reduce the financial burden of the water sector, in June 1988 the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation (NWCPC) was established. Its role was to operate water supply systems under state control on a commercial basis.

===Commercialization of local utilities===
But the centralised approach failed to achieve improvements. Thus the idea of creating local-government owned commercial utilities emerged. A Second National Water Master Plan was formulated in 1992, and a new policy approach emphasising decentralisation and a demand-driven approach was discussed at the national level. The city of [[Eldoret]] went ahead in 1994 and set up a water and sewer department with finances that were separate from the municipal budget. The utility's board includes representatives of NGOs, women's organisations, the chamber of commerce and industry and the Kenya Consumer Organization. The commercialisation of the utility in Eldoret as well as in [[Nyeri]] and [[Kericho]] was supported by the German development co-operation.&lt;ref name="Boell"&gt;Wambua Sammy:[http://www.boell.de/internationalepolitik/internationale-politik-3730.html Water Privatisation in Kenya], Global Issue Paper No. 8, [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], 2004, p. 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach was formalised by the Ministry of Local Government, through the Companies Act Cap. 486 of 1996 which allowed the establishment of publicly owned, commercially run water and sanitation companies.&lt;ref name="Nyangacha"/&gt; As of 2002, this approach had led to significant improvements in terms of reduced of non-revenue water, improved bill collection and fewer complaints in Nyeri and Eldoret.&lt;ref name="Boell"/&gt; However, other local water companies in [[Kitale]] and [[Nakuru]] had to be taken over again by the national government due to financial problems.&lt;ref name="Nyangacha"&gt;Ezekiel Nyangeri Nyanchaga and Kenneth S. Ombongi [https://books.google.pl/books?id=x7Ov-mVPjZ0C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=history+kenya+sanitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkoKTFmzu7&amp;sig=aMTmLOYgbyTrMMI1j_eMTb1IGnI&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=p4WfS6bCJYKcmwO7t5TpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20kenya%20sanitation&amp;f=false History of Water Supply and Sanitation in Kenya, 1895–2002] in Juuti, Katko and Vuorinen (Eds.) Environmental History of Water (IWA Publishing 2007), Section on Independent Kenya (1980–2002): pp.286–297. Retrieved 24 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the first National Policy of Water Resources Management and Development was published. The policy stated that the government would ''hand over'' urban water systems to autonomous departments within local authorities, and rural water supply to communities. Another provision of this document was placing water and sanitation services under single utilities. While developing the National Water Policy, the Government also established a National Task Force to review the Water Act, Cap 372, and draft amendments that would result in a complete overhaul of the sector.&lt;ref name="kenya" /&gt;

===Reorganisation of water institutions (2002–2011)===
The current legal framework for the Kenyan water and sanitation sector is based on the ''Water Act No. 8 of 2002'' which became effective in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/images/stories/Water%20Act.pdf Water Act 2002] Retrieved 18 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 Water Act introduced far-reaching reforms based on the following principles:
* the separation of the management of water resources from the provision of water services;
* the separation of policy making from day-to-day administration and regulation;
* decentralisation of functions to lower level state organs;
* the involvement of non-government entities in the management of water resources and in the provision of water services.
The implementation of these principles triggered a wide-ranging restructuring of the sector and led to the creation of new institutions. The Water Sector Reform Secretariat (WSRS) was formed as a transitional unit in the Ministry of Water and Irrigation to oversee the formation of the new water sector institutions. In 2004, the Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) was established to provide financial assistance towards capital investment costs in areas lacking adequate services (usually inhabited by the poor). A Transfer Plan was devised in 2005 (through Legal Notice No. 101 of the 12 August 2005) to direct the transfer of staff and assets from the central government to the newly founded Water Services Boards and Water Service Providers (for detailed role descriptions see the next paragraph).&lt;ref&gt;Albert Mumma [http://www.nri.org/projects/waterlaw/AWLworkshop/MUMMA-A.pdf Kenya’s new water law: an analysis of the implications for the rural poor] 26–28 January 2005. Retrieved 18 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

To guide the implementation of the Water Act, a draft ''National Water Services Strategy'' (NWSS) for the years 2007–2015 was formulated in June 2007. Its mission is to "realise the goals of the MDG declaration and the Vision 2030 of the Kenyan Government concerning access to safe and affordable water and basic sanitation by responsive institutions within a regime of well-defined standards and regulation." NWSS is based on the identification of sustainable access to safe water and basic sanitation as a [[human right]] and an economic good. Among the core commitments are: cost recovery by water service providers to ensure sustainable water and sanitation for all and the formalisation of service provision.&lt;ref name="track" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MWI - SP"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.cohre.org/store/attachments/RTWP%20-%20NWSS%20June%2007%20draft.pdf The National Water Services Strategy (NWSS)] Retrieved 3 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, MWI also elaborated pro-poor implementation plans.&lt;ref name="reform" /&gt;

In 2010 Kenya adopted a new constitution that enshrines the human right to water and sanitation in Article 43(1). Specifically, it states that every person has the right "to accessible and adequate housing and to reasonable standards of sanitation", as well as the right "to clean and safe water in adequate quantities".

===New Water Bill===
A new water bill was passed in 2015. The bill transforms the 8 Water Service Boards (Asset Holding Companies) into 47 Water Works Development Boards in each [[Districts of Kenya|county of Kenya]]. This in line with the decentralisation prescribed in the 2010 Constitution of Kenya. Also, the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation became the National Water Storage Authority, the Water Services Regulatory Board became the Water Services Regulatory Commission and the Water Services Trust Fund became the Water Sector Trust Authority. The Bill is meant as an improved version of the Water Act of 2002, rather than another fundamental reform of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ochieng|first=Wesonga|title=Kenya: Water Bill 2012 Set to Transform Water Sector|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201209250084.html|publisher=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft Water Bill 2012|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/257994-1335471959878/draft-water-bill-2012.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill - under discussion since 2012 - was finally passed by Parliament as The Water Bill, 2014 (Bill No. 7 of 2014) on July 7th, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Water Bill, 2014, Bill No. 7 of 2014|url=http://www.parliament.go.ke/the-senate/house-business/bills-from-national-assembly/item/download/1574_c32d3b3173e0e0c769a064a9afe39182|publisher=Republic of Kenya, Parliament|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy formulation and sector coordination ===
The '''Ministry of Water and Irrigation''' (MWI) is the key institution responsible for the water sector in Kenya. The Ministry is divided into five departments: Administration and Support Services, Water Services, Water Resources Management, Irrigation, Drainage and Water Storage, and Land Reclamation. Water supply is overseen by the Department for Water Services, whose functions include: formulation of policy and strategies for water and sewerage services, sector coordination and monitoring of other water services institutions. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation is also in charge of overall sector investments, planning and resource mobilisation.&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.water.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=46&amp;Itemid=63 MINISTERIAL STRATEGIC PLAN 2009–2012 – Water for all] Retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanitation policy is in the hands of the '''Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation''' (MoPHS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/health.htm Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation – Functions] Retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; To harmonise the institutional framework for sanitation MWI and the MoPHS have developed a common ''Water Supply and Sanitation Concept'' with clearly defined sanitation targets. As of early 2011, the Minister of Water and Irrigation is [[Charity Ngilu]], chairperson of the [[National Party of Kenya]], which supports Prime Minister [[Raila Odinga]]. The Minister of Health and Sanitation is [[Beth Mugo]] of the [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] of President [[Mwai Kibaki]].

Other Ministries also play a role in the water and sanitation sector. The Ministry of Education cooperates with MWI and MoPHS in the area of school sanitation by participating in Water and Sanitation Programme Committees. The Agricultural Sector Coordination Unit deliberates on all issues related to agriculture, including irrigation which is overseen by MWI. The MWI also co-operates with the Ministries of Forestry, of the Environment and of Special Programmes to further the rehabilitation and maintenance of water towers.&lt;ref name="review3"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.hackenya.org/documents/details/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=948&amp;Itemid=538 Annual Water Sector Review 2009], pp.62–64 "Intra and Inter-Ministerial Coordination" Retrieved 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation ===
'''Economic regulation.''' The regulation and monitoring of urban and rural water service provision is carried out by the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB). WASREB is a non-commercial state corporation established in March 2003 on the basis of the ''2002 Water Act''. Its functions comprise: issuing of licenses to water services boards and approval of Service Provision Agreements, developing tariff guidelines and carrying out tariff negotiations, setting standards and developing guidelines for service provision, publishing the results of sector monitoring in the form of comparative reports (such as the Impact Report).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=94 Water Services Regulatory Board – Institutional Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental regulation''' in Kenya is carried out by the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). NEMA was established under the ''Environmental Management and Coordination Act'' No. 8 of 1999 and became operational in July 2002. Its role is to promote the integration of environmental considerations into government policies, plans, programmes and projects. As regards the water sector in particular, NEMA is in charge of formulating water quality regulations (the current version was elaborated in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nema.go.ke/images/stories/pdfs/water_quality_regulations.pdf Water Quality Regulations – 2009] Retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nema.go.ke/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 National Environment Management Authority, Kenya] Retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asset management ===
As a result of sector reforms, responsibility for water and sanitation service provision has been devolved to eight [[Provinces of Kenya|regional]] '''Water Services Boards '''(WSBs): Athi (which serves the capital Nairobi),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awsboard.go.ke Athi Water Services Board] Retrieved 17 March 2010/&lt;/ref&gt; Coast, Tana, Lake Victoria North, Lake Victoria South, Northern, Rift Valley Water Services Board, and since 2008, Tanathi Water Services Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanathi.go.ke Tanathi Water Services Board] Retrieved 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Water Services Boards are responsible for asset management, that is, for the development and rehabilitation of water and sewerage facilities, for investment planning and implementation.&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.worldwaterweek.org/documents/WWW_PDF/Resources/2009_17mon/Kenya_Water_Human_Rights_brochure-final.pdf Water Sector Reform in Kenya and the Human Right to Water – October 2007] Retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the WSBs were established, they were criticised as "an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy" that lead to a "conflation of roles" because they are "both regulators (alongside the WSRB) and market actors" as well as "monoliths... that are far away from the point of service". WSBs operate under licenses, but the licensing regime has been criticised as "bureaucratic, cumbersome and confusing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=J. M. Migai Akech, Senior Lecturer in Law, University of Nairobi|title=Governing Water And Sanitation in Kenya: Public Law, Private Sector Participation and the Elusive Quest for a Suitable Institutional Framework|url=http://www.ielrc.org/activities/workshop_0704/content/d0702.pdf|publisher=Paper prepared for the workshop entitled 'Legal Aspects of Water Sector Reforms' to be organised in Geneva from 20 to 21 April 2007 by the International Environmental Law Research Centre (IELRC) in the context of the Research partnership 2006–2009 on water law sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)|accessdate=27 December 2012|pages=32–33|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service provision ===
Responsibility for water and sanitation service provision is in the hands of Water Services Boards. However, they are not required to provide services directly – they can delegate them to commercially oriented public enterprises, the so-called '''Water Service Providers''' (WSPs). Service provision is regulated by service provision agreements (SPAs) to ensure compliance with the standards on quality, service levels and performance established by WASREB.&lt;ref name="wwap"&gt;[[World Water Assessment Programme]]: [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001488/148866E.pdf Kenya National Water Development Report – 2006] Retrieved 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are two categories of WSPs:

* public utilities – there are 89 WSPs in this category, including both limited liability companies in urban areas owned by one or more local authorities and Water User Associations in rural areas. 
* '''private utilities''' – there are only two relatively small WSPs in this category, the Runda Water Company and Kiamumbi Water Project.

[[File:Kibera.jpg|thumb|300px|The population of low-income settlements such as [[Kibera]] depends on water provided by informal small service providers.]]

Informal '''small service providers''' (SSPs) provide water in both rural and urban low-income settlements. Some of them sell water from tanker trucks or through jerry cans, often at prices that are five to ten times that of piped water supply. Others are self-help groups, often run by women, who provide piped water supply. The Water Services Trust Fund is making efforts to formalise service provision in low-income settlements. It has developed two national concepts for service provision for the poor. The first one is the Community Project Cycle, which makes funds available for local communities that are willing to comply with minimum service standards. The second one, the "Urban Poor Concept" has been implemented in low-income urban areas since 2007 and has led to the construction of numerous water kiosks that meet sustainability standards.&lt;ref name="review4"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.hackenya.org/documents/details/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=948&amp;Itemid=538 Annual Water Sector Review 2009], pp.65–66 "Human right to WSS." Retrieved 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a partnership between a utility and self-help groups can be found in Nyalenda, a poor neighbourhood with about 60,000 inhabitants in [[Kisumu]]. The local utility sells water in bulk to self-help groups that in turn manage networks and water kiosks inside their neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dailymotion]] Video:[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xc7cv1_afd-rendez-vous-au-kenya-gestion-de_webcam AFD Rendez-vous au Kenya, Gestion de l'eau], accessed on 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Malindi town view.jpg|thumb|300px|A view of the old town of Malindi, a touristic city where a private company ran the water system from 1999 to 2003.]]
'''Private sector participation.''' The private sector plays a limited, but not negligible role in operating water supply systems in Kenya. Since 1975 Runda Water Limited provides piped water to the Executive Residential Housing Estate of Old Runda in Nairobi. In 2008, Runda signed a service provision agreement with the Athi WSB for the provision of water supply to the inhabitants of two residential blocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rundaestate.com/runda/runda_inner.asp?pcat=services&amp;cat=water Runda Estate Association website] Retrieved 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a service contract was signed between the NWCPC and Gauff Consulting Engineers to support local authorities in the coastal town [[Malindi]] in billing and revenue collection. The contract was extended from seven and a half months to three and a half years. After its conclusion in 1999, a management contract was signed between Malindi Water Company and the private operator for a period of four years to support the company on technical and financial aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Ballance, T. and S. Tremolet:Private sector participation in urban water supply in Sub-Sahara Africa, GTZ, 2005, quoted in:Agro Paris Tech &amp; Group SUEZ: [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/28316800/MANAGEMENT-CONTRACTS-IN-DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES Management Contracts in Developing Countries] February 2008, pp.8–9. Retrieved 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract was regarded as successful and after it expired responsibility for service provision reverted to the public sector. In the small town of [[Tala, Kenya|Tala]] in 1999, the Kangundo county council entered in a 30-year water provision contract with Romane Agencies Ltd. The contract foresees that 10% of revenues are to be paid to the town council. As of today, small improvements in service quality have been observed, but water coverage still remains a challenge.

=== Water sector arbitration ===
The 2002 Water Act also provided for the establishment of an independent '''Water Appeals Board''' to settle water-related disputes and conflicts.&lt;ref name="reform" /&gt; The Water Appeals Board was established in 2005 in Nairobi but since then only three cases have been determined. Five additional appeals are pending because the chair has resigned in March 2009 and the terms of two other Board members have not been extended.&lt;ref name="review5"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.hackenya.org/documents/details/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=948&amp;Itemid=538 Annual Water Sector Review 2009], pp.32–34 "Ruling on appeals – WAB." Retrieved 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil society===
Kenya has an active civil society including a number of local NGOs active in water supply and sanitation. Many of them are members of the Kenya Water and Sanitation Civil Society Network (Kewasnet) founded in 2007. Among other activities, Kewasnet monitors service delivery, especially for the poor, and policy implementation on water sector reforms. It also "provides information to Kenyans to enable them to be engaged and involved in the management and decision-making mechanisms of the Water and Sanitation Sector". It also "promotes a culture of consumer responsibility that pays for supplied services from utility companies, safeguards water services infrastructure and equipment against vandalism by criminals."&lt;ref&gt;Kenya Water and Sanitation Network (KEWASNET):[http://www.kewasnet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=54 What we do], retrieved on 20 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the larger Kenyan NGOs active in water and sanitation is ''Maji Na Ufanisi'' (Water and Development). It is involved in community development and infrastructure construction in urban slums and in small towns, advocates for improved sector governance and carries out research. It was created in 1998 to take over the Kenya operations of [[WaterAid]] UK when the latter decided to close down its operations in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maji na Ufanisi|title=Background of Maji na Ufanisi|url=http://www.majinaufanisi.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=128|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion, consumer feedback and allegations of corruption ==
{{See also|Corruption in Kenya}}

'''Public opinion'''. A 2008 survey of Kenyan public opinion reported that water supply is not considered as a high priority for government action. Only about 5% of respondents said that water supply was among the ten most important issues that the government should address, even though 60% think that the government is handling the issue badly. The survey also monitored instances of corruption in the sub-sector: 15% of urban and 11% of rural respondents reported that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favour to government officials to get water or sanitation services in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://next.pls.msu.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=252 Afrobarometer Survey 2008 – Kenya] Survey based on a nationally representative random sample of 1,104 Kenyans. Retrieved 20 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allegations of corruption'''. In September 2010, Water Minister [[Charity Ngilu]] admitted in Parliament that corruption was rampant in public water institutions, including all the eight water services boards and the National Water and Conservation Pipeline Corporation.&lt;ref name="Corruption"&gt;IRC E-Source:[http://www.source.irc.nl/page/55322 Kenya: Minister admits corruption is rampant in public water institutions], 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenya Water and Sanitation Civil Society Network (Kewasnet) called the statement the "height of hypocrisy and double standards", claiming that the Minister had only talked publicly about corruption in the sector after the [[Daily Nation]] newspaper had uncovered the corruption. Shortly before the chief executive officer of the Tanathi Water Services Board had been suspended after a WASREB audit of the board alleging corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[allAfrica.com]:[http://allafrica.com/stories/201009210108.html Kenya: Water Chief Sent Home As Probe Starts], 20 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The report had been published in March 2010 without action being taken for six months.&lt;ref name="Corruption"/&gt; According to Kewasnet, "governance in the water sector is at its worst and lowest ebb."&lt;ref&gt;Kenya Water and Sanitation Civil Society Network (Kewasnet):[http://www.kara.or.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=213:kewasnet-why-kenya-water-minister-ngilu-is-not-honest-on-anti-corruption&amp;catid=34:update Why Kenya water minister Ngilu is not honest on anti-corruption], 1 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feedback from consumers'''. In 2010 WASREB and local utilities helped to establish Water and Sanitation Action Groups (WAGs) consisting of citizen volunteers in Kisumu, Kakagemam, Nairobi and Mombasa to provide a forum for dialogue and for feedback from consumers. Consumer complained about inaccurate billing and metering, pipe bursts, illegal connections, poor workmanship on installations, vandalism, overcharging and corruption. Utility staff were initially suspicious and even hostile. The feedback was done in the form of focus group discussions, public hearings and scheduled meetings between citizen representatives and utility managers. While 63% of the complaints were resolved after 8 months, it remains to be seen if the system will become permanent or will be extended to other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rop|first=Rosemary|author2=Rose Lukalo-Owino |author3=Alois Muthini |title=Lessons for Regulators, Utilities and Citizens in Promoting Accountability and the Human Right to Safe Water and Sanitation Services|journal=World Water Week in Stockholm Abstract Volume|date=21–27 August 2011|pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic efficiency ==
The economic performance of Kenyan Water Service Providers is closely monitored by WASREB and made available in the ''Impact Report'' to encourage competition and spread best practices. Important indicators of economic efficiency are: collection rates, the level of [[non-revenue water]], metering ratios and labour productivity. Most Kenyan Water Service Providers do not meet the benchmarks in these dimensions.

'''Collection rate.''' In 2013-14 most Kenyan WSPs recorded good revenue collection efficiencies with an average of 93%, up from 86% in 2006-07. The worst performing utility was [[Mawingo]] with 40% of the billed amount being collected. In some utilities, the collection rate exceeded 100% because WSPs were able to collect outstanding arrears.&lt;ref name="Impact 2015 Efficiency"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact: A Performance Review of Kenya’s Water Services Sector 2013 - 2014|url=http://www.wasreb.go.ke/|publisher=Water Services Regulatory Board|accessdate=14 December 2015|pages=24 and 31–36|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-revenue water.''' On average, 42% of the supplied water in Kenya was not billed in 2013–2014, e.g. due to leakage or water theft. Only one Water Services Providers (Nyeri) met the benchmark set by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation with levels of NRW of less than 20%. In Nairobi NRW levels were 39%, in Mombasa 48%. Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million.&lt;ref name="Impact 2015 Efficiency"/&gt;

'''Metering ratio.''' The metering ratio of Kenyan water utilities was 89% in 2013-14, up from 82% in 2006–2007. There is, however, uncertainty about whether the installed water meters are in fact functioning. The metering ratio in Nairobi had been increased to 99% in 2006-07, but then declined again to 94% in 2013-14.&lt;ref name="Impact 2015 Efficiency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="impact4"&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=53&amp;Itemid=109 Metering Ratio – WASREB Impact Report 2009], pp.31–33. Retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labour productivity.''' In 2013–2014 there were on average 7 employees per 1000 water connections in Kenya, a significant improvement over 11 in 2006-07. Seven Water Service Providers, all of them large, attained good levels of labour productivity, with 5 or less workers per 1000 connections, up from only one in 2006-07.&lt;ref name="Impact 2015 Efficiency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=53&amp;Itemid=109 Staff per 1000 connections – WASREB Impact Report 2009], pp.35–36. Retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Cost recovery===
In 2014 the WSPs recovered, on average, 100% of operation and maintenance costs. However, all but four utilities fell short of the target to cover 150% of operation and maintenance costs in order to service debt and to develop their infrastructure. Water Services Boards should be cover their administrative costs through the Regulatory Levy they collect from WSPs in their service area. In fact, only Athi WSB was able to meet 115% of operational costs in 2006/2007. The other WSBs were still heavily reliant on government subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=53&amp;Itemid=109 Performance analysis of Water services boards – WASREB Impact Report 2009], pp.54–57. Retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tariff level===
The average [[water tariff]] reported in 2014 was [[KSh]] 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure is not very indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means that for the first 10 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there are problems with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff.

Information about tariffs at water kiosks is contradictory. A 2007 report about three Kenyan cities says that the unit rate for water kiosks was 10 KSh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Nairobi, 15 KSh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Mombasa, and 55 KSh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Kisumu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/11/05/000334955_20081105050028/Rendered/PDF/463040WP0Box331Card111Summary1Kenya.pdf Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007], p. 51, Retrieved 20 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same report states earlier on that water kiosk users pay 100 KSh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in all three cities, which is said to be two to five times more than what is paid by those who get their water delivered to their homes through the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/11/05/000334955_20081105050028/Rendered/PDF/463040WP0Box331Card111Summary1Kenya.pdf Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007], p. 3, Retrieved 20 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no sewer tariff in Kenya, so that properties connected to the sewer network receive this service for free, although sewerage and wastewater treatment is at least as expensive as drinking water supply. In 2013 a study commissioned by the regulator recommended the introduction of a 5% sewerage levy as a surcharge on the water bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact: A Performance Review of Kenya’s Water Services Sector 2013 - 2014|url=http://www.wasreb.go.ke/|publisher=Water Services Regulatory Board|accessdate=14 December 2015|pages=6|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides tariffs, Kenya has also introduced charges for the abstraction of groundwater and surface water.

===Tariff adjustments===
Tariff setting is the responsibility of Water Services Boards and Water Service Providers according to operation and maintenance costs. Tariffs have to be approved by WASREB, which can also mandate a WSB to formulate a tariff adjustment. There are three types of tariff adjustments, as described in the ''Tariff Guidelines'': Regular Tariff Adjustments based on the WSPs' business plan; Extraordinary Tariff Adjustments when the cost structure undergoes significant changes; Automatic Tariff Adjustments every 12 months which might be part of a service provision agreement with a WSP.&lt;ref&gt;WASREB: [http://www.wasreb.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=63 Tariff Guidelines] Retrieved 18 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 an Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment was granted to all WSPs as an interim measure to assist WSPs to meet their operation and maintenance costs. Tariffs for sewerage services are part of tariff adjustments and the aim is to reach full cost recovery also for sanitation. The ministry responsible for water is, however, aware that full cost recovery tariffs for sewerage for certain systems would make the service provision unaffordable for many connected households.&lt;ref name="review6"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.hackenya.org/documents/details/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=948&amp;Itemid=538 Annual Water Sector Review 2009], pp.48–49 "WSS tariffs." Retrieved 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment===
According to the Annual Water Sector Review 2013-14, investments in urban water and sanitation amounted to Kenyan Shilling (Ksh) 12 billion in 2013-14 (US$ 120m) compared to an investment need of around Ksh 75 billion annually (US$ 750m).&lt;ref name="Impact Investment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact: A Performance Review of Kenya’s Water Services Sector 2013 - 2014|url=http://www.wasreb.go.ke/|publisher=Water Services Regulatory Board|accessdate=14 December 2015|pages=8|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, its budget for drinking water supply and sanitation had been KSh 18.7 billion or US$242.8 million in Fiscal Year 2008–09, and thus had been higher than investments in 2013-14. In the preceding five years, the budget for the water sector had been increased by 245% from KSh 4.2 billion (US$54.5 million) in 2004–2005. 82% of funds were allocated for the water supply and sanitation sub-sector, while the rest was devoted to Water Resources Management, for Irrigation Drainage and Water Storage as well as Land Reclamation.

===Financing===
According to the regulator, "the overwhelming dependency on development partners (i.e. external donors) with over 94% of the total investment funds provided in 2013/14 (does) not augur well for the sector." The main sources of funding for Kenyan water institutions are three: government funds which had still constituted 58% of sector funding in 2008–2009, internally generated funds that had amounted to 11%, and donor contributions that made up 31% of the funds available at the time. One-third of the contributions by development partners were channelled through government budget, while the remaining two–thirds were disbursed outside the budget. Of the estimated donor funding for 2008–2009, 70% was in the form of loans, whereas grants represented 30%.&lt;ref name="review7"&gt;Ministry of Water and Irrigation: [http://www.hackenya.org/documents/details/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=948&amp;Itemid=538 Annual Water Sector Review 2009], pp.11–16 "Water sector financial turnout." Retrieved 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for measures aimed at improving access to water and sanitation in areas without adequate services – especially areas inhabited by the poor – is provided by the '''Water Services Trust Fund''' (WSTF). The WSTF receives funds from the Government of Kenya and from donor agencies and directs them to the 362 poorest locations throughout the country (identified in collaboration with Water Services Boards).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wstfkenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=26 Water Services Trust Fund – who we are] Retrieved 18 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill payment through mobile phones===
Since 2009 Kenya's largest mobile phone company extended its mobile phone bank transaction payment system [[M-Pesa]] to be used for the payment of water utility bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fastcompany|title=Kenya's M-PESA System Lets Cell Phones Control Access to Water|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/kenyas-m-pesa-system-lets-cell-phones-control-access-water|accessdate=27 August 2011|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 more than 12 million Kenyans and 85% of the urban population use mobile phones for Bank transactions. A study by the University of Oxford showed that prior to the introduction of this system residents of Kiamumbi on the outskirts of Nairobi had to make a 40-minute round trip on public transport, a wait in a lengthy queue to make a bank deposit and then present the slip at the offices of the water utility to pay their monthly bill. When the small utility serving the local water system allowed payments through M-Pesa in December 2010, within two months half their customers switched to the mobile phone payment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Timothy|author2=Robert Hope |author3=Cliff Nyaga |title=Adoption and implications of mobile phone banking for urban water services in Kenya|journal=World Water Week in Stockholm Abstract Volume|date= 21–27 August 2011|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== External co-operation ==
{{Update section|inaccurate=yes|date=December 2013}}
Kenya receives external support from several donor agencies with a currently ongoing project volume of €627 million. The major donors are, namely, the [[African Development Bank]], France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, as well as the [[World Bank]]: Other donors include: the European Commission, Italy, Finland, Japan (through [[JICA]]), the Netherlands and UNICEF. External assistance is focused on urban water supply and sanitation, with much less activities in rural areas.

In October 2006 the Kenyan Government initiated a [[Sector-Wide Approach]] (SWAp) to harmonise the activities of the development partners, the co-ordination and the implementation of projects. The SWAp helps to improve the sector dialogue between the Ministry and the donors and to strengthen cross-sectoral links. A common sector policy framework, monitoring as well as a common sector program and strategy are being developed by the major donor agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADO931.pdf USAID Kenya WSS Profile], Retrieved 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 an Annual Water Sector Review (AWSR) is carried out which helps to foster the alignment of donor projects among other things. The Development Partners have formed the Water Sector Technical Group (WSTG) to improve co-ordination and harmonisation among themselves, as well as a Water Sector Working Group (WSWG) to co-ordinate with the government. The WSTG is led by a troika and a chair that rotates on an annual basis. In 2012, the troika included Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

=== African Development Bank ===
The [[African Development Bank]] is present in the Kenyan water and sanitation sector with the following projects with a donor volume of around €70 million:
* The “Small Towns Water Supply &amp; Waste“ project (total project volume: €84.2 million),&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;1 Unit Account Value =  1.08 Euro (October 2009); Source: http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Policy-Documents/Benin%20-%20Ndali%20Nikki%20Road-%20APR%20ENG__.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; initiated in summer 2009, will focus in a period of four years on institutional development support, water supply and waste water infrastructure as well as water storage interventions in the [[Yatta, Kenya|Yatta]] area. The estimated number of beneficiaries will be 780,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdb.org/en/projects-operations/project-portfolio/project/p-ke-e00-007/ Small Towns Water Supply &amp; Waste], Retrieved 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/Kenya%20-%20Small%20Towns%20and%20Rural%20Water%20Supply%20and%20Sanitation%20Project.pdf SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT], p. 3.

=== France ===
The [[French Development Agency]] (AFD) supports the Kenyan water and sanitation sector through projects in Nairobi, [[Kisumu]] and [[Mombasa]]. In 2008 the total financing for on-going projects was €105 million, including a €40 million loan for Mombasa approved in 2008.&lt;ref name="AFD East Africa"&gt;{{fr}}[[French Development Agency]]:[http://www.afd-maroc.org/jahia/webdav/site/afd/users/administrateur/public/plaquettes/AFD_Afrique_Est_FR.pdf L’AFD EN AFRIQUE DE L’EST], November 2007, accessed on 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[[French Development Agency]]:[http://www.afd.fr/jahia/Jahia/home/Presse/Communique/CA-du-13-novembre-2008 Conseil d’administration du 13 novembre 2008 de l’AFD : engagement de 162 millions d’euros en faveur du développement, Kenya : eau et assainissement à Mombasa], accessed on 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 AFD approved a new €51 million loan for water supply and sanitation in Nairobi and Kisumu.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[[French Development Agency]]:[http://www.afd.fr/jahia/Jahia/home/Presse/Communique/pid/33409 L'AFD engage plus de 840 millions d'euros en faveur du développement à l'occasion de son CA du 25 juin 2009, Kenya : extension des services d’eau potable et d’assainissement à Nairobi et Kisumu], accessed on 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the agency also financed projects in [[Kandara]], [[Kahuti, Kenya|Kahuti]], [[Litein]] and [[Siaya]].&lt;ref name="AFD East Africa"/&gt;

=== Germany ===
Since 1975 Germany has supported the Kenyan water sector through the German [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development]], which operates through [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] in charge of technical co-operation and [[KfW]] in charge of financial co-operation. KfW has been nominated as the sector coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nairobi.diplo.de/Vertretung/nairobi/en/005__Development_20Cooperation/s__Water_20Sector.html German Embassy Nairobi], Retrieved 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's ongoing programmes amount to approximately €80 million. The main development aid objective of the bilateral co-operation is to support sector institutions in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to safe water and sanitation in urban settings and to safeguard water resources. For example, GIZ contributes to the state target within its "Water Sector Reform Programme" from 2003 to 2013: The Project has several components such as: a) supporting the water ministry in sector reform b) regulation of the water sector and poverty-oriented financing commercialisation of water supply and sanitation c) commercialisation of water supply and sanitation d) capacity-building for the Water Resources Management Authority e) introduction of recycling-oriented sanitation ([[Ecosan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtz.de/en/weltweit/afrika/kenia/1621.htm GTZ Priority Areas in Kenya], Retrieved 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden and Denmark ===
Sweden, Denmark and Kenya have a long-standing co-operation in the water sector. Since 2005 Sweden, through the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA) together with Denmark, through the [[Danish International Development Agency]] (DANIDA), has supported the Kenya Water and Sanitation Programme (KWSP) which has had a total grant budget of US$80 million during 2005 – 2010. KWSP has supported the implementation of the water sector reforms, with a special focus on institution building, rural water supply and sanitation, and water resources management.&lt;ref&gt;Embassy of Denmark, Nairobi:[http://www.ambnairobi.um.dk/en/menu/Development/Water/TheWaterAndSanitationProgramme/ The Water and Sanitation Programme], retrieved on 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____106331.aspx Embassy of Sweden, Fact Sheet on Development Cooperation with Kenya], retrieved on 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===
The [[World Bank]]’s "Water and Sanitation Service Improvement Project" for the period 2007–2012 in Kenya has a total loan volume of approximately $159 million. It supports the Athi Water Services, Coast Water Services and Lake Victoria North Services boards and, moreover, provides the Water Sector Regulatory Board and the Water Appeal Board with technical assistance. Besides investments in infrastructure the project also supports activities aimed at strengthening the commercial, financial and technical operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=356509&amp;menuPK=356542&amp;Projectid=P096367 World Bank WSS Project Kenya], Retrieved 15 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
YouCaring was founded in 2011 by Brock Ketcher, Naomi Ketcher, and Luke Miner. After returning from two years of international mission trips, the three friends wanted to continue to give back.&lt;ref name="Jain"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jain|first1=Chet|title=These Free Crowdfunding Platforms Are Making Lives Easy for Fundraisers|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293337|website=Entrepreneur India|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They created a free crowdfunding website so people could raise money to overcome hardship.&lt;ref name="Jain" /&gt; To date, YouCaring has raised over $800 million from more than 8 million donors.&lt;ref name="Woodley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodley|first1=Suzanne|title=American Health Care Tragedies Are Taking Over Crowdfunding|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-12/america-s-health-care-crisis-is-a-gold-mine-for-crowdfunding|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, YouCaring acquired GiveForward.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Megan|title=Competitor acquires Chicago-based crowdfunding site GiveForward|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-giveforward-youcaring-acquisition-bsi-20170329-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodley" /&gt; In May 2016, YouCaring became a [[B corporation|Certified B Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurst|first1=Samantha|title=Brief: YouCaring Becomes Certified B Corporation|url=https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2016/07/87627-youcaring-milestone-becoming-b-corporation/|website=Crowdfund Insider|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, YouCaring releases internal fundraising data to show which cities in America are (by their own estimation) the most compassionate.&lt;ref name="Hurst" /&gt;

==Business model==
YouCaring users create crowdfunding campaigns to raise money for personal, medical, and charitable causes. Nearly 50% of the money raised on YouCaring is for medical expenses.&lt;ref name="Ramsey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Lydia|title=Almost Half of all Money Raised Through Crowdfunding is Going Toward Medical Expenses|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/crowdfunding-for-medical-expenses-2017-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodley" /&gt; Users write an explanation of their needs, set the amount they need to raise, upload supporting photos and video, and share their fundraisers through social channels and email. Donations can be made using credit card processors PayPal, WePay, or Stripe. YouCaring trademarked the name Compassionate Crowdfunding to describe its service. YouCaring doesn’t charge a fee to those raising funds, but a third-party credit card processing fee exists. Operating costs (including salaries for YouCaring employees) are funded by voluntary donations.&lt;ref name="Jain" /&gt;

==Fee structure==
YouCaring does not charge the fundraiser a fee, but YouCaring does ask that the donor provide a "Tip" to YouCaring.&lt;ref name="Jain" /&gt; The credit card processing fee for each donation is 2.9% plus $0.30 per donation, which is paid by the donor.&lt;ref name="Serena"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serena|first1=Katie|title=Crowdfunding Sites Are Making Lots of Money Off America’s Miserable Health Care System|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/06/13/crowdfunding-sites-are-making-lots-of-money-off-americas-miserable-health-care-system/|website=Salon|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain" /&gt; All [[Comparison of crowdfunding services|crowdfunding platforms]] charge money either through the tipping fee structure that YouCaring charges or through a straight percentage which the fundraiser pays on the total amount raised.

== Biography ==
Estermann was born in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]]). She studied [[medicine]] at the [[Comenius University]], where she obtained her [[doctorate]] in 1993. One year later, she emigrated to Switzerland to marry her Swiss partner and pursue studies in [[homeopathy|homeopathic medicine]].

After obtaining [[Swiss citizenship]] in 1999, Estermann joined the right-wing [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP). In 2005, she was elected to the cantonal parliament, the [[Grand Council of Lucerne]], and in the [[Swiss federal election, 2007|2007 national elections]], she was elected to the National Council. Despite her foreign origin, Estermann is very vocal against immigration of foreigners into Switzerland.
