The '''American Architecture Awards''' &lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/about-american-architecture.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a national and international awards program for new architecture, landscape architecture, interiors, and urban planning in the United States. The program was launched by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]] Museum of Architecture and Design in 1994 to honor and celebrate the most outstanding architecture designed and built or unbuilt throughout the nation or abroad in foreign countries. The Awards Program is open to all American architecture offices and international firms with projects inside the United States from the past two years. 
 
The '''American Architecture Awards''' are organized annually with The European Center for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.

The Awards are the Nation's highest public recognition for architectural design excellence given by a non-commercial, non-trade affiliated  public arts, culture and educational institution in the United States.
 
"The [[Chicago Athenaeum]] believes that The American Architecture Awards serve the direct and distinct purpose of promoting [[Good Design]] and as a vehicle to further enlighten the general public's understanding and knowledge about architecture and the design arts," states [[Christian Narkiewicz-Laine]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The awards deadline is February 1 and the awards are given annually at the end of September by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]] Museum of Architecture and Design, and Metropolitan Arts Press Ltd. Starting in 2009 the awards were presented in partnership with The European Center for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.
 
The winning projects are selects by a jury from several hundred submissions from architectural practices in the U.S. and around the world. All submitted projects are to be designed by architects in the 50 states  or abroad two years prior to the award year.
 
Recent juries for awards have been conducted in Dublin, Ireland (2007) Athens, Greece (2008); Stuttgart, Germany (2009); Istanbul, Turkey (2010); Vancouver, Canada (2011); Seoul, South Korea (2013); Athens, Greece (2014); Phoenix Arizona (2015);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/news/schools-homes-and-museums-among-60-winning-buildin&lt;/ref&gt; and Denver, Colorado (2016) in coordination with The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, The Turkish Camber of Architects in Istanbul, The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in Vancouver, The Federation of Institutes of Korean Architects, The Hellenic Institute of Architecture, International Biennial of Architecture Buenos Aires, The Istanbul Design Biennial, and The University of Florence.

The Awards are published each year in Global Design + Urbanism by Metropolitan Arts Press.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
 
The awarded projects form an exhibition, "The City and the World", that has toured inside the United States and Europe.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''Ars Mathematica''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "[the] Mathematical Art") is a [[Paris]], [[France]]-based, international and [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1992 by Christian Lavigne and Alexandre Vitkine to promote the interconnection between [[art]], [[science]], and [[technology]], with a particular focus on digital [[sculpture]].

Since 1993, the association has organized a biennial exhibition of digital sculpture. "Intersculpt '95," the second show, was jointly sponsored by U.S.-based [[Computer and Sculpture Forum]]. During the expo, a [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] [[videoconference]] between [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and Paris resulted in the creation of a shared sculpture, "the Temple Hands," based on a concept by David Morris, and the first transatlantic telesculpture, sent by Stewart DICKSON via the Internet and materialized in Paris.

Since 1996, many digital sculptures showed during the Intersculpt events are displayed on [[Active Worlds]], in the DAAP zone founded, curated and managed by the Pr. Derrick WOODHAM (professor Emeritus at the [[University of Cincinnati]] ).

'''''Art on Paper''''' was a bi-monthly [[art magazine]] published from 1996 to 2009. The magazine's editorial scope included limited-edition prints and artists' [[book]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[photograph]]s, and [[ephemera]].

==History==
The magazine was founded in [[New York City]] in 1970 as ''The Print Collectors Newsletter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephanie Murg|title=Art on Paper Folds, but Holds Out Hope for Imminent Revival|url=http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/art-on-paper-folds-but-holds-out-hope-for-imminent-revival/278975|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=FishbowlNY|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Paul Cummings]],&lt;ref name=artf&gt;{{cite news|title=Art on Paper Closes Print Edition After Forty Years|url=http://artforum.com/news/id=24788|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=Art Forum|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Judith Goldman as [[editor]]. Within a year, Cummings sold it to Jacqueline Brody, who continued to publish it until 1996.

From the start, the title ''The Print Collectors Newsletter,'' was a misnomer. The newsletter covered artists' prints from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, but it also published on artists' books, multiples, ephemera and photography. An issue typically included a feature story or interview, industry news, reviews of recently released prints or photographs, auction reports, and book reviews. Contributors included [[Holland Cotter]], Richard S. Field, Nancy Princenthal, Susan Tallman, [[Larry Qualls]] and others.

In 1996, Gabriella Fanning, the former editor of the art magazine ''Contemporanea,'' purchased ''The Print Collectors Newsletter''. She changed the name to ''On Paper'', converted it to a [[Magazine|journal]] format and expanded its coverage to include drawings. In 1998, she changed its title and format again, this time to a full-color glossy magazine titled ''Art on Paper''. Faye Hirsch, later Senior Editor at ''Art in America'', acted as Editor-in-Chief.

Fanning sold the title in 2004 to Darte Publishing LLC, a company established by the magazine's then editor, Peter Nesbett, and two partners. ''Art on Paper'' ceased publication in December 2009.&lt;ref name=artf/&gt; Nesbett resigned under a cloud of mystery.

''[[Art in Print]]'', the bimonthly journal on artists' prints that began publication in 2011, was founded as a not-for-profit organization and has no formal relationship to ''Art on Paper'', though many of the same writers contribute.

'''''Bench Around the Lake''''' is a public artwork by [[Danes|Danish]] artist [[Jeppe Hein]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="100Acres"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park |publisher= [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |year= 2011 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork consists of fifteen individually designed yellow [[Interactive art|interactive]] [[Bench (furniture)|bench]] installations strategically placed throughout the park location. Some of the benches consist of multiple components or sections within one site.

==Description==
The artwork consists of fifteen bright [[yellow]] benches of different shapes, sizes and designs made of [[powder coated]] [[galvanized steel]]. The benches are placed at specific sites, as decided by the artist, throughout the park which borders the bank of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. Hein describes the work as "one long bench that emerges from the ground and then twists, turns, and submerges again in several locations,".&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;

==Historical Information==

''Bench Around the Lake'' is a re-interpretation of Hein's ''[[Modified Social Benches]]'' which manipulate the traditional concept of a park bench. With this artwork series Hein hopes to challenge the idea of a bench being a passive object used for sitting, as well as to promote visitors to interact with the artwork in different ways and to explore more secluded or less-used areas of the park.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; This series of benches also coincided with Hein's May 2010 temporary installation of ''[[Distance (sculpture)|Distance]]'' inside the museum.&lt;ref name="ArtDailyorg"&gt;{{cite web | author=Sarah Green | year=2010 | title=Exhibition of Interactive Work by Artist Jeppe Hein Announced in Indianapolis  | work= | publisher=Art Daily | url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=35739&amp;int_modo=1 | accessdate= 10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location History===

Working with IMA staff and Indianapolis-based [[landscape architect]] Eric Fulford, Hein selected the locations for the benches which are placed throughout the 35-acre park. The benches appear along the [[beach]]es on the [[lake]] and [[river]], a [[gully]], by fallen [[tree]]s, the park's [[Ruth Lilly Visitors Pavilion]] and other spots throughout the park's many pathways.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; The artwork was fabricated in Germany and shipped to Indianapolis and installed at the IMA by their Design and Installation crew.  The artwork was fully installed by the park's opening in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==

{{main|Jeppe Hein}}

On creating the artwork Hein states: "Once you start to experience them sequentially, you'll feel that connection between them," encouraging interaction with the artworks by visitors and the appearance of tunneling the benches have within the environment. "They are a tool for communication, and create a kind of social playroom," Hein states, referring to the functional aspects of each bench. He describes one bench as the "kissing bench" due to the sliding factor the bench has, bringing together those who sit upon it regardless of their desire to be close.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Hilarie Sheets | year=2010 | title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions  | work=Art &amp; Design  | publisher=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==

''Bench Around the Lake'' requires regular cleaning of its powder coated galvanized steel surface to discourage the buildup of potentially damaging materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center, Los Angeles, Getty Conservation Institute|year=2010|publisher=Getty Publications, Gregory M.

[[File:Bielefeld Theater.jpg|thumb|Stadttheater am Niederwall, main entrance]]
[[File:Theater Bielefeld Zuschauerraum.jpg|thumb|Auditorium as viewed from the stage]]
The '''Bielefeld Opera''' is the venue of ''Städtische Bühnen Bielefeld'' (Municipal Theatre Bielefeld) in [[Bielefeld]], Germany. It is a ''Dreisparten Haus'' (three-department house), offering [[Play (theatre)|plays]], music ([[opera]], [[musical theatre]]), and [[ballet]]. The main performance venue is the ''Stadttheater am Niederwall'' (Municipal Theatre at the Lower Wall), built in 1904 and extensively renovated from 2004 to 2006. It is the largest theater in East [[Westphalia]], offering 500 performances annually. It is under the direction of Michael Heicks; its resident orchestra is the 72-member Bielefeld Philharmonic Orchestra that also performs symphonic concerts at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf-Oetker-Halle|de}}.

== History ==
Plans to build an opera house in Bielefeld were laid in 1885 by a foundation set up the widow of the founder of the Crüwell Tobacco Company. Bernhard Sehring was chosen as architect and construction was started in 1901 on the Niederwall. The [[Art Nouveau]] building was inaugurated with a performance of [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' on 3 April 1904.

The [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|financial crisis in the 1920s]] led to discussions about reducing the number of employees or amalgamating with neighboring theaters in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]]. When the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] came to power in 1933, Director Max Cahnbley was fired and replaced by Leon Geer. The building was rebuilt in 1937 but badly damaged during the bombing of Bielefeld on the night of 26 October 1944.

It proved difficult to restart normal theater life immediately after the war as the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British administration]] forbade drama performances. Nevertheless, the opera house reopened on 1 December 1945 with a performance of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. During the renovation of the building in 1960, it was decided not to renew the Art Nouveau façade; it was reconstructed for the 75th jubilee in 1979.

The Theater Foundation Bielefeld was founded in 2001 with the purpose of renovating the building again at a cost of €23&amp;nbsp;million. It was closed in 2004 for two years, but the opera ensemble continued to perform in the Rudolf-Oetker-Halle. The opera house reopened on 19 September 2006, with a performance of Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

== ''Opernwunder'' ==
Between 1975 and 1998, under Director Heiner Bruns and [[dramaturge]] Alexander Gruber, the Bielefeld Opera became internationally renowned as the ''Bielefelder Opernwunder'' ("Bielefeld Opera miracle"), producing a series of successful rediscoveries and premiere performances. The team, which included John Dew as stage director, Gottfried Pilz as stage designer; Rainer Koch, David de Villiers, and [[Geoffrey Moull]] as conductors, helped Bielefeld Opera attract attention of the national German and British press; critics from ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', the ''[[Financial Times]]'', and New York (''[[Opera News]]'') became regular visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opern-freund.de/opernwunder.html "Bielefelder Opernwunder"] {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programming philosophy ===
In addition to operas like ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and ''[[Aida]]'', several dramaturgical ''[[leitmotif]]s'' were to be found in the programming of the ''Opernwunder'' years of the Bruns era. A number of operas from the ''Entartete Kunst'' ([[Degenerate art]]) period were performed for the first time since being banned by the Nazis in the 1930s. Publishers and opera house staff recreated lost orchestral materials for productions of [[Bohuslav Martinů]]'s ''[[Julietta]]'', Karoly Rathaus' ''Fremde Erde'', and [[Ernst Toch]]'s ''Der Fächer''. German romantic operas that had been lost since the 19th century were given new life, thus the rediscovery of [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Genoveva]]'', [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''[[Faust (Spohr)|Faust]]'' and Carl Maria von Weber's ''[[Die drei Pintos]]'' for the operatic stage. Some operas from abroad received their European premieres in Bielefeld, such as [[John Adams]]' ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'' and [[Shulamit Ran]]'s ''Der Dybbuk''. The Bielefeld Opera also produced a number of world premieres, including [[Nikolai Karetnikov]]'s ''Till Eulenspiegel'' and {{Interlanguage link multi|Michael Hirsch|de}}'s ''Das stille Zimmer''.

'''Brand New Theatre''', abbreviated '''BNT''', is the oldest student [[theater company]] at the [[University of Southern California]], and the only organization on campus to produce only student-written work. BNT was founded by Joe Douglass in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll104/id/154001/rec/164|title = Daily Trojan article on founding of Brand New Theater (see page 7):|date = November 15, 1996|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow student [[playwrights]] the opportunity to see their work produced, and give student actors and directors the opportunity to shape a show in collaboration with its writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charney|first=Amanda|title=The Land of Opportunity in Independent Student Productions|url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles-theater/tmu/02-2012/the-land-of-opportunity-in-independent-student-pro_50190.html|publisher=Theater Mania|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BNT prioritizes the inclusion of [[undergraduate]] students from outside the [[USC School of Dramatic Arts]], and USC students from widely disparate [[Academic major|majors]] and departments have participated as actors, writers, directors, and producers for BNT shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Will|title=Independent Student Productions at USC|url=http://viterbivoices.usc.edu/will/independent-student-productions-at-usc/|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's name draws from the fact that it only produces original work; every show is brand new.

==One-Act Plays==
The productions for which they are best-known, BNT produces a series of [[One-act play|one-acts]] every [[semester]]. The organization curates submissions from throughout the student body, and a reading committee made up of BNT executives and student volunteers read every show and collectively select the one-acts that will together produce the strongest show; typically four are chosen. At this point, the playwrights participate in a writing workshop to finalize their scripts, and often remain involved in the drafting and production process in collaboration with their show's director and cast.

==Full-Length Show==
In 2012, BNT produced its first full-length student-written show, and has continued to do so every [[Spring (season)|Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brand New Theatre's "Get.That.Snitch." by Achilles Capone|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/461375392/brand-new-theatres-getthatsnitch-by-achilles-capon|publisher=KickStarter|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is similar to that of the one-acts: submissions are called for, and a reading committee selects a single show to be produced.

===List of BNT Full-Length Productions===
*2012: '''Here's The Thing''' by Jake Minton
*2013: '''Get. That. Snitch.''' by Achilles Capone
*2014: '''Animal Stories''' by Molly Sharpe
*2015: '''The Adventurers Club''' by Kyle Bellar
*2016: '''Stars &amp; Shadows''' by Jonathan Stoller-Schoff
*2017: '''This Our Now''' by Olivia Cordell

==24-Hour Festival==
BNT also sponsors a 24-hour theater festival every [[Spring (season)|spring]]. From 10 pm to 10 am, individuals and teams work together to produce the script for a show or a series of shows based on a prompt. Then, from 10 am to 10 pm, the script is passed off to actors and producers, who memorize lines, block the show, acquire necessary [[Theatrical property|props]], [[costumes]], and [[Theatrical scenery|sets]], and rehearse the show. At 10 pm, the curtain goes up, exactly one day after the show was first conceived.

==Writers' Workshop==
In 2014, BNT will expand its one-acts writers workshop into an open forum that meets regularly, as a resource for student playwrights throughout USC to offer feedback and help to one another on scripts they're drafting. The workshop meets twice a month, and is not officially associated with the selection process for BNT's productions that year.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

'''Christopher Hills''' (April 9, 1926 – January 31, 1997) was an English-born author, philosopher, and scientist, popularly described as the "Father of Spirulina"&lt;ref&gt;''San Jose Mercury News'' obituary, February 2, 1997:- "Spirulina Czar"&lt;/ref&gt; for popularizing [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] [[cyanobacteria]] as a food supplement. He also wrote 30 books on consciousness, [[meditation]], [[yoga]] and spiritual evolution, [[divining]], [[world government]], [[aquaculture]], and personal health.

Hills was variously headlined by the press as a "Western Guru Scientist",&lt;ref&gt;Western Guru Scientist – ''Holistic Health &amp; Medicine'' magazine, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural Foods Pioneer",&lt;ref&gt;Natural Foods Pioneer – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Feb 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Evolutionary Revolutionary"&lt;ref&gt;"Evolutionary Revolutionary" – ''Monterey Peninsula Herald'', Jan 29, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Modern Merlin".&lt;ref&gt;Modern Merlin, Hills Seeks Answers in the Mountains – ''Oakland Tribune'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

As a successful commodities trader and art patron in Jamaica, he retired from business at an early age to follow a spiritual quest that took him around the world as a speaker, author, entrepreneur and pioneer of algae as one of the most efficient sources of food and fuel for humanity.

==Early biography==
Born in Grimsby, England to a family of fishermen, Hills grew up sailing the bleak and turbulent [[North Sea]]. In 1940 he enrolled as a cadet in nautical school and joined the [[British Merchant Navy]] during [[World War II]]. At sea, Hills had several life and death experiences that formed his views on [[karma]], divinity and destiny. On one occasion a rogue wave swept him off the deck hundreds of yards (metres) away from the vessel, but another wave picked him up and threw him back onto the ship,&lt;ref&gt;''The Movie of Life'' – Early Morning Meditations series, volume MM3&lt;/ref&gt; cutting open his forehead but saving him from freezing to death. As German [[U-boat]]s sank 2,828 merchant ships, he watched tanker crew colleagues incinerated in the flaming oil-slicked Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty thousand men of the British Merchant Navy were killed. ''Battle of Wits'', p. 280, {{ISBN|0-684-85932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, as navigating officer for an [[Esso]] oil tanker, Hills found himself docked in [[Curaçao]], where he set up shop as a [[commodities trader]] with branch offices in [[Venezuela]] and [[Aruba]].

Encountering problems with South American contract law when a client reneged on a deal, Hills moved to [[Jamaica]], where business was conducted under the [[British judicial system]]. There with the help of plantocrat philanthropist Percy Junor&lt;ref&gt;"Indisputably one of Jamaica's most successful self-made men" - ''Sunday Gleaner'', March 8, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; he founded commodity companies specializing in sugar, bananas, insurance, telegraph communications and agricultural spices pimento, [[nutmeg]]s and [[ginger]]. Financing for the first export corporation came from British businessman Andrew Hay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/18/nyregion/andrew-mackenzie-hay-73-trade-expert.html| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Andrew Mackenzie Hay, 73, Trade Expert | date=18 May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then husband of best-selling motivational author [[Louise Hay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04Hay-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=The Queen of the New Age | date=4 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the 1950s was a high-fashion model and Hills family friend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2007/04/23/hlouise123.xml Louise Hay Interview] www.telegraph.co.uk, 23 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Christopher Hills married a young English woman, Norah Bremner, deputy headmistress of [[Wolmer's School]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Her father, Bernard E. Bremner B.E.M.,&lt;ref&gt;"32 Years in Civil Defence" Mr. Bremner a leading figure in civil defence since 1930 awarded the  [[British Empire Medal]], ''Eastern Daily Press'', pg 5, Oct 11, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; was the Magistrate, Chief of Customs, and Mayor&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. and Mrs. B.E. Bremner, Mayor and Mayoress of Lynn" ''Lynn News'', July 27, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]] who in 1951 co-founded the King's Lynn Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.kingslynncivicsociety.co.uk/history.asp| title=History of King’s Lynn Civic Society | }}&lt;/ref&gt; with concert pianist&lt;ref&gt;The Times (London), Thursday, 8 July 1993; p. 4 col. D and p. 19 col. A&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy]].

The family frequently sailed to England for events such as the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] and Mayor Bremner's presenting Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] with Freedom of the Borough,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-signing-a-declaration-of-news-photo/3366713| work=[[Getty Images]] | title=Kings Lynn Ceremony | date=26 July 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which encompassed the royal family's home at nearby [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]].

==Jamaica business leader==
From 1949 to 1967, Christopher and Norah Hills became influential forces in Jamaica's commerce, art, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Music Awards, Christopher Hills Challenge Cup - ''The Daily Gleaner'', July 4, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jamaica Governor with Kapo and Christopher Hills.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.10|Governor of Jamaica Sir [[Hugh Foot]] opening a 1957 Hills Galleries exhibition showing works by Mallica "Kapo" Reynolds with Christopher Hills]]
Believing that Jamaica's strength lay in its agriculture, Christopher Hills co-founded the Jamaica Agriculture &amp; Industrial Party (AIP)&lt;ref&gt;"Statistics Support Call for Third Party" - ''Daily Gleaner'', September 13, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to the two major political parties: [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and [[People's National Party]] (PNP), both of which he felt were too busy warring with each other to look out for the middle class and the country people who were the backbone of Jamaica's rural economy. Despite competing vigorously in the polls, the Hills couple were nevertheless close friends with JLP leader Sir [[Alexander Bustamante]] and [[Norman Manley]], head of the PNP, who both served as [[Jamaican Prime Minister]]s. Norman Manley in fact had been best man at the Hills' wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Given in Marriage by Mr. N. W. Manley K.C. - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 31, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Christopher and Norah Hills founded Hills Galleries Ltd, which, in cooperation with the Prime Minister's wife [[Edna Manley]],&lt;ref&gt;"She changed Jamaica for the better" - ''Globe and Mail'', June. 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Edna Manley: The Mother of Modern Jamaican Art" - ''Woman's Art Journal'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Autumn 1986 - Winter 1987) pp. 36-40&lt;/ref&gt; became a nexus of the [[Jamaican art]] movement. The Gallery &amp; Antiques showroom&lt;ref&gt;Hills Galleries - ''Daily Gleaner'' March 3, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; at 101 Harbour Street, Kingston was built on the site of [[Simon Bolivar]]'s Jamaica residence where, in 1815, the revolutionary wrote his famous letter [[Carta de Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/jamaica-letter.html| work=The Colonial Press Inc. | title=The Selected Writings of Simón Bolívar | date=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Hills Galleries supplied and exhibited local celebrity artists [[Ian Fleming]] and [[Noël Coward]], enjoyed the patronage of British royals&lt;ref&gt;"Queen Mother and Lady Fermoy visit Jamaica" - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 22, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Morley opens Hills Galleries exhibition" - ''Daily Gleaner'', November 21, 1962, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Of Beauty and Majesty", Princess Margaret's visit - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 24, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and such high-profile clients as [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller]],&lt;ref&gt;Knodler Gallery New York - "Jamaican Paintings Join Top Bracket" - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 15, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;"Hills Dine with Elizabeth Taylor, Eddie Fisher" - ''[[Sunday Gleaner]]'', March 31, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Elizabeth Taylor buys three Gaston Tabois paintings from Hills Galleries: "Village Street", "Rock River", "Rio Cobre Dam" - ''Daily Gleaner'', March 26, 1960, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Bird Johnson]], [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Errol Flynn]]. Hills Galleries was also the main agent for [[George Rowney|Rowney's]], [[Grumbacher]] and [[Winsor &amp; Newton]] art supplies in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;"Dealer's Art" - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 22, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Through multiple exhibitions, the Hillses nurtured or launched the careers of a plethora of talented Jamaican artists, such as Gaston Tabois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121202/arts/arts4.html | work=''Daily Gleaner'', | title=Gaston Tabois First Solo Show at Hills Galleries, 1955 | date=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Abendana Spencer]], [[Carl Abrahams]], [[Barrington Watson]],&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Scott-Williams, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Barrington-Watson--A-life-in-paint_9905483 "Barrington Watson: A life in paint"], ''Jamaica Observer'', 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Huie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20001224/arts/arts2.html | work=The Jamaica Gleaner, | title=Albert Huie, First solo exhibition at Hills Galleries 1955 | date=24 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Huie More Than a Superb Craftsman" - ''Sunday Gleaner Magazine'', October 28, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Escoffery]], Karl Parboosingh, Vernon Tong and the revivalist preacher/painter/sculptor [[Mallica Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;Hills Galleries "This Is Jamaica" exhibit - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 31, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Hills opened a Hills Galleries branch on Jamaica's north coast at [[Montego Bay]], mooring his yacht, the ''Robanne''&lt;ref&gt;"Artists sail to Round Hill exhibit aboard Christopher Hills' yacht the 40-ton Robanne" - ''Daily Gleaner'', April 17, 1956, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; at Round Hill, a popular resort for foreign leaders and industrialists vacationing in the Caribbean. It was there he met then Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and CBS president [[William S. Paley]], who in 1956, sponsored a Hills Galleries exhibition of Jamaican art at Barbizon Plaza&lt;ref&gt;New York Socialites Appreciate Jamaica's "Intuitive Art" - ''Sunday Gleaner'', March 3, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Artists - ''New York Times'', March 2, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City, which awoke U.S. art collectors to Jamaica's dynamic sphere of artistic talent. The exhibition was described by the Daily Gleaner as "Epochal in the establishment of a market for West Indian art."&lt;ref&gt;A World of Glory to Record. Review by George Campbell - ''Daily Gleaner'', March 26, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The Hills family spent weekends and holidays at [[Port Antonio]] visiting friends and clients including their neighbor, novelist [[Robin Moore]] at Blue Lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;"Robin Moore's Big Marlin Bet" Telepathy experiment, ''Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', 0-916438-18-X (1975) p 593&lt;/ref&gt; There Hills met [[Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza]] who asked Hills to curate part of his art collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/28/nyregion/baron-thyssen-bornemisza-industrialist-who-built-fabled-art-collection-dies-81.html | work=The New York Times | title=Industrialist Who Built Fabled Art Collection, Dies at 81 | date=28 April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For five years many classic works of the baron's international art acquisitions decorated the walls of the Hills' home. Von Thyssen also granted Hills' children access to his private island at San San near Port Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jamentrust.org | work=Jamaica Environment Trust | title=Pellew Island | date=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Hills had just returned from sailing the ''Robanne'' to Havana when he met [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] who had given a speech honoring a visit to Jamaica by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]]. At the gallery Stevenson fell in love with Hills' George III period Sheraton bow-fronted desk,&lt;ref&gt;"Jamaican Mementoes" - ''Daily Gleaner'', September 18, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; immediately purchasing it for his own office in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Adlai Stevenson paid $328.00 with [[Northern Trust]] Company personal check No.5162 ($2,884 in today's dollars)&lt;/ref&gt; Over dinner, Hills shared his observations of simmering revolution in Cuba, while he and Stevenson compared their concepts of justice, democracy, conflict and dictatorships — a conversation that inspired Hills to publish his ideas for uplifting the world's underprivileged masses in his landmark volume ''Rise of the Phoenix''.&lt;ref&gt;''Rise of the Phoenix - Universal Government by Nature's Laws'', 0-916438-04-X (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari movement==

Hills also became an advocate for Jamaica's [[Rastafari movement]], who were being oppressed in the late fifties.&lt;ref&gt;"Rasta Spirit Knows no Boundaries" - ''Daily Gleaner'', June 22, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Rastafarians jobs as [[woodcarver]]s, free paints to poor artists, such as the now-famed Ras Dizzy and bailed them out of [[Spanish Town Prison]] while encouraging rasta brethren to sustain themselves through art and music. Christopher and Norah Hills were personally thanked for their years of support for struggling rastas by [[Mortimo Planno]], the Rasta teacher of [[Bob Marley]] and one of the few Rastafarian elders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mortimer-planno-6102816.html | work=[[The Independent]] | title=Revered Rastafarian leader | date=25 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have met with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

Hills also "reasoned" [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhian]] non-violence with [[Leonard Howell]], the original "Gong"&lt;ref&gt;Bob Marley named his record label [[Tuff Gong]] after Leonard "The Gong" Howell&lt;/ref&gt; activist who founded Pinnacle, a Rastafarian community farm at [[Sligoville]], a few miles from Hills' home. In 1958 Pinnacle was raided in a brutal crackdown by the authorities, ostensibly for growing [[marijuana]], but in fact Rastafarianism at that time was regarded by The Crown as a threat to social harmony. Hills interceded with the Prime Minister but, with an election coming, law &amp; order politics prevailed and many sustainable farming families had to leave the land. For his support, Hills was given the moniker "The First White Rasta". Unlike his skeptical friends and business colleagues, he saw Rastafarian spirituality as a righteous way of life, indeed growing out his hair and beard in solidarity and also in keeping with his emerging interest in the [[sadhu]]s and enlightened sages of India who had much in common with the vegetarian mystical Rastafarians.&lt;ref&gt;"Back to Africa" movement, Christopher Hills' speech at Addis Ababa - ''Kingston Gleaner'' July 22, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual awakening==
By 1960 Christopher Hills had accumulated a large [[Supernatural|metaphysical]] library on frequent trips to [[Samuel Weiser Books]] in New York, while writing his own books, ''Kingdom of Desire'', ''Power of the Doctrine'' and ''The Power of Increased Perception''. At 30 he retired from business&lt;ref&gt;"The Business of Art" - ''Business Sketch Magazine'', July 1961&lt;/ref&gt; and began to research multiple spiritual paths and the physics of what [[Einstein]] called [[Unified field theory]]. Prolific research papers and lectures came out of Hills' laboratory in the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)]] on subjects such as [[bioenergetics]], [[hypnosis]], tele-thought, [[biophysics]], effects of solar radiation on living organisms, resonant systems of [[ionosphere]], and capacitor effects of human body on static electricity and electron discharge of the nervous system. In 1960 he began a 30-year project to document the effects of sound and color on human consciousness and states of health.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-916438-12-0}}, pp. 108, 190, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global outreach ==

With Norah Hills running the galleries, Hills set forth on a two-year journey travelling in Asia, Europe, Pakistan and India, meeting with members of the [[United Nations|UN]] and calling on politicians, scientists and religious leaders. [[UNESCO]] hired him to shoot 1,000 photographs of their projects in faraway countries, which appeared in an exhibit at [[United Nations headquarters]].

Hills' global odyssey's itinerary grew out of publishing his views on [[conflict resolution]] and alternative government in a manifesto, ''Framework for Unity'', that was circulated to The Commission for Research in the Creative Faculties of Man, a network he had founded of thinkers around the world which, in 1961, included Prof. Oliver Reiser, [[Humphry Osmond]], Dr. [[Andrija Puharich]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], and Lady [[Isobel Cripps]], among its 500 members.

After teaming up with his good friend and noted lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] (co-founder of [[Amnesty International]]), Hills decided to search the world for a spot to establish a Center where a dedicated community could live and test his ''World Constitution for Self-Government by Nature's Laws'', which he published in a book with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christ Yoga of Peace'' - Centre Publications, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship with Nehru ==

Working his way on a speaking tour through Europe in the direction of India, Hills decided to make a precarious expedition to the remote Himalayan [[Hunza Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hunza – Dreamland of the Hillside Farmer". ''Sunday Gleaner'', Feb. 3, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; where he had long been curious about the diet and extraordinary longevity of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Balti people|Balti]] and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] hill tribes. In Pakistan, Hills was the guest of Professors Duranni and Walid Uddin at [[Peshawar's College of Engineering]]. Visiting Sufi holy men and Islamic scholars in [[Karachi]], he met [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] to discuss possible Indo-Pakistan cooperation in [[algae]] cultivation in the climatically suitable Gujrat-Sind border region, which is where Bhutto and his ancestors were from. Later, when Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup, Hills orchestrated urgent appeals to General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] for clemency, but, like many westerners protesting Bhutto's imprisonment, was ignored, and Bhutto was hanged.

In the 1950s Hills became known to Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Nehru I Knew" – ''Sunday Gleaner'', full page, May 31, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; through his friend the Deputy leader of India's Congress Party, Surendra Mohan Ghose, a Bengali revolutionary and relative of [[Sri Aurobindo]]. Hills invited Ghose to Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Ghose, Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference – ''Daily Gleaner'', Nov 7, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; to speak at the 1961 [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference]], and together they formed a partnership to promote World Union and global famine relief through [[algae aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Food from Sunlight - Planetary Survival for Hungry People'', 0-916438-13-9 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; S.M. Ghose&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Leader to announce World Centre project" – ''Daily Gleaner'', November 4, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the founders of [[Auroville]], an experimental sustainable-living International Village in [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 1962 Ghose took Hills to [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] for a personal audience with Aurobindo's successor, spiritual head of the ashram, [[Mirra Alfassa]], known as "The Mother". Later Ghose arranged for Christopher Hills' son, John Hills, to give the keynote address at the World Parliament of Youth in [[Puducherry]] in 1971.
[[File:Christopher Hills Nehru Delhi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90| Christopher Hills with Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] at [[Teen Murti Bhavan]], New Delhi]]

In 1959 Hills had lobbied Nehru to approve a government in exile for the [[Dalai Lama]] fleeing persecution in [[Tibet]] and to grant full refugee status to exiled Tibetans. He had become connected to the Tibetans through his study of [[Buddhism]] and in 1960 provided funding for the [[Young Lama's Home School]]&lt;ref&gt;Cave in the Snow: A Western Woman's Quest for Enlightenment, [[Vicki Mackenzie]], 1999, {{ISBN|1-58234-045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh]] founded by his English friend [[Freda Bedi]], one of Gandhi's handpicked [[satyagrahi]]s&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rawlinson, "The Book of Enlightened Masters". Open Court, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8126-9310-8}}, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; who became Gelongma Karma Kechog Palmo,&lt;ref&gt;The Revolutionary Life of Freda Bedi, [[Vicki Mackenzie]], 2017, {{ISBN|9781611804256}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Western woman to take ordination in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/saving-private-anushka/16096162#sthash.qqXeW0Rc.dpuf | work=Mid-Day Magazine | title=Remembering Freda | date=27 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freda Bedi is the mother of film and television star [[Kabir Bedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001934/?ref_=nv_sr_1| work=IMDb | title=Internationally acclaimed Indian actor | date=1971–2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Hills contributed to Freda Bedi's building of the Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling nunnery at [[Tilokpur]] in the [[Kangra Valley]] and helped organize her journey to the West with the [[16th Gyalwa Karmapa]], Rangjung Rigpe Dorje in 1974.

When Hills arrived in India, he found Nehru besieged by [[Sino-Indian border dispute|border disputes with China]] and discussion inevitably turned to Hills' theories of [[conflict resolution]] and how to avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Conflict - The Secret of Heart-to-Heart Communication'', 0-916438-36-8 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Their connection also evolved out of the fact that India was experiencing famine in some states. With dependence on wheat shipments from the United States, Hills helped lobby President [[Lyndon Johnson]] for an increase in wheat aid, which was granted. But when Hills mentioned his research with algae as a food source, then Nehru became interested and offered to support cultivation in India. (PDF will be posted)

While in New Delhi, Hills spent time with the prime minister at [[Teen Murti Bhavan]], enjoying Jawaharlal Nehru's rose gardens and meeting his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]]. Hills was the guest of Indian industrialist [[G.D. Birla]], where on his first day in India, he had met [[Swami Shantananda]], an enlightened sage and a remarkably politically connected guru with whom Hills would travel throughout India for two years, much like a roaming [[sanyassin]]. On one of his "pilgrimages", Hills was taken by Shantanananda and Nehru's Parliamentary Secretary [[S.D. Upadhyaya]] to [[Brindavan]] for a private audience with India's highest female [[yogini]] [[Sri Anandamayi Ma]], from whom he felt a "genuine sublime holiness" and received one of the most significant blessings in his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The One I Love'', {{ISBN|0-916438-51-1}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Patna]], [[Bihar]], Hills, along with Dr [[Raynor Johnson]], were the only Europeans to attend the 1961 Science &amp; Spirituality Conference, where seeds were sown for Hills' decade of cooperation with hundreds of Indian scientists and yogis, many of whom eventually journeyed to visit Hills' centers in the West and who comprised many of the delegates for a 1970 Yoga conference Hills staged in New Delhi.

In 1963, the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] and [[Gandhi Peace Foundation]] sponsored another conference in Patna, hosted by Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s longtime right-hand disciple and first [[President of India]]. Prasad was supposed to speak at the conference but became ill, and Hills' guru Shantananda was leading prayers for him every day at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Prasad requested to meet Hills, whose goals for World Union he had heard about from Nehru. Hills considered Prasad the most spiritual of the founders of Independent India, and their meeting was a profound encounter in which Prasad gave his blessing for Hills' global endeavors, but then the president lost consciousness, tightly holding onto Hills' hand.&lt;ref&gt;''The President's Last Words – The One I Love'', {{ISBN|0-916438-51-1}}, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy that the man who, through [[satyagraha]], had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said his last words to an Englishman.

== Microalgae International ==
In earlier travels from Jamaica to Japan, Hills had formed an [[aquaculture]] research company with his friend and colleague, biologist Dr Hiroshi Nakamura, Dean of [[Tokyo Women's University]]. Dr Nakamura was a noted scientist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=dr+hiroshi+nakamura&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gL-Se-olT7&amp;sig=eqhGViSlNxrXr4kafgW76OL0s3E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8RrUTsXIFOKoiALq74C5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dr%20hiroshi%20nakamura&amp;f=false | work=Yoga Journal | title=SPIRULINA - Food From The Sun's Light | page= 44 |date= May–June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a colleague of Emperor [[Hirohito]] (himself a marine biologist) who asked Nakamura to research alternative food sources for Japan after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had devastated food supplies. The goal of Hills and Nakmura's organization Microalgae International Union, was to develop strains of algae as a way of harnessing the sun's energy for [[biofuel]]s and human nutrition and as a solution to World Hunger.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World'', 0-916438-47-3 - Micro Algae International Union, pp. 5, 69, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Presented with M.I.U.'s [[feasibility studies]], Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed Hills' proposal for bringing the cultivation of protein-rich [[Chlorella]] algae to the villages of India.&lt;ref&gt;''Food from Sunlight'', 0-916438-13-9, pp. 103–109&lt;/ref&gt;

With India's Home Minister, [[Gulzari Lal Nanda]], Hills had co-founded the Institute of Psychic and Spiritual Research in New Delhi. A devout Gandhian, Nanda feared social upheaval and possible communal violence if poor and hungry villagers started migrating to India's cities so he threw his support behind Hills' plan for developing rural economies via small footprint aquaculture that could help villages become sustainable. A detailed plan for a pilot project in the [[Rann of Kutch]] was approved by the Indian government. However, the initiative became mired in bureaucracy when Nehru died in 1964. Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the [[chlorella]] algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to political jockeying as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/43-years-on-mystery-shrouds-postmortem-of-shastri/497076/ | work=Indian Express | title=Mystery of Prime Minister Shastri's Death | date=2 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Tashkent Declaration|1966 India-Pakistan peace conference]] in [[Tashkent]], the project lost its key sponsor.

Nevertheless, the networks Hills had established with the founders of modern India proved valuable when his son, John Hills, was introduced by Nanda and S.M. Ghose to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], who helped the younger Hills&lt;ref&gt;"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet", ''Hindustan Times'', Sept 17, 1970, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; garner support among India's Congress party and religious leaders for India's largest conference of Western scientists and Indian yogis.&lt;ref&gt;"World Conference on Scientific Yoga" – ''Times of India'', Nov. 30, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centre House, London ==

[[File:BKS Iyengar Centre House.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.70|Members of Centre House community with Hatha Yoga teacher Malcolm Strutt and Yoga Master [[B.K.S. Iyengar]]]]
Three years after [[History of Jamaica#Independent Jamaica|Jamaica's 1962 declaration of Independence]] from Britain, the Hills family moved to London, at the suggestion of two of his mentors, Bertrand Russell and [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet]]. They helped Hills find and purchase a six-story Edwardian building in London's leafy [[Kensington]]. There Christopher Hills and others, including Kevin Kingsland, founded Centre House, a self-discovery and human-potential community&lt;ref&gt;"The Superman Project", ''News of the World'', Dec 5, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; known as a nucleus of yoga and spirituality in the emerging [[New Age]] movement throughout the late sixties and seventies. Seekers came from all over the world to study with visiting gurus, such as [[Swami Satchidananda]], [[Muktananda]], [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], [[Sangharakshita]] and [[John G. Bennett]] as well as Sanskrit scholar Dr. Rammurti Mishra,&lt;ref&gt;Rammurti S. Mishra - ''Yoga Sutras: The Textbook of Yoga Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christmas Humphreys]], Tibetan [[lama]]s, chief [[Druids]], [[homeopathic]]  doctors and scientists studying meditation, telepathy and [[neuroplasticity]] in Hills' Yoga Science laboratory. It was here Christopher Hills wrote his magnum opus, ''Nuclear Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-916438-12-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; - recognized as a definitive treatise on the [[chakra]]s as they relate to the human [[endocrine system]], light frequencies and human personality. [[Yoga Journal]] described the book as, "Synthesizing a vast amount of information ranging from the structure of [[DNA]] to the [[metaphysics]] of consciousness" and also as, "A giant step forward in integrating science with religion in a meaningful way."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yoga Journal]] '' magazine - The Rainbow Body, March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Centre House was an experiment in group consciousness where the majority of residents were well-educated students, teachers and scientists interested in the convergence of [[science and spirituality]]. For a while the large basement kitchen was a [[macrobiotic]] restaurant, first run by [[Craig Sams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Days In The Life: Voices from the English Underground 1961-1971 | first = Jonathon | last = Green | author-link = Jonathon Green | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=am6TOJ9tNscC&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;vq=february%2014&amp;dq=days%20in%20the%20life&amp;pg=PT190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 1988 | publisher = Heinemann | isbn = 978-1-448-10444-4 | quote = "I remember Christopher Hills, who ran the Centre House, calling down one day, 'Can you please not smoke marijuana - we can smell it on the third floor.'

Its founder, Muz Murray (Ramana Baba),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mantra-yoga.com/| title=Gandalf's Garden publisher Muz Murray aka Ramana Baba | }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the early residents of Centre House and there published the first issues of ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'' magazine, a publication chronicling the vitality of London's New Age scene. Kevin Kingsland went on to found the [[Centre for Human Communication]] in Devon and Grael Associates (a [[The Community Company|Community Company]])..

== World Conference on Scientific Yoga, New Delhi ==

In December 1970 Christopher Hills, his son John, and Kevin Kingsland organized the world's first World Conference on Scientific Yoga (WCSY)&lt;ref&gt;"World Yoga Conference" – ''Times of India'', Nov. 30, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; in New Delhi, bringing 50 Western scientists together with 800 of India's leading swamis, yogis and lamas to discuss their research and establish a network for the creation of a World Yoga University.
[[File:John Hills with Dhirendra Bramachari and Amrit Desai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|John Hills discusses the World Conference on Scientific Yoga program with [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] and [[Amrit Desai]] in New Delhi]]

The conference generated some controversy&lt;ref&gt;"Masters of Emotions – Yogis Wind Up Parley By Losing Tempers", ''Los Angeles Times'', Dec 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; when Indian politics intersected with religion,&lt;ref&gt;"Yogis Act Unyogalike", ''The Daily Herald'', Dec 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the concept of ''Christ Yoga'', a book Hills had written linking Christ's teachings to those of [[Buddha]] and the [[Vedas]]. But the conclave nevertheless emerged as a milestone in the soon-to-be-booming migration of Indian yogis to the West. John Hills,&lt;ref&gt;"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet", ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', Sept 17, 1970, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; helped by his father's prior relationship with Nehru, worked with India's Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and the Nehrus' yoga master [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] to steer a fractious committee of MPs, ministers and often competitive spiritual leaders from disparate religions and castes into creating a uniquely diverse and widely hailed program of events.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, Dec 27, 1970 – "World Conference on Scientific Yoga"&lt;/ref&gt; Presenters from the West included [[transpersonal psychology]] pioneer Dr. [[Stanislav Grof]] and Dr. [[Sidney Jourard]] who compared their research in lively sessions with Indian scholars, scientists, philosophers and yogis such as [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], Shri [[K. Pattabhi Jois]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Swami Satchidananda]], Padma Bhushan [[Murugappa Channaveerappa Modi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec202005/spectrum1291520051219.asp | work=[[The Deccan Herald]] | title=Man With A Vision | date=20 December 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212072444/http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec202005/spectrum1291520051219.asp | archivedate=12 February 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; R.R. Diwaker, [[Swami Rama]], Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martand, [[Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center]] and yoga hospital founder Dr. [[G. S.

The actor [[James Coburn]], a yoga and martial arts practitioner, described the World Conference on Scientific Yoga as "Very rewarding for me, definitely worth the time and money getting here."&lt;ref&gt;"Yogi Film Moghul" – ''[[Times of India]]'', Dec 23, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the conference, Dhirendra Brahmachari presided over the wedding of organizer Kevin Kingsland and yoga teacher Venika Mehra. James Coburn also attended. Kevin and Venika Kingsland went on to establish various Centres for Human Communication in the UK, USA and India, teaching yoga, human communication and promoting community consciousness.

Post-conference, the select delegates' presentations were published in ''CHAKRA'' magazine, founded with the help of [[Tantra]] scholar Ajit Mookerjee and Indian art patron Virendra Kumar and edited by John Hills whose first venture in publishing was mentored by [[Baburao Patel]] M.P., editor of ''[[Filmindia]]'' and ''[[Mother India (magazine)|Mother India]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor's Welcome" - ''CHAKRA Magazine'', Vol 1, March–May, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was deemed a success and Christopher Hills was elected by a majority of the delegates to establish a World Yoga University somewhere on the planet. A mission that would take him from the United Kingdom to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Yoga University Seeks Site" - ''San Mateo Times'', March 4, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of the Trees ==

As the spiritual axis shifted to America, Christopher Hills visited his friend [[Laura Huxley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/17/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries | work=[[The Guardian]], | title=Laura Huxley Obituary | date=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who urged him to move to the United States where he settled in [[Boulder Creek, California]], and became a U.S. citizen. There, amidst the ancient [[redwoods]], he founded in 1973,&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"/&gt; an accredited college, University of the Trees, an alternative education and research center for the social sciences to study the laws of nature and their relation to [[human consciousness]].&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"/&gt; Students lived on campus and studied subjects as diverse as [[Radionics]] and [[dowsing]] (Hills was a well-known diviner&lt;ref&gt;"Incredible Feat" – ''[[National Enquirer]]'', June 22, 1976, p. 14 (Diviner finds stolen loot for Santa Cruz Police)&lt;/ref&gt;), meditation, [[hatha yoga]], [[the Vedas]], and early forms of social networking he called "Group Consciousness".

The campus housed University of the Trees Press which published Christopher Hills' writings and the research of a number of resident students who obtained degrees at the university and wrote books on light &amp; color frequencies and the science of [[Radionics]]. A small workshop produced [[pendulums for dowsing]] and a line of [[negative ion generators]]. With the buildup of the vitamin business surrounding discoveries that spirulina had significant weight loss benefits University of the Trees became one of the largest employers in the [[San Lorenzo Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;"From Counterculture to Mainstream" – ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' (Cover), Aug 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and leased more than 10 buildings in Boulder Creek for housing students and warehousing for Light Force,&lt;ref&gt;"Spirulina – Miracle Pill or Mind Pill? " – ''[[The Press Democrat]]'', September 24, 1981, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; a burgeoning nutritional products brand based on spirulina.

From this base in California, Hills extended his hospitality to a pantheon of visiting scientists, writers, philosophers and scholars such as [[Alan Watts]], [[Edgar Mitchell]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Thelma Moss]], [[Hiroshi Motoyama]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], Sri Lanka president Ranasinghe Premadasa, [[Menninger Foundation]]'s [[Swami Rama]], Dr. [[Evarts G. Loomis]], [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]], [[Max Lüscher]], [[Marcia Moore]], Bernard Jensen and countless others in the fields of human potential, holistic health, aquaculture, religion, quantum physics and [[alternative medicine]].

== Supersensonics ==

Within the campus, Hills founded an experimental laboratory, managed by physicist Dr. Robert Massy,&lt;ref&gt;"Revealing Look Into World Of Luminous Revelations" - ''The Times, San Mateo'', September 22, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; to develop his theories on the Electro Vibratory Body – documenting what Hills' colleague Stanford University's [[William A. Tiller]] Ph.D,&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117924009/ | title=''What the #$*! Do We Know!?'' (Film review) |author=Robert Koehler |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=June 2, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls "subtle energies" or "psychoenergetics". Shortly before he died [[radionics]] pioneer [[George de la Warr]] donated a substantial portion of his research files, library and instruments to Christopher Hills. In 1975 Hills wrote the book ''Supersensonics — the Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', widely considered "The Bible of dowsing"&lt;ref&gt;''Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', 0-916438-18-X (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The book sheds new light on divining, telepathy, [[The I Ching]], [[Egypt's Pyramids]], [[Biblical miracles]] and discusses the value of low level extrasensory phenomena vs higher levels of insight, wisdom and consciousness. ''[[New Age Journal]]'' magazine called ''Supersensonics'' "A short course in miracles for scientist and seeker alike."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Age Journal]]'', July/August, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

== International philanthropy ==

With the [[Cold War]] in full swing liberation from the evils of totalitarianism was a constant theme in Hills writings. He lobbied hard against the [[KGB]]'s persecution of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the internal exile with police surveillance of [[Andrei Sakharov]] and the denial of an exit visa for [[Natan Sharansky]]'s emigration to Israel.[[File:Afghan Award to Christopher Hills.jpg|right|thumb|220px| Award presented to Christopher Hills for his humanitarian services during the [[Afghan-Soviet war]]]] Christopher Hills' lifelong crusade against dictatorships and Man's inhumanity was manifested in the book ''Rise of the Phoenix'' while his passionate beliefs against deficit spending were set forth in a book on the global economy — ''The Golden Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Egg'' - 0-916438-32-5 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme throughout all Christopher Hills' approaches to world, local and family problems was a process he developed called "Creative Conflict" — the same principles of solving differences between individuals, political parties and even nations that Hills had debated with Adlai Stevenson, Nehru and Luis Kutner.

Throughout the seventies and eighties Hills focused on international affairs, particularly the emergence of democracy in the Soviet Republics, eventually traveling to Russia to meet with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] where he joined the [[Soviet Peace Committee]]. U.S. Presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] bestowed awards on Hills for his commitment to democratic freedom and his humanitarian support for victims of oppression.

The Christopher Hills Foundation donated more than $9 million worth of spirulina products to charitable organizations in the U.S. and abroad. When the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan]], Hills learned from his friends in Peshawar that Afghan freedom fighter [[Ahmad Shah Masoud]]'s mujahadeen troops as well as Tajik and [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribals were starving because supply routes had been cut by Russian forces. Hills donated and shipped $300,000 worth of spirulina, which was packed in by mules with help from Senator [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] to sustain the Afghans.&lt;ref&gt;Hills received a Humanitarian Award from the Afghan National Islamic Council, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Sri Lanka president [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]], struggling to find a formula to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], traveled to Boulder Creek to meet with Hills and learn more about his conflict resolution concepts. The two men shared a spiritual connection and established a close friendship. Premadasa then brought the Ceylon conflict closer to a democratic solution than any other Sri Lankan president had. However, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] hierarchy had split and in 1993 a faction assassinated Premadasa in a suicide bombing that killed 23 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-03/news/mn-30648_1_tamil-rebels | work= Los Angeles Times| title=Assassination Clues Point to Tamil Rebels | date=3 May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirulina: food from sunlight==

Hills and Nakamura had a vision of feeding the world from lakes, seas and backyard aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, ''Food from Sunlight'' which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on [[chlorella]] but its cellular structure was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at [[Lake Chad]] were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in [[Ethiopia]]. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of spirulina samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation.

For millennia spirulina had been a food staple for natives of Lake Chad and also for the [[Aztecs]] but Hills funded much of the early experimentation needed for its successful modern day mass cultivation, described in Dr Nakamura's book ''Spirulina: Food for a Hungry World''.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World'', 0-916438-47-3&lt;/ref&gt;

To manufacture spirulina nutritional products Hills started the Light Force company in Santa Cruz, California, which was one of the early models for [[multi-level marketing]]. Customers began reporting weight loss and health benefits from spirulina and the success story was featured in ''[[The National Enquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Doctors Praise Safe Diet Pill" – ''National Enquirer'' (Cover), June 2, 1981, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Sales skyrocketed into the millions of dollars propelling Light Force to 50,000 distributors worldwide. To grow that much spirulina Hills formed joint ventures with Koor Foods in [[Eilat]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;Hills-Koor Red Sea Negev Algae Partnership - How to Feed the Hungry, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan Aqua in [[Taipei]] and Sosa Texcoco at [[Lake Texcoco]] in [[Mexico]]. Hills also had an association with Cyanotech on the [[Big Island of Hawaii]] which grew a very pure Pacifica brand of spirulina. By 1995 more than 5000 tons of spirulina a year were being imported for Light Force products. To encourage domestic research and production Hills purchased a 150-acre farm and built raceway ponds filled from the land's own natural geothermal aquifer in [[Desert Hot Springs, California]]. Professor Nakamura's student and protégé Dr Kotaro Kawaguchi relocated from Japan as chief research scientist and working with Sebastian Thomas, an algae cultivation expert from India, they refined desert-grown spirulina into consumable powder using the world's first {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[Solar dryer|solar heated dryer]].

While a staff of 40 ran the Southern California "Green Gold Farms," harvesting its own U.S.-grown spirulina for Light Force, Hills built a {{convert|13000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home/laboratory on a mountain in the redwoods of Boulder Creek, California, dedicated to researching [[neutraceuticals]] and as a gathering place for scientists, innovators and spiritual "map makers". Three years after moving to the new home Norah Hills died from [[Alzheimers]] eliciting an outpouring of affection from the many who had seen her as the "divine mother" and a significant force in all that Christopher Hills had achieved.

At the property he built a [[Hollywood]] quality video production studio to produce films on Enlightenment and, through new media, to inspire people to celebrate what he called the "Divine Goddess".&lt;ref&gt;''The Visionary State'' - 0-811848-35-3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The studio is run today by his second wife, artist/producer [[Penny Slinger|Penny Slinger Hills]].

In 1996, after three decades of globetrotting, Hills visited [[Vietnam]] to invest in a naturally carbonated underground spring water venture. He contracted an obscure virus which caused a deterioration of his health. Light Force and the research company Biogenics were sold to Royal Body Care which continued to market the products.

Christopher Hills died at home January 31, 1997&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-10/news/mn-27264_1_christopher-hills| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| title=Christopher Hills; Natural Foods Pioneer, Microbiologist | date=Feb 10, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his wife Penny Slinger Hills, two sons, John Hills and Anthony Hills and four grandchildren. He believed that "Algae biomass was God's way of providing an inexhaustible source of energy from the sun". Today millions of health conscious people enjoy the health benefits of spirulina in myriad products worldwide. Recent innovations have moved algae to the front burner as researchers recognize its efficiency as a carbon sequestration mechanism and alternative biofuel.

Hills' legacy of bio-innovation and commitment to hunger relief is being carried forward by the Christopher Hills Foundation.

[[File:KLAMATH RIVER - NARA - 543095.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Confusion Hill in 1972]]
'''Confusion Hill''' is a [[roadside attraction]] in [[Piercy, California]].  The attraction, which opened in 1949, includes what is dubbed as a "gravity house," a structure built to give the interior visitors tilt-induced [[optical illusion]]s, similar to the perspective on a [[gravity hill]].  Occupants experience the need to stand upright when they actually already are.

Also included in the attraction is the [[Mountain Train Ride]] a 1½ mile, {{RailGauge|20in}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] built in a [[Zig zag (railway)|switchback]] layout along the side of a steep hill.

For 60 years, Confusion Hill was on the heavily traveled [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] highway, also known as the Redwood Highway.  Due to repeated mudslides obstructing the road, US 101 was realigned in 2009 to the [[Confusion Hill Bridges]], bypassing the attraction.  In 2010 Confusion Hill was granted [[California Points of Historical Interest]] status.&lt;ref name="PD1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Confusion Hill gains historical interest status  |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20100129/ARTICLES/100129327?tc=ar |publisher= ''[[The Press Democrat]]'' |date= January 29, 2010 | last=Anderson|first= Glenda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Confusion Hill signage.jpg|thumb|Signs at Confusion Hill, 2016]]
In 2016, [[Alex Hirsch]], creator of the television series ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', installed a statue of series villain [[Bill Cipher]] at Confusion Hill, after it was removed from its initial home of [[Reedsport, Oregon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Creative Partnerships''' was the UK government's flagship creative learning programme, established in 2002 as part of the Council's SR2000 settlement to develop young people's creativity through artists' engagement with schools in nominated areas across England. Following the 2010 election of the coalition government, funding was cut by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Arts Council England in 2011, with activity in schools ending in summer 2011.

==Aim==
It aimed to build sustainable learning partnerships between schools, creative and cultural organisations and individuals.

==Methods==
Creative Partnerships facilitated many long-term links between schools and creative professionals, such as artists, architects, scientists and multimedia developers. Research reports covering many different aspects of the programme, conducted by researchers from a number of universities and consultancies, are available online. Reports include literature reviews about creativity and education, teacher identity, pupil wellbeing and tracking progression in creativity; evaluations and surveys of the programme; and qualitative research investigating pedagogy, wellbeing and progression.  https://archive.is/20131017205459/http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/tag/research

== Who delivered Creative Partnerships? ==
Between 2002 - 2009, local Arts Council offices delivered the programme in 36 areas of England. Peter Jenkinson OBE was the first national director of the programme and he was succeeded by Paul Collard. 
Between 2009 - 2011, responsibility for Creative Partnership was transferred to [[Creativity, Culture and Education]].  Creativity, Culture and Education, chaired by Paul Roberts with Paul Collard as CEO, funded 25 organisations to deliver Creative Partnerships in their local area. These were a range of independent and ‘host’ cultural organisations, with many of the individuals working there transferring from Arts Council England.

==Funding==
The organisation was managed by [[Arts Council England]] and funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with additional funding from the Department for Education. It was finally managed by [[Creativity, Culture and Education]] (CCE).

[[Image:Sklepienie kryształowe kościół św. Anny w Warszawie.JPG|thumb|A diamond vault at the [[St. Anne's Church, Warsaw|former Bernardine monastery]] in [[Warsaw]] (1514)]]
A '''diamond vault''' is a form of [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] [[church architecture]] used in the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style, which is based on an elaborate system of cavernous vaults in a manner resembling diamonds. It was widely used especially in [[Central Europe]]an countries.

Diamond vaults are concave-convex ceilings so complex that, as their name suggests, they invoke the facets of a cut gemstone. First appearing in 1471 at the palace of Albrechtsburg in Meissen, Germany, they were employed for almost a century in locations as far apart as Gdansk on the Baltic to Bechyne in Southern Bohemia (today's Czech Republic).
From the historical point of view, diamond vaults show the continuing vitality of the Gothic architecture in Central Europe, at a time when the rediscovery of the classical past in Renaissance Italy was changing the course of building. Architecturally, they offer some of the most impressive examples of geometrical experimentation and versatility in both secular and sacred spaces.

The design of diamond vaults involved an understanding of how the whole interior is shaped through a correlation of its geometry, spatial composition and support system. The vaults have the ability visually to integrate or to compartmentalise interiors, to make them appear to expand through seamless recession or to diminish them by the presence of claustrophobic, heavily projecting ridges. They can add an element of playful irregularity to symmetrical spaces, or conversely can harmonise oddly shaped interiors. Their plasticity is enhanced by the contrasting play of light and dark across their surfaces. 

Diamond vaults are among the most original, yet least-known, creations of the mediaeval architecture.

The '''Drosten Stone''' is a carved [[Pictish stone]] of the 9th century at [[St Vigeans]], near [[Arbroath]], [[Scotland]]. In [[academic]] contexts it is sometimes called ''St Vigeans 1''.
&lt;!--pictures would be good--&gt;
&lt;!-- added, Aug 2008 --&gt;
The Drosten Stone is a Class 2 cross-slab: a flat rectangular stone with a cross carved on one side and  symbols on the other. The stone is unusual in having a non-[[ogham]] inscription.
[[Image:Pictish.stone.St.Vigeans.inscription.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Drosten Stone, showing the inscription.]]
The inscription is read as:&lt;blockquote&gt;DROSTEN:&lt;br&gt;IPEUORET&lt;br&gt;[E]TTFOR&lt;br&gt;CUS&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Thomas Owen Clancy]] has interpreted the text as [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]], giving ''Drosten, i ré Uoret ett Forcus'' (Drosten, in the time of Uoret, and Forcus). Clancy notes three possibilities for the origin of the stone. One is as a [[monument]] to a noble or ecclesiastic called Drosten, a common [[Picts|Pictish]] name related to Tristan, who died in the reign of Uoret and Fergus. The second possibility is a dedication to the popular Pictish Saint [[Drostan]], or perhaps to Saints Drostan and Fergus. The final possibility noted by Clancy is that Drosten and Fergus had the stone made. Clancy believes the stone should be dated to the reign of the Pictish king [[Uurad]] (i.e. Uoret) (839&amp;ndash;842), again, an unusual feature in that Pictish stones can rarely be so precisely dated.

'''''EuroTrump''''' is a 90-minute long documentary, which follows [[Geert Wilders]]' campaign for Prime Minister of the Netherlands during the [[Dutch general election, 2017]] and compares him to the U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]. It was directed by [[Stephen Robert Morse]] and [[Nick Hampson]], and co-written by Morse and [[Maria Spinger]]. 

== Background and production ==
Geert Wilders, a right-wing politician in the [[Netherlands]], decided to run for [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2017]]. Stephen Robert Morse was fascinated by this, particularly after American politician [[Donald Trump]]'s successful presidential election and the [[United Kingdom]] leaving the [[European Union]]. He, along with Nick Hampson and Maria Springer, decided to make a documentary which follows Wilders campaign, and compares him to Donald Trump.&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/news/eurotrump-documentary-mba-alumni-airs-tv|title=EuroTrump documentary by MBA alumni airs on TV|work=Oxford University Saïd Business School|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wilders’ was the first big election in the world after Trump, which is what drew us to the project in the first place. We wanted to make a movie about an election that involved an outsider, someone from the traditional right wing," Hampson said.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Kelsey |title='EUROTRUMP' Documentary Provides Inside Look at Geert Wilders |url=https://observer.com/2017/10/documentary-eurotrump-provides-inside-look-at-geert-wilders/ |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Observer]] |publisher=Joseph Meyer |date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Robert Morse]] and [[Nick Hampson]] co-directed the documentary, and [[Maria Spinger]] co-wrote it. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Davidson, a music scholar from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt;

The filming began in December 2016, a couple of days after a trial where Wilders was convicted of hate speech, which concluded with the judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, deciding that the court would not impose any punishment on Wilders following the trial.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Persio |first1=Sofia Lotto |title=Is Geert Wilders Really The Dutch Donald?

The Dutch press were not supportive of the documentary; however, Morse stated, "I think that’s an ignorant approach. You should try understand the people who disagree with. If you don't have an in-depth understanding of someone it makes it very challenging to understand their viewpoint, if you don't understand where those views came from."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Morse stated that throughout the whole production time span, the production team applied the lessons they learned at the [[Saïd Business School]].&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; Morse thought that even though Wilders' had such strong beliefs politically,  he was a likeable person; at their first meeting for the documentary, Wilders' and Morse made each other laugh often, despite Morse expecting Wilders' to be "a monster."&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;

The documentary follows Wilders' campaign and provides an up-close view of him, discussing what his ideas are politically, including clearing Islam from the [[Netherlands]] and shutting down all [[mosques]],&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; as well as providing information about himself, such as talking about his two cats and describing himself as a "spoilt child."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; The documentary also discusses how Wilders' constantly has strict security around him, and how it affects him.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; Morse describes the comparison between Wilders and Trump as ironic, due to how little they have in common.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Morse thought that his work producing ''[[Amanda Knox]]'' allowed Wilders to trust him more; many journalists would have a much more difficult time getting up-close to Wilders.&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; The show premiered on [[Hulu]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Gabe |title=What’s on TV Monday: ‘The Rape of Recy Taylor’ and ‘Strangers’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-the-rape-of-recy-taylor-and-strangers.html |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[A.G.

'''Feminist art criticism''' emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=n.paradoxa|date=Sep 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of [[art criticism]].

== Emergence ==
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s 1971 groundbreaking essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", analyzes the embedded privilege in the predominantly white, male, Western art world and argued that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?| work = Women, Art and Power and Other Essays | year=1971 |publisher= Westview Press|url=|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, as well as questioning which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]: "...it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genius===
Nochlin challenges the myth of the Great Artist as 'Genius' as an inherently problematic construct. '[[Genius]]' “is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the person of the Great Artist.”&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;
This ‘god-like’ conception of the artist’s role is due to "the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; She develops this further by arguing that "if women had the golden nugget of artistic genius, it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself. Q.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget of artistic genius."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; Nochlin deconstructs the myth of the 'Genius' by highlighting the unjustness in which the Western art world inherently privileges certain predominantly white male artists. In Western art, ‘Genius’ is a title that is generally reserved for artists such as, van Gogh, Picasso, Raphael, and Pollock—all white men.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; As recently demonstrated by Alessandro Giardino, when the concept of artistic genius started collapsing, women and marginal groups emerged at the forefront of artistic creation.&lt;ref&gt; Alessandro Giardino, ''[https://www.academia.edu/35257521/_Caravaggio_and_the_Enfranchisement_of_Women._New_Discoveries_Theory_in_Action_2017 "Caravaggio and the Enfranchisement of Women. New Discoveries"_]'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum organizations===
Similar to Nochlins’ assertions on women’s position in the art world, art historian [[Carol Duncan]] in the 1989 article, “The MoMA Hot Mamas”, examines the idea that institutions like the [[MoMA]] are masculinized. In MoMA’s collection, there is a disproportionate amount of sexualized female bodies by male artists on display compared to a low percentage of actual women artists included.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776968?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104799788381 | title=The MoMA Hot Mamas | work=Art Journal | date=1998 | accessdate=2014-11-28 | last=Duncan | first=Carol | pages=171–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data accumulated by the Guerrilla Girls, “less than 3% of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 83% of the nudes are female”, even though “51% of visual artists today are women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get the Facts|work = National Museum of Women in the Arts |url= http://nmwa.org/advocate/get-facts |accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan claims that, in regards to women artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the MoMA and other museums, their numbers are kept well below the point where they might effectively dilute its masculinity. The female presence is necessary only in the form of imagery. Of course, men, too, are occasionally represented. Unlike women, who are seen primarily as sexually accessible bodies, men are portrayed as physically and mentally active beings who creatively shape their world and ponder its meanings.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article narrows its focus on one institution to use as an example to draw from and expand on. Ultimately to illustrate the ways in which institutions are complicit in patriarchal and racist ideologies.

=== Intersectionality ===

Women of color in the art world were often not addressed in earlier feminist art criticism. An intersectional analysis that includes not only gender but also race and other marginalized identities is essential.

[[Audre Lorde]]’s 1984 essay “[http://www.muhlenberg.edu/media/contentassets/pdf/campuslife/sdp%20reading%20lorde.pdf The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House],” briefly addresses a vital dilemma that artists who are women of color are often overlooked or tokenized in the visual arts. She argues that "in academic feminist circles, the answer to these questions is often, ‘We did not know who to ask.’ But that is the same evasion of responsibility, the same cop-out, that keeps Black women's art out of women's exhibitions, Black women's work out of most feminist publications except for the occasional ‘Special Third World Women's Issue,’ and Black women's texts off your reading lists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = Lorde| first = Audre| author-link = Audre Lorde | title = The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House| work = [[Sister Outsider]]: Essays and Speeches| year=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley|pages=110–114|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde’s statement brings up how important it is to consider intersectionality in these feminist art discourses, as race is just as integral to any discussion on gender.

Furthermore, [[bell hooks]] expands on the discourse of black representation in the visual arts to include other factors. In her 1995 book, ''Art on My Mind'', hooks positions her writings on the visual politics of both race and class in the art world. She states that the reason art is rendered meaningless in the lives of most black people is not solely due to the lack of representation, but also because of an entrenched colonization of the mind and imagination and how it is intertwined with the process of identification.&lt;ref name="hooks Art"&gt;{{Cite book| last =hooks| first = bell| author-link = bell hooks | date=1995|title = Art on My Mind: Visual Politics|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31737494|location= New York|publisher= New Press|isbn= 9781565842632|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Thus she stresses for a “shift [in] conventional ways of thinking about the function of art. There must be a revolution in the way we see, the way we look,"&lt;ref name="hooks Art" /&gt;{{rp|4}} emphasizing how visual art has the potential to be an empowering force within the black community. Especially if one can break free from "imperialist white-supremacist notions of the way art should look and function in society."&lt;ref name="hooks Art" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

== Intersection with other schools of thought ==
Feminist art criticism is a smaller subgroup in the larger realm of [[feminist theory]], because feminist theory seeks to explore the themes of [[discrimination]], [[sexual objectification]], [[oppression]], [[patriarchy]], and [[stereotyping]], feminist art criticism attempts similar exploration.

This exploration can be accomplished through a variety of means. [[Structuralism|Structuralist theories]], [[deconstructionist]] thought, [[psychoanalysis]], [[Queer theory|queer analysis]], and [[semiotic]] interpretations can be used to further comprehend gender symbolism and representation in artistic works. The social structures regarding gender that influence a piece can be understood through interpretations based on stylistic influences and biographical interpretations.

=== Freudian Psychoanalytic Theory ===

[[Laura Mulvey]]'s 1975 essay, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]" focuses on the gaze of the spectator from a Freudian perspective. Freud's concept of [[scopophilia]] relates to the objectification of women in art works. The gaze of the viewer is, in essence, a sexually charged instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Mulvey|first= Laura|author-link= Laura Mulvey|editor1-first= Karyn|editor1-last= Kay|editor2-first= Gerald|editor2-last= Peary|editor2-link= Gerald Peary|encyclopedia= Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology|title= Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|year= 1977|publisher= Dutton|location= New York|isbn= 0525474595|oclc= 3315936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the gender inequity that exists in the art sphere, the artist's portrayal of a subject is generally a man's portrayal of women. Other [[Freudian]] symbolism can be used to comprehend pieces of art from a feminist perspective—whether gender specific symbols are uncovered through psychoanalytic theory (such as [[phallic]] or [[yonic]] symbols) or specific symbols are used to represent women in a given piece.

=== Realism and Reflectionism ===
Are the women depicted in an artistic work realistic portrayals of women? Writer [[Toril Moi]] explained in her 1985 essay "'Images of Women' Criticism" that "reflectionism posits that the artist's selective creation should be measured against 'real life,' thus assuming that the only constraint on the artist's work is his or her perception of the 'real world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Moi|first= Toril|author-link= Toril Moi|editor-first= Moi|editor-last= Toril|editor-link= Toril Moi|encyclopedia= Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory|title= 'Images of women’ criticism|year= 1985|publisher= Methuen|location= London|isbn= 0416353606|oclc= 12103885|pages= 42ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals and publication ==
The 1970s also saw the emergence of feminist art journals, including ''The Feminist Art Journal'' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Timeline: United States|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_timeline/plain_text.php|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies]]'' in 1977. The journal ''[[n.paradoxa]]'' has been dedicated to an international perspective on feminist art since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktpress.co.uk/feminist-art-magazines.asp A List of Past and Present Feminist Art Journals on n.paradoxa's information pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the academy ==
In 1989, the [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]]' poster protest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW WOMEN GET MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IN ART MUSEUMS|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|archivedate=25 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s gender imbalance brought this feminist critique out of the academy and into the public sphere.

===Exhibition===
In 2007, the exhibit "[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]" presented works of 120 international artists and artists’ groups at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Johnson| first = Ken| author-link1 = Ken Johnson (art critic)|title = WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution - Art - Review| work = New York Times| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2008-02-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/arts/design/15wack.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of its kind that employed a comprehensive view of the intersection between feminism and art from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ozler| first = Levent| title = Wack!: Art and the Feminist Revolution| work = Dexigner| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2007-02-16| url = https://www.dexigner.com/news/10312}}&lt;/ref&gt; WACK! “argues that feminism was perhaps the most influential of any postwar art movement-on an international level-in its impact on subsequent generations of artists.”&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack" /&gt;

== Today ==
Rosemary Betteron’s 2003 essay, “Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism”, insists that older feminist art criticism must adapt to newer models, as our culture has shifted significantly since the late twentieth century. Betterton points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Feminist art criticism is no longer the marginalized discourse that it once was; indeed it had produced some brilliant and engaging writing over the last decade and in many ways has become a key site of academic production. But, as feminist writers and teachers, we need to address ways of thinking through new forms of social engagement between feminism and the visual, and of understanding the different ways in which visual culture is currently inhabited by our students.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Betterton| first = Rosemary| title = Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism| work = The Feminist Visual Cultural Reader| year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=11–14|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Betterton, the models used to critique a Pre-Raphaelite painting are not likely to be applicable in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; She also expresses that we should explore ‘difference’ in position and knowledge, since in our contemporary visual culture we are more used to engaging with "multi-layered text and image complexes" (video, digital media, and the Internet).&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; Our ways of viewing have changed considerably since the 1970s.

'''''Ferry Tales''''' is a 2003 American short [[documentary film|documentary]] film written, produced and directed by [[Katja Esson]]. It follows the conversations of women in the powder room of the [[Staten Island Ferry]] during the morning commute from [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]] to [[Manhattan]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sisterhood in a Floating Powder Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/12/movies/sisterhood-floating-powder-room-oscar-nominated-documentary-captures-life-aboard.html|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
'''Ferry Tales''' exposes a secret world that exists in the powder room of the Staten Island Ferry—a place that brings together suburban moms and urban dwellers, white-collar and blue-collar, sisters and socialites. For 30 minutes every day, they gather around mirrors to put on their makeup – talking not as wives, mothers, or professionals, but just as themselves. Sassy and honest, they dish on everything from sex scandals to stilettos, family problems to September 11, leaving stereotypes at the door and surprising viewers with their straight-shooting wisdom.

In broaching such topics as divorce, single motherhood and domestic violence, ''Ferry Tales'' goes beyond the surface to show us the realities of life for working women. A rare and honest look at the intersections of race and class, this heartwarming film is utterly charming and often outrageous, FERRY TALES gives these unlikely heroines their moment in the spotlight.

==Production==
In July 2001, Katja Esson decided to create a sort of ‘working-girl’ documentary about the women who occupy the ladies bathroom on the ferry each and every morning. Coming up with a concept was simple enough, but trying to gain the confidence of these women and filming them in their element was quite another matter.

Then, just as filming had started, the tragic events of September 11 happened. At first, Esson felt she would have to scrap the project altogether. Instead, she kept filming. The resulting footage shows just how strong a sense of community exists between the many different women in the powder room.

==Film Festivals &amp; Awards==

'''Esson's film gives a fantastic glimpse into one of the countless secret sub-cultures of New York. Her brilliant portrayal rethinks class and gender and turns our ideas of the suburban/urban divide on their head'.'' (K.E. Flemming, New York University)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KE Flemming|url=http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c647.shtml|publisher=women make movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMV GV 116 t.jpg|thumb|right|A '''G.V. Series''' (G.V.116) recording of the 1941 songs "El estagiario / Mi refugio" by Argentine [[Carlos Di Sarli]] y su [[Orquesta típica]].

The '''G.V. Series''' (perhaps for ''Grabación Victor'')&lt;ref&gt;White 2002 and Stewart 2004 offer several variations on G. V.'s real and perceived meanings, which include "Grabación Victor" ("Victor Recording" in Spanish), "Grabado en Venezuela" (recorded in Venezuela), "Gramophone Victor", and a popular Congolese nickname "Grands Vocalistes" (great singers). White (2002) also reports it may only be an [[EMI]] records code which lies between G.U. and G.W.&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of 10&amp;nbsp;inch [[78 rpm]] [[Gramophone record]]s produced in Europe and the United States from 1933 to 1958, and exported (or repressed on site) to colonial Tropical Africa. They are credited with introducing [[Afro-Cuban music]] into modern African popular culture. The resulting re-interpretations influenced the creation of several genres of African popular music.

==The Series==
Over 250 titles (double sided records) were produced in the G.V. Series. The records were launched by the British [[EMI]] company's [[His Master's Voice]] label in 1933, in part because of shrinking demand during the [[Great Depression]]. In the 1940s, HMV reached agreement with other companies, such as [[RCA Victor]] to share the royalties of their artists in the production of G.V. Series recordings. Thereafter local distributors were able to request, or press themselves, any of the back catalog of these companies for relatively low cost in Africa, making the records affordable to African listeners for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;White (2002) describes this process, citing Gronow, P. The Recording Industry: An Ethnomusicological Approach. Tampere, Finland: University of Tampere Press (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time in West Africa (what became [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]], specifically) EMI was recording and releasing [[Sakara music|Sakara]], [[Juju]] and [[Apala]] music on 78rpm discs in the ''[[Parlophone]] B'', ''HMV JL'', ''HMV JZ'' and ''[[Decca Records|Decca]] WA/GWA/NGA'' series (1947–52), as well as HMV owned local labels, such as Ghana's [[Taymani Special]].&lt;ref&gt;see Chapter Twenty (pp.149–156) of John Collins. Musicmakers of West Africa. Lynne Rienner Publishers (1985) {{ISBN|0-89410-075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there were also domestic record producers beginning to appear in Anglophone West Africa, Francophone Central African music was based on the twin poles of small domestic labels of the 1940s and 50s, and the Latin music supplied by the G.V. Series records and later competitors from [[Pathé Marconi]] and Decca.&lt;ref&gt;For the impact of the G.V. Series vs. these series of domestic music on Ghanaian and Nigerian music see: John Low. 'A History of Kenyan Guitar Music: 1945–1980', African Music, VI, 2,1982, pp.23–24&lt;br&gt;
Christopher Waterman. Juju: A Social History and Ethnography of an African Popular Music, Chicago, University of Chicago Press (1990), pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglophone West Africa also had twin advantages of having had access to domestic recording and the distribution across West Africa of these recordings by the HMV owned [[Zonophone]] label of African music from 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon. Savannaphone. FolkRoots No.122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuban music in Africa==
While the G.V. Series drew on a wide back catalogue of music, they are best known as the first exposure many Africans had to [[Afro-Cuban]] music (specifically [[Son Cubano|Son]] and [[Son montuno]]). Some musicians of the era still refer to these songs not by the Spanish language titles but by the G.V. numbers of their records.&lt;ref&gt;"The influence that they had may be measured in part by older musicians recalling Cuban tunes by the HMV catalogue number rather than the proper title." – Paul Vernon. [http://www.bolingo.org/audio/texts/fr145eastafrica.html Feast of East].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine initial G.V. records were released in 1933, drawn from EMI's back catalogue of '"''general ethnic''" or "''Spanish''" recordings, with G.V. 1 being "''[[The Peanut Vendor]]''" by [[Don Azpiazu &amp; his Havana Casino Orchestra]], recorded New York City, 13 May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;John Cowley. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/ubunca.htm uBungca (Oxford Bags): Recordings in London of African and West Indian music in the 1920s and 1930s]. Musical Traditions No 12, Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note were Cuban artists such as Son combo [[Sexteto Habanero]], [[Trio Matamoros]], [[Don Azpiazú]], [[Abelardo Valdés]], [[Antonio Machin]], as well as big band leader [[Xavier Cugat]], originally recorded in the United States for the American market.

These records spawned some of the most successful modern musical styles West Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa. The most notable of these styles is [[African Rumba|Congolese Rumba]] ("''Soukous''") which developed in [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], Belgian Congo (modern Kinshasa, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) in the 1940s and 50s. The guitar styles of [[Highlife music]] in British colonial West Africa were also highly influenced by these records, as were the stylings of the Dakar sound in Senegal.  African guitar playing in general, and the electric guitar in particular, was popularised in part by the music distributed in the G.V. Series records. The music of East Africa was also influenced by the G.V. series, sold through East African Music Stores in [[Nairobi]] as its agents in [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] and [[Dar-es-Salaam]]. But here too, the Cuban musics of the G.V. series quickly had to complete with domestic music produced by EMI and specialist labels like [[Odeon Swahili]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Vernon.

{{Nihongo|'''''Girls Beyond the Wasteland'''''|少女たちは荒野を目指す|Shōjotachi wa Kōya o Mezasu|lit. ''Girls aim for the wasteland''}}, often abbreviated as {{nihongo|'''''Shokomeza'''''|しょこめざ}} and also known as '''''Girls Beyond the Youth Koya''''' in Japan, is a [[visual novel]] developed by [[Minato Soft]] to be released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] on March 25, 2016 with a rating for all ages. An anime television series adaptation, produced by [[Project No.9]] and directed by [[Takuya Satō (scriptwriter)|Takuya Satō]], premiered in January 2016.

==Gameplay==
''Girls Beyond the Wasteland'' is a [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of Buntarō Hōjō. Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. The text in the game is accompanied by character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], which represent who Buntarō is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters [[CG artwork]] at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. The game follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|Buntarō Hōjō|北条 文太郎|Hōjō Buntarō}}
:{{voiced by|[[Seiichirō Yamashita]]}}
:Buntarō, nicknamed {{Nihongo|Bunta|ブンタ}}, is the protagonist. He is hardworking, friendly, and well-aware of his surroundings.

:{{voiced by|[[Haruka Chisuga]]}}
:Sayuki is Buntarō's quiet classmate. She has been investigating Buntarō and convinces herself that he is fit to be scenario writer for her upcoming game. She wants to make a [[bishōjo game]] because she knows that this world is a "wasteland" where people are forced to do something they have no interest in so they can make money for living. She is inspired by her older brother who works for a game company. She loves Buntarō and kissed him in the 8th episode in the anime. She blushes really hard when Buntarō sees her in embarrassing situations or when he said something lovely to her. She goes with him on a date in the first episode in the anime.

:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Akesaka]]}}
:Nicknamed {{Nihongo|Akkīna|アッキーナ}}, Teruha is another of Buntarō's classmate. She is the programmer, web designer, and script composition of the game. Despite working on a bishōjo game, Teruha is a heavy [[fujoshi]], and views the characters as men so she can get the "feeling". Teruha's way of thinking is opposite to that of Sayuki, and she is not afraid to try new things, often getting in fights with Sayuki over ideas. Due to not getting permission from school, she is secretly working at a Maid Cafe and using an alter ego under the name of {{Nihongo|"Luka"|ルカ|Ruka}}. She also has feelings for Buntarō.

;{{Nihongo|Uguisu Yūki|結城 うぐいす|Yūki Uguisu}}
:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Satō]]}}
:Uguisu is a first-year student, and the artist of the game. She is nicknamed {{Nihongo|Tori|トリ||"bird"}} because her name stands for [[Japanese bush warbler]].

;{{Nihongo|Atomu Kai|甲斐 亜登夢|Kai Atomu}}
:{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Toyonaga]]}}
:Atomu is Buntarō's childhood friend. Along with Yūka, they are a trio who are always seen together.

'''''Gomorrah''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: '''''Gomorra''''') is a [[non-fiction]] [[Investigative journalism|investigative]] book by [[Roberto Saviano]] published in 2006, which documents Saviano's infiltration and investigation of various areas of business and daily life controlled or affected by [[Organized crime in Italy| criminal organization]] [[Camorra]].

==The book==
The book describes the clandestine particulars of the [[business]] of the [[Camorra]], a powerful [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[mafia]]-like organization. In this book Saviano employs [[prose]] and news-reporting style to narrate the story of the Camorra, exposing its territory and business connections.

Since 2006, following the publication of the book, Saviano has been threatened by several Neapolitan “[[Capo di tutti capi|godfathers]]”. The Italian Minister of the Interior has granted him a permanent [[police escort]], but he's been often attacked by politicians of [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s cabinet. Also, his escort has been questioned.

As of December 2008, the book has sold almost 4 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174278 |title=Streets of ‘Gomorrah’|work= Newsweek|date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book comes from a text by [[Giuseppe Diana]], a parish priest in Casal di Principe who was killed by the Camorra in March 1994: "time has come to stop being a Gomorrah."&lt;ref name=varese&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a913746680&amp;fulltext=713240928 |title=The Camorra closely observed], by Federico Varese|journal=Global Crime|volume= 10|issue= 3 |date=August 2009 |pages= 262 – 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception ==
''Gomorrah'' won numerous literary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Viareggio-Repaci Prize for best [[debut novel]], Premio Giancarlo Siani, Premio Dedalus, Premio "Lo Straniero", Premio Letterario Edoardo Kihlgren for best debut novel, Premio Tropea, the Vittorini Prize for civic engagement and the Guido Dorso literary prize&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 the number of copies sold in Italy surpassed 2,000,000.

''Gomorrah'' has been translated in 51 countries. It appeared in the best sellers’ lists of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Sweden and Finland. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has placed it amongst the most important books of 2007, while ''[[The Economist]]'' has included it among the hundred books of the year. Saviano is the only Italian to be placed in both lists.

''Gomorrah'' was described by some critics and other Italian authors (such as [[Wu Ming]], [[Carlo Lucarelli]] and [[Valerio Evangelisti]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/outtakes/NIE_have_to_be_the_parents.htm A Reflection on ''Gomorrah'' in the context of the New Italian Epic ], opening talk at the conference "The Italian Perspective on metahistorical fiction: The New Italian Epic", IGRS, University of London, October 2nd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmillaonline.com/archives/2008/05/002632.html a single webpage regrouping two articles by major Italian authors published on two important daily newspapers: Carlo Lucarelli, "Noi scrittori della nuova epica", ''La Repubblica'', May 3rd, 2008 and Valerio Evangelisti, "Literary Opera", ''L'Unità'', May 6th, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316065856/http://www.carmillaonline.com/archives/2008/05/002632.html |date=2009-03-16 }}. 
Lucarelli wrote: "I agree with enthusiasm and great interest to Wu Ming's reflections on the New Italian Epic, and I practically identify myself with many of their observations. By "practically" I mean in terms of a literary praxis, a research done by means of books and novels [...] by means of history, which for us Italians has never become past and is always present and contemporary [...], also by means of telling the hidden everyday life of the camorra, as Saviano did...'"

According to Evangelisti, "''Gomorrah'', which is far from being a mere journalistic report, makes a statement which [[Jean-Patrick Manchette]] would have appreciated: crime is not a secondary element of capitalism, a perversion of its principles. On the contrary, crime is at the core of capitalism, it's one of the main pillars of the system [...] This unidentified object – is it a report or a novel? – has a choral nature that links it to epic, in this case an epic that has no heroes but is capable to embrace a whole world."&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a turbulent, heterogeneous stream in Italian writing called the [[New Italian Epic]], whose representatives are particularly keen on producing not only novels and non-fiction narratives, but also real UNOs, Unidentified Narrative Objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/suoni/audiotheque.htm#allegorithms Italian novelist Wu Ming  explains the concept of New Italian Epic] in a conference at Middlebury College, VT, March 31st, 2008 - audio, English, 50:00&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gomorrah'' itself was described as a UNO by several critics, readers and  writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/Giap/gomorra.htm "Appunti sul come e il cosa di Gomorra], on wumingfoundation.com, June 2006 (Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical, cinematic and television adaptations==
''Gomorrah''  has been made into a play written by Saviano with Mario Gelardi and [[Gomorrah (film)|a 2008 film]] directed by [[Matteo Garrone]] and produced by Fandango. On September 24, 2008, the film was picked by ANICA (Italy's Association of the Cinematic and Audiovisual Industry) to represent Italy in the race for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] Oscar nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic06d5fa4f707358585ba55a4294ccd82 Eric J. Lyman, "''Gomorrah'' in Oscar's foreign-language gang: Italian organized crime drama joins list of contenders"], Hollywood Reporter, September 24th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Garrone's film adaptation of the book, Christoph Huber wrote: "With its interest in moving beyond the categories of novel or non-fiction, Saviano's work has been identified as part of a heterogeneous strain of national literature, subsumed as the New Italian Epic. A term that certainly isn't disgraced by ''Gomorrah'', the film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs35/spot_huber_gomorrah.html Christop Huber, "Gomorrah", Cinemascope #35] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514052128/http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs35/spot_huber_gomorrah.html |date=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the book was also loosely adapted as an [[Gomorrah (TV series)|eponymous television series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rees |first=Jasper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11011682/Gomorrah-Sky-Atlantic-review-ugly-in-a-good-way.html |title=Gomorra, Sky Atlantic, review: 'ugly, in a good way' |work=Telegraph |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Read Literature Like a Professor''''' is a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] by Thomas C. Foster that was published in 2003. The author suggests interpretations of themes, concepts, and possible symbols commonly found in literature. The book brands itself as "A Lively and Entertaining Guide to Reading Between the Lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Read Literature Like a Professor |last=Foster |first=Thomas|year=2003 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |isbn=0-06-000942-X |pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also includes sample interpretations of [[Katherine Mansfield]]'s short story, "The Garden Party". 

The author's simple, methodical take on literary interpretation has fallen under the scrutiny of literary experts, such as the English professor and biographer Alan Jacobs, who questions the value of the book's premise and criticizes the idea that "reading is best done by highly trained, professionally accredited experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/09/136857010/easy-reading-just-take-it-one-page-at-a-time|date=June 9, 2011|title=Easy Reading: Just Take It One Page At a Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isabella Grinevskaya''' (1864&amp;ndash;1944) was the pen name of '''Beyle (Berta) Friedberg''', daughter of the Hebrew-language author [[Abraham Shalom Friedberg]] and the first wife of [[Mordechai Spector]].&lt;ref name="berta"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =A.S.Fridberg , 6 Nov. 1838 - 21 March 1902| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://holocaust.cheeb.com/photo6.html| doi =| accessdate =2009-03-22| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081215123824/http://holocaust.cheeb.com/photo6.html| archivedate =15 December 2008| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in [[Grodno]] in 1864 which at various times was part of [[Lithuania]], Poland and [[Belarus]] though at the time was within the  [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Short Description/History | work = Eastern BorderLands of  the II Polish Republic | publisher = Paul Havers | date = 2008-11-18 | url = http://www.kresy.co.uk/grodno.html | doi = | accessdate = 2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s she lived in [[St. Petersburg]] where she frequented Jewish literary circles and from the 1880s and 1890s she was published several times .
Her first novel ''The Orphan'' was published in [[Hans Freind]] in 1888; the story "It Did Not Work" was published in an edition of the [[Juedisch Bibliothek]]. The story "From Happiness to the Grave" was published in [[Warsaw]] in 1894. In her books, she tried to depict the life of the Jewish middle class and mainly the situation of enlightened Jewish young girls.

In the 1890s, she settled in [[Odessa]], Ukraine, then part of the [[Russian Empire]] and undertook to write in Russian. As a playwright Grinevskaya wrote the play "Báb" based on the life an events of the founder of the [[Bábí]] religion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grinevskaya | first = Isabella | title = Bab | work = | publisher = | year = 1916|edition=reprint| url = http://imwerden.de/pdf/grinevskaya_bab.pdf | format = pdf | doi = | accessdate = 2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7, translated into French and [[Tatar language|Tatar]],&lt;ref name="notes-ii"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on the Babi and Baha'i Religions in Russia and its territories | journal = Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages =41–80, 86 | publisher = | location = | year = 1993 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia| doi = | id = | accessdate = 2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lauded by [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other reviewers at the time.&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan| authorlink = Moojan Momen  | title = Russia  | work = Draft for "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | date =  | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_russia | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grikor Suni]] won the first prize in a contest based on the play before it and the music were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = On Behalf of the Museum | work = Official Website of the Suni Project | publisher = The Suni Project | date = | url = http://suniproject.org/autobiography-of-grikor-suni/ | format = pdf| accessdate = July 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 she settled in Constantinople&lt;ref name="berta"/&gt; where there was a substantial Bahá'í population.&lt;ref name="Walbridge"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Walbridge | first = John | title = Chapter Four - The Baha’i Faith in Turkey   | journal = Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies   | volume = 06   | issue = 1   | date = March 2002   | url =http://bahai-library.com/walbridge_bahai_faith_turkey }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910-11 she met [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], when he traveled to Egypt.

Collins and Jan T. Jasion, Journal of Bahá’í Studies Vol. 3, number 3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Grinevskaya had several other writings published: an essay of meeting [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], a poem and a play entitled ''Bahá'u'lláh'', each about founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], published though the play was never performed partly from the turmoil of [[World War I]] and the [[October Revolution]], and she carried on correspondence with Russian intellectuals, Bahá'ís both in the East and to a lesser extent in the West ([[Martha Root]], [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]) as well as traveling to Egypt, France, and [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] where there was a substantial Bahá'í population.&lt;ref name="notes-ii"/&gt; Through her life she was in several Bahá'í communities and in touch with many others.

Grinevskaya died in [[Istanbul]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="berta"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">This is a list of botanical illustrators and flower painters born in or citizens of the [[United States of America]]. It does not include European botanical illustrators active in America during the Colonial period; for information on these, see the main entry on [[botanical illustrator]]s.

Botanical illustrators paint or draw plants and sometimes their natural environment as well, forming a lineage where art and science meet. Some prefer to paint isolated specimen flowers while others prefer arrangements. Many botanical artists through the centuries have been active in collecting and cataloguing new species and/or in breeding plants. Some artists listed here worked primarily on botanical art, while others made it part of a wider artistic practice or illustrated books with their artwork.

On August 1, 2011, Stephen Ferg restructured the entire page into sortable columns, after considerable discussion on the Talk page.

This is a '''list of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction''' works as portrayed in literature, film, television, and, comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brians|first=Paul|title=Nuclear holocausts : atomic war in fiction, 1895-1984|year=1987|publisher=Kent State University Press|location=Kent, Ohio|isbn=978-0-87338-335-6 |chapter=Nuclear Holocausts Bibliography}} ([http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/a.htm Also online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227012854/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/a.htm |date=2011-12-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M. Keith|last2=Thoma |first2=Anne-Marie|title=The science fiction handbook|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-6205-0|pages=53&amp;ndash;64}} Includes a list of notable works.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Apocalyptic fiction]] is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] that is concerned with the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|end of civilization]] due to a potentially [[existential risk|existential catastrophe]] such as [[nuclear warfare]], [[pandemic]], [[alien invasion|extraterrestrial attack]], [[impact event]], [[cybernetic revolt]], [[technological singularity]], [[dysgenics]], [[supernatural phenomena]], [[Eschatology|divine judgment]], [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]] or some other [[disaster|general disaster]]. [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Post-apocalyptic fiction]] is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized).
 
''[[Apocalypse]]'' is a Greek word referring to the end of the world. [[Apocalypticism]] is the religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation of God's will, but now usually refers to belief that the world will come to an end very soon, even within one's own lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Apocalypticism |title=Dictionary-Apocalypticism |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalyptic fiction does not portray catastrophes, or disasters, or near-disasters that do not result in apocalypse.  A ''threat'' of an apocalypse does not make a piece of fiction apocalyptic. For example, ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' are considered [[disaster film]]s and not apocalyptic fiction because, although earth and/or human-kind are terribly threatened, in the end they manage to avoid destruction. Apocalyptic fiction is not the same as fiction that provides visions of a [[dystopian]] future.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', for example, is [[dystopian fiction]], not apocalyptic fiction.

It goes awry when it is discovered that the Bore leads to the [[Dark One (Wheel of Time)|Dark One]]'s prison, allowing the Dark One to influence the world. This causes the male half of the One Power to be tainted, driving all male Aes Sedai mad and causing the Breaking of the World. The society regresses from futuristic to [[Renaissance]]-era, with only a few artifacts of the Age of Legends remaining.

An '''[[organ stop]]''' can mean one of three things:

*the control on an [[organ (music)|organ]] console that selects a particular sound
*the row of [[organ pipe]]s used to create a particular sound, more appropriately known as a ''rank''
*the sound itself

Organ stops are sorted into four major types: [[principal pipe|principal]], [[string pipe|string]], [[reed pipe|reed]], and [[flute pipe|flute]].

This is a [[Help:Sorting|sortable]] list of names that may be found associated with [[Electronic organ|electronic]] and [[pipe organ]] stops. Countless stops have been designed over the centuries, and individual organs may have stops, or names of stops, used nowhere else. This non-comprehensive list deals mainly with names of stops found on numerous [[Baroque]], classical and romantic organs. Here are a few of the most common ones:

The '''Londesborough Brooch''' is a [[Celts|Celtic]] pseudo-[[penannular brooch]] from Ireland. Dating from the early medieval period, it is a particularly elaborate example of a dress fastener that was produced during Ireland's artistic golden age, when objects such as the [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Ardagh Chalice]] were produced. Since 1888, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=98321&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Londesborough+brooch&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The brooch and pin were cast in [[silver]], though the metal is heavily debased, and tests show it contains about 65% copper, 34% silver, with traces of lead and gold.&lt;ref name=Youngs&gt;Youngs, 93&lt;/ref&gt;  This might reflect an origin in melted-down late Roman coins. The pieces were thickly [[gilding|gilded]] on the front, and selectively on parts of the back of the head. The pin was cast in two pieces, head and shank, joined with a [[rivet]].  Both head and pin were ornamented with geometric and [[zoomorphic]] patterns and inset with [[amber]] pieces, some now missing.  On the back of the head there are two blue glass studs near where the large terminal joins the hoop.  There are many small differences between the decoration of the right and left sides of the head, although the overall impression is one of symmetry.  Many details of the decoration recall the earlier Tara Brooch and the [[Breadalbane Brooch]] (the latter also in the British Museum).  However, unlike most other very elaborate brooches of the type, the Londesborough Brooch lacks any gold [[filigree]] decoration, and aspects of the decoration recall larger pieces of church metal work such as shrines.&lt;ref name="Youngs" /&gt;  
[[Image:Brit Mus 17sept 016.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of the brooch]]

==Original ownership==

The intricate decoration on precious metal and the large size of the brooch suggest it was made for a wealthy patron or religious leader in Ireland in the late eighth or early ninth centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Youngs" /&gt;  The pseudo-penannular form is typical of Irish brooches at this period; in a true penannular brooch there is a gap in the centre of the wide terminals ending the hoop through which the pin can pass.  In the pseudo-penannular type the terminal sides are joined, here by two narrow bands, making the brooch less efficient as a fastener.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Little is known about the original circumstances of the brooch's discovery before it became part of [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Londesborough]]'s collection. The British Museum purchased the brooch in 1888. With the Tara Brooch in [[Dublin]], and the [[Hunterston Brooch]] in [[Edinburgh]], it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Makapansgat''' (/mɐkɐˈpɐnsxɐt/) (or '''Makapan Valley [[World Heritage Site|world heritage site]]''') is an [[archaeological]] location within the Makapansgat and Zwartkrans Valleys, northeast of [[Mokopane]] in [[Limpopo]] province, South Africa. It is an important palaeontological site,&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan, Mark L. Cooke and Helen Murray, ''[http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html The Waterberg Biosphere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324191043/http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html |date=24 March 2007 }}'', Lumina Technologies, 22 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with the local [[Lime (material)|lime]]works containing ''[[Australopithecus]]''-bearing deposits dating to between 3.0 and 2.6 million years [[Before Present|BP]]. The whole Makapan Valley has been declared a [[National heritage sites (South Africa)|South African Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9/2/257/0003 - Makapans Valley and Limeworks at Makapansgat, Potgietersrus District|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19235|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]]|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makapansgat belongs to the [[Cradle of Humankind]].

==Makapansgat Valley sites==

===Makapansgat limeworks===
This is the oldest of the cave sites in the Makapansgat valley, spanning an age of greater than 4.0 million years until perhaps 1.6 million years ago. This site has yielded many thousands of fossil bones, amongst which were found remains of the gracile australopithecine ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''. The ''A. africanus'' fossils are suggested to date to between 2.85 and 2.58 million years ago based on [[palaeomagnetism]] by Andy Herries ([[La Trobe University]], Australia).&lt;ref name="HerriesHopley2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herries|first1=Andy I.R.|last2=Hopley|first2=Philip J.|last3=Adams|first3=Justin W.|last4=Curnoe|first4=Darren|last5=Maslin|first5=Mark A.|title=Letter to the editor: Geochronology and palaeoenvironments of Southern African hominin-bearing localities-A reply to Wrangham et al., 2009. “Shallow-water habitats as sources of fallback foods for hominins”|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=143|issue=4|year=2010|pages=640–646|issn=00029483|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was recently excavated by a joint project between the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in South Africa and [[Arizona State University]] in the US.

===Cave of Hearths and Hyaena Mandible Cave===
The Cave of Hearths is part of the Historic Cave complex and preserves a remarkably complete record of human occupation from [[Early Stone Age]] “[[Acheulian]]” times in the oldest sediments through the [[Middle Stone Age]], the [[Later Stone Age]] and up to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="LathamHerries2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Latham|first1=A.G.|last2=Herries|first2=A.I.R.|title=The formation and sedimentary infilling of the Cave of Hearths and Historic Cave complex, Makapansgat, South Africa|journal=Geoarchaeology|volume=19|issue=4|year=2004|pages=323–342|issn=0883-6353|doi=10.1002/gea.10122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth century European relics such as brass ware and [[Musket#Ammunition|musket ball]]s were found at the surface when excavations started. The site was re-excavated and re-analysed as part of the 'Makapan Middle Pleistocene Research Project' run by the [[University of Liverpool]] (UK) between 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref name="McNabbSinclair2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sinclair|editor1-first=Anthony  |editor2-last=McNabb|editor2-first=John |title=The Cave of Hearths: Makapan middle pleistocene research project : field research by Anthony Sinclair and Patrick Quinney, 1996-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQYNAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=[[Archaeopress]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4073-0420-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has shown that coloured sediment horizons in the Early Stone Age levels are not from fire use. A Homo [[human mandible|mandible]] also recovered from these layers may also represent one of the earliest representatives of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref name="Curnoe2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curnoe|first= D. |chapter= The mandible from Bed 3, Cave of Hearths|editor-last1=Sinclair|editor-first1=Anthony  |editor-last2=McNabb|editor-first2=John |title=The Cave of Hearths: Makapan middle pleistocene research project : field research by Anthony Sinclair and Patrick Quinney, 1996-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQYNAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=[[Archaeopress]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4073-0420-5|pp=138–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buffalo Cave===
A small number of fossils were thought to have been collected by Dr Robert Broom from this site in 1937, including the remains of an extinct 'pygmy buffalo', ''[[Bos]] makapania'', for which the cave is named.&lt;ref name=herries&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herries|first=A.I.R.|title=Speleology and magnetobiostratigraphic chronology of the Buffalo Cave fossil site, Makapansgat, South Africa |journal=Quaternary Research |year=2006 |volume=66 |pages=233–245 |url=http://www.archaeomagnetism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Herries-Andy-I.R.-et-al-2006-b.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.yqres.2006.03.006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent excavations have revealed an extensive '[[Cornelia, Free State|Cornelian]] Land Mammal Age' fauna including antelope, horses, pigs, monkeys and carnivores. The fauna, along with palaeomagnetic age estimates by Andy Herries (La Trobe University, Australia) suggest an age of between 990,000 and 780,000 years for the main fossil bearing layers.&lt;ref name=herries/&gt; Basal [[flowstone]] deposits are estimated to go back to around 2 million years and show evidence for the beginning of the '[[Walker circulation]]' at around 1.7 million years ago.&lt;ref name="HopleyWeedon2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopley|first1=Philip J.|last2=Weedon|first2=Graham P.|last3=Marshall|first3=Jim D.|last4=Herries|first4=Andy I.R.|last5=Latham|first5=Alf G.|last6=Kuykendall|first6=Kevin L.|title=High- and low-latitude orbital forcing of early hominin habitats in South Africa|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=256|issue=3-4|year=2007|pages=419–432|issn=0012821X|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.01.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ficus Cave and Iron Age Site===
The cave gets its name from the fig tree ''[[Ficus ingens]]'' roots which curtain its entrance. This cave contains Iron Age and 19th century relics, a large bat colony and an underground lake. An Iron Age site close by yields occupational debris from approximately Early Iron Age (550 AD), 870 AD and the Late Iron Age (1560 AD). The slopes adjacent to the cave are artificially terraced and archaeological finds from these include potsherds, grindstones, hammer stones and relics of iron smelting operations, including ore, slag and fragments of tuyeres.

===Peppercorn's Cave===
This cave contains Iron Age and ancient relics and an underground lake. It is also home to a large colony of migratory long-fingered bats, ''[[Miniopterus schreibersii]]''.

===Rainbow Cave===
This cave is situated immediately below the Historic Cave and contains the remains of several putative hearths, suggesting both human occupation and the controlled use of fire. The exposed sediments have yielded Middle Stone Age artefacts of the Pietersburg Culture of between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. Recent studies have shown that the coloured horizons are not hearths but are more likely ancient pool deposits.&lt;ref name="HerriesLatham2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herries|first1= A.I.R.|last2= Latham|first2= A.G. |chapter= Chapter 5: Archaeomagnetic studies at the Cave of Hearths|editor-last1=Sinclair|editor-first1=Anthony  |editor-last2=McNabb|editor-first2=John |title=The Cave of Hearths: Makapan middle pleistocene research project : field research by Anthony Sinclair and Patrick Quinney, 1996-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQYNAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=[[Archaeopress]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4073-0420-5|pp= 59–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic Cave or Makapansgat===
This site lies immediately adjacent to the Cave of Hearths, and preserves Iron Age and [[Mfecane]] relics. It is most famous as the clash between a [[Boer Commando]] and local Langa and Kekana people after the murders of [[Voortrekkers]] at Moorddrift, Mapela and Pruizen. [[Chief Makapan]] (Mokopane), together with a large number of his tribespeople and their cattle were besieged in the cave for nearly a month between 25 October and 21 November 1854, during which time many hundreds died of hunger and thirst.&lt;ref name="Le RouxCain2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le Roux|first1=Andreas|last2=Cain|first2=Chester|last3=Badenhorst|first3=Shaw|last4=Esterhuysen|first4=Amanda|title=Faunal Remains from the 1854 Siege of Mugombane, Makapans Valley, South Africa|journal=Journal of African Archaeology|volume=11|issue=1|year=2013|pages=97–110|issn=1612-1651|doi=10.3213/2191-5784-10229}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Piet Potgieter was shot during the siege and the name of the nearby town was changed from [[Vredenburg]] to 'Pieter Potgietersrust', which later changed to 'Potgietersrus'. As of early 21st century (ca. early 2000s), after the transition from the [[Apartheid]] government into majority rule, there has been a trend to rename several national and provincial government institutions (including educational institutions), roads, public infrastructures, towns, cities, etc. As a result, the town has been controversially re-renamed to [[Mokopane]], in honour of Chief Mokopane. The cave was proclaimed a National Monument in 1936.

===Cold Air Cave===
Stable isotope analyses of a uranium-series-dated stalagmite from Cold Air Cave provided a record of climate changes for the periods 4400–4000 years and approximately 800 years ago until the present day.

===Gutentight Cave===
This cave was located and explored in 2000 by A. Herries, A. Latham and W. Murzel. After breaking through a number of tight squeezes, the cave opened out into a large chamber. The floor of the chamber was covered in hearths. An inscription on the wall of the cave was from the 19th Century and indicated that a previous entrance to the cave had collapsed and sealed the cavity after this date.

===Murzel's Cave===
This cave was located and explored in 1998 by A. Herries and A. Latham. Digging out of the entrance led to a climb and traverse down into a series of lower decorated chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Herries, A.I.R., Latham, A.G., 1999. New caves in the Makapansgat area of the Northern Province of South Africa. Caves and Caving. 85, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Katzenjammer Cave or Herries' Hole===
Katzenjammer Cave is located adjacent to Peppercorn's Cave. An entrance shaft leads down to a narrow climb and entrance to a network of passages at the same level as the far reaches of Peppercorn's Cave. The entrance shaft has formed by the collapse of fossil bearing deposits (including the Giant Dasie) into the lower modern cave system, Katzenjammer Cave. The entrance shaft area and fossil deposits were collectively termed Herries' Hole by the Makapan Middle Pleistocene Research Project.

==History of discoveries in Makapansgat Valley==
Makapansgat Valley has been described as having one of the greatest palaeontological records of human evolution in the world.&lt;ref name=RaynerEtal1993&gt;{{citation |date=March 1993 |last1=Rayner|first1= Richard J.|last2= Moon|first2= Bernard P.|last3= Masters|first3= Judith C. |title=The Makapansgat australopithecine environment |journal=[[Journal of Human Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=219–231 |doi=10.1006/jhev.1993.1016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collecting at the site began in 1925, when a local school teacher, Wilfred Eitzman, was attracted by the activities of limeworkers. Some fossil material was sent to [[Raymond Dart]], who initiated a systematic investigation in 1947.&lt;ref name=RaynerEtal1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tattersall1996&gt;{{citation |year=1996 |author=Tattersall, Ian |authorlink=Ian Tattersall |title=The Fossil Trail: How we know what we think we know about human evolution |place=Oxford &amp; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=77 |isbn=0-19-506101-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NHUYzuvmXIC}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-19-510981-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eitzman also discovered the so-called "[[Makapansgat pebble]]" associated with the bones. [[Ca.]] 3,000,000 BCE, the pebble is shaped naturally to resemble a human face, it is thought to have been found by an Australopithecus and carried from its source into the Makapansgat cave. It has been suggested that this pebble represents the earliest known example of symbolic thinking of early hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunspot.sli.unimelb.edu.au/aura/MAKAPANSGAT.htm  |title=Makapansgat cobble analysed |last=Bednarik |first=Robert G |date= |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |accessdate=2010-05-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030330065452/http://sunspot.sli.unimelb.edu.au/aura/MAKAPANSGAT.htm |archivedate = 2003-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]: A Global History|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-495-79986-3|pages=15–16|edition=Enhanced Thirteenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rocks that Professor Dart received from Mr Eitzman turned out to contain, amongst others, blackened fossil bones which led him to believe that they had been burnt. Although no hominid remains or stone tools were found at first, he concluded that these were the remains of bones burnt in fireplaces and therefore that Makapansgat was a site of early hominid occupation. Dart named the first hominids discovered at the site ''Australopithecus prometheus'' after the mythological Greek hero who stole fire from the Gods. Afterwards the black markings turned out to be manganese stains and ''Australopithecus prometheus'' were recognised as specimens of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''. After analysing 7,159 fossil bones, Dart concluded that these creatures, in an era before stone tools were discovered, used tools made from bone, teeth and horn, naming it the [[Osteodontokeratic industry|Osteodontokeratic]] Culture.

In 1936, the [[Historical Monuments Commission]] was asked to declare Makapan's Cave a National Monument and Professor [[Clarence van Riet Lowe]], Secretary of the commission and Director of the [[Archaeological Survey of the Union of South Africa]], visited the site in 1937. He inspected the Historic Cave and discovered, close by, an abandoned limeworker’s adit that cut through a calcified cave infill. In this infill he saw fossil bones, stone tools, and what he took to be ash horizons representing ancient hearths. At first he referred to it as part of Makapan's Cave, but he later renamed it "The Cave of Hearths".

Further research during June and October 1937 revealed the Rainbow Cave. The site was visited by [[Clarence Van Riet Lowe]], [[Raymond Dart]], and [[Robert Broom]]. [[H. B. S. Cooke]] of the Geology Department of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] conducted a geological survey of the area (1941) followed by L. C. King in 1951.

In July 1945, [[Phillip V. Tobias|Philip Tobias]] led a group of students to the valley, where they discovered the "Hyaena Cave" next to Van Riet Lowe's site. Further down the valley, from a cave next to the limeworks, they collected a large fossil horse's lower jaw, which supplied a name for the “Cave of the Horse's Mandible”.

After these discoveries, Dr [[Bernard Price]] made a research grant available for systematic excavations, which started at the Cave of Hearths in 1947, with field work being carried out by Guy Gardiner, [[James Kitching]], and his brothers Ben and Scheepers. One of the most significant discoveries was a ''Homo'' lower jaw from Bed 3, by Ben. In 1953, Dr R. J. Mason was placed in charge of the excavations. The stratigraphic sequence was determined during 1953–1954.

After the Kitching brothers discovered an ape-man braincase amongst the limeworks dumps in 1947, Dart organised for the lime miner's dumps to be hand-sorted to recover as much fossil-bearing material as possible. After 45 years of research, many thousands of fossils from this site have been identified and catalogued.

Brian Maguire studied rocks which were brought into the caves during prehistoric times (1965, 1968, 1980). He interpreted this to represent rudimentary stone tool making activities dated at around 2.3 – 1.6 million years ago, however, recent analysis has shown this information to be incorrect.

Recent work at the sites in the late 1990s and early 2000s was done by these groups:
* the Makapansgat Fieldschool, run jointly by Kaye Reed of the Institute of Human Origins at [[Arizona State University]] (US) and Kevin Kuykendall of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (SA) and later the [[University of Sheffield]] (UK); 
* the Makapan Middle Pleistocene Research project, run by Anthony Sinclair, Patrick Quinney of the [[University of Liverpool]] (UK) and later John McNabb of the [[University of Southampton]] (UK.). 
* Alf Latham, Ginette Warr (University of Liverpool), and Andy Herries ([[La Trobe University]], Australia) did Geochronological and stratigraphic work for both projects.

'''Melissa Ellen Gilbert''' (born May 8, 1964)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/melissa-gilbert# |title=Melissa Gilbert Interview &amp;#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gilbert|2009|pp=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[actress]] and [[television director]].

Gilbert began her career as a [[child actress]] in the late 1960s, appearing in numerous commercials and guest starring roles on television. From 1974 to 1984, she starred as [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], the second oldest daughter of [[Charles Ingalls]] (played by [[Michael Landon]]) on the [[NBC]] series ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]''. During the run of ''Little House'', Gilbert appeared in several popular television films, including ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1980 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and ''[[The Miracle Worker (1979 film)|The Miracle Worker]]''.

As an adult, she continued her career mainly in television films. Gilbert has also continued with guest starring roles on television and has done [[Voice acting|voice work]] for animation such as ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' as [[Barbara Gordon]] / [[Batgirl]]. From 2009 to 2010, Gilbert appeared as [[Caroline Ingalls|Caroline "Ma" Ingalls]] in the touring production of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (musical)|Little House on the Prairie, the Musical]]''. In 2012, she was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 14)|season fourteen]] of the popular reality dance competition show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Gilbert served as the President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] from 2001 to 2005. In 2009, her autobiography ''Prairie Tale: A Memoir'', was released. In 2014, she wrote a short story for children, called ''Daisy and Josephine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Daisy-Josephine-Melissa-Gilbert/dp/1442445785/ref=la_B00279DM70_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414692372&amp;sr=1-2|title=Daisy and Josephine: Melissa Gilbert, Julia Kuo: 9781442445789: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''My Prairie Cookbook: Memories and Frontier Food from My Little House to Yours''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/My-Prairie-Cookbook-Memories-Frontier/dp/1419707787/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_cp_3_35FB?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1J7TC5TYMGPXDSG14NRQ|title=My Prairie Cookbook: Memories and Frontier Food from My Little House to Yours: Melissa Gilbert, Dane Holweger: 9781419707780: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Gilbert was born in [[Los Angeles]], California, on May 8, 1964, to a newly engaged couple, Kathy Wood and David Darlington, and given up for adoption immediately after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/melissa-gilbert# |title=Melissa Gilbert Interview &amp;#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was adopted one day later by actor and comedian [[Paul Gilbert (actor)|Paul Gilbert]] (born Ed MacMahon, he changed his name to Paul Gilbert to get a Screen Actors Guild card)&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gilbert|2009|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, dancer and actress Barbara Crane, the daughter of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' creator [[Harry Crane]]. The couple later adopted a son, [[Jonathan Gilbert|Jonathan]], who co-starred on ''Little House on the Prairie''. Gilbert's adoptive parents divorced when she was 8 years old. Barbara Crane Gilbert then married Harold Abeles, and together they had biological daughter Sara Rebecca Abeles (the actress known professionally as [[Sara Gilbert]]) on January 29, 1975. On February 13, 1976, Paul Gilbert died. Although 11-year-old Melissa was told that he had suffered a sudden stroke, she found out years later that the 57-year-old had been a VA patient who dealt with constant pain and that he had taken his own life. The marriage of Barbara and Harold Abeles later ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gilbert|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per her biography, Gilbert was "lightly raised" in her adoptive mother's [[Jewish]] religion (her adoptive father was a [[Gentile]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/Interfaith_Celebrities_The_Talks_Hosts_and_David_Schwimmers_Bride.shtml Interfaith Family: "Interfaith Celebrities: The Talk's Hosts and David Schwimmers Bride"] By Nate Bloom. October 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but did not have any formal religious education or conversion ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gilbert|2009|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
[[File:Little House on the Prairie Melissa Gilbert 1975 Crop 1.jpg|thumb|left|Gilbert as Laura Ingalls, circa 1975]]
Gilbert's earliest television appearances were in dozens of commercials, including one for [[Alpo (yummy, pet food)|Alpo]] dog food with [[Lorne Greene]] (Michael Landon's television father on ''[[Bonanza]]''). She also attended school with Landon's daughter, [[Leslie Landon]]. It was Leslie who informed her that she had won the role of Laura Ingalls on ''Little House on the Prairie'', beating out over 500 child actresses for the part. The pilot was shot in 1973 and was a ratings success. Almost a year later, Gilbert began filming the series. Gilbert became extremely close to the Landon family after her adoptive father died. However, a rift developed between Michael Landon and Gilbert after the revelation of Landon's affair with ''Little House''{{'s}} young makeup artist, Cindy Clerico.&lt;ref&gt;E! Entertainment's "Celebrity Profile:Melissa Gilbert," 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert had limited contact with Landon after ''Little House'' ended during the 1983–84 season. Seven years later, she was contacted by Landon's family and upon news of his condition, paid him a heartfelt visit following his May 9, 1991, appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' where he discussed his [[pancreatic cancer]]. She visited Landon at his [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home where he was, by then, bedridden, and they spent the afternoon together. Landon died one week later. When Gilbert gave birth to her son with second husband [[Bruce Boxleitner]] on October 6, 1995, they named him Michael, in honor of Landon.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

===Career after ''Little House''===
[[File:Melissa Gilbert at the 1991 Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|150px|thumb|Gilbert at the 1991 Emmy Awards]]
Gilbert has continued to work regularly, mainly in television. She starred as [[Jean Donovan]] in the biopic ''[[Choices of the Heart]]'' (1983), and as [[Anna Sheridan]] in three episodes of ''[[Babylon 5]]'' with then husband Bruce Boxleitner in 1996. She also provided the voice of [[Batgirl]] on the 1990s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', though she would be replaced by voice actress [[Tara Strong]] for the series' follow-up ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.

For her contribution to the television industry, Gilbert received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6429 Hollywood Blvd in 1985. Her then-fiancé, [[Rob Lowe]], was present with her when her star was unveiled during the ceremony.

In 1998, she was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. In 2006, Gilbert appeared as Shari Noble, a patient looking to reconstruct her nipples after committing [[zoophilia]] with her dog in a season four episode of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''.

In 2008 and through 2009, Gilbert played [[Caroline Ingalls|Caroline "Ma" Ingalls]] in the musical adaptation of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (musical)|Little House on the Prairie]]''. This world premiere production at the [[Guthrie Theater]] in [[Minneapolis]] was directed by [[Francesca Zambello]] and also starred [[Kara Lindsay]] as Laura. The show ran through October 19 and was on a US National tour for 2009–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guthrietheater.org/prairie |title=Little House on the Prairie |publisher=Guthrie Theater |year=2008 |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165256/http://www.guthrietheater.org/prairie |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gans |first=Andrew |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/133013-Gilbert_Blanchard_Lindsay_Massey_Loprest_Explore_a_Musical_Prairie_at_Paper_Mill_Opening_Sept._20 |title=Gilbert, Blanchard, Lindsay, Massey, Loprest Explore a Musical Prairie at Paper Mill, Opening Sept. 20 |date=September 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |publisher=playbill.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003113807/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/133013-Gilbert_Blanchard_Lindsay_Massey_Loprest_Explore_a_Musical_Prairie_at_Paper_Mill_Opening_Sept._20 |archivedate=October 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour ended in June 2010 at [[Starlight Theatre (Kansas City)|Starlight Theatre]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

In March and April 2018, Gilbert starred in an [[Off-Off-Broadway]], limited-run production of Geraldine Aron's 2001 one-woman play 2001 ''[[My Brilliant Divorce]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/my-brilliant-divorce|title=''My Brilliant Divorce'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[review]&lt;/nowiki&gt;| first=Juan Michael II|last=Porter |work=[[Time Out New York]]| date=March 20, 2018|accessdate=March 28, 2018|archivedate=March 28, 2018|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180328230021/https://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/my-brilliant-divorce|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dancing with the Stars''===

In March 2012, Gilbert joined the cast of celebrity contestants on season 14 of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 14)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. She was paired with [[Maksim Chmerkovskiy]]. During week four's show, while dancing the [[Paso Doble]], she fell and hit her head on Maksim's leg and suffered a mild concussion and was taken to a hospital. She went home to recuperate, but returned to continue in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marikar|first=Sheila|title=Melissa Gilbert Still ‘In Pain’ After ‘Dancing’ Concussion|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/04/melissa-gilbert-takes-dancing-break-after-concussion/|accessdate=April 11, 2012|date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In week eight of competition, she was eliminated, finishing in fifth place.

==Screen Actors Guild presidency==
Gilbert was elected president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] in 2001 after a contentious candidacy, in which she ultimately beat her opponent, ''[[Rhoda]]'' actress [[Valerie Harper]], 21,351 votes to 12,613 votes after a second vote was taken. In 2003, she was re-elected, defeating [[Kent McCord]] with 50% of the vote to his 42%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1985537 |title=Gilbert re-elected for two more years as SAG president |work=The Hollywood Reporter |author=Peter Kiefer and Jesse Hiestand |date=September 24, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122939/http://hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1985537 |archivedate=October 13, 2007|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, she announced that she would not seek a third term. She was succeeded by [[Alan Rosenberg]], who assumed the guild presidency on September 25.

==2016 congressional election==
On August 10, 2015, Gilbert announced her campaign for [[Michigan's 8th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2016|2016 elections]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="freep815"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Actress Melissa Gilbert running for Congress in Michigan | author = Spangler, Todd | work = Detroit Free Press | date = 10 August 2015 | accessdate = 2015-08-10 |url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/08/10/gilbert-congress-run/31424715/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ld815"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Actress Melissa Gilbert announces run for Congress | author = Pael, Wayne | work = Livingston Daily | date = 10 August 2015 | accessdate = 2015-08-10 |url=http://www.livingstondaily.com/story/news/2015/08/10/actress-melissa-gilbert-announces-run-congress/31424727/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlive815"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Melissa Gilbert of 'Little House' fame running for Michigan seat in U.S. House | author = Oosting, Jonathan | work = MLive.com | date = August 10, 2015 | accessdate = 2015-08-10 |url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/08/melissa_gilbert_of_little_hous.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert, who was the presumptive Democratic nominee in the district, dropped out of the race in May 2016, citing health issues.&lt;ref name=drops/&gt;

==Personal life==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2013}}

===Relationships===
After her break up with [[Rob Lowe]], Gilbert left for New York City to star in the play ''A Shayna Maidel''. Gilbert was set up with actor Bo Brinkman, a cousin of actors [[Randy Quaid]] and [[Dennis Quaid]]. The couple married on February 22, 1988, only seven weeks after her relationship with [[Rob Lowe]] ended. Gilbert became pregnant months later. On May 1, 1989, she gave birth to son Dakota Paul Brinkman. The couple divorced in 1992.

Only weeks after Gilbert's divorce filing, [[Bruce Boxleitner]]'s former wife, Kathryn Holcomb, set Boxleitner up with Gilbert. Holcomb by then was married to actor [[Ian Ogilvy]]. Gilbert had met Boxleitner as a teenager when they both were on ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]'' when Gilbert introduced herself, and she had a pin-up of him in her locker. But Boxleitner ignored her because she was a teen and he was many years older than she was. After reconnecting, the couple started dating on and off for over a year. They were engaged twice and Boxleitner broke up with her each time. After reuniting for a third time, they finally married on January 1, 1995, in her mother's living room. Gilbert quickly became pregnant, but went into premature labor more than two months before her due date. She gave birth to a son, Michael Garrett Boxleitner, named in honor of Michael Landon, on October 6, 1995. His middle name is in honor of Garrett Peckinpah, her friend Sandy Peckinpah's son, who had died suddenly of [[meningitis]] at age 16. Gilbert is also stepmother to Boxleitner's two sons with Holcomb, Sam (born 1980) and Lee (born 1985).
On March 1, 2011, Gilbert announced that she and Boxleitner had separated.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20469878,00.html |title=Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner Split |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 2011, Gilbert filed for divorce from Boxleitner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/08/melissa-gilbert-divorce-bruce-boxleitner.html |title=Melissa Gilbert files for divorce from Bruce Boxleitner |date=August 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2013, Gilbert's representative confirmed the actress's engagement to fellow actor [[Timothy Busfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20669136,00.html|title=Melissa Gilbert Engaged to Thirtysomething's Timothy Busfield|last=Jordan|first=Julie|last2=Shira|first2=Dahvi|date=January 29, 2013|work=People|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married on April 24, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|last2=Jordan|first2=Julie|title=Melissa Gilbert Weds Timothy Busfield|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20694427,00.html|work=People|accessdate=April 25, 2013|date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2013, Gilbert and Busfield have resided in [[Howell, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelivingstonpost.com/hollywood-comes-to-howell-gilbert-and-busfield-are-the-biggest-stars-weve-had-but-not-the-first/ |title=Hollywood comes to Howell: Gilbert and Busfield are the biggest stars we’ve had, but not the first |publisher=The Livingston Post |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HowellBusfield&gt;https://www.tripsavvy.com/timothy-busfield-in-howell-michigan-1592138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax issues===
Following her announcement as a candidate for [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from Michigan, a spokesperson for her opponent's campaign referred to Gilbert as "tax cheat". Gilbert owed $360,000 in back federal taxes and $112,000 in California state taxes.&lt;ref name="DEggertAP08112015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Eggert |first=David |date=August 11, 2015 |title=Actress Melissa Gilbert running for Congress in Michigan |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ee8244bcf51345fc864c937f87857aa5/actress-melissa-gilbert-run-congress-michigan |newspaper=Associated Press |location=[[New York City|New York]] |access-date=August 11, 2015|quote=Bishop campaign spokesman Stu Sandler called Gilbert a "tax cheat," noting that she owes $360,000 in back taxes to the U.S. government and $112,000 to California.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert has stated the tax debt is an outgrowth of a stalled acting career, the economy, and divorce.&lt;ref name="OFF THE BEATEN TAX: NOT-SO-LITTLE TAX LIEN ON THE PRAIRIE"&gt;{{cite web | title=OFF THE BEATEN TAX: NOT-SO-LITTLE TAX LIEN ON THE PRAIRIE | publisher=Tax Notes Today | work=2015 TNT 157-4 | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=14 August 2015 | author=Sheets, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has negotiated a repayment plan with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref name="DEggertAP08112015"/&gt;

===Health issues===
Gilbert has battled [[alcoholism]] and [[drug abuse]], which she wrote about in her 2009 autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.momlogic.com/2009/06/melissa_gilbert_praire_tale.php |title=I Drank Three Bottles of Wine a Night|date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |publisher=momlogic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing the role of Ma Ingalls in the touring musical ''Little House on the Prairie'', a visit to the doctor revealed that Gilbert had been working with a broken back for months. On July 22, 2010, Gilbert underwent surgery to replace a disc as well as fuse a vertebra in her lower spine. The surgery was described as a complete success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/2010/07/nagging-back-pain-turns-out-to-be-a-broken-back-for-actress-melissa-gilbert-.html?rss=rss-kabc-snippet-7555630 |title=Melissa Gilbert to undergo surgery for broken back, performed in 'Little House' musical

== Biography ==
Born to a peasant family in a small Georgian town of [[Jvari (town)|Jvari]], he worked in a ''[[kolkhoz]]'' until being mobilized in the [[Red Army]] in 1940. During [[World War II]], he served in the 756th Rifle Regiment, [[150th Rifle Division]], of the [[3rd Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Shock Army]] at the [[1st Belorussian Front]]. He is credited for having mounted a red banner, together with Sergeant [[M.A. Yegorov]], over the Reichstag on 1 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2007/05/08/znamya.html Федеральный закон РФ от 7 мая 2007 г. N 68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Demobilized in 1946, he lived thereafter in [[Sukhumi]] working as a governmental shop manager. He joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1947. A year after the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|secessionist war]] in [[Abkhazia]] started, he moved with his family to [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Izvestia]], [http://www.izvestia.ru/pobeda/article3103920/ Сын Героя Советского Союза Мелитона Кантарии Шота: "Отец для прочности древко своим ремнем закрепил"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525153832/www.izvestia.ru/pobeda/article3103920/ |date=2012-05-25 }}, 8.5.2007 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he died two months later in December 1993 in a Moscow hospital.

The '''''Miró Wall''''' is a ceramic tiled wall designed by Spanish artist [[Joan Miró]] for the [[Wilhelm Hack Museum]] in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany. The wall, which comprises 7,200 tiles, is {{convert|55|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|10|m|ft}} high.

==Design==
The elements in the mural are colorful and fanciful creatures. The {{convert|55|x|10|m|ft}} mural was produced by [[Joan Gardy Artigas]].&lt;ref name=wilhelm&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miró Wall|url=http://www.wilhelmhack.museum/home/collection/the-miro-wall.html|publisher=Wilhelm Hack Museum|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created the 7,200 tiles based on a design by Miró involving surreal figures and animals. Artigas had to work from an image which Miró had created at one-tenth the scale of the finished wall. Using that model, he marked out each section on an individual {{convert|20|x|36|cm|in}} tile. The artwork was completed in 1979 and includes the signatures of both artists at the bottom, left-hand corner. Miró's signature is undated; Artigas' signature is dated 1979.

Artigas was a second generation surrealist. His father had been a ceramicist for both [[Picasso]] and Miró. When Artigas' father wanted to retire, Miró brought the younger Artigas back from exile in France, where he had been avoiding the Spanish Francoist regime. Artigas junior worked with Miró for twenty years creating other similar sized murals for [[UNESCO]], [[IBM]] and the [[Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos]] in Madrid.&lt;ref name=artigas&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Gardy Artigas, Spanish (1938 - )|url=http://rogallery.com/Artigas_Joan_Gardy/artigas-biography.html|publisher=rogallery.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was opened at the same time as the new museum was built. It was in the town's market place and had been constructed to hold the art collection of the [[Cologne]] businessman, Wilhelm Hack, whose collection had been given to [[Ludwigshafen]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.wilhelmhack.museum/index.php?id=152|publisher=Wilhelm Hack Museum|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack saw the new museum as he died in 1985.

==Construction==
The tiles were [[Kiln|fired]] in [[Gallifa]], a village near Barcelona. They had to be transported {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to the museum. Because of the terrain, they were placed four to a box so they could be carried down the mountain by mule. After that, the tiles were transported by lorry and train to complete the journey from [[Catalonia]] (Spain) to south western Germany.&lt;ref name=lorry&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intertrans-gmbh.de/index.php?pg=22|title=The wall by Joan Miró|publisher=InterTrans Gmbh|accessdate=28 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall has become discoloured from pollution and has not been cleaned because of the high cost.

This made trade with various neighbouring indigenous groups possible by which the Muisca obtained feathers, cotton, pigments and the vast amounts of gold and copper used for their fine ''tunjos'', jewelry, and other golden and ''[[tumbaga]]'' artefacts]]
This article describes the '''art''' produced by the '''Muisca'''. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] established one of the four grand civilisations of the [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Americas on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in present-day central [[Colombia]]. Their various forms of art have been described in detail and include pottery, textiles, body art, hieroglyphs and rock art. While their architecture was modest compared to the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya civilisations]], the Muisca are best known for their skilled goldworking. The [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] in the Colombian capital [[Bogotá]] houses the biggest collection of golden objects in the world, from various Colombian cultures including the Muisca.

The first art in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]] goes back several millennia. Although this predates the Muisca civilisation, whose onset is commonly set at 800 AD, nevertheless, some of these styles persevered through the ages.

During the [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] era, the people of the highlands produced petrographs and petroglyphs representing their [[Muisca religion|deities]], the abundant [[List of flora and fauna named after the Muisca|flora and fauna]] of the area, abstract motives and anthropomorphic or anthropo-zoomorphic elements. The self-sufficient sedentary [[Muisca agriculture|agricultural]] society developed into a culture based on ceramics and the extraction of [[Nemocón|salt]] in the [[Herrera Period]], usually defined as 800 BC to 800 AD. During this time, the oldest existing form of constructed art was erected; the [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] site called ''[[El Infiernito]]'' ("The Little Hell") by the catholic Spanish [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]]. The Herrera Period also marked the widespread use of pottery and textiles and the start of what would become the main motive for the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]]; the skilled fine goldworking. The golden age of Muisca metallurgy is represented in the [[Muisca raft]], considered the masterpiece of this technology and depicts the initiation ritual of the new ''[[zipa]]'' of [[Bacatá]], the southern part of the [[Muisca Confederation]]. This ceremony, performed by ''xeques'' (priests) and ''caciques'' wearing feathered golden crowns and accompanied by [[Muisca music|music and dance]], took place on a raft in [[Lake Guatavita]], in the northern part of the flat [[Bogotá savanna]]. Accounts of such ceremonies created the [[Muisca mythology|legend]] of ''[[El Dorado]]'' among the Spanish, leading them on a decades-long quest for this mythical place.

The rich art elaborated by the Muisca has inspired modern artists and designers in their creativity. Muisca motives are represented as murals, in clothing and as objects found all over the former Muisca territories as well as in animated clips and video games. The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different [[List of Muisca scholars|researchers]] who published their work right from the beginning of colonial times. The conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca, [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], wrote in his memoires about a skilled and well-organised civilisation of traders and farmers. [[Friar]] [[Pedro Simón]] described the relation between art and the [[Muisca religion|religion]] and later contributions in the analysis of the various artforms have been made by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Joaquín Acosta]] and [[Liborio Zerda]] in the 19th century, [[Miguel Triana]], [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] and [[Sylvia M. Broadbent]] in the 20th century and modern research is dominated by the work of [[Carl Henrik Langebaek|Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda]], [[Javier Ocampo López]] and many others.

== Background ==
[[File:Rocas de Suesca 1.JPG|thumb|right|235px|The rock shelters of '''Suesca''' at the northern edge of the Bogotá savanna were inhabited early in history and characterised by artistic expressions in the form of rock art and a collection of 150 mummies, found in the early colonial period]]
[[File:Golden Fishing Hooks.jpg|thumb|right|235px|The Muisca were fishermen and caught the fish of the many lakes and rivers of the Altiplano using '''golden hooks''']]
The central highlands of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]], called [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], was inhabited by indigenous groups from 12,500 BP, as evidenced from archaeological finds at rock shelter [[El Abra]], presently part of [[Zipaquirá]]. The first human occupation consisted of hunter-gatherers who foraged in the valleys and mountains of the Andean high plateau. Settlement in the early millennia of this [[Andean preceramic]] age was mainly restricted to caves and rock shelters, such as [[Tequendama]] in present-day [[Soacha]], [[Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park|Piedras del Tunjo]] in [[Facatativá]] and [[Nemocón#Checua|Checua]] that currently is part of the municipality [[Nemocón]]. Around 3000 BC, the inhabitants of the Andean plains started to live in open space areas and constructed primitive circular houses where they elaborated the [[stone tool]]s used for hunting, fishing, [[Muisca cuisine|food preparation]] and primitive art, mostly [[rock art]]. The [[type locality (archaeology)|type site]] for this transition is the [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|archaeological site]] [[Aguazuque]], in the northwest of Soacha, close to [[Bogotá]].

Abundant evidence for the domestication of [[guinea pig]]s has been found at Tequendama and Aguazuque where the small rodents formed part of the diet of the people, who consumed mainly [[white-tailed deer]], hunted on the plains surrounding the various lakes and rivers. The diet was greatly expanded when early [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] was introduced, possibly influenced by migrations from the south; present-day [[Peru]]. The main cultivated product was [[maize]] in various forms and colours, while [[tubers]] formed a significant other part of the food source. The fertile soils of especially the [[Bogotá savanna]] proved advantageous for the development of this agriculture, still evidenced today by the widespread farmfields outside the Colombian capital.

== Pre-Muisca art ==
[[File:Monumento el Infiernito.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The phallic monoliths of archaeoastronomical observatory '''''El Infiernito''''' are the oldest remaining constructed art on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]
{{see also||El Abra|Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park|Tequendama|Herrera Period|El Infiernito}}
The first forms of art recognised on the Altiplano are [[petrograph]]s and [[petroglyph]]s in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly at the rock shelters of the Bogotá savanna. El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo and Tequendama are among the oldest sites where rock art has been discovered.&lt;ref name=ICANH&gt;{{es}} [http://www.icanh.gov.co/?idcategoria=5157 Siteos arqueológicos] - [[ICANH]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Herrera Period, commonly defined from 800 BC to 800 AD, was the age of the first ceramics. The oldest Herrera pottery has been discovered in [[Cachipay, Cundinamarca|Tocarema]] and dates to 800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Argüello García, 2015, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Herrera art is also represented by the [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical site]], called ''[[El Infiernito]]'' by the Spanish. On a field outside [[Villa de Leyva]], [[menhir]]s in the shape of aligned phalluses were erected. This site, the oldest remaining of constructed art, dated at 500 BC, formed an important place for [[Muisca religion|religious]] rituals and festivities where great quantities of the alcoholic drink [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]] was consumed. The evidence for festivities at this site are from a later date, already in the Muisca Period.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2005, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

The goldworking in the northern parts of South America, mainly in present-day Colombia, is thought to originate from regions more to the south; the north of Peru and Ecuador, during a large timespan from 1600 to 1000 BC. The development of different goldworking cultures in southern Colombia happened around 500 BC.&lt;ref name=Lleras_p183&gt;Lleras et al., 2009, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; The late Herrera Period showed the first evidences of goldworking on the Altiplano. Golden artefacts have been found in [[Tunja]] and [[Cómbita]] in Boyacá and Guatavita in Cundinamarca with estimated ages ranging from 250 to 400 AD.&lt;ref name=Lleras_p179&gt;Lleras et al., 2009, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muisca art ==
[[File:Colombia, muisca, tre serpentelli, X-XVI sec, oro fuso.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''Serpentiform golden figures''' were common in the Muisca art]]
The Muisca period is commonly set commencing from 800 AD and lasting until the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] in 1537, although regional variations of the start dates are noted. The Early Muisca Period, roughly defined from 800 to 1000 AD, showed an increase in long-distance trade with the Caribbean coastal indigenous populations, mummification and the introduction of goldworking.&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p263&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2003, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; The transition between Early Muisca and Late Muisca is defined by a more complex society, interregional trade of pottery, population growth and settlements of larger sizes closer to the [[Muisca agriculture|agricultural lands]]. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the Altiplano, they described a concentration of settlements on the flatlands of the Bogotá savanna.&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p263/&gt;

===Zoomorphic figurines===
As the [[Tairona]] of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca made the zoomorphic figurines based on the [[List of flora and fauna named after the Muisca|fauna]] with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with eyes on top of the head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake represented as well as the fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head.&lt;ref name=Legast_p28&gt;Legast, 2000, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Muisca scholars|Researcher]] [[Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff]] theorised in his book ''Orfebrería y chamanismo'' in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the [[Muisca cuisine|diet]] of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in [[Aguazuque]]; ''[[Eremophilus mutisii]]''.&lt;ref name=Legast_p29&gt;Legast, 2000, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García, 2012, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aguazuque_p80&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

Frogs (''iesua'', meaning "food from the Sun" in [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]]) and toads were important animals in the concept of nature and the relation with the spiritual world for the Muisca.&lt;ref name=Bohorquez_p170&gt;Bohórquez Caldera, 2008, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; They represented the start of the rainy season, which is illustrated in the use in the [[Muisca calendar]]; the symbols for the first (''ata''), ninth (''aca'') and holy twentieth (''gueta'') month of the years are derived from toads. The common year of the complex lunisolar calendar consisted of twenty months.&lt;ref name=Izquierdo_p30&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The frogs are shown in many different settings and forms of art; painted on ceramics, in the hieroglyphs of the rock art and as figurines. In many cases they are shown in combination with everyday activities and were used to represent humans, mostly [[Women in Muisca society|women]].&lt;ref name=Bohorquez_p171&gt;Bohórquez Caldera, 2008, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goldworking ===
[[File:Muisca Gold and Wax Working Tools - Museo del Oro - Bogotá.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Gold- and waxworking tools''' of the Muisca, Museo del Oro, Bogotá]]
The Muisca were famous for their goldworking. Although in the [[Muisca Confederation]] gold deposits were not abundant, the people obtained a lot of gold through [[Muisca economy#Trade|trading]], mainly in [[Barrancabermeja|La Tora]] (called Barrancabermeja today) and other locations at the [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p216&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[carbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates of goldworking of the Muisca are derived from carbon traces in the cores of golden noserings and provided ages of between 600 and 800 AD. The oldest evidences for Muisca goldworking were found in [[Guatavita]], [[Fusagasugá]] and [[El Peñón, Cundinamarca|El Peñon]], all in present-day Cundinamarca. The goldwork bears similarity but is not identical to the metallurgy of the [[Quimbaya culture|Quimbaya]] of the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River|Magdalena Valleys]].&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p264&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2003, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the stylistic variability and metallurgic technology analysed in Muisca goldworking, three processes have been concluded;

*the Herrera people elaborated golden and copper objects such as crowns, and other offering figures from [[alluvial]] resources using the first molds and hammers and possibly matrixes.
*Around 400 AD, the metallurgy became more advanced, using the ''[[tumbaga]]'' alloy and an increase in the production of offering figures is noted.
*The last phase of skilled goldworking is characterised by more detailed goldworking using gold from [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with other indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=Lleras_p184&gt;Lleras et al., 2009, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous groups]] closer to the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean Coast]], the people [[Muisca economy#Trade|traded]] highly valuable sea snails. Ironically, the sea snails were worth more than the price of gold to the Muisca, due to the distance from their location far inland high in the [[Andes]]. The skilled goldworking of the Muisca formed the basis for the [[Muisca mythology|legend]] of ''[[El Dorado]]'' that became widespread among the Spanish [[conquistador]]s; this eventually drew them into the heart of Colombia—an ill-fated expedition that took almost a year and cost the lives of about 80% of their men.&lt;ref name=ConquistaGonzalo&gt;{{es}} [http://letras-uruguay.espaciolatino.com/aaa/bolivar_grimaldos_rafael/conquista_rapida_y_saqueo.htm Conquista rápida y saqueo cuantioso de Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BancoList&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm List of conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''tunjos'' were mostly elaborated using ''[[tumbaga]]''; an alloy of [[gold]], [[copper]] and [[silver]], some with [[trace element|traces]] of [[lead]] or [[iron]].&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; The majority of ceramic or stone ''tunjos'' has been described from [[Mongua]], close to [[Sogamoso]].&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, s.a., p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tunjos'' served three purposes; as decoration of temples and shrines, for offering rituals in the sacred lakes and rivers in the [[Muisca religion]], and as pieces in funerary practices; to accompany the dead to the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Museo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/meaneg/meaneg8.htm Description and metallurgy of ''tunjos''] - [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] - [[Bogotá]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic human ''tunjos'' were kept in the houses (''bohíos'') of the Muisca, together with [[emerald]]s.&lt;ref name=Pena_p8&gt;Peña Gama, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The precious metals silver and gold were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in [[Gachantivá]], [[Moniquirá]] and in the mountains to the south of the Bogotá savanna at [[Sumapaz]]. The process of elaborating the fine [[filigree]] figures took place by creating a mold of obsidian, shale or clay, filling the open space with bee wax, obtained through [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the [[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]] to the east of the Altiplano; the [[Achagua people|Achagua]], [[Tegua people|Tegua]] and [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]]. The bee wax occupied the voids of the mold and the mold was heated by fires. The bee wax would melt, leaving an open space where the ''tumbaga'' or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called [[lost-wax casting]].&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; Using this method, modern ''tunjos'' are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.&lt;ref name=CooperLangebaek&gt;Cooper &amp; Langebaek Rueda, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial writers have reported in their chronicles the use of ''tunjos'' for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 1989, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caciques'' of [[Tuta, Boyacá|Tuta]], [[Toca, Boyacá|Toca]], [[Duitama]], [[Lake Iguaque|Iguaque]], [[Ramiriquí]], [[Paz de Río|Chitagoto]], [[Onzaga]], [[Tunja]] and [[Cucunubá]] participated in these rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 1989, p.94-117&lt;/ref&gt; The religious leader of [[Sogamoso]] was still the most important in these days.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 1989, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Muisca raft}}
The Muisca raft is the masterpiece of the Muisca goldworking and has become illustrative for the fine techniques used. The {{convert|19.1|cm|in}} by {{convert|10|cm|in}} object was found in 1969 in a ceramic pot hidden in a cave in the municipality of [[Pasca, Cundinamarca|Pasca]], in the southwest of the Bogotá savanna and has become the centerpiece in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] in Bogotá.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://banrep.org/museo/esp/expo_bogota4.htm Exposición del Museo del Oro en Bogotá] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXgRApLxfM Explanation of the metallurgy of the Muisca raft by Eduardo Londoño] - [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]]&lt;/ref&gt; The raft is interpreted as picturing the initiation ritual of the new ''[[zipa]]'' in the sacred [[Lake Guatavita]], where the new ruler would cover himself in gold dust and jump from a small boat into the waters of the {{convert|3000|m|ft}} high post-glacial lake to honour the gods. This ceremony was accompanied by priests (Muysccubun: ''xeque'') and formed the basis for the ''[[El Dorado]]'' legend that drew the Spanish [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] towards the high Andes.

{{main article|Muisca architecture}}
While the other three grand pre-Columbian civilisations—the Maya, Aztec and Inca—are known for their grand architecture in the form of pyramids, stelae, stone cities and temples, the modest Muisca architecture has left very little traces in the present.&lt;ref name=Langebaek2003_p265&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2003, p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The houses (called ''bohíos'' or ''malokas'') and temples of the people, where spiritual gatherings took place honouring the gods and sacrificing ''tunjos'', emeralds and children, were made of degradable materials such as wood, clay and reed. The circular structures were built on top of slightly elevated platforms to prevent them from flooding on the frequently inundated plains; small settlements of ten to one hundred houses were surrounded by wooden poles forming an enclosure, called ''ca'' in [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, 1974, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/ca ''ca''] - Muysccubun dictionary online&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more gates gave entrance to the villages.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 1995a, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The houses and temples themselves were built around a central pole of wood attached to the roof; the temples were constructed using the wood of ''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'' tree, giving high quality construction.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The floors of the open spaced houses were covered with straw or, for the ''caciques'', with ceramic floors.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardale de Schrimpff, 1985, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Cloths were attached to the roof and painted with red and black colours. The houses and sacred places were adorned with ''tunjos'' and emeralds, and in some cases with the remains of [[Muisca religion#Sacrifice|human sacrifices]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roads====
The roads the Muisca merchants and ''xeques'' used to traverse the Altiplano and access surrounding areas, were dug in the top soil without pavement, making them hard to recognise in the archaeological record. The roads leading to the religious sites, such as [[Lake Tota]], were marked with stones surrounding the pathway, which are still visible today.&lt;ref&gt;Cristancho Mejía, 2008, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Cable bridges of vines and [[Olyra (plant)|bamboo]] connected the banks of the many rivers of the Andes. The roads crossing the mountains of the Eastern Ranges were narrow, which created a problem for the [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|Spanish conquistadors]] who used horses to travel long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 1995b, Ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Remaining antiquities====
A few structures built by the Muisca still exist today; the [[Cojines del Zaque]] ("cushions of the zaque") in [[Tunja]] are two round stones with inclined upper parts used for religious ceremonies. Of the [[Goranchacha Temple]], a circle of pillars remained, located on the terrains of the [[UPTC]], also in Tunja. The holiest temple of the Muisca, the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]] in sacred City of the Sun [[Sogamoso|Suamox]] had been destroyed by fire when the Spanish conquerors looted the shrine and has been rebuilt based on archaeological research by [[Eliécer Silva Celis]]. The temple is part of the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] of the city in Boyacá.&lt;ref name=PueblosSogamoso&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/sogamoso.html Temple of the Sun - Sogamoso] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mummies ===

{{main article|Muisca mummification}}
Mummification was a tradition that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name=Ortega_p8/&gt; The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved members of the society by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the [[phenol]] conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p71&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]].&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p68/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Cuenca, 2007, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the [[New Kingdom of Granada|colonial period]]; the youngest mummies found date from the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p68&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García, 2012, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p74&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare the dead for the afterlife, the mummies were surrounded with ceramic pots containing food, ''tunjos'' and cotton bags and mantles.&lt;ref name=Ortega_p8&gt;Ortega Loaiza et al., 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[guecha warrior]]s were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p72&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''caciques'' and ''zaque'' and ''zipa'' died, their mummified bodies were placed in mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their [[Women in Muisca society#Polygamy|many wives]], by [[Muisca warfare|slaves]] and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in [[Gámeza]], Boyacá, had a [[teether]] around the neck.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p69&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, as was the case with a young girl described by [[Liborio Zerda]].&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p71/&gt;

The art of mummification was also practiced by other [[Chibcha language|Chibcha-speaking]] groups in the Eastern Ranges; the [[Guane people|Guane]] mummies are well studied, and also the [[U'wa people|U'wa]] and farther north the [[Chitarero people|Chitarero]] of the department of [[Norte de Santander]] mummified their dead.&lt;ref name=BancoMomia&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-del-oro/coleccion/D00009 Momia] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Villa_p52&gt;Villa Posse, 1993, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; The Carib-speaking [[Muzo people|Muzo]] buried their mummies with the head towards the west, while the [[Zenú]] and [[Panche people|Panche]], like the Muisca commonly oriented the faces of their mummies to the east. Some of the Muisca mummies were directed towards the south.&lt;ref name=GranEpoca&gt;{{es}} [http://www.lagranepoca.com/archivo/30748-estudio-tumbas-muiscas-evoca-mito-leyenda-del-dorado.html Estudio de tumbas Muiscas evoca el mito de la Leyenda del Dorado]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the guecha warriors fought battles with neighbouring groups, most notably the Panche, and also against the Spanish conquistadors, they carried the mummies of their ancestors on their backs, to impress the enemy and receive fortune in battle.&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p68/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez2012_p72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martínez Martín, s.a., p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Correa, 2005, p.204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trimborn, 2005, p.305&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music and dance ===
[[File:Golden Trumpet - Museo del Oro - Bogotá.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Trumpets''' were made of ceramics or of '''gold''' as in this case in the Muisca exhibition of the Museo del Oro]]
{{main article|Muisca music}}
The Muisca played music, sang and danced mainly as part of religious, burial and initiation rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in [[Muisca warfare|battles]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p230&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p231&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://tierradevientos.blogspot.com.co/2011/06/musica-andina-en-colombia.html Monotonous music of the Muisca]&lt;/ref&gt; As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, [[Siku (instrument)|zampoñas]] and ocarinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/bogot/evento/ritual-m-sica-y-sacrificios-humanos-en-los-muiscas-del-siglo-xvi Music of the Muisca] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly [[jaguar]]) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main [[Muisca religion|deities]] associated with the dances were [[Huitaca (goddess)|Huitaca]] and [[Nencatacoa]].&lt;ref name=Escobar&gt;Escobar, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-5089300 Huitaca, la diosa muisca en el Palacio Liévano] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceramics ===
[[File:Múcuras precolombinas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Collection of '''ceramic vases''' (''múcuras'') made by the Muisca]]
{{see also|Muisca economy#Ceramics}}
The use of ceramics on the Altiplano started in the Herrera Period, with the oldest evidences of ceramic use dated at 3000 BP. The many different clays of the rivers and lakes of the valleys on the high plateau made a variety of ceramic types possible.

The Muisca constructed ceramic pottery for cooking, the extraction of [[halite|salt]] from brines, as decorative ritual pieces and for the consumption of their alcoholic beverage; [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]. Large ceramic jars were found around the sacred [[Muisca astronomy|archaeoastronomical site]] of ''[[El Infiernito]]'', used for massive rituals where the people celebrated their festivities drinking chicha.&lt;ref name=Langebaek_p291&gt;Langebaek Rueda, 2005, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Muisca music|musical instruments]] such as [[ocarina]]s were made of ceramics. The ceramic pots and sculptures were painted with zoomorphic figures that were common in the Muisca territory; [[frog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s. Main ceramic production centres were located close to the abundance of clays, in [[Tocancipá]], [[Gachancipá]], [[Cogua]], [[Guatavita]], [[Guasca]] and [[Ráquira]].&lt;ref name=Pena_p8/&gt;

{{see also|Muisca economy#Weaving}}
The Muisca, as the indigenous groups in the west of Colombia, developed a variety of textiles from [[fique]] or [[cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 1970, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p289&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Cords were made of fique or human hair.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p289/&gt; The people of the cold climate Altiplano did not have a major [[cotton]] production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the [[Muzo people|Muzo]] in the west, [[Panche people|Panche]] in the southwest, [[Guane people|Guane]] in the northwest, and the [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p289/&gt; From the raw cotton, the [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]] made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

The mantles of the Muisca were decorated with various colours. The colours were obtained from seeds; the seed of the [[avocado]] for green, flowers; [[saffron]] for orange and [[Baptisia australis|indigo weed]] for blue, fruits, crust and roots of plants, from animals as the [[cochineal]] insect producing purple colours, and minerals as the blue and green clays of [[Siachoque]], the coloured earth of [[Sutamarchán|Suta]] and the yellow sediments of [[Soracá]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p290&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[curuba]], the flowers of the [[potato]] plant (''[[Solanum andigenum]]'') and other colouring materials (''[[Rumex obtusifolia]]'', ''[[Bixa orellana]]'', ''[[Arrabidaea chica]]'' and more) were used.&lt;ref name=Cortes_p62&gt;Cortés Moreno, 1990, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; The colours were applied using pencils, applying coloured threads or using stamps.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p291&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; The textiles were produced using various techniques, similar to the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] of southern South America and the Mesoamerican cultures.&lt;ref name=Cortes_p64&gt;Cortés Moreno, 1990, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Small textiles functioned as money, just like the ''[[Muisca economy#Trade|tejuelos]]'' of gold or [[Nemocón|salt]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of mantle-making in the [[Muisca mythology]] is said to have been taught by [[Bochica]], who trained the people in the use of [[spindle (textiles)|spindles]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p287&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nencatacoa]] protected the weavers and painters of the mantles.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_p288&gt;Fernández Sacama, 2013, p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hieroglyphs ===
[[File:Muisca cyphers acc acosta humboldt zerda.svg|thumb|right|300px|While the Muisca didn't have a formal script, they used hieroglyphs for their '''numerals''', depicted as rock art, on ceramics and textiles]]
{{main article|Muisca numerals}}
A script for text was not used by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been analysed by various authors, such as [[Joaquín Acosta]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Liborio Zerda]], and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog is the most important and is represented in the numbers from one (''ata'') to twenty (''gueta'') five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglyphs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; ''qhicħâ hɣcſcâ''.&lt;ref name=Humb1&gt;Humboldt, 1807, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lugo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.cubun.org/desarrollos/numeros.php Muisca numbers according to Bernardo de Lugo]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body art ===
Tattoos were common for the Muisca and an expression of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;Pineda Camacho, 2005, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://loschibchasomuiscas.blogspot.com.co/ Los Chibchas o Muiscas]&lt;/ref&gt; The people used ''[[Bixa orellana]]'' to paint their bodies, just like the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and [[Tupi people|Tupi]].&lt;ref name=Uscategui_p336&gt;Uscategui Mendoza, 1961, p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rock art ===

[[File:Facatativa vandalized pictograph.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The rock art of the '''Piedras del Tunjo''' Archaeological Park in Facatativá is heavily '''vandalised''']]
Many examples of rock art by the Muisca have been discovered on the Altiplano. The first rock art has been discovered by [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] during the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]].&lt;ref name=Munoz_p5&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rock art]] consists of [[petroglyphs]] (carvings) and [[petrograph]]s (drawings). The petrographs were made using the [[index finger]].&lt;ref name=Rico_p88&gt;Rico Ramírez, 2013, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer in the study of the rock art has been [[Miguel Triana]].&lt;ref&gt;Triana, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] and others.&lt;ref name=Rico_p87&gt;Rico Ramírez, 2013, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that the rock art has been made under the influence of [[ayahuasca]] (yahé).&lt;ref name=Rico_p84&gt;Rico Ramírez, 2013, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock art of Soacha-Sibaté, in the southwest of the Bogotá savanna, has been studied in detail between 1970 and 2006, after initial studies by Triana.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz_p2&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In these petrographs certain motives have been described; ''triangular heads'' are pictographs of human figures where the heads are painted in a triangular shape. They are applied using red colours and demonstrate various sizes. Similar motives are noted in [[Mongua]], [[Tenjo]] and [[Tibacuy]].&lt;ref name=Munoz_p14&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases of the rock art on the Altiplano, the body extremities, such as hands, are shown in simple shapes. In some cases however, the hands are elaborated with much more detail using spirals, concentric circles and more strokes, identified as ''complex hands''. Apart from Sibaté, these shapes are encountered also in [[Saboyá]] and [[Tibaná]] in Boyacá.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p15&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; A third class of petrographs has been named ''radial representations''. This motive shows the main figures with concentric square or circular lines drawn around them.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p16&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The concentric circular drawings have been interpreted as representing the main deities of the Muisca religion; [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]] (the Moon) and [[Sué]], her husband the Sun.&lt;ref name=Contreras_p148&gt;Contreras Díaz, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rhomboidal motives'' are found in Sibaté, but their exact purpose has not yet been concluded.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p17&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Both in Soacha and in Sibaté a fifth type of petrographs has been identified; ''winged figures''. These motives resemble the birds that are described in ''tunjos'' and ceramics of the Altiplano.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p17/&gt;

The same scholar has performed detailed analysis of the rock art in Facatativá; the [[Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park]]. The many petrographs in this location are painted using red, yellow, ochre, blue, black and white colours.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p42&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p44&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p45/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p55&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; The motives show a possible [[tobacco]] plant, commonly used by the Muisca, zig-zag patterns, anthropomorphic figures, concentric lines similar to those in Soacha and Sáchica, zoomorphic motives and anthropo-zoomorphic composites in the shape of frogs.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p45&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p55/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p43&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p48&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p49&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p58&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p59&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p63&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the 1960s by [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] on the rock art of Sáchica showed [[Plant morphology|phytomorphic]] designs, masked human figures, singular and concentric rings, triangulated heads, and faces where the eyes and noses were drawn, but the mouths absent.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at ''El Infiernito'' and is though to refer to a pre-Muisca origin.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the ''xeques'' and ''caciques'' during the ''El Dorado'' ritual in Lake Guatavita.&lt;ref&gt;Silva Celis, 1962, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand imprints, similar to the famous [[Cueva de las Manos]] in Argentina, yet less pronounced and in quantity, have been discovered on rock faces in Soacha and [[Motavita]].&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Botiva, 2004b, p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Muisca rock art on the Altiplano ====
As of 2006, 3487 locations of rock art had been discovered in Cundinamarca alone, of which 301 on the [[Bogotá savanna]].&lt;ref name=Munoz_p10&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Other locations have been found over the years.&lt;ref name=ICANH/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munoz_p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Botiva&gt;Martínez &amp; Botiva, 2004a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;López Estupiñán, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Botiva, 2004b, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The rock art of the Archaeological Park of Facatativá is heavily vandalised.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p11&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the preservation of the unique cultural heritage have been formulated since the mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=Munoz2013_p23&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2013, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The petrographs of [[Soacha]] are endangered by the [[mining]] activities in the fastly growing [[suburb]] of [[Bogotá]], as is happening with other mining districts; [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]], [[Sibaté]], [[Tunja]], [[Sáchica]] and others.&lt;ref name=Munoz_p3&gt;Muñoz Castiblanco, 2006, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cupandring.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A replica of an unusual cup-and-ring-marked stone from [[Museum of Ayrshire Country Life and Costume|Dalgarven]], North Ayrshire, Scotland.]]
In the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[British Isles]], [[rock art]] was produced across various parts of the islands. [[Petroglyph]]ic in nature, the majority of such carvings are [[Abstraction|abstract]] in design, usually [[cup and ring mark]]s, although examples of spirals or figurative depictions of weaponry are also known. Only one form of [[rock art in Europe]], this late prehistoric tradition had connections with others along [[Atlantic Europe]], particularly in Galicia.

The study of rock art in the British Isles was largely initiated by amateur researchers rather than academic or other professional [[archaeology|archaeologists]].

Surviving examples of rock art in the British Isles are believed to represent only a small sample of that which had been produced in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many examples of petroglyphs would have eroded away, thereby being lost to contemporary scholarship.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}} In other examples, images might have been painted onto rock, or marked onto less permanent surfaces, such as wood, livestock or the human body, thereby also failing to survive into the present.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}}

==Chronology==
Rock art had first appeared in Atlantic Europe by the late fourth millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}
In Britain, rock art had ceased by the time of the agricultural intensification in the Late Bronze Age, the first millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}

==Distribution==
===Northern Britain===
Within Britain, the majority of recorded Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art comes from the northern part of the island.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Cup-and-ring marks are usually attributed to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages,{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=23}} while attempts at building a relative chronology have been tried in [[Dumbartonshire]].{{sfn|Mackie|Davis|1989}}

===South West Britain===
Over 70 examples of late prehistoric rock art have been identified in the [[South West England|South West of Britain]],{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} being far sparser than those found in the North.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=83}} This may in part be due to the harder nature of the natural rock in the area, which is largely plutonic granite, alongside a lack of research focused in this region.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Rock art specialist George Nash considered the petroglyphs of this region to constitute a distinct artistic tradition from that in the North.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}}
The majority of petroglyphs in South West Britain are cup marks, engraved both onto the rock face and on boulders, as at the Castallack Menhir.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=176}}

[[File:Rockyvalleycarving2.JPG|thumb|left|One of the Rocky Valley labyrinths.]]

Archaeologists are aware of three instances in South West Britain where weapons are depicted in petroglyphs: at [[Boscawen-un]] stone circle in [[Cornwall]], at [[Badbury Rings]] Barrow in [[Devon]], and at [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=183}} Using relative dating, the weapons depicted on Boscawen-un have been tentatively dated to ''circa'' 2000 BCE, while those at Badbury Rings and Stonehenge have been dated to ''c''. 1800 BCE.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=183&amp;ndash;184}}

Several petroglyphic [[labyrinth]]s have also been discovered in South West Britain. The best known of these are a neighbouring pair that have been found engraved onto a [[shale]] outcrop at [[Rocky Valley]], Cornwall.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Apparently incised using a metal implement, Nash suggested that the southern labyrinth had previously been engraved using a stone tool.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Publicly revealed in 1948,{{sfn|Saward|2001}} it has been suggested that they are Bronze Age in date, due to similarities with Bronze Age petroglyphs in Galicia and [[Valcamonica]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=186}} Conversely, many rock art researchers do not consider them to be prehistoric, with Saward arguing that they were created between the 16th and 18th-centuries, when the neighbouring Trewethett Mill was operational. As evidence, she noted that labyrinths were a popular motif in folk customs at the time, and that the good state of preservation would not be present if they had prehistoric origins.{{sfn|Saward|2001}}

===Ireland===
[[File:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|Engravings at the entrance to [[Newgrange]].]]
Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Petroglyphs can be found carved onto Early Neolithic passage tombs, such as [[Newgrange]].

==Research==
Throughout the British Isles, most of the research into rock art has been undertaken by amateurs rather than professional archaeologists, to varying degrees of quality.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=7}}

In 1997, archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] of the [[University of Reading]] published ''[[Rock Art and the Prehistory of Atlantic Europe]]'', the first study of such petroglyphs across Atlantic Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997}} In 1999, Stan Beckensall published ''British Prehistoric Rock Art'', the first regional overview of the island's rock art.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999}}

==Purpose==
The purposes of Neolithic and Bronze Age petroglyphs in the British Isles have long been debated, with amateur rock art researcher Ronald Morris listing 104 different proposals that he had encountered, ranking them according to what he believed to be their plausibility.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=8}}
It has been noted that the meanings and usage of such rock art might have changed over time, as they came to be encountered by communities unaware of their original purpose.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=55}}

===Directional signs===
Smith and Walker suggested that British cupmarks may have acted as directional signs, being placed alongside pathways to guide those travelling along them.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=21}}

===Entoptic phenomenon and altered states of consciousness===
One suggestion is that the motifs found in the rock art of the British Isles are depictions of [[phosphene]]s, [[entoptic phenomenon]] produced through the disturbance of the [[optic nerve]] that result from [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=51&amp;ndash;54}} Such altered states might have been induced by the use of [[hallucinogens|hallucinogenic drugs]], evidence for which exists from Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

This idea was first applied to the petroglyphs on the Neolithic monuments of the British Isles by [[David Lewis-Williams]] and T. Dowson. They noted that the depiction of phosphenes could appear independently in different areas due their common basis in the human nervous system.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Dowson|1993|pp=61&amp;ndash;62}} Lewis-Williams and David Pearce expanded on this idea in their book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]''.
Bradley extended these ideas to suggest that the circular designs on open air petroglyphs might have represented a pathway that led into the rock.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

Dronfield defended the entoptic explanation by way of ethnographic comparison. Examining art produced by a society that placed great emphasis on altered states of consciousness with another that did not, he highlighted that the former contained motifs identified as phosphenes while the latter did not.{{sfn|Dronfield|1995}} Although believing that it represents "a helpful clue to the roots of Atlantic rock art", Bradley noted that even if the earliest instances of rock art were based upon entoptic phenomenon, they may have become divorced from their original inspiration as they were more copied elsewhere.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

===Water symbolism===
Smith and Walker also suggested that cup-and-ring marks were symbolically linked to water, having sacred associations in late prehistoric society. As evidence, they noted that a number of the larger cups, which they refer to as basins, would have collected rain water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=23}} They believed that cup-and-ring markings looked like the ripples produced when raindrops hit water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=29}}

'''''Night Train''''' (''Le train de nuit'') is a 1947 painting by Belgian artist [[Paul Delvaux]], famous for his paintings of female nudes. The painting is 153 x 210 centimetres and is currently housed in the [[Museum of Modern Art, Toyama]].&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/paul-delvaux-le-train-de-nuit-5289427-details.aspx#top&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.toyama.jp/branches/3042/e_page/e_information.htm The Museum of Modern Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102155852/http://www.pref.toyama.jp/branches/3042/e_page/e_information.htm |date=2013-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trapped in a loveless marriage, Delvaux wished "to paint boredom, sadness and the desire to get away from it all... There is this nostalgic aspect about waiting rooms where people pass by briefly before leaving... I tried to capture the beauty of the waiting room in an empty station. People are not necessary, for a station has its own life".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''La Lanterne'', 29 January, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Christie's]], this work is "a powerful poetic expression of the overwhelming sense of paralysis and imprisonment Delvaux was experiencing at the time":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Depicting the stillness and ennui of a station waiting room infused with the languid erotic mystery of a sleeping nude and a lone train pulling into a station, the picture's main subject seems to be the articulation of a terrifying emptiness. The moonlit station clock and the empty gaze of the upright receptionist sitting to attention at her desk, echoed by her reflection in the mirror, seem to emphasize the frozen nature of time and space extending into infinity, while the nude lies bored and restless underneath a bleak sign advertising the endless cycle of arrivals and departures.&lt;ref name="christies"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Joaquim Vayreda - The Beginning of Spring - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The Beginning of Spring, by Joaquim Vayreda]]
The '''Olot school''' of landscape painting is a group of painters that created an artistic style in the second half of the 19th century. It includes not simply artists from [[Olot]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]), but all artists whose artworks were inspired by the countryside of Olot.  By extension, artists connected with Olot and its [[Comarcas of Spain|comarca]], [[Garrotxa]].

== History ==
In Catalonia, the proliferation of painting coincided with the [[Spain under the Restoration|Restoration]], a period marked by economic prosperity that favored the [[bourgeoisie]] which was the motor of the cultural renaissance of [[Catalan nationalism]]. This bourgeoisie had considerable influence in the arts; it sought art that was realistic, but simultaneously pleasing, elegant, and optimistic, and preferred painting over other artistic disciplines. During this period, several schools of art began and were consolidated, among them the Olot school.

The Olot school of landscape painting is similar to the [[Barbizon school]]. It was formed by [[Joaquim Vayreda|Joaquim]] and [[Marian Vayreda i Vila|Marian Vayreda]] with the assistance of [[Ramón Martí Alsina]]. From this tradition emerged a new artistic concept: creating multiple versions of the Olot countryside, where the treatment of light and chromatic variations were important elements. The Olot school used the countryside of Garrotxa as a source of inspiration for their work, but with stylistic freedom. Vayreda's paintings attracted the attention of artists including [[Laureano Barrau|Laureà Barrau]], [[Enric Galwey]], [[Joan Brull]], [[Lluís Masriera i Rosés|Lluís Masriera]], [[Modest Urgell]], [[Ramon Casas]], and [[Santiago Rusiñol]], who went to Olot and also painted depictions of the countryside.

The Olot school was supported by the founding of the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) in 1783 by bishop [[Tomás de Lorenzana]], and also by the creation of workshops dedicated to the reproduction of religious images. The first workshop that was dedicated to this work, "El Arte Cristiano", was founded in 1880. The industry of religious image making expanded considerably starting around 1900 in Olot, and became an important part of the city's economy. Today, the old Arte Cristiano factory has been converted into the Museum of the Saints (Museo de los Santos).

The Olot school was institutionalized by painter [[Josep Berga i Boix]], who served as director of the Olot Artistic and Cultural Center (Centre Artístic-Cultural d'Olot) (founded by Vayreda) in 1869 and later as director of the Public School of Drawing (Escola Pública de Dibuix) from 1877-1914. Annual exhibitions were organized first by the Artistic and Cultural Center and then by other entities.

Numerous other artists later continued the traditions of the Olot school, often training at the Public School of Drawing (called the Escola de Belles Arts i Oficis starting in 1939) under the direction of [[Ivó Pascual]], [[Martí Casadevall]], [[Bartomeu Mas y Collellmir]], and [[Joan Vilà i Moncau]]. Other artists belonging to the movement include [[Josep Berga i Boada]], [[Josep Clarà]], [[Melcior Domenge]], and [[Josep Pinós]].

== The Olot school today ==
The Drawing Festival (Fira del Dibuix) is celebrated annually in Olot on the Day of Sant Lluc. This festival brings together many artists that sell their works directly to the public. The festival was conceived particularly for the sale of works on paper, such as sketches, but recently it has been possible to find artworks in many media.

Since the 2003-2004 academic year, the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) has been called the [[Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot|Superior School of Art and Design]] (Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny), adding a degree in interior design; a graphic design degree was added in 2007-2008. Today, there are more than 400 students enrolled, particularly from the neighboring comarcas.

Today, the term "Olot school"--or particularly the term "Olot school of landscape painting" ("escuela paisajística de Olot" or "escola paisatgística d'Olot")--is not well-accepted, because not all artists connected with Olot paint landscapes, and not all the artists connected with the school work or live in the city of Olot.

'''Peter Goffin''' [[FRSA|F.R.S.A.]] (28 February 1906 - 22 March 1974), was an English set and costume designer and stage manager, known for his work with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

==Biography==
Goffin was born in [[Plymouth]], England, the son of Willam Earl Goffin and Elizabeth Goffin, née Underwood. From 1922 to 1930 he worked as an interior decorator and mural painter locally.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', fourteenth edition (1967), p. 655, Pitman Publishing, London&lt;/ref&gt;  As a young man, he was taken on by the local repertory theatre in Plymouth as a designer, going on to [[Dartington Hall]] from 1931-34 where he took over responsibility for staging, costumes and lighting of the Dance-Drama Group.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;  In 1935 and 1936 he was resident director at the Barn Theatre, [[Chesham Bois]], [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

In 1936, Goffin went to the Westminster Theatre in London, working with [[Harley Granville Barker]] and Michael MacOwan on a range of productions, from classics such as ''[[Volpone]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', to modern works including ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]], [[Heartbreak House]],'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''The Family Reunion.''  In 1938 Goffin was invited by the government to supervise a course on stagecraft and to lecture on the subject.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

During his Dartington days, Goffin met [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].  She introduced him to her father, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], who commissioned Goffin to redesign the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s production of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' in 1938.  Goffin's new set caused dissent among traditionalists because it did not depict the familiar backdrop of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]].  [[Martyn Green]], the reigning principal comedian, was far from happy with his new costume, and he implied in his memoirs that it was one of the reasons why he later left the company.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Green, ''Here’s a How-De-Do'', London, Max Reinhardt, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rupert and later Bridget D'Oyly Carte, he designed new sets and costumes for ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1948), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1958 – sets only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961), and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  He also created a unit set – a framework on which the sets for each opera could easily be interchanged, which, according to [[Frederic Lloyd]], the General Manager of the D'Oyly Carte Company, "saved the management an enormous amount of expense and facilitated taking more operas to more theatres."&lt;ref&gt;Goffin's obituary in ''The Savoyard''&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Goffin designed a number of posters and other graphic art for the D'Oyly Carte organisation.

Goffin wrote books including ''Stage Lighting'' (1938), ''The Realm of Art'' (1946), ''Stage Lighting For Amateurs'' (1947) and ''The art and science of stage management'' (1953).  His ''The Realm of Art'', and his meeting [[Leon MacLaren]], led the [[School of Economic Science]] to begin teaching philosophy; Goffin later presented their early public philosophy lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Stewart |title=Standing for Justice |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |page=67|year=2009 |isbn=0-85683-194-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dorine Tolley |title=The Power Within: Leon MacLaren, A Memoir of His Life and Work |publisher=BookSurge Publishing| pages=76–77 |year=2009 |isbn=1-4392-1030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1948.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

He was married to Margaret Wallace Dale.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt; Goffin died in [[Buckinghamshire]] at the age of 68.

'''Shalom Koboshvili''' (b. [[Akhaltsikhe]], 1876, d. [[Tbilisi]] 1941) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n [[artist]] who specialised in drawings and paintings of [[Jew]]ish life in Georgia.

Born to a poor family of Jews in Akhaltsikhe, Koboshvili was originally intended for the [[Rabbi]]nate, but quit religious training at an early age.  His interest in art was  discouraged by his family, and he was originally apprenticed as a printer. All his knowledge of art was effectively self-taught. After a varied career (in which around 1910 he is said to have met with the artist [[Niko Pirosmani]])&lt;ref&gt;Tsitsuashvili (2006), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually became in 1937 a watchman at the newly established [[David Baazov Museum of History of Jews of Georgia|Jewish Historic-Ethnographic Museum]] in Tbilisi. His work there apparently inspired him to devote himself to painting and all his surviving work dates from the period 1937-1941, the year of his death.

Koboshvili's work, which is all in a competent but [[Naive art|naive]] style, is entirely devoted to scenes of Jewish life; sometimes painted in oils, sometimes in water colours on paper. There are scenes relating to Jewish marriages, to Jewish festivals (including [[Succot]] and [[Yom Kippur]]), and to scenes of Jewish life in Georgian villages and on Jewish [[kolkhoz|collective farms]].

The Georgian Jewish Museum was forcibly closed in the 1950s and its contents, including  the works of Koboshvili, were transferred to the [[National Museum of Georgia]], to which they still belong. A retrospective exhibition of the works of Koboshvili was held at the Museum in Tbilisi in 2006.

'''''Sleepers of Mars''''' ({{ISBN|0-340-17326-2}}) is a collection of early short stories by [[John Wyndham]], published after his death, in 1973 by [[Coronet Books]].

The collection includes:

*"Sleepers of Mars" (1939), a sequel to the novel ''[[Stowaway to Mars]]'', in which a Russian expedition finds the remains of Martian civilisation.
*"Worlds to Barter" (1931), telling of the descendants of the human race travelling back in time to take over the current Earth.
*"Invisible Monster" (1933), featuring an invisible alien on the loose after the return of a space expedition. 
*"The Man from Earth" (1934), in which a human sent on a mission to Venus wakes up in the far future as the last human alive.
*"The Third Vibrator" (1933), a cautionary tale in which the inventor of a super-weapon has a vision of how it previously destroyed [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].

==Summary==
At the end of the previous novel ''[[Stowaway to Mars]]'' the British [[spaceship]], the ''Gloria Mundi'' departed [[Mars]], expecting the [[USSR]] ship to leave at the same time.  It did not.  In the Stowaway to Mars it is mentioned that while the British reached Earth safely, it was now several years later, and still there had been no sign of the Soviet vessel.  This story tells their fate.

While on the planet in the previous story, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and British crews had explored part of Mars around their landing sites, discovering [[Life on Mars|vegetation plant life]], in the form of scrubby bushes growing along the banks of [[Martian canal|ancient canal works]], with sluggish water still in them.  The planet also hosted [[AI]] [[robot]]s, hostile to the visitors from [[Earth]].  They seemed almost wild, feral machines living without control of organic life.  Due to fatal encounters with these robots, and ill planned gunfight with the British crew, the Soviets now number four crewmen.   Preparing to depart for Earth they discuss the fate of their mission - originally a race between the nations of Earth to be the first to reach Mars.  The British and the ''Gloria Mundi'' had won the race, reach Mars before the Soviets and United States (whose rocket had crashed with no survivors upon reaching Mars).   The Russians speculate what would be the global reaction if the ''Gloria Mundi'' reaches Earth, and then the Soviets return, and claim that they were the first to land on Mars, not the British.  They conclude that they would not be believed.  However, they reason that if they succeed in racing the British home, then they can claim that the USSR was the first to conquer the Red Planet, and the British will be disbelieved.

Both spaceships prepare to take off, with the Russians planning to boost their engines to achieve greater velocity than the smaller British craft.  Upon take off, however, the Soviet ship suffers a malfunction, crash-landing back upon Mars.  Although the ship is relatively undamaged and the four crew survive the impact, the ship has landed on its side and they lack the means to right it for take off.  Even worse, they have no more fuel for a second attempt.

Stranded on Mars, their wrecked ship surrounded by the hostile [[robot]]s, the Russians are saved by the arrival of more advanced and powerful robots, commanded by a [[Martian]].  [[Humanoid]] in appearance, he is one of the same Martians encountered by the British party (but not by the Soviets) in the previous story.  His machines drive off the feral AIs, and allows the Russians to leave their ship.   Using advanced technology, the Martian is able to modify the mind of one of their crew so that they can communicate.

The Martian offers to provide the Soviet crew safety in one of their [[domed city|enclosed cities]] while they decide what to do with them.  Faced with few options the Russians agree.  They are taken by the advanced robots to a nearby Martian city.  They find it to be in good working order, fully automated, with dwellings suitable for their needs.  There are no people living there however.  Given an apartment within the city the Martian communicates with them via video screen from another settlement.  Talking via the crew member they modified, the Martian explains to the Soviets how the Martians are a dying race, as is their world.  Once fertile and full of life, Mars long ago ran short of water.  As its rivers dried up, so its life died with it.  There was even an attempt to melt the [[Martian polar ice caps|icecaps]] in an attempt to provide more water.  While this worked for a time, eventually even this water was used up, only holding off the inevitable for a few generations and the planet continued to decline.  The Martian tells that his people are now few in number, and expect that they will eventually become [[extinct]].  Asked to explain the robots, the Soviets are told how the Martians experimented with forms of artificial intelligence, and consider the robots to be their successors and evolutionary children.  The rogue AIs encountered earlier in the novel were early attempts, and they now live beyond control of the Martians.  The more advanced robots obey their commands, and perform such tasks as are required in the city.

The Martian is eager for the earthmen to leave his world, and expresses a willingness to aid them.  He tells the Russians that they can remain as guests in the city while he will instruct the robots to repair their ship and refuel it for the voyage back to Earth.  Due to their earlier encounter with the British, the Martian is confident that the city can produce both atmosphere and food suitable for the humans.  While they wait for the repairs to be completed, the Soviets explore the abandoned city.  They discover several interesting machines and devices, and their engineer believes that he can take several examples of advanced technology back to Earth that will give their country an advantage over the capitalist nations in the [[Cold War]].  The chance to learn of the Martian [[civilisation]] far eclipses losing the race back to Earth (the ''Gloria Mundi'' will by now have had such a head-start that catching them up will be impossible).

After several days of exploring, two of the crew discover a huge vault deep beneath the city.  Inside are countless fluid-filled capsules containing apparently dead Martians.  Opening one, they are shocked to discover that the occupant is alive, but the Martian female dies swiftly upon the opening of the container, likely due to trauma caused by incorrect revival.  Realising that all the capsules contain living Martians in some form of [[suspended animation]], the ship's doctor attempts to revive a second one.  This time the Russians take the precaution of bringing the capsule to their quarters and preparing medical equipment before they try to awaken the second Martian.

Their efforts are successful, and the sleeper awakes, surviving the process.  Once recovered he is able to talk with the modified Russian, and discuss his past.  It seems that he was once part of a larger Martian population living many hundreds of years ago, at the time when the world was drying up.  At the time the best hope for their civilisation was seen as the Project to Melt the Ice Caps.  This great work would take many years to achieve, and with the aid of the robot workforce, only need a few Martians to supervise the project.  To conserve water and resources, the vast majority of the population agreed to go into suspended animation for the decades it would take.  They would be woken years later by the descendants of those who remained to direct the project, once the world was fertile once more.  He is shocked to see the world at it is now - far worse and more barren than in his day.  It appears that he and the other sleepers have been left to hibernate for far longer than originally envisaged.

The Soviet crew discuss the implications of this, speculating what happened.  They conclude that while the early generations of Martians entered into the plan with good intentions, the later generations who had melted the poles, reneged on their ancestors' agreement.  They had seen no reason to awaken these sleeping people, when they had done all the work, and could keep all the benefits for themselves.  Now the world had dried up once more, and the sleepers would be left forever in the silent cities.  The Russians are worried by this revelation, and also by the reaction of the Martian they woke.  Angry at the betrayal of him, his wife and all his people he blames the current rulers of Mars.  He claims that he can also order the robots, and will have revenge upon those who kept him dormant for so long.

The Earthmen argue about what course of action they should take. They debate warning the current Martians, given that their return to Earth depends on their goodwill, compared to the injustice suffered by the sleepers.  Also if it will do any good at all, and if it is not best to pretend nothing happened.  Eventually they prevail upon the modified crewman to use the video link to contact the main Martian settlement and warn them.  He does so, causing their host to become displeased.  The Russian assures his fellows that the ruling Martian was not too concerned, and that the robots have since been modified and that the sleepers can be stopped.  Also their ship is now ready for launch, and they can depart the planet.

As they prepare to leave the city, the doctor confronts the modified crewman, revealing that he knows that he lied to them, and did not actually warn the ruling Martians.  As they argue they spot more Martian sleepers now awake in the city, some armed, using machines to awaken others.  It appears that their Martian friend has awoken other sleepers and is preparing to attack the ruling Martians.  Before the four men can react, the sleeper they woke bursts into their quarters, and in an angry rage uses a [[raygun]] to kill the doctor.  He is shot dead by the remaining Russians. They conclude that he had gone into hibernation beside his wife, and that she must have been the first sleeper they tried to awake and inadvertently killed.  While arguing what to do, the Soviets notice from the window that sleepers are attempting to board their spaceship, now fuelled and ready for launch.

As two of the remaining crew race to the landing site to try and stop them, the last Soviet remains behind in the city.  He watches as his comrades are unable to prevent several of the sleepers entering their ship and sealing the hatch.  They are still on the boarding ladder when the ignition sequence is triggered and the ship blasts off, killing two Russians.   The last Russian considers his options, locates the Martian's ray-gun and uses it to kill himself.

The ultimate fate of the Martian civilisation is unknown, nor the final landing site of the Russian ship, which could have carried a crew of Martians to a remote corner of Earth.

In a typical TASK party, a limited number of invited participants each perform tasks as they interpret, as written on slips of paper drawn at random.  Once finished, they write a new task for others, and draw a new one for themselves.  The events are held in public spaces such as university student commons, or in other large areas (outdoors, museums), where the public at large can easily interact as they enter the space.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

"'''Temple of the Cat'''" is the third single by [[Ayreon]], released on 2000, from the album  ''[[Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer]]''. It was re-released on 2001, containing an acoustic version of the song, and the song, "Nature's Dance", from "[[the Final Experiment]]".

== Music ==
This song makes reference to the [[Mayan civilisation]] and [[Maya mythology]], taking place circa the 8th century. According to Arjen Lucassen, it speaks especially about the Jaguar Temple and the city of [[Tikal]]. Certain samples used on the song come from an authentic Maya festival. Vocals on this song were provided by Jacqueline Govaert.

Arjen has stated that, despite enjoying Jacqueline's vocal work, "Temple of the Cat" is his least favorite Ayreon song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arjenlucassen.com/ayreon/ay_jacqueline.html Jacqueline Govaert's page at Ayreon.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Origin of the Milky Way''''' is a painting by the [[italy|Italian]] late [[Renaissance]] master [[Jacopo Tintoretto]], in the [[National Gallery, London]], formerly in the [[Orleans Collection]]. It is an oil painting on canvas, and dates from ca.1575–1580.

According to myth, the infant [[Heracles#Birth and childhood|Heracles]] was brought to [[Hera]] by his half-sister [[Athena]], who later played an important role as a goddess of protection. Hera nursed Heracles out of pity, but he suckled so strongly that he caused Hera pain, and she pushed him away. Her milk sprayed across the heavens and there formed the [[Milky Way (mythology)|Milky Way]]. With divine milk, Heracles acquired supernatural powers.

[[File:La Chasse au loup et au renard - Rubens.jpg|thumb|340px]]
'''''The Wolf and Fox Hunt''''' is a c.1616 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] now held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]. It shows mounted and walking hunters chasing two wolves and three foxes. It marks the beginning of an intensive creative phase in which Rubens focuses on the theme of hunting.

''The Wolf and Fox Hunt'' is the first painting by Rubens when he created a market for a new form of art. This is one of the many paintings of very large hunting scenes painted on a canvas. The painting was originally trimmed from the top and the left side as it was too big and it would not fit in any of the houses of the princes. The wolves in the painting are his own creation and work but overall the painting was completed with assistance. 

This painting was considered to be a modern replacement for tapestries.
