Current technological developments suggest that [[cars]], as used today, will be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, K., Urry, J. 2009. After the Car. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; Established '''alternatives to car use''' include [[public transport|public transit]] ([[bus|buses]], [[trolleybus|trolleybuses]], [[train|trains]], [[rapid transit|subways]], [[monorail|monorails]], [[tram|tramways]]), [[cycling]], [[walking]], [[inline skating|rollerblading]] and [[skateboarding]].

[[Bicycle-sharing system|Bicycle-sharing systems]] have been implemented in over 1000 cities worldwide, and are especially common in many European and Chinese cities of all sizes. Similar programs have been implemented across the United States as well, including large cities like [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New York City]], as well as smaller cities like [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], [[Colorado]].

[[Personal rapid transit]] is a scheme that has been discussed, in which small, automated vehicles would run on special elevated tracks spaced within walking distance throughout a city, and could provide direct service to a chosen station without stops. However, despite several concepts existing for decades personal rapid transit has failed to gain significant ground and several prototypes and experimental systems have been dismantled as failures. Another possibility is new forms of personal transport such as the [[Segway PT]], which could serve as an alternative to cars and bicycles if they prove to be socially accepted.&lt;ref name="asphalt"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Asphalt Nation: how the automobile took over America, and how we can take it back
|author=[[Jane Holtz Kay]]
|year=1998
|isbn=0-520-21620-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these alternative modes of transport pollute less than the conventional (petroleum-powered) [[car]] and contribute to [[transport sustainability]]. They also provide other significant benefits such as reduced traffic-related injuries and fatalities, reduced space requirements, both for parking and driving, reduced resource usage and pollution related to both production and driving, increased social inclusion, increased economic and social equity, and more livable streets and cities. Some alternative modes of transportation, especially cycling, also provide regular, low-impact exercise, tailored to the needs of human bodies. Public transport is also linked to increased exercise, because they are combined in a [[intermodal passenger transport|multi-modal]] transport chain that includes walking or cycling.

According to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Future Car Workshop, the benefits of possible future car technologies not yet in widespread use (such as [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s) over these alternatives, would be:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archinode.com/transology.html Transology: M.I.T. Future Car Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased mobility in rural settings and in some other areas where traffic jams are not severe
* Possibly higher social status 
* Overall a better provision for privacy
* Profit for the multinational firms producing cars, and possibly for their employees

The '''American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists''' ('''ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''') is a professional association of industrial hygienists and practitioners of related professions, with headquarters in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].  One of its goals is to advance worker protection by providing timely, objective, scientific information to [[occupational health|occupational]] and [[environmental health]] professionals.&lt;ref&gt;About ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. [http://www.acgih.org www.acgih.org]. Retrieved 7-20-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The National Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (NCGIH)&lt;ref&gt;ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; History. [http://www.acgih.org www.acgih.org]. retrieved 7-20-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debra Nims (28 January 1999). Basics of Industrial Hygiene. John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp 6-8, {{ISBN|978-0-471-29983-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; convened on June 27, 1938, in [[Washington, D.C.]] NCGIH's original constitution limited  full membership to two representatives from each governmental [[industrial hygiene]] agency. Associate membership was made available to other professional personnel of the agencies holding full memberships, and also to personnel of educational institutions engaged in teaching industrial hygiene. Governmental industrial hygiene personnel of other countries were eligible for affiliated membership.

The Conference came into being with 59 members, one affiliated member, and 16 associate members. Forty-three members, one associate and six guests, attended the initial Conference. All but five of the members were from health departments. The New York and Massachusetts state labor departments had two each present, and there was one from the West Virginia state compensation commission.

At the end of World War II, many individuals were leaving governmental employment and membership in the Conference declined from the peak of 281 in 1944 to 235 in 1946. Changes due to the transition to a peace-time economy, the development of other professional associations, and changes in the technical and administrative needs of state and local agencies, required the Conference to revise its constitution and make some major changes in its organizational structure.

The 1946 constitution revisions abandoned the concept of limiting full membership to only two individuals from each governmental industrial hygiene agency. This opened the doors to all of their professional personnel to participate in the activities of the organization on an equal basis. Governmental industrial hygiene personnel from foreign countries were also given the right to full membership. These changes, among others, were to have a salutary effect on the organization which, in 1946, changed its name to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;).

In the mid 1950s, steady growth in membership resumed and by 1960 there were 511 members, including 54 from other countries. During the next decade these numbers more than doubled and in 1977 the total reached 1,800, of which 166 were from outside the United States.

For over 75 years, ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; has been dedicated to the industrial hygiene and occupational and environmental health and safety communities. They have grown and expanded without losing sight of their original goal - to encourage the interchange of experience among industrial hygiene workers and to collect and make accessible such information and data as might be of aid to them in the proper fulfillment of their duties. This original goal is reflected in both their current mission - the advancement of occupational and environmental health - and in their tagline: Defining the Science of Occupational and Environmental Health.

This scientific information is provided to members and others in the industry through our journal, professional conferences and seminars, as well as through a vast list of technical and scientific publications, including the ''[http://www.acgih.org/forms/store/CommercePlusFormPublic/search?action=Feature TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;]'' book.

Presently, nine ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; committees focus their energies on a range of topics: agricultural safety and health, air sampling instruments, bioaerosols, biological exposure indices, industrial ventilation, international, small business, chemical substance TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and physical agent TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Committees.

== TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;==

ACGIH&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; establishes the Threshold Limit Values ("TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;") for chemical substances and physical agents and Biological Exposure Indices ("BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;").&lt;ref&gt;TLV&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;/BEI&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Overview. [http://www.acgih.org www.acgih.org]. Retrieved 7-20-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Threshold Limit Values  for Chemical Substances (TLV&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;-CS) Committee was established in 1941. This group was charged with investigating, recommending, and annually reviewing exposure limits for chemical substances. It became a standing committee in 1944. Two years later, the organization adopted its first list of 148 exposure limits, then referred to as Maximum Allowable Concentrations. The term "Threshold Limit Values (TLV&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;)" was introduced in 1956. The first list of Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices (the ''TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;'' book) was published in 1962''.'' A new edition is now published annually. Today's list of TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; includes over 600 chemical substances and physical agents, as well as over 30 Biological Exposure Indices for selected chemicals.

The TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; are developed as guidelines to assist in the control of [[health hazard]]s. These recommendations or guidelines are intended for use in the practice of industrial hygiene, to be interpreted and applied only by a person trained in this discipline.

In certain circumstances, individuals or organizations may wish to make use of these recommendations or guidelines if the use of TLVs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and BEIs&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; contributes to the overall improvement in worker protection.

[[File:Beat frequency oscillator board.jpg|thumb|right|Add-on 455 kHz homemade BFO board]]
In a [[radio receiver]], a '''beat frequency oscillator''' or '''BFO''' is a dedicated [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] used to create an audio frequency signal from [[Morse code]] [[radiotelegraphy]] ([[Continuous wave|CW]]) transmissions to make them audible. The signal from the BFO is mixed with the received signal to create a [[heterodyne]] or [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]] frequency which is heard as a tone in the speaker. BFOs are also used to demodulate [[single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] (SSB) signals, making them intelligible, by essentially restoring the carrier that was suppressed at the transmitter. BFOs are sometimes included in [[communications receiver]]s designed for [[short wave]] listeners; they are almost always fitted to [[amateur radio]] station receivers, which often receive CW and SSB signals. &lt;ref&gt;Larry Wolfgang, Charles Hutchinson (ed), ''The ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs Sixty Eighth Edition'', ARRL, {{ISBN|978-0872591684}}-9,  pages 12-29,12-30 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The beat frequency oscillator was invented in 1901 by Canadian engineer [[Reginald Fessenden]]. What he called the "heterodyne" receiver was the first application of the [[heterodyne]] principle.

== Overview ==
In [[continuous wave]] (CW) radio transmission, also called [[radiotelegraphy]] or [[on-off keying]] and designated by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] as [[Types of radio emissions|emission type A1A]], information is transmitted by pulses of [[modulation|unmodulated]] radio [[carrier wave]] which spell out text messages in [[Morse code]]. The different length pulses of carrier, called "dots" and "dashes" or "dits" and "dahs", are produced by the operator switching the [[transmitter]] on and off rapidly using a [[switch]] called a [[telegraph key]]. This was the first type of radio transmission, and during the early 20th century was widely used for private person-to-person messages by amateurs and commercial [[telegram]] traffic. With the rise of other types of modulation its use has declined, and CW is now only used for personal hobbyist messages by [[radio amateur]]s and is becoming obsolete.    

Since the pulses of carrier have no audio [[modulation]], a CW signal received by an AM [[radio receiver]] simply sounds like silence.&lt;ref&gt; Sometimes, when the carrier pulses are strong enough to block out the normal static atmospheric "hiss" in the receiver, CW signals could be heard without a BFO as "pulses" of silence. However this was not a reliable method of reception&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make the carrier pulses audible in the receiver, a beat frequency oscillator is used. The BFO is a [[radio frequency]] [[electronic oscillator]] that generates a constant sine wave at a frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt; that is offset from the [[intermediate frequency]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; of the receiver. This signal is mixed with the IF before the receiver's second detector ([[demodulator]]). In the detector the two frequencies add and subtract, and a [[beat frequency]] ([[heterodyne]]) in the [[audio signal|audio]] range results at the difference between them:  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;audio&lt;/sub&gt; = |''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; - ''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt;| which sounds like a tone in the receiver's speaker. During the pulses of carrier, the beat frequency is generated, while between the pulses there is no carrier so no tone is produced. Thus the BFO makes the "dots" and "dashes" of the Morse code signal audible, sounding like different length "beeps" in the speaker. A listener who knows Morse code can decode this signal to get the text message.

The first BFOs, used in early [[tuned radio frequency receiver|tuned radio frequency]] (TRF) receivers in the 1910s-1920s, beat with the carrier frequency of the station. Each time the radio was tuned to a different station frequency, the BFO frequency had to be changed also, so the BFO oscillator had to be tunable across the entire frequency band covered by the receiver.

Since in a [[superheterodyne]] receiver the different frequencies of the different stations  are all translated to the same [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) by the [[frequency mixer|mixer]], modern BFOs which beat with the IF need only have a constant frequency. There may be a switch to turn off the BFO when it is not needed, when receiving other types of signals, such as AM or [[Frequency modulation|FM]]. There is also usually a knob on the front panel to adjust the frequency of the BFO, to change the tone over a small range to suit the operator's preference.

==Example==
[[File:D 1944 Rohde und Schwarz STT4032 Front Large.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Separate BFO oscillators were manufactured for receivers that didn't have them; a Rohde und Schwarz STI4032 from 1944.]]
[[Image:Goldschmidt tone wheel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|One of the first crude examples of a BFO, the Goldschmidt [[tone wheel]]. Before vacuum tube [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s were invented, the first CW receivers used a wheel with electrical contacts around its rim, spun at a high speed by a motor, to interrupt a current to create a radio frequency signal to beat with the incoming radio signal.  This example, at the Tuckerton transatlantic receiving station in New Jersey in 1917, created a 40 kHz signal.]] 

A receiver is tuned to a [[Morse code]] signal, and the receiver's [[intermediate frequency]] ('''IF''') is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; = 45000 Hz.  That means the dits and dahs have become pulses of a 45000 Hz signal, which is inaudible.

To make them audible, the frequency needs to be shifted into the audio range, for instance ''f''&lt;sub&gt;audio&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000 Hz.  To achieve that, the desired BFO frequency is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 44000 or 46000 Hz. 
 
When the signal at frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; is mixed with the BFO frequency in the [[detector (radio)|detector]] stage of the receiver, this creates two other frequencies or [[heterodyne]]s:  |''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt;|, and |''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt;|.    The ''difference frequency'', ''f''&lt;sub&gt;audio&lt;/sub&gt; = |''f''&lt;sub&gt;IF&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt;| = 1000 Hz, is also known as the [[beat frequency]].

The other, the ''sum frequency'', ''(F&lt;sub&gt;if&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;bfo&lt;/sub&gt;)'' = 89000 Hz, is unneeded.  It can be removed by a [[lowpass filter]], such as the radio's speaker, which cannot vibrate at such a high frequency.

''f''&lt;sub&gt;BFO&lt;/sub&gt; = 46000 Hz also produces the desired 1000 Hz beat frequency and could be used instead.

==Other uses==
By varying the BFO frequency around 44000 Hz, the listener can vary the output audio frequency; this is useful to correct for small differences between the tuning of the transmitter and the receiver, particularly useful when tuning in [[single sideband]] (SSB) voice. The waveform produced by the BFO ''beats'' against the IF signal in the mixer stage of the receiver. Any drift of the local oscillator or the beat-frequency oscillator will affect the pitch of the received audio, so stable oscillators are used.&lt;ref&gt; Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill
"The Art of Electronics 2nd Ed." Cambridge University Press 1989 {{ISBN|0-521-37095-7}}, page 898 &lt;/ref&gt;

For a radio signal like SSB with wider bandwidth than Morse code, low-side injection preserves the relative order of the frequency components.  High-side injection reverses their order, which is often desirable to counteract a previous reversal in the radio receiver. For radio amateurs it is conventional practice to use lower sideband below 10 MHz and upper sideband above 10 MHz, however the 60 metre band is different, using upper sideband. Amateurs have the band as secondary users and that practice retains compatibility with the primary users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">Chemical Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) is a [[bioassay]] used in the detection of specific chemicals in samples. It consists of a modified cell line that has a [[DNA construct]] with a [[luciferase]] [[reporter gene]] in conjunction with [[response elements]] that can induce [[Transcription_(genetics)|transcription]] of the inserted [[gene]] for the light-generating enzyme. The response elements can be varied in order to provide binding sites for other receptors that relate to a chemical of interest that is wished to be detected. The CALUX bioassay has thus been redesigned to detect certain chemicals of interest. Most applications have been oriented in detecting environmentally harmful chemicals like [[environmental hormones]].

CALUX is an effect based screening method as it measures the total effect [[ligands]] (from a sample) have on a receptor. Unlike [[chemical analysis]], CALUX is thus able to measure all activity on the receptor of interest. This also includes unidentified [[Congener_(chemistry)|congeners]] of certain ligands.

==Applications==
Dioxin Responsive (DR)CALUX is a bioassay used in the detection of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]]. It is based on the mechanisms of the [[AhR]]-pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murk,|first=A.J. |author2=J. Legler |author3=M.S. Denison |author4=J.P. Giesy |author5=C. van de Guchte |author6=A. Brouwer |title=Chemical-Activated Luciferase Gene Expression (CALUX): A Novel in-Vitro Bioassay for Ah Receptor Active Compounds in Sediments and Pore Water|journal=Fundamental and Applied Toxicology|date=1 September 1996|volume=33|issue=2|pages=149–160|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272059096901529|accessdate=28 March 2014|doi=10.1006/faat.1996.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chronic activation of the AhR-pathway by these compounds has been shown to cause cancer in the predominantly the liver and can cause developmental defects in [[vertebrates]]. DR CALUX is used by companies that want to screen for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in order to guarantee [[food safety]] of their products. Dioxins are considered to be the most toxic man-made chemical.

'''Ceramic water filters''' are an inexpensive and effective type of [[water filter]], that rely on the small pore size of [[ceramic]] material to filter dirt, debris, and [[bacteria]] out of water. This makes them ideal for use in [[developing countries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.potterswithoutborders.com/category/reference/studies/ |title=Ceramic Pot Water Filter Purifier Studies |publisher=Potters Without Borders |accessdate=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portable ceramic filters are commonly used in [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theadventurejunkies.com/best-backpacking-water-filter/ |title=Top 10 Best Backpacking Water Filters of 2018 |publisher=The Adventure Junkies |author=Nikki Salzman |year=2018 |accessdate=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of action==
Similar to other methods of filtering water, the filter removes particles larger than the size of the pores in the filter material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/ceramic-filtration.html |title=Ceramic Filtration |year=2011 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically bacteria, protozoa, and microbial cysts are removed. However, filters are typically not effective against viruses since they are small enough to pass through to the "clean" side of the filter. Ceramic water filters (CWF) may be treated with [[silver]] in a form that will not leach away. The silver helps to kill or incapacitate [[bacteria]] and prevent the growth of [[mold]] and [[algae]] in the body of the filter.

Ceramic filtration does not remove [[Chemical substance|chemical]] contaminants, ''per se''. However, some manufacturers (especially of ceramic candle filters) incorporate a high-performance activated carbon core inside the ceramic filter cartridge that reduces organic and metallic contaminants. The active [[carbon]] absorbs compounds such as [[chlorine]]. Filters with active carbon need to be replaced periodically because the carbon becomes clogged with foreign material.
[[Image:Ceramic water filter.jpg|thumb|left|Pot-type ceramic water filter dispensing clean water into a glass.]]
The two most common types of ceramic water filter are pot-type and candle-type filters. Ceramic filter systems consist of a porous ceramic filter that is attached to, or sits on top of a plastic or ceramic receptacle. Contaminated water is poured into a top container.  It passes through the filter(s) into the receptacle below. The lower receptacle usually is fitted with a tap.

Contaminants larger than the minute holes of the ceramic structure will remain in the top half of the unit. The filter(s) can be cleaned by brushing them with a soft brush and rinsing them with clean water. Hot water and soap can also be used.

In stationary use, ceramic candles have mechanical, operational and manufacturing advantages over simple inserts and pots. Filter candles allow sturdy metal and plastic receptacles to be used, which decreases the likelihood of a sanitary failure.  Since their filter area is independent of the size of the attachment joint, there is less leakage than other geometries of replaceable filter, and more-expensive, higher-quality gaskets can be used.  Since they are protected by the upper receptacle, rather than forming it, they are less likely to be damaged in ordinary use.  They are easier to sanitize, because the sanitary side is inside the candle.  The nonsanitary part is outside, where it is easy to clean. They fit more types of receptacles and applications than simple pots, and attach to a simple hole in a receptacle.  They also can be replaced without replacing the entire upper receptacle, and larger receptacles can simply use more filter candles, permitting filter manufacture to be standardized.  If a filter in a  multifilter receptacle is found to be broken, the filter hole can be plugged, and use can continue with fewer filters and a longer refill-time until a replacement can be obtained.  Also, standardizing the filter makes it economical to keep one or a few filters on hand.

There are also portable ceramic filters, such as the MSR Miniworks, which work via manual pumping, and in-line ceramic filters, which filters drinking water that comes through household plumbing.  Cleaning these filters is the same as with the clay pot filter but also allows for reverse-flow cleaning, wherein clean water is forced through the filter backwards, pushing any contaminants out of the ceramic pores.

The major risks to the success of all forms of ceramic filtration are hairline cracks and cross-contamination.  If the unit is dropped or otherwise abused, the brittle nature of ceramic materials can allow fine, hard to see cracks, and can allow larger contaminants through the filter.  Work is being done to modify clay/sawdust ratios during manufacture to improve the brittle nature and fracture toughness of these clay ceramic water filter materials.&lt;ref name="plappally"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4004158 Physical Properties of Porous Clay Ceramic-Ware], A. K. Plappally, I. Yakub, L. C. Brown, W. O. Soboyejo and A. B. O. Soboyejo.  J. Eng. Mater. Technol. 2011, 133(3), 031004, accessed May 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, if the "clean" water side of the ceramic membrane is brought into contact with dirty water, hands, cleaning cloths, etc., then the filtration will be ineffective.  If such contact occurs, the clean side of the filter should be thoroughly sterilized before reuse.

==Development and expansion==
[[Image:MSABI Tembo filter.jpg|thumb|Modern ceramic water filter pot, manufactured by [[MSABI]].]]
[[Henry Doulton]] invented the modern form of ceramic candle sanitary water filter in 1827. In 1835, Queen Victoria commissioned him to produce such a device for her personal use.  By 1846, Doulton ceramics was widely recognized as a premier manufacturer of an effective prevention device for treating infective water.  In 1887, Doulton was knighted, in part for his work with water filters.  [[Louis Pasteur]]'s research concerning bacteria also had provided a demonstrable reason for the filters' effect. Doulton's original organization for water filters remains in existence, although it has been sold and renamed several times.  "Doulton" is currently (2013) a registered trademark of Fairey Ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purewatergazette.net/doultonhistory.htm|title=History of the Doulton Ceramic Filter|work=purewatergazette.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Fernando Mazariegos of Guatemala was responsible for developing Ceramic Pot Filter technology in 1981 while Director of Water Research at the Central American Research Institute in Guatemala City.  He is currently the Director of Research and Development at Ecofiltro in Antigua, Guatemala. [[Ron Rivera (public health)|Ron Rivera]] studied under Mr. Mazariegos of Guatemala and was a key proponent and innovator in the field as part of the group to take the ceramic frustum shaped(pot) filter across international borders and helped developing nations to provide cheap high quality potable water. Ron Rivera also worked with Potters for Peace worldwide for the good and benefit of clay workers in developing nations to sustain their businesses &lt;ref&gt;Plappally, A.,  Chen, H., Ayinde, W.,  Alayande, S., Usoro, A.

The '''commutation cell''' is the basic structure in [[power electronics]]. It is composed of an electronic switch (today a high-power [[semiconductor]], not a mechanical switch) and a diode. It was traditionally referred to as a [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper]], but since [[Switched-mode power supply|switching power supplies]] became a major form of power conversion, this new term has become more popular.

The purpose of the commutation cell is to "chop" DC power into [[square wave]] alternating current. This is done so that an [[inductor]] and a [[capacitor]] can be used in an [[LC circuit]] to change the voltage.  This is in theory a lossless process, and in practice efficiencies above 80-90% are routinely achieved.  The output is then usually run through a [[electronic filter|filter]] to produce clean DC power.  By controlling the on and off times (the [[duty cycle]]) of the switch in the commutation cell, the output voltage can be [[regulated]].

This basic principle is the core of most modern power supplies, from tiny [[DC-DC converter]]s in portable devices to huge switching stations for [[high voltage]] DC power transmission.

==Connection of two power elements==
[[image:Voltage and current sources.svg|thumb|250px|Fig. 1: The different configurations that are impossible: short circuit of a voltage source, current source in an open circuit, two voltage sources in parallel, two current sources in series. Any of these circuits will result in failure of generation of large amounts of heat!]]

[[image:Inductors capacitor.svg|thumb|250px|Fig. 2: As with the voltage and current sources, direct energy transfer from a capacitor to another or from an inductor to another should be avoided, as it results in important losses.]]

A Commutation cell connects two power elements, often referred to as sources, although they can either produce or absorb power.

Some requirements to connect power sources exist. The impossible configurations are listed in figure 1. They are basically:
* a voltage source cannot be shorted, as the short circuit would impose a zero voltage which would contradict the voltage generated by the source;
* in an identical way, a current source cannot be placed in an open circuit;
* two (or more) voltage sources cannot be connected in parallel, as each of them would try to impose the voltage on the circuit;
* two (or more) current sources cannot be connected in series, as each of them would try to impose the current in the loop.

This applies to classical sources (battery, generator), but also to capacitors and inductors: At a small time scale, a capacitor is identical to a voltage source, and an inductor to a current source. Connecting two capacitors with different voltage level in parallel therefore corresponds to connecting two voltage sources, one of the forbidden connections of figure 1.

The figure 2 illustrates the poor efficiency of such connection. One capacitor is charged to a voltage V, and is connected to a capacitor with the same capacity, but discharged.

Before the connection, the energy in the circuit is &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}C\cdot V^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the quantity of charges Q is equal to &lt;math&gt;C\cdot U&lt;/math&gt;, where U is the potential energy.

After the connection has been made, the quantity of charges is constant, and the total capacitance is &lt;math&gt;2C&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the voltage across the capacitances is &lt;math&gt;\frac{Q}{2C}=\frac{V}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The energy in the circuit is then &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(2C)\left(\frac{V}{2}\right)^2=\frac{E}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, half of the energy has been dissipated during the connection.

The same applies with the connections in series of two inductances. The magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi=L\cdot I&lt;/math&gt;) remains constant before and after the commutation. As the total inductance after the commutation is 2L, the current becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (see figure 2). The energy before the commutation is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}L\cdot I^2&lt;/math&gt;. After, it is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}L\cdot \left(\frac{I}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;. Here again, half of the energy is dissipated during the commutation.

As a result, it can be seen that a commutation cell can only connect a voltage source to a current source (and vice versa). However, using inductors and capacitors, it is possible to transform the behaviour of a source: for example two voltage sources can be connected through a converter if it uses an inductor to transfer energy.

==The structure of a commutation cell==
[[image:Commutation cell practical theroretical.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 3: A commutation cell connects two sources of different nature (current and voltage sources). It theoretically uses two switches, but as they both must be commanded with a perfect synchronization, one of the switches is replaced by a diode in practical applications. This makes the commutation cell unidirectional. A bidirectional commutation cell can be obtained by paralleling two unidirectional ones.]]

As told above, a commutation cell must be placed between a voltage source and a current source. Depending on the state of the cell, both sources are either connected, or isolated. When isolated, the current source must be shorted, as it is impossible for a current to be created in an open circuit. The basic schematic of a commutation cell is therefore given in figure 3 (top). It uses two switches with opposite states: In the configuration depicted in figure 3, both sources are isolated, and the current source is shorted. When the top switch is on (and the bottom switch is off), both sources are connected.

In reality, it is impossible to have a perfect synchronization between the switches. At one point during the commutation, they would be either both on (thus shorting the voltage source) or off (thus leaving the current source in an open circuit). This is why one of the switches has to be replaced by a diode. A diode is a natural commutation device, i.e. its state is controlled by the circuit itself. It will turn on or off at the exact moment it has to. The consequence of using a diode in a commutation cell is that it makes it unidirectional (see figure 3). A bidirectional cell can be built, but it is basically equivalent to two unidirectional cells connected in parallel.

{{clear}}

==The commutation cell in converters==
[[image:Commutation cell in converters.svg|thumb|250px|right|Fig. 4: The commutation cell is present in every switching power supply]]

The commutation cell can be found in any [[Power electronics|power electronic]] converter. Some examples are given in figure 4. As can be seen, a "current source" (actually a loop that contains an inductance) is always connected between the middle point and one of the external connections of the commutation cell, while a voltage source (or a capacitor, or a connection in series of voltage source and capacitor) is always connected to the two external connections.

[[File:Radar-CAPPI example2.gif|thumb|Reflectivity Cappi at 1.5&amp;nbsp;km altitude from [[Montréal]] radar (Source [[Environment Canada]])]]
The '''constant altitude plan position indicator''', better known as '''CAPPI''', is a [[radar]] display which gives a horizontal cross-section of data at constant altitude. It has been developed by [[McGill University]] in Montreal by the ''Stormy Weather Group''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radar.mcgill.ca/who-we-are/history.html |title=Stormy Weather Group |publisher=Radar.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to circumvent some problems with the [[Plan Position Indicator|PPI]]:

* Altitude changing with distance to the radar.
* Ground echoes problems near the radar.

== Definition and history ==
[[File:Radar-angles.png|left|thumb|Angles available on a weather radar]]
In 1954,&lt;ref&gt;''Radar in Meteorology by [[David Atlas]]'', published by the '''[[American Meteorological Society]]'''&lt;/ref&gt; [[McGill University]] obtained a new radar (CPS-9) which had a better resolution and used FASE (Fast Azimuth Slow Elevation) to program multi-angle soundings of the atmosphere.

In 1957, Langleben and Gaherty developed a scheme with FASE to keep only the data at a certain height at each angle and scan on 360 degrees. If we look at the diagram, each angle of elevation or PPI has data at height X at a certain distance from the radar. Using the data at the right distance, one forms an annular ring of data at height X. Assembling all the rings coming from the different angles gives you the CAPPI.

The CAPPI is composed of data from each angle that is at the height requested for the cross-section (bold lines in zig-zag on the left diagram). In the early days, the scan data collected where shown directly on the cathodic screen and a photo sensitive device captured each ring as it was completed. Then all those photographed rings were assembled. By 1958, East developed a real time assembly instead of a delayed one. By the mid 1970s, computer developments made it possible to gather data in electronic form and make CAPPIs more easily.

Today, [[weather radar]]s collect in real-time data on a large number of angles. Many countries such as Canada, UK and Australia, scan a large enough number of angles with their radars to have an almost continuous vertical view (taking into account the radar beam width) and produce CAPPIs. Other countries, like France and United States, use fewer angles and prefer PPIs or composite of maximum [[reflectivity|reflectivities]] above a point.

== Usage ==
Above right is an example of a CAPPI at 1.5&amp;nbsp;km altitude. Looking at the diagram of angles, that depending on the height of the CAPPI, there comes a distance where no data is available. The portion beyond this distance on a CAPPI is then showing data from the lowest PPI. The higher is the CAPPI above ground, the smaller is that PPI zone.

A '''control track''' is a track that runs along an outside edge of a standard [[Analog signal|analog]] [[videotape]] (including [[VHS]]). The control track encodes a series of [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]]s, each pulse corresponding to the beginning of each [[Video compression picture types|frame]].  This allows the video tape player to synchronize its [[Helical scan|scan]] speed and tape speed to the speed of the recording.  Thus, the recorded control track defines the speed of playback (e.g. SP, LP, EP, etc.), and it is also what drives the relative counter clock that most [[VCR]]s have.

== Significance and use ==
The control track is used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback, so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks (known as "[[video tape tracking|tracking]]"). Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the linear tracks, which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches.

The control track is also used to hold ''index marks'', which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session, and can be found using the VCR's ''index search'' function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the ''n''th specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crutchfield.com/S-PFiOFC1Dt8s/learn/learningcenter/home/vcr_glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrevo.com/support/JVC-HR-S7300U-VCRs-manual/id/318ag718/t/2/ JVC HR-S7300  manual]: features list: ''"..., Index Search, Manual Index Mark/Erase ..."''&lt;/ref&gt; — so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the [[television program]] — but this feature later became hard to find.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

By the late 1990s, some high-end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic's Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) both on the cassette and in the VCR's memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729233622/http://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/instrukcjeobslugi?id=2176 Panasonic Video Cassette Recorder NV-HS960 Series Operating Instructions], VQT8880, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control track damage ==
A gap in the control track signal of a videotape usually causes a flaw during playback, as the player may lose [[Video tape tracking|tracking]] as soon as the track drops out.  This usually leads to a gap in video and audio (since there's no information as to what speed the media is recorded at), the VCR's counter will freeze, and upon re-acquiring the control track, the [[Sync pulse#Synchronization|video sync]] will be momentarily lost.

Problems with control track [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]s are almost always caused by a gap in [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], e.g. a recording was resumed ''beyond'' (rather than ''at'') the point where recording was previously stopped.  A control track [[error]] can also be caused by a "[[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]]" - a defect in the [[magnetic]] particles on a tape - but this is very uncommon, as the control track is immune to all but the most severe tape damage.

A discontinuous control track was (and still is) especially problematic for analog videotape editing.  Each gap in the control track, no matter how brief, destroys synchronization and continuity, which can make a segment of a recorded video difficult or impossible to use for editing.

The acronym ''LOCT'' (pronounced ''locked''), used by many video professionals, can mean "Loss Of Control Track" and/or "Loss Of Continuous [[Timecode]]".  Though either type of "loss" can pose similar problems, and both issues are sometimes directly related, control track and timecode are two different things (see [[timecode]]).

Control track problems cannot be "repaired".  You can duplicate the tape to restore control track continuity, but this will not fix visual and audible "[[glitch]]es" caused by gaps in the original control track, and the video itself will suffer quality degradation due to "[[generation loss]]".

For this reason, many video professionals would "pre-stripe" every analog videotape to be used in the field or studio beforehand to help ensure good control track throughout.  This was done by pre-recording [[black]] to the entire videotape.  Pre-striping also facilitated spot-checking for dropouts on the video portion of the tape (usually seen as brief white horizontal "dashes") before use.

'''Cosmetics''' are substances or products used to enhance or alter the [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] of the face or [[Aroma compound|fragrance]] and texture of the body. Many cosmetics are designed for use of applying to the face, hair, and body. They are generally mixtures of [[chemical compound]]s; some being derived from natural sources (such as [[coconut oil]]), and some being synthetics or artificial.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Schneider, Günther ''et al'' (2005). "Skin Cosmetics" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetics applied to the face to enhance its appearance are often called '''make-up''' or '''makeup'''. Common make-up items include: [[lipstick]], [[mascara]], [[eye shadow]], [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]]. Whereas other common cosmetics can include [[Cleanser|skin cleansers]] and [[Lotion|body lotions]], [[shampoo]] and conditioner, [[hairstyling product]]s ([[Hair gel|gel]], [[hair spray]], etc.), [[perfume]] and [[Eau de Cologne|cologne]].

In the U.S., the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which regulates cosmetics,&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt; defines cosmetics as "intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or functions". This broad definition includes any material intended for use as a [[wikt:component|component]] of a cosmetic product. The FDA specifically excludes [[soap]] from this category.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Carol (2000).

The word ''cosmetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κοσμητικὴ τέχνη (''kosmetikē tekhnē''),  meaning "technique of dress and ornament", from κοσμητικός (''kosmētikos''), "skilled in ordering or arranging"&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert.

== History ==
{{Main|History of cosmetics}}

Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years. The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[deformities]], blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.

[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}&lt;/ref&gt; They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.&lt;ref name="lipstick3"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Yona . [http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_4535.shtml Ancient Indus Valley: Food, Clothing &amp; Transportation]. unexplainable.net&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ians extracted red dye from [[Seaweed|fucus-algin]], 0.01% [[iodine]], and some [[bromine]] mannite, but this dye resulted in serious illness. Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially made using a [[Iridescence|pearlescent]] substance found in fish scales.&lt;ref name="chemical1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/stuff/7728scit2.html|last=Johnson|first= Rita |title=What's That Stuff? Lipstick|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|volume =77|issue= 28|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six thousand year old relics of the hollowed out tombs of the [[Ancient Egyptian]] pharaohs are discovered.

According to one source, early major developments include:&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;
* [[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]] used by ancient Egypt as a protectant of the eye.
* [[Castor oil]] used by ancient Egypt as a protective [[Liniment|balm]].
* [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|Skin creams]] made of [[beeswax]], [[olive oil]], and [[rose water]], described by Romans.
* [[Vaseline]] and [[lanolin]] in the nineteenth century.
The Ancient Greeks also used cosmetics&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Lesley and Adkins, Roy A. (1998) ''Handbook to life in Ancient Greece'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burlando, Bruno; Verotta, Luisella; Cornara, Laura and Bottini-Massa, Elisa (2010) ''Herbal Principles in Cosmetics'', CRC Press&lt;/ref&gt; as the Ancient Romans did. Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids—approximately 840 BC—and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.

One of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin. Tremella fuciformis is also known in Chinese medicine for nourishing the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reshetnikov SV, Wasser SP, Duckman I, Tsukor K |title=Medicinal value of the genus ''Tremella'' Pers. (Heterobasidiomycetes) (review) |journal=International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms |year=2000 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=345–67 |doi=10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v2.i3.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, it seemed completely natural that the face should be whitened and the cheeks rouged.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

During the sixteenth century, the personal attributes of the women who used make-up created a demand for the product among the upper class.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Angeloglou, Maggie. ''The History of Make-up''. First ed. Great Britain: The Macmillan Company, 1970. 41–42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic use was frowned upon at many points in Western history. For example, in the 19th century, [[Queen Victoria]] publicly declared make-up improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lipstick: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Cosmetic | first = J | last = Pallingston | ISBN = 0-312-19914-7 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women in the 19th century liked to be thought of as fragile ladies. They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They aimed always to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used "[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Make-up was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.

During the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.

It was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].

By the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world.

In 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a "Freedom Trash Can." This included cosmetics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dow, Bonnie J. |title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology |journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs |volume=6 |issue=1 |date= Spring 2003 |pages=127–149 |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were among items the protestors called "instruments of female torture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Duffett, Judith |title=WLM vs. Miss America |work=Voice of the Women's Liberation Movement |date=October 1968 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced [[femininity]].

As of 2016, the world's largest cosmetics company is [[L'Oréal]], which was founded by [[Eugène Schueller]] in 1909 as the French Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now owned by [[Liliane Bettencourt]] 26% and [[Nestlé]] 28%; the remaining 46% is traded publicly). The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]] just after.

Although modern make-up has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on. Cosmetics brands release products specially tailored for men, and men are increasingly using them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |title=FDA Authority Over Cosmetics |publisher=Cfsan.fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513223418/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |archive-date=2009-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Cosmetics are intended to be applied externally. They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.

A subset of cosmetics is called "makeup", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between "decorative" and "care" cosmetics.

Cosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.

Most cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.
* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] comes in formulas to suit individual skin conditions. Most are meant to reduce the appearance of pore size, prolong the wear of makeup, and allow for a smoother application of makeup. Primers are applied before foundation or eye-shadows depending on where the primer is to be applied.
* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health – FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored for a pop of fun. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]].
* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup.
.  Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face.
* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt; Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.
* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.
* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to compliment different skin tones.&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt;
* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face as well as to add glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.
* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color by adding a golden or bronze glow and highlighting the cheekbones, as well as being used for contouring. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for an everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face while adding more of a shimmery look.&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt; It comes in either matte, semi matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.
* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt; Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.

[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies make-up before the opening night of a play.]]
* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow - definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kerala kathakali makeup.jpg|thumb|The chin mask known as ''chutti'' for [[Kathakali]], a performing art in [[Kerala]], India, is considered the thickest makeup applied for any art form.]]
* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color.
* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt;
* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].&lt;ref name=USHealthandHuman /&gt; Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish.
* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.
* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs.
* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a "contour palette" - which can be either cream or powder. 
Cosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.

Makeup remover is a product used to remove the makeup products applied on the skin. It cleans the skin before other procedures, like applying bedtime lotion. Micellar waters are becoming a more common product used to remove makeup. It acts as a two-in-one by removing the makeup and cleansing the skin.

Cleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:

* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.byrdie.com/daily-skincare-routine|title=The Exact Regimen You Should Be Following for Your Skin Type|work=Byrdie|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}
* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]]. These types of toners are targeted at oily skin types, as well as acne-prone skin.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.
** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.
** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.
** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.
* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.
** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.

Abrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt, sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.

* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.

== Brushes ==
A makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.

* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.
* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration. 
* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage. 
* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.
* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.
* A bronzer blush is a round, fluffy brush that gives a "sun-kissed" appearance to the face.
* A contour brush can have a flat top or be angled which gives the illusion of having cheekbones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.makeup.com/how-to-contour-for-your-face-shape|title=How to Contour For Your Face Shape|work=Makeup.com|access-date=|last=Rebecca|first=Ashley |date = 21 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.
* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.
* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.
* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.
* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.
* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.

{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}
There are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.&lt;ref name="Kessler2015"&gt;Kessler R.

[http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm127406.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many types of tools used such as makeup brushes or [[Beauty blender|face sponges]], also known as the Beauty Blender &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beautyblender.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_ZrXBRDXARIsAA8KauR9hgkNjy05qQzVunw8WfBPMJieBIp5vNNFFE39gmyh9NL640B7HbcaAhG4EALw_wcB|title=beautyblender® official site {{!}} the original makeup sponge {{!}} free shipping|website=www.beautyblender.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beauty Blender is supposed to be run underwater to become dampened and then can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter.

== Ingredients ==
{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}
A variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.

=== Natural ===
{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}
Handmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified "USDA Organic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mineral ===
The term "mineral makeup" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.&lt;ref name="The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | publisher=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt; There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].

==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====
Although some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health. Therapeutic Goods|date=2017-01-11|work=Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral makeup is noncomedogenic (as long as it does not contain talc) and offers a mild amount of sun protection (because of the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palladino |first=Lisa |url=http://www.luxist.com/2009/12/07/what-is-mineral-makeup/ |title=What Is Mineral Makeup? |publisher=Luxist.com |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they do not contain liquid ingredients, mineral makeups have long shelf-lives.

==Cosmetic packaging==
{{main|Cosmetic packaging}}
The term [[cosmetic packaging]] is used for [[cosmetic container|primary packaging]] and secondary packaging of cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Purposes of Cosmetic Packaging|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging|date= September 16, 2016|website = Desjardin Metal packaging}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Cosmetic packaging compliant to ISO 22715|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/cosmetic-packaging-compliant-to-iso-22715|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary packaging, also called cosmetic container, is housing the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEuropeRegulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics – Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]]. Marketers and manufacturers of cosmetic products must be compliant to these regulations to be able to market their cosmetic products in the corresponding [[Jurisdiction (area)|areas of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
[[File:JPG Farmers Centre Place cosmetics 2013.jpg|thumb|Cosmetics at department store [[Farmers Trading Company|Farmers]] [[Centre Place]] in [[Hamilton, New Zealand]]]]
The manufacture of cosmetics is dominated by a small number of [[multinational corporation]]s that originated in the early 20th century, but the distribution and sales of cosmetics is spread among a wide range of businesses. The worlds largest cosmetic companies are [[L'Oréal]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Unilever]], [[Shiseido]], and [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081209102412/http://www.scribd.com/doc/3027409/Top-100-Cosmetic-Manufacturers Top 100 Cosmetic Manufacturers]. scribd.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the market volume of the cosmetics industry in the US, Europe, and Japan was about EUR 70 Billion/a year.&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt; In Germany, the cosmetic industry generated €12.6 billion of [[Retail|retail sales]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="Cosmetic Industry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-business-portal.info/GBP/Navigation/en/Business-Location/Manufacturing%20Industries/cosmetics-industry,did=326082.html|title=Cosmetic Industry|date=|accessdate=2010-08-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908122058/http://www.german-business-portal.info/GBP/Navigation/en/Business-Location/Manufacturing%20Industries/cosmetics-industry%2Cdid%3D326082.html|archivedate=2010-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes the German cosmetic industry the third largest in the world, after Japan and the United States. German [[export]]s of cosmetics reached €5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of cosmetics totaled €3 billion.&lt;ref name="Cosmetic Industry" /&gt;

The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf – May 2007). Europe is the leading market, representing approximately €63 billion, while sales in France reached €6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (Fédération des Industries de la Parfumerie – the French federation for the perfume industry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clickpress.com/releases/Detailed/82987005cp.shtml |title=France continues to lead the way in cosmetics|date=24 July 2008 |accessdate= |website = ClickPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role, both nationally and internationally. According to data from 2008, the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40 consecutive years. In 2006, this industrial sector reached a record level of €6.5 billion. Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Yves Rocher]], and many others.

The Italian cosmetic industry is also an important player in the European cosmetic market. Although not as large as in other European countries, the cosmetic industry in Italy was estimated to reach €9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchwikis.com/Cosmetics_-_Europe_%28Italy%29_2008_Marketing_Research|title=Cosmetics – Europe (Italy) 2008 Marketing Research|date=|accessdate= 2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian cosmetic industry is dominated by [[hair]] and body products and not makeup as in many other European countries. In Italy, hair and body products make up approximately 30% of the cosmetic market. Makeup and facial care, however, are the most common cosmetic products exported to the United States.

According to Euromonitor International, the market for cosmetics in [[China]] is expected to be $7.4 billion in 2021 up from $4.3 billion in 2016. The increase is due to [[social media]] and the changing attitudes of people in the 18-to-30-year age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wei |first=Daniela |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/bloggers-touting-makeup-secrets-spur-estee-lauder-s-china-sales |title=Bloggers Touting Makeup Secrets Spur Estee Lauder's China Sales |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=2017-05-31 |accessdate=2017-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the popularity of cosmetics, especially fragrances and perfumes, many designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up with perfumes carrying their names. Moreover, some [[actor]]s and [[singing|singers]] (such as [[Celine Dion]]) have their own perfume line. Designer perfumes are, like any other designer products, the most expensive in the industry as the consumer pays for the product and the brand. Famous Italian fragrances are produced by [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], and others.

[[Procter &amp; Gamble]], which sells [[CoverGirl]] and [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] makeup, funded a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cosmetics as a Feature of the Extended Human Phenotype: Modulation of the Perception of Biologically Important Facial Signals |journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e25656|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0025656|pmid=21991328|pmc=3185017|year=2011|author1=Etcoff|first1=N.

|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetics are used by girls at increasingly young ages, especially in the United States. Because of the fast-decreasing age of make-up users, many companies, from high-street brands like Rimmel to higher-end products like Estee Lauder, cater to this expanding market by introducing flavored lipsticks and glosses, cosmetics packaged in glittery and sparkly packaging, and marketing and advertising using young [[model (person)|models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|title=What would Estee Do?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/business/27lauder.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social consequences of younger and younger cosmetics use has had much attention in the media over the last few years.

=== Animal testing ===
{{update|section|date=September 2016}}
Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, [[phototoxicity]] (toxicity triggered by [[ultraviolet]] light), and mutagenicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024059 | pmid = 21915280 | title = Ethical and Scientific Considerations Regarding Animal Testing and Research | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = e24059 | year = 2011 | last1 = Ferdowsian | first1 = Hope R. | last2 = Beck | first2 = Nancy|pmc=3168484 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...624059F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the controversy over the ethics of animal testing, alternatives to animal testing are in development, and some nations have chosen to legislate on animal testing with cosmetics. There are nearly 50 non-animal tests that have been validated for use, with many more in development, that may replace animal testing and are potentially more efficacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/cosmetic_testing/qa/questions_answers.html|title=Fact Sheet: Cosmetic Testing : The Humane Society of the United States|website=www.humanesociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, India, Norway, Israel, New Zealand, Belgium, and the UK, and in 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union (EU) agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/animal-testing_en|title=Ban on Animal Testing - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal testing is regulated in [[EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics#Restrictions for hazardous ingredients and animal testing|EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics]]. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, [[L'Oréal]], has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]], asking that the ban be quashed.&lt;ref name=Osborn /&gt; The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy.&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;Osborn, Andrew &amp; Gentleman, Amelia (August 19, 2003).[https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,11917,1021527,00.html "Secret French move to block animal-testing ban"], ''The Guardian''.

== Legislation ==

=== Europe ===
In the European Union, the manufacture, labelling, and supply of cosmetics and personal care products are regulated by [[EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics|Regulation EC 1223/2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=BJgDTqTLRty236HwZXJDnLB8dT2DKtFwsDg7wsf2KknHqQZCl6vh!990913682?uri=CELEX:32009R1223|title=EUR-Lex – 32009R1223 – EN – EUR-Lex|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to all the countries of the EU as well as Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. This regulation applies to single-person companies making or importing just one product as well as to large multinationals. Manufacturers and importers of cosmetic products must comply with the applicable regulations in order to sell their products in the EU.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Packaging"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this industry, it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the cosmetics’ compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic regulations and other relevant legislation, including [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]], [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/product-safety/cosmetic-products-safety-regulations-2008-as-amended|title=Product safety for manufacturers|work=bis.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety has been a subject of legislation since 1976. One of the newest improvement of the regulation concerning cosmetic industry is a result of the ban [[animal testing]]. Testing cosmetic products on animals has been illegal in the European Union since September 2004, and testing the separate ingredients of such products on animals is also prohibited by law, since March 2009 for some endpoints and full since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/cosmetics/animal-testing/index_en.htm|title=Regulatory context|date=|accessdate= 2010-08-04|publisher=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic regulations in Europe are often updated to follow the trends of innovations and new technologies while ensuring [[safety standards|product safety]]. For instance, all annexes of the Regulation 1223/2009 were aimed to address potential risks to human [[health]].
Under the EU cosmetic regulation, manufacturers, retailers, and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as "Responsible Person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:en:PDF "EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009"], European Parliament &amp; Council, 30 November 2009, Retrieved 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This new status implies that the responsible person has the legal [[Legal liability|liability]] to ensure that the cosmetics and [[brand]]s they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms. The responsible person is also responsible of the documents contained in the Product Information File (PIF), a list of product information including data such as Cosmetic Product Safety Report, product description, [[GMP statement]], or product function.

=== United States ===
In 1938, the U.S. passed the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorizing the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to oversee safety via legislation in the cosmetic industry and its aspects in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/default.htm|title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act)|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/ucm132818.htm|title = The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|date = |accessdate = 22 April 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA joined with 13 other federal agencies in forming the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) in 1997, which is an attempt to ban animal testing and find other methods to test cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Testing &amp; Cosmetics|url=http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/scienceresearch/producttesting/ucm072268.htm|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===

ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, ''Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency'') is the regulatory body responsible for cosmetic legislation and [[:wikt:directive|directives]] in the country. The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire [[Mercosur]].

The current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as pyrogallol, [[formaldehyde]], or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as lead [[acetate]] in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.

More recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.

Most Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].

=== International ===
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.
ISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.

The standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.

[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving make-up from a professional.]]

An account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics. They explain new products and "gifts with purchase" arrangements (free items given out upon purchase of cosmetics items costing over some set amount).

A beauty adviser provides product advice based on the client's skin care and makeup requirements. Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.

A [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[make-up artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.

Professionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).

Many involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.

[[File:dims latch.png | right | thumb]]

The DIMS ('''delay-insensitive minterm synthesis''') system&lt;ref&gt;D. E. Muller, “Asynchronous logics and application to information processing,” Proc. Symp. Application of Switching Theory in Space Technology, H. Aiken and W. F. Main, Ed. , pp. 289-297, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; is an asynchronous design methodology making the least possible timing assumptions. Assuming only the [[quasi-delay-insensitive]] delay model the generated designs need little if any timing hazard testing. The basis for DIMS is the use of two wires to represent each bit of data. This is known as a [[dual-rail]] data encoding. Parts of the system communicate using the early [[four-phase asynchronous protocol]].

The construction of DIMS logic gates comprises generating every possible minterm using a row of [[C-element]]s and then gathering the outputs of these using [[OR gate]]s which generate the true and false output signals. With two dual-rail inputs the gate would be composed of four two-input C-elements. A three input gate uses eight three-input C-elements.

Latches are constructed using two C-elements to store the data and an OR gate to acknowledge the input once the data has been latched by attaching as its inputs the data output wires. The acknowledge from the forward stage is inverted and passed to the C-elements to allow them to reset once the computation has completed. This latch design is known as the 'half latch'. Other [[asynchronous latches]] provide a higher data capacity and levels of decoupling.

DIMS designs are large and slow but they have the advantage of being very robust.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">An '''enterprise appliance transaction module''' (EATM) is a device, typically used in the manufacturing automation marketplace, for the transfer of plant floor equipment and product status to [[manufacturing execution system]]s (MES), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems and the like.

Solutions that deliver manufacturing floor integration have evolved over time.  Initially they took the form of custom integrated systems, designed and delivered by System Integrators.  These solutions were largely based on separate [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Commercial off the Shelf]] (COTS) products that a System Integrator acquired and integrated into the custom solution.  

These solutions have evolved into vendor supplied product solutions that no longer require the integration of separate components.  EATM products, as they are known today, are available as COTS Appliance products, fully configurable, and not needing any software development or custom integration.

== Components required for EATM functionality ==

'''Hardware platform –''' [[Embedded system|embedded computer]], [[computer appliance]]

'''Device communications software –''' Support for the [[Automation protocols|device protocols]] from which data will be extracted.   Device communications software typically operates through polled or change based protocols that are vendor specific.  Data to be extracted is typically organized into related items, and transferred based on a machine status such as Cycle Complete, Job Start, System Downtime Event, Operator Change, etc.

Typical protocols;  Rockwell Automation [[Common Industrial Protocol|CIP]], ControlLogix backplane, [[EtherNet/IP]], Siemens [[Industrial Ethernet]], [[Modbus|Modbus TCP]].  There are hundreds of automation device protocols and EATM solutions are typically targeting certain market segments and will be based on automation vendor relationships.

'''Enterprise communications software –''' Software that will enable communications to [[Enterprise systems]].  Communications at this level are typically transaction oriented and require data transactions to be sent and acknowledged to ensure the data integrity.  Examples include; Relational Database Adapters, Java Message Services (JMS), Oracle Database Interfaces and proprietary interfaces to specific products.

'''Transaction application –''' Software that is configured to watch and collect device variables, formats them into required transactions, and transfer the results securely and reliably to the Enterprise Solutions.  The Transaction Application resides between the Device Communications and the Enterprise communications.

== Enterprise solutions ==

Manufacturing solutions fall into many categories.  Overall, the manufacturing environment is portrayed as a three layer Manufacturing Pyramid.  At the base, Device Control Systems – [[Programmable logic controller|Programmable Logic Controller]] (PLC) and [[SCADA|Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition]] systems (SCADA) perform the process automation functions.  A layer above that encompasses Plant Execution Systems that deliver the functions of; Asset Management, Genealogy, [[Statistical process control|SPC]], [[Manufacturing Execution System|MES]], Order Tracking, Quality Assurance and Scheduling.  At the top most level, [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) systems offer final control over the enterprise and track overall enterprise performance.  

It is the job of EATM solutions to act as a bi-directional bridge between field devices and the supervisory control systems.  These field devices could be located in a work cell or an assembly or process line.  They could be very simple devices, or programmable controllers, machine controls, or PLCs.  The upstream business systems could be ANDON and [[Kanban]] systems for that line, [[manufacturing execution system]]s (MES), and Archival Quality databases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3311">'''Event tree''' is an inductive analytical diagram in which an event is analyzed using [[Boolean logic]] to examine a chronological series of subsequent events or consequences. For example, event tree analysis is a major component of nuclear reactor safety engineering.&lt;ref name="wang69"&gt;Wang, John '' et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|''What Every Engineer Should Know About Risk Engineering and Management,'' p. 69.|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event tree displays sequence progression, sequence end states and sequence-specific dependencies across time.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA, [http://www-ns.iaea.org/downloads/ni/training/specific_expert_knowledge/psa-level1/III1_2_A%20Accident%20sequence%20modelling.pdf  "Accident sequence modelling," p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical tool==
[[Event tree analysis]] is a logical evaluative process which works by tracing forward in time or forwards through a causal chain to model risk.  It does not require the premise of a known hazard.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. (2002). {{Google books|pIKrHQDY-mgC|''Environmental Effects of Transgenic Plants: the Scope and Adequacy of Regulation,'' p. 5.|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event tree is an inductive investigatory process.&lt;ref name="wang69"/&gt;

In contrast, the [[Fault tree analysis]] (FTA) evaluates risk by tracing backwards in time or backwards through a cause chain.

'''Finastra''' is the third largest financial technology company in the world. The firm was formed in late 2017 through the combination of [[D+H]] and Misys, after [[Vista Equity Partners]] acquired Misys in June 2012 and subsequently purchased D+H in 2017.

Finastra is led by chief executive officer, Simon Paris, who was appointed in June 2018. The company has offices in 42 countries with U.S. $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion in revenues. The company employs over 10,000 people and has over 9,000 customers across 130 countries.&lt;ref name=Peyton&gt;[http://www.bankingtech.com/869501/misys-and-dh-merge-to-launch-fintech-titan-finastra Misys and D+H merge to launch fintech titan Finastra]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misys history == 

=== 1970 to 2000 ===
The company was founded by Roger Morgan and Kevin Lomax as Misys to develop insurance software.&lt;ref name="The Free Library"&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Profile%3A+Kevin+Lomax+Chairman+of+Misys+Making+an+after-dinner+mint.-a060539888 Profile: Kevin Lomax Chairman of Misys Making an after-dinner mint.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purchase of multiple companies in respective markets by Misys under the leadership of Kevin Lomax (Chairman and/or CEO 1985–2006) allowed Misys to become a software supplier to the US healthcare industry, to banks (worldwide) and to fund managers worldwide. Many of the companies acquired and consolidated by Misys were themselves products of previous mergers.

In 1987 Misys shares were first traded on the [[Unlisted Securities Market]]. It was admitted to the Main List of the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1989, cross selling to increased client base and economies of scale arising from consolidation.
  
In 1994 Misys entered the banking software space by purchasing Kapiti Ltd. In 1995 Misys purchased ACT (which included BIS and [[Kindle Banking Systems|Kindle]]), thus giving Misys control of 3 of the 4 largest selling core banking packages at the time. At time of purchase, Midas had the biggest installed base of any "off-the shelf" banking software package.

The largest banking software company to be brought into the Misys fold was BIS. Business Intelligence Services or BIS Ltd in 1976 had acquired [[Kingsley-Smith and Associates]] and a software package named [[Midas (banking system)|MIDAS]] developed by KSA. This banking software system was based on a concept of a core multi-currency accounting module.  At the time, most other International Banks worldwide worked and accounted on a 'single currency' methodology. It was marketed to and operated by a number of client London Banks from 1979. From the mid to late-1980s competition to MIDAS came from vendors with systems called [[Kapiti Inc.|Kapiti]], BankMaster (from Kindle) and [[Ibis (company)|IBIS]]. In 1991 ACT purchased Kindle followed by BIS in 1993 uniting two of the biggest selling products under one ownership albeit with different user bases. Midas was focused on its international branch banking in the world's financial centers. The simplicity of Bankmaster and its Branchpower front end appealed to tier 3 and 4 banks in Africa and South America.

Kapiti Ltd was a privately held packaged banking software house focused on using IBM's mid range computers to server the international branch banking market. Kapiti was founded in 1975 by a Mr. John Kennedy, a New Zealand native and competed directly with the commercially more successful Midas system. Initially headquartered in London, the company moved to Windsor then Slough, Berkshire. In 1990 Kapiti re-branded the well established Kapiti International Banking System (KIBS) as EQUATION 1, sales were still focused on international branch banking with clusters of users in financial centers like London, plus some small retail operations in the Gulf. The combination of the port to the new IBM AS/400 platform with its increased processing power, the user friendly EQ2 user interface rework, the performance boost from the EQ3 data base rewrite, and the addition of a client server Cashier system had allowed an expansion into retail banking. Kapiti also pursued wholesale banking by merging with Aregon International (dealing room information feeds), purchasing Future Systems (trade capture) and purchasing rights to some reporting tools. None of the acquired companies prospered under Kapiti. However the technical expertise of the Aregon team was exploited to build in house a trade finance system called Trade Innovation (TI) which saw commercial success for approximately 20 years.

In 1996 Misys bought Summit Systems, an American software company selling a front-office cross-asset management system targeting investment banks' [[trading room]]s.

In 1997 it bought Medic Computer Systems, a healthcare software business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2007 Misys sold its diagnostic information software division to [[Vista Equity Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://histalk.blog-city.com/misys_sells_off_sunquest_cpr_exiting_the_hospital_systems_.htm Misys Sells Off Sunquest, CPR, Exiting the Hospital Systems Business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708013905/http://histalk.blog-city.com/misys_sells_off_sunquest_cpr_exiting_the_hospital_systems_.htm |date=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 Misys' subsidiary, Misys Healthcare, was merged with [[Allscripts]], a medical records business, to become ''Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-misys-announce-merger Allscripts, Misys announce merger]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 Misys bought [[Sophis]], a provider of portfolio and risk management software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-11-12/misys-to-buy-software-vendor-sophis-for-593-million.html Misys to Buy Software Vendor Sophis for $593 Million] Bloomberg, 12 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Misys entered into merger talks with its [[Swiss]] rival [[Temenos Group|Temenos]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-03/misys-in-merger-talks-with-swiss-rival-temenos-after-failed-fidelity-deal.html Misys In Talks Over Merger With Swiss Rival Temenos After Fidelity Failure] Bloomberg, 3 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The deal later collapsed when the two sides were unable to agree to terms.

In March 2012 private equity firm [[Vista Equity Partners]] announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Misys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[BBC]] | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17429412 | date = 19 March 2012 | title = Misys agrees to be bought by Vista for £1.3bn | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, upon the completion of acquisition by Vista Equity Partners, Misys was merged with Turaz, another acquisition of Vista. Turaz was formerly the treasury and risk management software division of [[Thomson Reuters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/misys-acquires-ind-group-to-create-power-house-in-retail-banking-solutions-244666091.html |title=Misys Acquires IND Group to Create Power House in Retail Banking Solutions |accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D+H History ==

In 1875, D+H was founded as Davis &amp; Henderson, a Canadian manufacturer specialising in bookbinding and printing. By the latter part of the 1890s, Canadian financial institutions began to form a significant portion of D+H customer base.

In the 1960s, D+H started to produce printed cheques with Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding and began printing individually personalized bank cheques. It continued to focus on the cheque business through the 1970s and 1980s.

Following a series of acquisitions starting in 2005, D+H shifted its business to providing financial technology services worldwide.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/cheque-please-a-canadian-play-on-the-us-recovery/article16420184/ Davis + Henderson: A Canadian play on the U.S. recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, D+H went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It acquired Mortgagebot&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"/&gt; and ASSET Inc. in 2011,&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=117488688 Company Overview of ASSET Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Avista Solutions in 2012,&lt;ref name=VanGeem&gt;[https://www.fool.ca/2013/10/07/checking-in-on-davis-henderson/ Checking In on Davis + Henderson]&lt;/ref&gt; Harland Financial Solutions&lt;ref name=Patel&gt;[http://www.banktech.com/core-systems/d%2bh-completes-acquisition-of-harland-financial-solutions/d/d-id/1296530d41d.html?

In 2016, D+H added blockchain technology capabilities to its global payments platform. The added capabilities enabled banks that use its Global PAYplus services platform to access distributed ledgers to connect networks, move money in real time and improve access to liquidity.&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;[https://www.theglobaltreasurer.com/2016/02/03/dh-adds-blockchain-capabilities-to-payments-platform/ D+H adds blockchain capabilities to payments platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2017, D+H announced that it would be acquired by Vista Equity Partners and combined with Misys, operating under the new company name Finastra for a total enterprise value of approximately $4.8&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Ligaya&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/dh-corp-to-be-acquired-by-vista-equity-partners-merged-with-u-k-based-software-provider-misys DH Corp to be acquired by Vista Equity Partners, merged with U.K.-based software provider Misys]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foodservice''' (US English) or '''[[Catering|catering industry]]''' (British English) defines those businesses, institutions, and companies responsible for any meal prepared outside the home.&lt;ref name=IntroERS&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Service Industry|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-service-industry.aspx|website=USDA Economic Research Service|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This industry includes [[restaurant]]s, school and hospital [[cafeteria]]s, [[catering]] operations, and many other formats.&lt;ref name=IntroERS/&gt;

The companies that supply foodservice operators are called [[foodservice distributor]]s. Foodservice distributors sell goods like small wares (kitchen utensils) and foods. Some companies manufacture products in both [[consumer]] and foodservice versions. The consumer version usually comes in individual-sized packages with elaborate label design for [[retail]] sale. The foodservice version is packaged in a much larger [[industry|industrial]] size and often lacks the colorful label designs of the consumer version.

==Statistics==
The food system, including food service and food retailing supplied $1.24 trillion worth of food in 2010 in the US, $594 billion of which was supplied by food service facilities, defined by the USDA as any place which prepares food for immediate consumption on site, including locations that are not primarily engaged in dispensing meals such as recreational facilities and retail stores.&lt;ref name=MarketERS&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Service Industry Market Segment|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-service-industry/market-segments.aspx|website=USDA ERS|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-service and Fast-food restaurants account for 77% of all foodservice sales, with full-service restaurants accounting for just slightly more than fast food in 2010.&lt;ref name=MarketERS/&gt; The shifts in the market shares between fast food and full-service restaurants to market demand changes the offerings of both foods and services of both types of restaurants.&lt;ref name=MarketERS/&gt;

According to the National Restaurant Association a growing trend among US consumers for the foodservice industry is global cuisine with 66% of US consumers eating more widely in 2015 than in 2010, 80% of consumers eating 'ethnic' cuisines at least once a month, and 29% trying a new 'ethnic' cuisine within the last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Palates 2015|url=http://www.restaurant.org/News-Research/Research/Global-Palates|website=Restaurant.org|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New research finds Americans embrace global cuisine|url=http://www.restaurant.org/News-Research/News/New-research-finds-Americans-embrace-global-cuisin|website=Restaurant.org|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Foodservice distributor]] market size is as of 2015 $231 billion in the US; the national broadline market is controlled by US Foods and Sysco which combined have 60-70% share of the market and were blocked from merging by the FTC for reasons of market power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamburger|first1=John|title=Sysco and US Foods: The Aftermath|url=http://www.foodservicenews.net/The-FSN-Feed/July-2015/Sysco-and-US-Foods-The-Aftermath/|website=Foodservice News|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health concerns==
Foodservice tends to be, on average, higher in calories and lower in key nutrients than foods prepared at home.&lt;ref name=RecentERS&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Service Industry -Recent Issues|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-service-industry/recent-issues.aspx|website=USDA ERS|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most restaurants, including fast food, have added more salads and fruit offerings and either by choice or in response to local legislation provided nutrition labeling.&lt;ref name=RecentERS/&gt;

In the US the FDA is moving towards establishing uniform guidelines for fast food and restaurant labeling, proposed rules were published in 2011 and final regulations published on 1 December 2014 which supersede State and local menu-labeling provisions, going into effect 1 December 2015.&lt;ref name=RecentERS/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewregERS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Hayden|last2=Morrison|first2=Rosanna Mentzer|title=New Regulations Will Inform Consumers About Calories in Restaurant Foods|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2015-januaryfebruary/new-regulations-will-inform-consumers-about-calories-in-restaurant-foods.aspx#.Vd8k2zbouAk|website=USDA ERS|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the new labels may influence consumer choices, but primarily if it provides unexpected information and that health-conscious consumers are resistant to changing behaviors based on menu labeling &lt;ref name=NewregERS /&gt; Fast food restaurants are expected by the ERS to do better under the new menu labeling than full service restaurants as full-service restaurants tend to offer much more calorie dense foods, with 50% of fast food meals being between 400 and 800 calories and less than 20% above 1000 calories, in contrast, full-service restaurants 20% of meals are above 1,400 calories.&lt;ref name=NewregERS /&gt; When consumers are aware of the calorie counts at full-service restaurants 20% choose lower calorie options and consumers also reduce their calorie intake over the rest of the day.&lt;ref name=NewregERS /&gt;

Eating one meal away from home each week translates to 2 extra pounds each year or a daily increase of 134 calories and a decrease in diet quality by 2 points on the Healthy Eating Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Jessica E.|last2=Mancino|first2=Lisa|last3=Lin|first3=Biing-Hwan|title=The Impact of Food Away From Home on Adult Diet Quality - Report Summary|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err90/report-summary.aspx|website=USDA ERS|accessdate=27 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907001423/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err90/report-summary.aspx|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition; the likelihood of contracting a food-borne illness (such as E. coli, hepatitis B, H. pylori, listeria, salmonella, norovirus and typhoid) is greatly increased due to food not being kept below 40 degrees Fahrenheit or cooked to a temperature of higher than 160 degrees Fahrenheit, not washing hands for at least 20 seconds for food handlers or not washing contaminated cutting boards and other kitchen tools in hot water.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Table service==
Table service is food service served to the customer's table by waiters and waitresses, also known as "servers". Table service is common in most restaurants, while for some [[fast food restaurant]]s counter service is the common form. For [[pub]]s and [[bar (establishment)|bars]], counter service is the norm in the [[United Kingdom]]. With table service, the customer generally pays at the end of meal. Various methods of table service can be provided, such as [[silver service]].

==History==

Gerson Lehrman Group was founded by [[Yale Law School]] graduates [[Mark Gerson]] and Thomas Lehrman in 1998. Alexander Saint-Amand, a former Bloomberg reporter, joined GLG shortly after, and served as CEO until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Professional Learning|url=http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2014.4_Oct/New_York_City/LEADERS-Alexander-Saint-Amand-GLG.html|website=Leaders Mag|access-date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=3367944&amp;privcapId=134597205|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLG, initially funded by friends and family, was formed as a [[publishing house]] to produce industry guidebooks for institutional investors. However, the founders discovered that their clients wanted to talk directly to experts in casual conversations, rather than reading formal written reports. Accordingly, in 1999, GLG abandoned its publishing business and began offering subscriptions to its network of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing; It's Not What They Know, but Whom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/23/business/investing-it-s-not-what-they-know-but-whom.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2001|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This business came to be called an [[expert network]].

GLG’s first customers were investors, and most of their growth from 1999 to 2005 was within the investment community. In 2006, they began working with big strategy consultancies and with companies in life sciences, chemicals and industrials, and technology. By 2010, [[The Wall Street Journal]] had described GLG as "dominating the U.S. expert networking industry".&lt;ref name=wsj2&gt;{{cite web|title=Talent holds key to growth in Asia for Gerson Lehrman boss|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703580904575130931563106648|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design space, GLG is a pioneer of [[Activity Based Working|activity based working]] office design, which does away with seating assignments for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More New York Companies Experiment With Innovative Office Space|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-new-york-companies-experiment-with-innovative-office-space-1404694528|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 7, 2014|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, GLG named Paul Todd as its new CEO. Todd was previously the head of [[eBay]]'s EMEA business since 2015.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman Recruits New Technology CEO from eBay|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/glg-recruits-new-technology-ceo-ebay/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=March 27, 2018|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/meet-the-leader-paul-todd/|title=Two Minutes with our European Chief Paul Todd|date=2015-08-03|website=www.ebayinc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonprofit activities==

In 2006, GLG worked with [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to provide new primary data and analysis relevant for any other recovery plans in the rebuilding of Louisiana following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebuilding after Katrina and Rita |url=https://www.swtlaw.com/sites/swtlawcom/files/779-RebuildingAfterKatrina.pdf|website=Schulten Ward Turner &amp; Weiss, LLP|date=April 12, 2006|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLG has also done other philanthropy work with smaller charities.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye-Care Charity Gets Free Fund-Raising Insights|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Eye-Care-Charity-Gets-Free/226491|website=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=November 11, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLG now operates a global Social Impact Fellowship, an initiative that provides learning resources and expertise to a select group of nonprofits and social enterprises, at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GLG Social Impact|url=http://glgsocialimpact.com/|website=GLG Social Impact|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Woman's Novel Approach to Poverty Relief is a Game-Changer|url=http://nationswell.com/glg-social-impact-fellow-sherry-riva|website=Nation Swell|date=January 30, 2017|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional partnerships==

As the use of alternative research providers within the financial industry has grown, brokerages themselves have been partnering with firms like GLG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman and Morgan Stanley Alphawise Tie Up|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/gerson-lehrman-and-morgan-stanley-alphawise-tie-up/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=March 27, 2008|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2008, the company announced a deal with [[Credit Suisse]], whereby analysts from the financial services giant would be able to tap into GLG’s experts as part of their research process.  About 300 Credit Suisse analysts became members of the GLG expert network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Suisse in alliance with consultancy firm|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7b41e986-7eca-11dd-b1af-000077b07658|website=Financial Times|date=September 10, 2008|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Gerson Lehrman Group announced a partnership with [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]], making the company's 800+ market researchers available to consult with GLG clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman Group Announces Addition of Frost &amp; Sullivan to the Council Partners Program|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gerson-lehrman-group-announces-addition-of-frost--sullivan-to-the-council-partners-program-61927502.html|website=GLG Press Release|date=April 23, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, GLG announced that it has partnered with [[Amba Research]], a leading financial services [[knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) firm that provides equity and credit research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amba partners with Gerson Lehrman Group|url=http://www.ambaresearch.com/amba-partners-gerson-lehrman-group/|website=Amba Press Release|date=July 27, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719202222/http://www.ambaresearch.com/amba-partners-gerson-lehrman-group/|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2010, GLG and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] announced a partnership that enables clients of the Bloomberg Professional platform to access the GLG expert network through the Bloomberg platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg Professional Offers Access to Global Industry Experts|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100708005324/en/Bloomberg-Professional-Offers-Access-Global-Industry-Experts|website=Bloomberg, GLG Press Release|date=July 8, 2010|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, GLG partnered with and acquired a minority stake in Ushi, a leading China-based business [[social networking]] provider, and the largest competitor of [[LinkedIn]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLG Invests in Chinese Social Media Startup|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/glg-invests-in-chinese-social-media-startup/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=November 8, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ushi, China’s Answer To LinkedIn, Raises $3 Million From GLG, Others|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/13/ushi-chinas-answer-to-linkedin-raises-3-million-from-glg |website=TechCrunch|date=October 13, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

The expert network business model has drawn scrutiny for concerns relating to adherence to disclosure rules and [[insider trading]] within the investment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmdutton.com/PDF_Files/mayhew-interview_0605.pdf Dutton Associates Online Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2005, for example, doctors who served as paid consultants to investment firms as a result of their role in an expert network generated a “fair share of controversy”.&lt;ref&gt;Marcy Tolkoff, April 21, 2006.

A '''hair dryer''', '''hairdryer'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hairdryer|title=hairdryer noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes {{!}} Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''blow dryer''' is an [[electromechanical]] device that blows ambient or hot air over damp hair to speed the [[evaporation]] of water to dry the hair. Blow dryers enable better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary [[hydrogen bond]]s within each strand. These bonds are powerful (allowing stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by [[Permanent wave|permanent waving products]]) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to [[humidity]]. They disappear with a single washing of the hair.

[[File:Handheld blowdryer.jpg|thumb|The normal use of a hair dryer]]

[[Hairstyle]]s using blow dryers usually have volume and discipline, which can be further improved with styling products and hairbrushes during drying to add tension, hold and lift.

Blow dryers were invented in the late 19th century. The first model was created by Esther F. "Beau" Godefroy in his salon in [[France]] in 1890. The handheld, household hair dryer first appeared in 1920. Blow dryers are used in [[beauty salon]]s by professional stylists and in the household by consumers.

==Function==
[[File:HairDryer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An early blow dryer]]

Most hair dryers consist of electric heating coils and a fan (usually powered by a [[universal motor]]). The [[heating element]] in most dryers is a bare, coiled [[nichrome wire]] that is wrapped around mica insulators. Nichrome is used because of two important properties: It is a poor conductor of electricity and it does not oxidize when heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theoriginof.com/hair-dryer.html|title = Hair Dryer|date = 2008-02-16|access-date = 2015-10-26|website = TheOriginOf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of stores in 2007 showed that most hair dryers had [[ceramic]] [[heating element]]s (like [[ceramic heater]]s), because of their "instant heat" capability. This means that it takes less time for the dryers to heat up and for the hair to dry.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Kirkland, Kathy (June 2004) "The Big Blow-Dryer Boom", ''Beauty Story Business''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Girl under hair dryer, 1958.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Girl under beauty parlor hair dryer, 1958]]
Many of these dryers have "normal mode" buttons that turn off the heater and blow room-temperature air while the button is pressed. This function helps to maintain the hairstyle by setting it. The colder air reduces frizz and can help to promote shine in the hair.

Many feature "ionic" operation, to reduce the build-up of [[static electricity]] in the hair,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/static-hair_n_4195372.html|title = 9 Ways To Win The War On Static Hair|date = 2013-11-05|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = Huffington Post|last = Krupnick|first = Ellie}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the efficacy of ionic technology is of some debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1935|title = How do "ionic" hair dryers affect the hair, short-term and long term?|accessdate = 26 October 2015|publisher = [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]] ScienceLine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers claim this makes the hair "smoother". Some stylists{{Who|date=September 2011}} consider the introduction of ionic technology to be one of the most important advances in the [[beauty industry]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

Hair dryers are available with attachments, such as diffusers, airflow concentrators, and comb nozzles. 
* A diffuser is an attachment that is used on hair that is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly. It diffuses the jet of air, so that the hair is not blown around while it dries. The hair dries more slowly, at a cooler temperature, and with less physical disturbance. This makes it so that the hair is less likely to frizz and it gives the hair more volume.
* An airflow concentrator does the opposite of a diffuser. It makes the end of the blow dryer narrower and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot to make it dry rapidly.
* The comb nozzle attachment is the same as the airflow concentrator, but it ends with comb-like teeth so that the user can dry the hair using the dryer without a brush or comb.

Hair dryers have been cited as an effective treatment for [[head lice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Atkin|first2=J. S.|last3=Wilding|first3=K. G.|last4=Birch|first4=K. G.|last5=Cottam|first5=M.

== Types ==
Today there are two major types of blow dryers (hair dryers): the handheld and the rigid-hood dryer.

A hood dryer has a hard plastic dome that fits over a person's head to dry their hair. Hot air is blown out through tiny openings around the inside of the dome so the hair is dried evenly. Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hair-hood-dryer.htm//|title=What is a hair hood dryer?|publisher=WiseGeek|accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AEG Foen Nr72355 03 mod03 res.jpg|thumb|150px|Dryer made by [[AEG]], c. 1920–1925]]
In 1890 the first hairdryer was invented by French stylist [[Fay Godefroy]]. His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his [[hair salon]] in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/04/28/fashion/history-hair-dryers/s/28HAIRDRYERS-slide-KVQ5.html|title=A Lot of Hot Air|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armenian American]] inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Kazanjiadl "Hair-Drier" {{US Patent|994259}}, assigned on 6 June 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1915, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zIYLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=91MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5997,3157234|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately {{convert|2|lb|1}}, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of [[thermal shock|overheating]] and [[electrocution]]. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100&amp;nbsp;watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000&amp;nbsp;watts of heat).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Hair-Dryer.html|title = Hair Dryer|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = MadeHow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when [[Green Electronics Council|GEC]] changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.&lt;ref name="homepage.ntlworld.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071004071952/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hairdryers.html Electric Hair Dryers]. ntlworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Excelsior hair dryer 1962.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1962]]
The bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person's head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once.

The 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person's head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage.&lt;ref name="homepage.ntlworld.com" /&gt;

In the 1970s, the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture. Since 1991 the CPSC has mandated that all dryers must use a [[ground fault circuit interrupter]] so that it cannot electrocute a person if it gets wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://home.howstuffworks.com/hair-dryer.htm|title = How Hair Dryers Work|date = 2000-12-15|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = HowStuffWorks.com|last = Toothman|first = Jessika|last2 = Meeker-O'Connell|first2 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, deaths by blowdryers had dropped to fewer than four people a year, a stark difference to the hundreds of cases of electrocution accidents during the mid-20th century.

[[File:Raja_of_Tranvancore's_elephants.jpg|thumb|210px|Howdah on the elephants of the [[list of maharajas of Travancore|Maharaja of Travancore]]. May 1841.]][[File:Howdah (PSF).png|thumb|right|Elephant with howdah]]

A '''howdah''', or '''houdah''' ([[Hindi]]: हौदा ''haudā''), derived from the Arabic هودج (hawdaj), that means "bed carried by a camel", also known as ''hathi howdah'' (हाथी हौदा), is a [[carriage]] which is positioned on the back of an [[elephant]], or occasionally some other animal such as [[camel]]s, used most often in the past to carry wealthy people or for use in [[hunting]] or [[war]]fare. It was also a symbol of wealth for the owner and as a result was decorated with expensive [[gemstone]]s.

Most notable are the [[Golden Howdah]], the one used in display at the [[Napier Museum]] at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] which was used by the [[List of maharajas of Travancore|Maharaja of Travancore]] and the one used traditionally during the Elephant Procession of the famous [[Mysore Dasara]]. The [[Mehrangarh Fort#Galleries in Mehrangarh Museum|Mehrangarh Fort Museum]] in [[Jodhpur]], [[Rajasthan]] has a gallery of royal howdahs.

In the present time, howdahs are used mainly for tourist or commercial purposes in South East Asia and are the subject of controversy as [[animal rights groups]] and organizations, such as [[Millennium Elephant Foundation]], openly criticize the use of the howdah, citing information that howdahs can cause permanent damage to an elephant's spine, lungs, and other organs and can significantly shorten the animal's life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumelephantfoundation.com/projects/howdah-not-to-do-it/|title=n.Howdah not to do it- MEF Lift the Covers! |publisher= [[Millennium Elephant Foundation]] |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== References in literature ==
The American author [[Herman Melville]] in Chapter 42 ("The Whiteness of the Whale") of ''[[Moby Dick]]'' (1851), writes "To the native Indian of Peru, the continual site of the snow-howdahed [[Andes]] conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the more fancy of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes." It also appears in Chapter 11 of [[Jules Verne]]s' classic adventure novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1873), in which we are told "The Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs." [[Tolkien]] also wrote in ''[[Lord of The Rings]]'' of the [[Mûmakil]] (Elephants) of [[Harad]] with howdahs on their backs.

== Elephant and castle symbol ==
{{details|Elephant and Castle#Name}}{{see also|history of elephants in Europe}}
[[File:Elephant &amp; Castle, London, England.jpg|thumb|Statue at [[Elephant and Castle]] intersection in [[London]].]]
A derived symbol used in Europe is the "elephant and castle": an elephant carrying a [[castle]] on its back, being used especially to symbolize strength. The symbol was used in Europe in [[classical antiquity]] and more recently has been used in England since the 13th century, and in Denmark since at least the 17th century.

In antiquity, the Romans [[War_elephant#Antiquity:_the_Mediterranean|made use of]] war elephants, and turreted elephants feature on the coinage of [[Juba II]] of [[Numidia]], in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mazard, ''Corpus Nummorum Numidiae Mauretaniaeque'' (Paris 1955) 103, nº. 276, pl. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were used in the Roman campaigns against the [[Celtiberians]] in [[Hispania]], against the [[Gauls]], and against the Britons, the ancient historian [[Polyaenus]] writing, "Caesar had one large elephant, which was equipped with armor and carried archers and slingers in its tower. When this unknown creature entered the river, the Britons and their horses fled and the Roman army crossed over."&lt;ref&gt;[[Polyaenus]], (VIII, 23.5).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he may have confused this incident with the use of a similar war elephant in [[Claudius]]' final [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]].

Alternatively, modern uses may derive from later contacts with howdahs. Fanciful images of war elephants with elaborate castles on their back date to 12th century Spain, as at right.

Notably, 13th century English use may come from the elephant given by [[Louis IX of France]] to [[Henry III of England]], for his menagerie in the Tower of London in 1225,  this  being the first elephant in England since Claudius.

Today the symbol is most known from the [[Elephant and Castle]] intersection in south [[London]], which derives its name from a pub, using the old site of a cutler's, who had used the symbol of the [[Worshipful Company of Cutlers]]. The Cutlers, in turn, used the symbol due to the use of ivory in handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-ele1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Elephant and Castle|website=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elephant and castle symbol has also been used since the 13th century in the [[coat of arms]] of the city of [[Coventry]], and was used in the 17th century by the English slaving monopoly, the [[Royal African Company]], which led to its use on the [[guinea (coin)|guinea coin]].

[[File:Keten Olifant.jpg|thumb|The collar of the [[Order of the Elephant]].]]
The symbol of an elephant and castle is also used in the [[Order of the Elephant]], the highest [[order (distinction)|order]] in Denmark, since 1693.

A '''humidistat''' is an [[Electronic component|electronic device]] analogous to a [[thermostat]] but which responds to [[relative humidity]], not [[temperature]]. Humidistats are used in a number of devices including [[dehumidifiers]], [[humidifiers]], and [[microwave ovens]]. In humidifiers and dehumidifiers the humidistat is used where constant relative humidity conditions need to be maintained such as a [[refrigerator]], [[greenhouse]], or [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] [[warehouse]]. When adjusting the controls in these applications the humidistat would be what is being set. In microwaves they are used in conjunction with "smart cooking" one-button features such as those for [[popcorn bag|microwave popcorn]]. Humidistats employ [[hygrometer]]s but are not the same. A humidistat has the functionality of a [[switch]] and is not just a [[measuring instrument]] like a hygrometer is.

For [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC) of buildings, humidistats or humidity sensors are used to sense the air relative humidity in the controlled space and turn on and off the HVAC equipment.&lt;ref&gt;ENGINEERING MANUAL OF AUTOMATION CONTROL, Honeywell, 1997, https://customer.honeywell.com/resources/techlit/techlitdocuments/77-0000s/77-e1100.pdf accessed 27 October 2014, Chapter "ELECTRONIC CONTROL FUNDAMENTALS", Section "RELATIVE HUMIDITY SENSOR", pg 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2014, Jamie Bolding founded Viral Thread in [[West London (sub region)|West London]]. The first piece of content produced was a [[listicle]] entitled "Twenty people you will meet at fresher's week." Initially, the site's focus was on collating already existent content.&lt;ref name="IndieMain"&gt;{{cite news | last=Chapman| first=Ben| title =Jungle Creations: The unknown company behind the internet's biggest viral videos | newspaper =The Independent| date =13 July 2017 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/Business/indyventure/jungle-creations-biggest-viral-videos-jamie-bolding-viral-thread-media-twisted-nailed-it-a7839616.html| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2016, the company's food-related channel, Twisted, partnered with [[Oreo]] to announce new Oreo flavours.&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;{{cite news | last=Beltrone| first=Gabriel| title =Oreo Is Now Making Tasty-Style Recipe Videos for Some of Its Stranger Flavors | work =Adweek| date =26 September 2016 | url =http://www.adweek.com/creativity/oreo-now-making-tasty-style-recipe-videos-its-special-edition-flavors-173715/| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DrumOreo"&gt;{{cite news | last=Velasco| first=Haley| title =Oreo debuts new cookie flavors with social channel Twisted | publisher =The Drum| date =21 September 2016 | url =http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/21/oreo-debuts-new-cookie-flavors-with-social-channel-twisted| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, the Viral Thread channel posted a video featuring the [[Hövding]] airbag bicycle helmet which became the most watched video in the company's history with over 150 million views.&lt;ref name="IndieMain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite news | last=Carlström| first=Vilhelm| title =The Swedish airbag for cyclists unexpectedly went completely viral | publisher =Business Insider| date =21 September 2016 | url =http://nordic.businessinsider.com/the-swedish-air-bag-for-cyclists-just-unexpectedly-went-viral-2016-9| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Jungle Creations attracted some controversy when it posted and began licensing a viral video featuring a female bicyclist being [[Street harassment|catcalled]] by men in a van. The video ended with the woman ripping the side mirror off the van and cycling away.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | last=Cresci| first=Elena| title =Why a viral video of a cyclist's revenge on catcallers may not be all it seems  | newspaper =The Guardian| date =22 February 2017 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/22/why-a-viral-video-of-a-cyclists-revenge-on-catcallers-may-not-be-all-it-seems| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndieVid"&gt;{{cite news | last=Eleftheriou-Smith| first=Loulla-Mae| title =Female cyclist catcalled by man in van chases him down and exacts her revenge  | newspaper =The Independent| date =22 February 2017 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/female-cyclist-catcalled-video-man-van-chase-down-revenge-wing-mirror-sexism-a7593186.html| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite news | last=Matyszczyk| first=Chris| title =Catcaller revenge video goes viral (but is it real?) | publisher =CNET| date =22 February 2017 | url =https://www.cnet.com/news/viral-video-woman-revenge-on-catcaller-real-ruse-staged/| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the company opened an office in New York City.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite news | last=Southern| first=Lucinda| title =With viral out of style, Viral Thread is rebranding as VT | publisher =[[Digiday]]| date =3 August 2017 | url =https://digiday.com/media/viral-thread-rebrand-grows-up/| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, it named Nat Poulter its chief operating officer and Sefton Monk its chief technology officer.&lt;ref name="DrumMove"&gt;{{cite news | last=Cleeton| first=Jenny| title =People on the move featuring ITV, Dentsu Aegis Network, Jungle Creations, GiveMeSport and Vice | publisher =The Drum| date =19 July 2017 | url =http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/07/19/people-the-move-featuring-itv-dentsu-aegis-network-jungle-creations-givemesport-and| accessdate =26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the company officially changed the name of Viral Thread to VT.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt;

==Operation==
Jungle Creations operates several, often themed video channels, largely on Facebook. Its channels include Twisted and Food Envy (for food and cooking), Bosh (for [[vegan]] food), Nailed It (for DIY), The Aardvark (for animals), and its flagship channel, Viral Thread (or VT) among others.&lt;ref name="IndieMain"/&gt; Currently, around 40% of the videos it publishes are original while the other 60% is culled from content aggregators or user submissions. The company also partners with other businesses (like Oreo or [[YO! Sushi]]) to produce video content for their brand.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt;

In a '''low-IF receiver''', the [[Radio Frequency|RF]] [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] is mixed down to a non-zero low or moderate [[intermediate frequency]], typically a few [[Hertz|megahertz]] (for TV), and even lower frequencies (typically 120-130kHz) in the case of FM radio band receivers. Low-IF receiver topologies have many of the desirable properties of [[zero-IF receiver|zero-IF architectures]], but avoid the [[DC offset]] and [[1/f noise]] problems.

The use of a non-zero IF re-introduces the [[Image response|image issue]]. However, when there are relatively relaxed image and neighbouring [[Electronic selectivity|channel rejection]] requirements they can be satisfied by carefully designed low-IF receivers. Image signal and unwanted blockers can be rejected by [[quadrature downconversion]] (complex mixing) and subsequent [[Electronic filter|filtering]].

This technique is now widely used in the tiny [[Frequency modulation|FM]] receivers incorporated into [[MP3]] players and [[mobile phone]]s and is becoming commonplace in both [[Analog television|analog]] and [[Digital television|digital]] TV receiver designs. Using advanced [[Analog signal processing|analog-]] and [[digital signal processing]] techniques, cheap, high quality receivers using no [[resonant circuit]]s at all are now possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13976">'''McAllister Hull''' (September 1, 1923 – February 9, 2011) was an American theoretical physicist who took part in the creation of the [[atomic bomb]] that was dropped over [[Nagasaki]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]].

==Early years==
Hull was born on September 1, 1923, in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  In his memoir, he describes how, in his boyhood, he read [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and other science-fiction writers, and discovered physics and [[Albert Einstein]] while doing school projects.&lt;ref name=love&gt;{{cite news| last =England| first =Terry| title =A Love for Physics| work =Santa Fe New Mexican| date =Aug 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 letter to the ''New York Review of Books'', Hull wrote that his father had “tried to enlist” in General [[John J. Pershing]]'s expedition to bring [[Pancho Villa]] to justice, “but needed his mother’s permission, which was not given. In 1917, he did enlist, and went to [[France]] with Pershing in the 4th Alabama, where he was in combat until wounded at [[Soissons]], and in hospital service until 1919.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/jul/15/a-major-attack/?pagination=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1941, Hull entered [[Mississippi State University]] to study physics.  After his freshman year, according to a 2007 newspaper profile, “he quit school and became a draftsman for an ordnance plant, where he was trained to test explosives to see if they were pure enough to be used for shells.”&lt;ref name=pac&gt;{{cite web| title =McAllister Hull| work =Post and Courier | url =http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20070804/PC1209/308049947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Army and Los Alamos==
In 1943 Hull was drafted into the Army Specialized Training Program, which identified enlisted personnel who had technical skills or some science education.  He was assigned to the [[Special Engineer Detachment]] (SED) at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

In the autumn of 1944, Hull and three other men were ordered to take a train from Oak Ridge to Lamy, [[New Mexico]], where Hull dialed a number he had been told to call.  A bus showed up and took Hull and his companions to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].  “I never saw those men again,” Hull later recalled.  Although he had only a high-school diploma, he had been identified as promising student of physics.  He was put to work developing methods for, and overseeing, the casting of explosive lenses which would compress a plutonium core, resulting in an implosion.&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;  Hull, a sergeant, acted as foreman, supervising the team of civilians who worked on the casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Steinberg| first =David| title =Making Scientific Site a Little More Permanent| work =Albuquerque Journal| date =Dec 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the months when he worked on the project to create [[Fat Man]], the atomic bomb that would be dropped over Nagasaki, he was not told explicitly that he was working on a bomb. “But I knew enough physics to figure out what was going on.”  His work, which lasted until the summer of 1945, was considered so dangerous that the lab where he worked with his team was 15 miles from the other scientists' labs.&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

In order to cast the explosives, according to the ''New York Times'', Hull used candy kettles and malted-milk stirrers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/29/science/oppenheimer-celebration-examines-the-myth-and-the-man.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm&lt;/ref&gt;  “We actually used a candy kettle ... to melt the explosives and then poured them into the mold to make the lenses,” Hull told MSNBC in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15157692/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/manhattan-project-building-preserved/&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists tells the story this way: “One of Hull's early assignments was to figure our how to eliminate air bubbles in the explosive lenses. Remembering his experience making milk shakes as a waiter at college, he devised a stirrer that could be drawn up through the molten mixture, effectively bringing the bubbles to the surface.”&lt;ref name=ssite&gt;{{cite news| last =Kelly| first =Cynthia| title =Remembering S Site| work =Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists| date =Jan 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the atom bomb, Hull told CBS: “We were pouring two--two-speed explosives: a slow explosive called baritar, which was [[barium nitrate]] and TNT, mainly, and then a faster explosive called Comp-B, which had TNT in it and the rest of it either classified or I don't remember. It was--it was fast.”  Asked by a CBS reporter whether there had been “white coats” or a “lab atmosphere,” Hull replied: “Oh, Lord, no.”&lt;ref name=gad&gt;{{cite news| title =The Gadget:: Look Back at the Testing of the Atomic Bomb 50 Years Ago| work =CBS News| date =Jul 16, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hull later recalled “the day that [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], the director of Los Alamos, brought Gen. [[Leslie Groves]] out to the lab. While looking at the mold for the lens, Groves accidentally stepped on and disconnected a hot water line. A stream of extremely hot water came out of the socket behind him, hitting him squarely in the rear.  Hull succeeded – just barely – in stifling his laughter, but only until Oppenheimer turned to him and remarked that the incident “just goes to show you the incompressibility of water.” There was no way Hull could contain himself after that. (Hull was relieved that Groves did not recognize him at the Trinity test several months later.)”&lt;ref name=ssite/&gt;

Hull was still at work on Fat Man At 5:30 A.M. on July 16, 1945, the test bomb produced by the project was detonated on the Alamogordo Bombing Range south of Los Alamos. “I was invited to go to a viewing site 20 miles away to watch,” Hull later said.  “It was pitch dark, and then suddenly, this brilliant light flashed, but since we were 20 miles away, we heard no sound,” says Hull.

Hill later said that the biggest surprise of his life was discovering that despite “strict internal security” in the [[Manhattan Project]], “Soviet KGB agents managed to get near enough to learn some things.”&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

==Reflections on the morality of the bomb==
When he was first working on Fat Man, Hull “didn't want it dropped on people,” but rather wished it would be detonate “in the [[Tokyo]] Harbor or in an isolated area, to scare them.  But when Hirohito didn't surrender, even after the Aug. 6 bombing of Hiroshima, we knew we had no choice.”  In 2007, Hull expressed hope that nuclear bombs would never be used again.&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

When it turned out that “the blast [over Nagasaki] was a good one,” Hull said in a 1995 interview with [[CNN]], “it was a tremendous relief. All of us felt that way. All of us felt that way. We had done it. But at the same time, immediately both of us who knew the score began to think, OK, what have we done? What have we done?...How many of us knew everything about the bomb, enough to know what its potential was? Well, a relatively small number, maybe a thousand. Maybe a few of them. So let's say a thousand just to be generous. How many people were killed — 20,000. It means I'm responsible for 400? That's the kind of arithmetic that bothers you.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Return to Ground Zero, Part | work =CNN| date =Aug 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Different kinds of people worked on the Manhattan Project, from the greatest scientist in the world to the ordinary people doing ordinary things,” Hull said in a 2006 interview.  He also said that “[a]nyone who works on weapons has a responsibility for people who are killed with those weapons....As a consequence, I have a personal responsibility for some of those people who were killed in Nagasaki.”  Still, as he told a 1985 interviewer, “my colleagues and I were very pleased that our efforts had not failed....We had no idea about the tactics or the strategy of using both bombs. And today, it is still controversial whether the second bomb should have been used or whether either bomb should have been used. But that's hindsight.”&lt;ref name=unm&gt;http://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/15215095397obitsprofiles02-15-11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in a 1995 interview on ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' whether, if he could go back in time, he would participate again in the creation of the bomb, Hull said: “I would again do whatever was necessary to defend our way of life, to save the life of this country and this society, which, as difficult, as fragile and as—as flawed as it is, it's still the best the world has ever seen. That I'd—that I'd do it again. Sorry.”&lt;ref name=gad/&gt;

==Postwar career==
After the war Hull attended [[Yale University]], where he earned a B.S. in 1948 and a Ph.D. in 1951.  He went on to teach physics at Yale for 20 years.&lt;ref name=unm/&gt;

Hull later said that the person who had exerted the greated professional influence upon him was [[Gregory Breit]], the theoretical nuclear physicist who “was my mentor and friend for 20 years through my career at Yale.”&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

He also taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he was the dean of graduate and professional education, and at [[Oregon State University]].

He moved to Albuquerque in 1977 to take up the position of provost at the [[University of New Mexico]], where he also taught physics.  He remained as provost until the mid 1980s, and retired from UNM in 1989.&lt;ref name=unm/&gt;

Hull played an instrumental role in the establishment of UNM’s optics program. He was also a strong supporter of the university's Peace Studies program.  In 2007 he said that his greatest professional pride was a course he had taught “for more than 30 years” called Physics and Society.&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;  He had “hoped to promote closer relations between the arts and sciences at the University of New Mexico by creating a modern Aristotelian program recognizing the unity of knowledge. I came close, but ran out of time.”&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

In his later years, when his wife began to lose her eyesight owing to macular degeneration, Hull created a device intended to improve her vision by “direct[ing] light to portions of the retina unaffected by the disease to compensate for the loss in the central vision field.”  Patented and marketed as the MacVision lens technology, it was put on the market in 2009 by MacVision Technologies, a joint venture by the University of New Mexico and Select Universities Technology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =MACULAR DEGENERATION SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU OR YOUR LOVED ONE FROM ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING| work =The Magnifier | url =http://www.eyesight2008.org/webdata/uploads/1259464817_Issue_issue74novdec2009.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hull said in 2007 that he had never met any survivors of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. “I have had Japanese students in my courses, perhaps children of survivors, in which I discussed the bombings,” he said. “The students seemed to accept the bombings as justified by the Japanese aggression.”&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

He moved to Charleston, South Carolina, in 2007.

At the time of his death, on February 9, 2011, aged 87, he was Professor Emeritus of Physics at UNM. Former University of New Mexico Provost and Professor Emeriti of Physics.&lt;ref name=unm/&gt;

==Beliefs and opinions==
He said that his strongest belief was that “[t]here is no acceptable degree of nuclear war, for once launched, no one can control the course of it.”&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

A reviewer wrote that “Hull's love of science permeates his memoir,” and quoted him as writing: “It usually surprises me –  pleasurably – when I discover that something I've worked out in theory actually works out in the real world....To paraphrase Einstein, the greatest puzzle about the universe is that we understand it!”&lt;ref name=love/&gt;

He told a 2006 interviewer, “I believe people in general, who are not going to be physicists, need to understand how physics affects their lives.”&lt;ref name=amanda&gt;{{cite news| last =Stevens| first =Amanda| title =Young Perspective: Author of Book about New Book about Manhattan Project Was Only 21 Years Old When He Worked on Atomic Project | work =Albuquerque Journal| date =Feb 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter the same year to the New York Times, reacting to a column about college education by David Brooks, Hull wrote: “The humanities without the sciences are incomplete, and the sciences without the humanities dangerous.”&lt;ref&gt;http://brooks.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/03/02/how-to-get-an-education-in-college/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
His memoir, ''Rider of the Pale Horse: A Memoir of Los Alamos and Beyond'', co-authored with Amy Bianco, was published in 2006 by UNM Press.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/By-McAllister-Hull-Memoir-Alamos/dp/B008VQZ57S&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the memoir refers to Revelation 6:8: “Behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.”&lt;ref name=amanda/&gt;

He was also the author of a 1969 textbook, ''The Calculus of Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/The-calculus-physics-McAllister-Hull/dp/B0006BZC92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Hull was married for 65 years to Mary Muska Hull, who survived him.  They had two children, John Hull and Wendy McCabe, and three grandchildren, Isaac Hull, Damaris McDonald and Ursula McCabe.&lt;ref name=unm/&gt;

In 2007 he listed his pastimes as “studying serious music, theater and art history” and said that in earlier years he had been interested in “flying light planes, mountain hiking, skydiving and building furniture.”&lt;ref name=pac/&gt;

'''Michael Joseph Owens''' (January 1, 1859 &amp;ndash; December 27, 1923) was an inventor of machines to automate the production of glass bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography]] |title=Michael Joseph Owens |url=https://archive.org/stream/cyclopaediaofame08wilsuoft#page/n233/mode/2up |isbn= |pages= |quote= | accessdate=2013-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Mason County, West Virginia]] on January 1, 1859. He left school at the age of 10 to start a glassware [[apprenticeship]] at [[J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. 
[[File:Ten Arm Owens Automatic Bottle Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A ten-arm owens automatic bottle machine, ca. 1910, photo by [[Jacob Riis]]]]
In 1888 he moved to [[Toledo, Ohio]] and worked for the [[Toledo Glass Factory]] owned by [[Edward Drummond Libbey]]. He was later promoted to foreman and then to supervisor. He formed the [[Owens Bottle Machine Company]] in 1903. His machines could produce glass bottles at a rate of 240 per minute, and reduce labor costs by 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hall of Fame -- Inventor Profile: Michael Joseph Owens |url=http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/357.html |publisher=[[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=2012-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927020621/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/357.html |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens and Libbey entered into a partnership and the company was renamed the Owens Bottle Company in 1919. In 1929 the company merged with the Illinois Glass Company to become the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Joseph Owens |url=http://www.todayinsci.com/O/Owens_MichaelJ/OwensMichaelJ.htm |quote=Michael Owens was a glass manufacturer who invented an automatic glass bottle manufacturing machine that revolutionized the industry.

'''Nanocrystal solar cells''' are [[solar cell]]s based on a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] with a [[coating]] of [[nanocrystal]]s. The nanocrystals are typically based on [[silicon]], [[CdTe]] or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] and the substrates are generally silicon or various organic conductors. [[Quantum dot solar cell]]s are a variant of this approach, but take advantage of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects to extract further performance. [[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s are another related approach, but in this case the nano-structuring is part of the substrate.

Previous fabrication methods relied on expensive [[molecular beam epitaxy]] processes, but colloidal synthesis allows for cheaper manufacture. A thin film of nanocrystals is obtained by a process known as "[[spin coating|spin-coating]]". This involves placing an amount of the quantum dot solution onto a flat substrate, which is then rotated very quickly. The solution spreads out uniformly, and the substrate is spun until the required thickness is achieved.

Quantum dot based photovoltaic cells based on dye-sensitized colloidal [[titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] films were investigated in 1991&lt;ref&gt;

and were found to exhibit promising efficiency of converting incident light energy to electrical energy, and to be incredibly encouraging due to the low cost of materials used. A single-nanocrystal (channel) architecture in which an array of single particles between the electrodes, each separated by ~1 exciton diffusion length, was proposed to improve the device efficiency&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and research on this type of solar cell is being conducted by groups at Stanford, Berkeley and the University of Tokyo.

Although research is still in its infancy, in the future nanocrystal photovoltaics may offer advantages such as flexibility (quantum dot-polymer composite photovoltaics&lt;ref&gt;

It is argued that many measurements of the efficiency of the nanocrystal solar cell are incorrect and that nanocrystal solar cells are not suitable for large scale manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;

Recent research has experimented with [[lead selenide]] (PbSe) semiconductor, as well as with [[cadmium telluride photovoltaics]] (CdTe), which has already been well established in the production of second-generation [[thin film solar cells]]. Other materials are being researched as well.

The 11th report of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission, titled "Promoting e-Governance - The Smart Way Forward", established the government's position that an expansion in [[e-Government]] was necessary in [[India]].&lt;ref name="ARC"/&gt; The ARC report was submitted to the Government of India on 20 December 2008.&lt;ref name="ARC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arc.gov.in/11threp/ARC_11thReport_preface_contents.pdf |title=Second Administrative Reforms Commission Preface to the Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report cited several prior initiatives as sources of inspiration, including references to the [[Singapore]] ONE programme. To pursue this goal, the National e-Governance Plan was formulated by the Department of [[Information Technology]] (DIT) and [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (India)#Department of Administrative Reforms &amp; Public Grievances|Department of Administrative Reforms &amp; Public Grievances]] (DAR&amp;PG). The program required the development of new applications to allow citizen access to government services through [[Common Service Centers]]; it aimed to both reduce government costs and improve access to services.&lt;ref name="Indg"&gt;{{cite news|author=Indg|url=http://www.indg.in/e-governance/e-governance/egov-plan|title=about NeGP|publisher=Indg.in|accessdate=17 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419175645/http://www.indg.in/e-governance/e-governance/egov-plan|archivedate=19 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Lack of needs analysis, business process re-engineering, interoperability across MMPs, and coping with new [[technology]] trends (such as mobile interfaces, [[cloud computing]], and [[digital signatures]]) were some of the limitations  of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csi-india.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=93dc78f8-cadb-45be-805c-bcc844db0738&amp;groupId=10616 Revisiting NeGP: eBharat2020:The proposed future NeGP 2.0 by CSR Prabhu in CSI Communications Oct 2011 (access date 5 Mar 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''non-stick surface''' is a surface engineered to reduce the ability of other materials to stick to it. Non-stick cookware is a common application, where the non-stick coating allows food to brown without sticking to the pan. Non-stick is often used to refer to surfaces coated with [[polytetrafluoroethylene|polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)]], a well-known brand of which is "[[Teflon]]." In the twenty-first century other coatings have been marketed as non-stick, such as  [[Anodizing#Anodized aluminium|anodized aluminium]], [[Ceramic materials|ceramics]], [[silicone]], [[Cast-iron cookware#Enameled cast iron|enameled cast iron]], and [[Seasoning (cookware)|seasoned cookware]]. [[Superhydrophobic coating]] is the newest non-stick coating for sale.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
The [[Mycenaeans|Mycenaean Greeks]] might have used non-stick pans to make bread more than 3,000 years ago. Mycenaean ceramic griddles had one smooth side and one side covered with tiny holes. The bread was probably placed on the side with the holes, since the dough tended to stick when cooked on the smooth side of the pan. The holes seem to be an ancient non-sticking technology, ensuring that oil spread evenly over the griddle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/42414-ancient-cooking-mycenaeans-portable-grills.html Ancient Greeks Used Portable Grills at Their Picnics], LiveScience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/news/1707-140109-mycenaean-souvlaki-tray How to Cook Like a Mycenaean], Archaeology Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern development===
The modern non-stick pans were made using a coating of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE). PTFE was invented [[Serendipity|serendipitously]] by [[Roy Plunkett]] in 1938,&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web| title= Roy J. Plunkett |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/roy-j-plunkett|website= [[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Roy J. Plunkett |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/plunkett-roy-j|website= [[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working for a joint venture of the [[DuPont]] company. The substance was found to have several unique properties, including very good corrosion-resistance and the lowest coefficient of friction of any substance yet manufactured. PTFE was first used to make seals resistant to the [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas used in development of the [[atomic bomb]] during [[World War II]], and was regarded as a military secret. Dupont registered the Teflon trademark in 1944 and soon began planning for post-war commercial use of the new product.&lt;ref name="IandTmag"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Invention and Technology Magazine]]|author=Anne Cooper Funderburg|title=Making Teflon Stick|series=Summer 2000|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/making-teflon-stick-1|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1951 Dupont had developed applications for Teflon in commercial bread and cookie-making; however, the company avoided the market for consumer cookware due to potential problems associated with release of toxic gases if stove-top pans were overheated in inadequately ventilated spaces. While working at [[DuPont]], [[NYU Tandon School of Engineering]] alumnus John Gilbert was asked to evaluate a newly- developed material called Teflon. His experiments using the fluorinated polymer as a surface coating for pots and pans helped usher in a revolution in non-stick cookware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2011-07-teflon-super-durable-proteins.html|title=Inspired by teflon, researchers create super durable proteins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/spark451/docs/invention_brochure/6|title=Invention, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Begin at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, a French engineer had begun coating his fishing gear with Teflon to prevent tangles. His wife Colette suggested using the same method to coat her cooking pans. The idea was successful and a French patent was granted for the process in 1954. The [[Tefal]] company was formed in 1956 to manufacture non-stick pans.&lt;ref name="IandTmag" /&gt;

Not all non-stick pans use Teflon; other non-stick coatings have become available.  For example, a mixture of [[titanium]] and [[ceramic]] can be [[sandblasting|sandblasted]] onto the pan surface, and then [[pottery firing|fired]] at {{convert|2000|C|F}} to produce a non-stick ceramic coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|encyclopedia=A to Z of Inventions and Inventors: M to P|article=Non-stick pan|author=Pennie Stoyles and Peter Pentland|pages=17|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|year=2007|isbn=9781583407899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Fluoropolymers
** [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE)
** [[Silverstone (plastic)]], a three-layer coating using PTFE and PFA
* [[Superhydrophobic coating]]s are made from a variety of materials
* [[Liquid-impregnated surface]] such as [[LiquiGlide]]

==PTFE (Teflon)==
[[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE) is a synthetic [[fluoropolymer]] used in various applications including non-stick coatings. Teflon is a brand of PTFE, often used as a generic term for PTFE. The metallic substrate is roughened by [[abrasive blasting]], then sometimes [[Thermal spraying|electric-arc sprayed]] with [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Wall, {{patent|US|5069937|"Thermal spraying of stainless steel"}}, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence W. McKeen, ''Fluorinated coatings and finishes handbook'', 2006, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The irregular surface promotes adhesion of the PTFE and also resists abrasion of the PTFE.&lt;ref&gt;Excalibur brochure, [http://www.whitfordww.com/pdf/literature/Excalibur_2011.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Then one to seven layers of PTFE are sprayed or rolled on, with a larger number of layers and spraying being better. The number and thickness of the layers and quality of the material determine the quality of the non-stick coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/326/Whats-In-Your-Non-Stick/print |title=Cooking For Engineers |newspaper=Cookingforengineers.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better-quality coatings are more durable, and less likely to peel and flake, and keep their non-stick properties for longer. Any PTFE-based coating will rapidly lose its non-stick properties if overheated; all manufacturers recommend that temperatures be kept below, typically, {{Convert|260|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chemours.com/Teflon/en_US/products/safety/cookware_safety.html |title=Cookware Safety by Teflon nonstick coatings |newspaper=Chemours Web site |date=  |author= |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utensils used with PTFE-coated pans can scratch the coating, if the utensils are harder than the coating; this can be prevented by using non-metallic (usually plastic or wood) cooking tools.

=== Health concerns ===
When pans are overheated beyond approximately 350&amp;nbsp;°C (660&amp;nbsp;°F) the PTFE coating begins to dissociate, releasing byproducts (PFOA) which can cause [[polymer fume fever]] in humans and can be lethal to birds. Concerns have been raised over the possible negative effects of using PTFE-coated cooking pans.&lt;ref name="IandTmag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teflon.com/Teflon/teflonissafe/keyquestions.html#q2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117234907/http://www.teflon.com/Teflon/teflonissafe/keyquestions.html#q2 |archivedate=2008-01-17 |title=Safety of Teflon Non-Stick Coatings for Cookware|publisher=[[DuPont]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/toxicteflon|author=Jane Houlihan|title=EWG finds heated Teflon pans can turn toxic faster than DuPont claims |publisher=[[Environmental Working Group|EWG]]|accessdate=2009-05-06|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Cancer Society, [http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid--pfoa Teflon and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tugend|first=Alina|title=Teflon Is Great for Politicians, but Is It Safe for Regular People?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/14/business/14shortcuts.html?ref=teflon&amp;_r=0|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processing of PTFE in the past used to include [[Perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA) as an emulsifier; however, PFOA is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] and poses both environmental and [[PFOA#Health concerns|health concerns]], and is now being phased out of use in PTFE processing.&lt;ref&gt;Juliet Eilperin: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/25/AR2006012502041.html ''Harmful Teflon Chemical To Be Eliminated by 2015'']. The Washington Post, 2006-01-26&lt;/ref&gt;

PTFE flakes that come off PTFE cookware poses no danger when ingested. This is because PTFE flakes are inert so they will travel through the body without being absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/research/healthy-home-tips/tip-6-skip-non-stick-avoid-dangers-teflon#.WcE6GriyNkg|title=EWG's Healthy Home Tips: Tip 6 - Skip the non-stick to avoid the dangers of Teflon|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318100023/http://www.ewg.org/research/healthy-home-tips/tip-6-skip-non-stick-avoid-dangers-teflon|archivedate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culinary uses and limitations ==
With other types of pans, some [[Cooking oil|oil]] or fat is required to prevent hot food from sticking to the pan's surface. Food does not have the same tendency to stick to a non-stick surface; pans can be used with less, or no, oil, and are easier to clean, as residues do not stick to the surface.

According to writer Tony Polombo, pans that are not non-stick are better for producing pan gravy, because the [[fond]] (the caramelized drippings that stick to the pan when meat is cooked) sticks to them, and can be turned into pan gravy by [[deglazing (cooking)|deglazing]] them&amp;mdash;dissolving them in liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cooking|chapter=Pots and Pans|author=Tony Polombo|pages=20|publisher=iUniverse|year=2006|isbn=9780595378661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following article details governmental and other organizations from around the world who are in the process of evaluating the suitability of using ([[Adoption (software implementation)|adopting]]) [[OpenDocument]], an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging office documents that may be edited.

== Overview ==
[[File:OpenDocument adoption world map.svg|thumb|400px|right|World map of countries, using the OpenDocument standard {{legend|#28ae28|Officially approved}}{{legend|#4223ad|Mandatory standard (NATO)}}]]

The OpenDocument format ([[ODF]]) was accepted as a standard by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] in May 2005, and by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in November 2006, as standard ISO/IEC 26300:2006.

Microsoft submitted another format, Office Open XML (aka [[OOXML]]), to [[Ecma International]] where it was accepted as a standard in December 2006. The Office Open XML specification was published as standard ISO/IEC 29500:2008 in November 2008.

OpenDocument has been officially approved by national standards bodies of Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, Ecuador, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odfalliance.org/press/Newsletter20090921.pdf ODF Alliance Newsletter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612231044/http://www.odfalliance.org/press/Newsletter20090921.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[NATO]]''' with its 28 members (Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the USA) uses ODF as a mandatory standard for all members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nhqc3s.hq.nato.int/Apps/Architecture/NISP/volume3/apds05.html|title=D.5. User Facing Capabilities|author=Interoperability Capability Team (IP CaT)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== South Africa ===
On October 23, 2007, the Department of Public Service and Administration of the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] released [http://www.oss.gov.za/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Downloads&amp;file=index&amp;req=getit&amp;lid=13 a report on interoperability standards]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in government information systems.  It specifies ODF as the standard for "working office document formats" (with UTF-8/ASCII text and comma-separated values data as the only alternatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url=http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?src=rss&amp;id=1838

 |archivedate=2007-10-27 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2008 ODF is a national standard too, not only the standard to be used by government departments. South African code for the ODF standard is "SANS 26300:2008/ISO/IEC 26300:2006".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sabs.co.za/Business_Units/Standards_SA/WebStore/search/detail.aspx?id=18646&amp;lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2008 all departments will be able to read and write in the Open Document Format. In 2009, ODF will become the default document format for South African government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tectonic.co.za/?p=2365|title=South Africa adopts ODF as a national standard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

every year recommending file formats for various tasks.  In their latest version they recommend the use of Microsoft Office '97 or OpenOffice.org v2.0 (based on OpenDocument 1.0) file formats for collaborative editing of text documents, spreadsheets and slideshow presentations.

=== India ===
Chandershekhar, [[India]]'s secretary of [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Ministry of Information and Technology]],  said, "We are glad to note that with formation of a National ODF alliance, India too would be playing a pivotal role in spearheading the ODF revolution. Further, considering the huge potential of eGovernance in the nation as well as the need to adopt open standards to make our data systems more inter-operable and independent of any limiting proprietary tools, we feel that ODF is a great technological leap and a big boon to further propel IT right to India's grass root levels. I congratulate this initiative of leading private &amp; public organisations and wish them all the best in this endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle1.asp?artid=85632] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627053226/http://www.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle1.asp?artid=85632 |date=June 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allahabad High Court of India has decided, as policy, to use OpenDocument format for its documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yksingh.blogspot.com/2006/06/open-document-format.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112085507/http://yksingh.blogspot.com/2006/06/open-document-format.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government agencies are required to:
* Use ODF
* Transition to open-source operating systems

====Kerala====

In 2007 Kerala released an Information Technology Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} &lt;/ref&gt;
designed to turn Kerala into a knowledge society.

They decided that open standards such as ODF would be followed in e-governance projects to avoid proprietary lock in.

=== Japan ===
On June 29, 2007, the government of [[Japan]] published a new interoperability framework which gives preference to the procurement of products that follow open standards including the ODF standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} &lt;/ref&gt; On July 2 the government declared that they wouldn't stop from adopting alternative document formats, because they hold the view that formats like [[Office Open XML]] which other organizations such as [[Ecma International]] and ISO had also approved was, according to them, an open standard, too. Also, they said that it was one of the preferences, whether the format is open, to choose which software the government shall deploy.

Government ministries and agencies are required to:
* Solicit bids from software vendors whose products support internationally recognized open standards

Open formats:
* Are to be preferred, and
* Must be used to promote exchange of information between ministries

Japan's Diet passed an open standards software incentive as part of its omnibus Special Taxation Measures law:
* Provides tax reductions for companies which buy open-standard based software
* Went into effect April 2008 and expires in March 2011.

=== Malaysia ===
In August 2007, The Malaysian government announced plans to adopt open standards and the Open Document Format (ODF) within the country's public sector. The Malaysian Administration Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU) issued a tender for a nine-month study to evaluate the usage of open standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

From April 2008 on the use of ODF is mandatory within the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2008/03/mampu-migrates.html Open Malaysia: MAMPU migrates to OpenOffice.org and ODF to increase freedom of choice and interoperability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323235203/http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2008/03/mampu-migrates.html |date=2008-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===
South Korean government adopted OpenDocument as a part of [[Korean Industrial Standards]] KS X ISO/IEC 26300 in 2007, but public documents are still made and distributed in [[Hangul (word processor)|.hwp]] format. There is no regulation of legislation about OpenDocument since 2007.

===Taiwan===
Already in 2009 ODF was chosen as official standard. But only from 2014 large scale migrations to ODF (and because of freedom of choice that brought) to LibreOffice started.

==Europe==

The [[European Commission]] has, since at least 2003, been investigating various options for storing documents in an XML-based format, commissioning technical studies such as the "Valoris Report".&lt;ref&gt;Valoris (2004). [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=17982 Comparative Assessment of Open Documents Formats Market Overview] aka the "Valoris Report". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927193137/http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=17982 |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, the Telematics between Administrations Committee (TAC) asked an OpenOffice team and a Microsoft team to present on the relative merits of their XML-based office document formats.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Tim. (September 24–26, 2004) [http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC SmartEC] (Accessed on October 17, 2005. (Discussing Open Office XML ISO Certification).)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, TAC issued a set of recommendations, in particular noting that, "Because of its specific role in society, the public sector must avoid &lt;nowiki&gt;[a situation where]&lt;/nowiki&gt; a specific product is forced on anyone interacting with it electronically. Conversely, any document format that does not discriminate against market actors and that can be implemented across platforms should be encouraged. Likewise, the public sector should avoid any format that does not safeguard equal opportunities to market actors to implement format-processing applications, especially where this might impose product selection on the side of citizens or businesses. In this respect standardisation initiatives will ensure not only a fair and competitive market but will also help safeguard the interoperability of implementing solutions whilst preserving competition and innovation." It then issued recommendations, including:
* Industry actors not currently involved with the OASIS Open Document Format consider participating in the standardisation process in order to encourage a wider industry consensus around the format;
* Microsoft considers issuing a public commitment to publish and provide non-discriminatory access to future versions of its WordML specifications;
* Microsoft should consider the merits of submitting XML formats to an international standards body of their choice;
* Industry is encouraged to provide filters that allow documents based on the WordML specifications and the emerging OASIS Open Document Format to be read and written to other applications whilst maintaining a maximum degree of faithfulness to content, structure and presentation. These filters should be made available for all products;
* The public sector is encouraged to provide its information through several formats. Where by choice or circumstance only a single revisable document format can be used this should be for a format around which there is industry consensus, as demonstrated by the format's adoption as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;Telematics between Administrations Committee (TAC). (May 25, 2004) [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/2592/5588 TAC Approval on Conclusions and Recommendations on Open Document Formats]. (Accessed on October 17, 2005.) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161429/http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/2592/5588 |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official recommendation for a certain format was not issued however.

===Belgium===
A memorandum on the use of open standards for creating and exchanging office documents was approved by [[Belgian federal government|Belgium's federal Council of Ministers]] on June 23, 2006. OpenDocument was proposed as the standard for exchanging office documents such as texts, spreadsheets, presentations within the federal civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Belgium's federal Council of Ministers. (2006) [http://presscenter.org/fr/node/47487?lang=en Open standards: Belgium's federal Council of Ministers approves ODF (Open Document Format)]. (Accessed on December 6, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2007, every federal government department has to be able to accept and read OpenDocument documents.&lt;ref&gt;Techworld. (2006) [http://www.techworld.com/applications/news/index.cfm?newsID=6335&amp;pagtype=all Belgium adopts OpenDocument]. (Accessed on December 6, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Government agencies are required to:
* Make each government form posted on a public Web site “accessible in a way that makes it legible in accessible freeware applications”
* Options for meeting this requirement:
** ODF
** PDF
** HTML

Until then Government agencies are required to:
* Accept ODF and OOXML “data-processing documents” created by the public, businesses, and other governmental units

Government entities are permitted to:
* Refrain from implementing the new OOXML and ODF standard if doing so would incur “additional costs or inconveniences” or raise “IT security concerns”

=== Finland ===

Finland's Ministry of Justice has chosen OpenOffice.org and thus the OpenDocument format as their main document format from the beginning of 2007. The decision was made after deep research of ODF possibilities. Other ministries may follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.om.fi/ Oikeusministeriö - Justitieministeriet - Etusivu]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to French government's RGI (general interoperability framework), ODF is the "recommended format for office documents within French administrations".  OOXML is tolerated for "information exchange needs through tables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.april.org/en/french-government-it-directorate-stands-its-ground-odf-supported-ooxml-rejected|title=French Government IT directorate stands its ground : ODF supported, OOXML rejected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government agencies are required to:
* Accept documents submitted in [[XML]] formats: ODF format as like OOxml format (both are in "Observations")
* Use [[PDF/A]] to preserve text documents

Government agencies are encouraged to:
* Install OpenOffice.org (an open-source, ODF-based productivity suite)
* Use ODF to create text documents, spreadsheets, and slideshow-style presentations

Government agencies are prohibited from:
* Migrating to any productivity suite formats other than ODF {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Germany ===

A large number of [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]], state and goverenmental offices and cities widely use products that support ODF (e.g. StarOffice, OpenOffice.org).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Despite the heated discussions about adopting Free Software and Open Standards in [[Romania]]n public administration - especially at [http://www.eliberatica.ro/2009/index eLiberatica 2009] - the Romanian [http://www.mcsi.ro/ Ministry for Communications and Information Society] passed no '''official''' bill to enforce the use of Open Standards, particularly [[OpenDocument]]. In June 2009, the ministry Gabriel Sandu declared, in an interview to [http://www.zf.ro/ Ziarul Financiar], that „we cannot give up Microsoft licenses overnight”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zf.ro/business-hi-tech/ministrul-comunicatiilor-gabriel-sandu-spune-ca-statul-nu-poate-renunta-peste-noapte-la-microsoft-4550649/|title=Ministrul Comunicatiilor, Gabriel Sandu spune ca statul nu poate renunta peste noapte la Microsoft|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the harsh critics from the large national Free Software community and a few '''important''' local IT businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zf.ro/zf-english/omnilogic-government-should-work-with-open-source-applications-not-pay-millions-of-euros-for-licences-4478884/|title=Omnilogic: Government should work with open source applications, not pay millions of euros for licences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[OpenDocument]] format and [[OpenDocument software|OpenDocument-capable software]] are widely used, not only by enthusiasts, but by businesses as well, including large parts of the Romanian government agencies, mayoralties, courts, notaries, insurance firms, accountants, engineers, etc. A (grossly incomplete) list of implementations, including Romania, is maintained here [http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Major_OpenOffice.org_Deployments#Europe]

===Serbia===
Government administration is required to:
* Use the ISO 19005 - Electronic document file format for long-term preservation (PDF/A format) for official electronic documents.
* For drafts, proposals and templates one of the following format should be used:
** ISO 26300 - Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0
** ISO 29500 - Office Open XML File Formats

If any other specialized file format is used for technical reasons, all parties in the document exchange must agree that  there is a technical interoperability for using that file format.

[[BECTA]] (British Education Communication Technology Agency) is the UK agency in charge of defining information technology (IT) policy for all schools in the United Kingdom, including standards for all the schools' infrastructure. In 2005 they published a comprehensive document describing the policy for infrastructure in schools.

This document highly recommends the use of OpenDocument and a few other formats for office document data. BECTA explains this as follows: "Any office application used by institutions must be able to be saved to (and so viewed by others) using a commonly agreed format that ensures an institution is not locked into using specific software. The main aim is for all office based applications to provide functionality to meet the specifications described here (whether licensed software, open source or unlicensed freeware) and thus many application providers could supply the educational institution ICT market.".

As stated in version v3.0 of 2007: "Preferred adoption of Open Formats: e-PING defines that, whenever possible, open standards will be used in technical specifications. "Proprietary standards" will be accepted, in this transition period, with the perspective of replacement as soon as there are conditions for a complete migration. With no loss to these goals, are to be respected those situations when there is the need to consider security requisites and information integrity. When available, Free Software solutions are to be considered preferential, accordingly with the policy defined by the Comitê Executivo de Governo Eletrônico (CEGE)"

Since April 2008 ODF is a national standard in Brazil, coded as NBRISO/IEC26300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abntnet.com.br/fidetail.aspx?FonteID=40911 NBR ISO/IEC 26300] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615121400/https://www.abntnet.com.br/fidetail.aspx?FonteID=40911 |date=June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010 version, the transition period has officially ended, and proprietary document formats may no longer be used in the federal public administration, although in practice this is not the case in many federal agencies and departments.

====Massachusetts====
{{update|type=section|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- The MS Office stuff in particular --&gt;
The [[United States]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Massachusetts]] has been examining its options for implementing [[XML]]-based document processing. In early 2005, [[Eric Kriss]], Secretary of Administration and Finance in [[Massachusetts]], was the first [[government]] official in the [[United States]] to publicly connect open formats to a public policy purpose: "It is an overriding imperative of the American [[democratic system]] that we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eoaf/open_formats_comments.html|title=Executive Office of Administration &amp; Finance - Mass.Gov|author=anf|work=Administration and Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a September 16, 2005 meeting with the [http://www.masoftware.org/ Mass Technology Leadership Council] Kriss stated that he believes this is fundamentally an issue of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danbricklin.com/log/2005_09_07.htm#meetingphotos|title=Starting September 7, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While supporting the principle of private intellectual property rights, he said sovereignty trumped any private company's attempt to control the state's public records through claims of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaregarden.com/cgi-bin/oss-sig/wiki.pl?OpenFormatMeetingSept2005|title=MTLC Open Source SIG Wiki: OpenFormatMeetingSept2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in September 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to formally endorse [[OpenDocument]] formats for its public records and, at the same time, reject [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] new [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] format, now standardized as ISO/IEC 29500:2008 — [[Office Open XML]].  This decision was made after a two-year examination of file formats, including many discussions with Microsoft, other vendors, and various experts, plus some limited trial programs in individual communities like [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] and [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]]. [[Microsoft Office]], which has a nearly 100% market share among the state's employees, did not support OpenDocument formats until Service Pack 2 of Office 2007. Microsoft had indicated that OpenDocument formats will not be supported in new versions of Office, even though they support many other formats (including [[ASCII]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], and [[WordPerfect]]), and analysts believe it would be easy for Microsoft to implement the standard.  If Microsoft chooses not to implement OpenDocument, Microsoft will disqualify themselves from future consideration.  Several analysts (such as Ovum) believe that Microsoft will eventually support OpenDocument.  On 6 July 2006 Microsoft announced that they would support the OpenDocument format and create a plugin to allow Office to save to ODF.

After this announcement by Massachusetts supporting OpenDocument, a large number of people and organizations spoke up about the policy, both pro and con (see the references section).  [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Corel]], [[IBM]], and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] all sent letters to Massachusetts supporting the measure.  In contrast, Microsoft sent in a letter highly critical of the measure.  A group named "[[Citizens Against Government Waste]]" (CAGW) also opposed the decision. The group claimed that Massachusetts' policy established "an arbitrary preference for open source," though both open source software and proprietary software can implement the specification, and both kinds of developers were involved in creating the standard (CAGW, 2005). However, [[InternetNews]] and [[Linux Weekly News]] noted that CAGW has received funding from Microsoft, and that in 2001 CAGW was caught running an [[astroturfing]] campaign on behalf of Microsoft when two letters they submitted supporting Microsoft in Microsoft's anti-trust case were found to have the signatures of deceased persons (Linux Weekly News). [[James Prendergast (executive)|James Prendergast]], executive director of a coalition named "[[Americans for Technology Leadership]]" (ATL), also criticized the state's decision in a [[Fox News]] article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,170724,00.html|title=Massachusetts Should Close Down OpenDocument|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Prendergast failed to disclose that Microsoft is a founding member of ATL. Fox News later published a follow-up article disclosing that fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,172063,00.html FOX News, 2005]; Jones, September 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State Senator]] [[Marc R. Pacheco]] and [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|State Secretary]] [[William F. Galvin]] have expressed reservations about  this plan. Pacheco held a hearing on October 31, 2005, on the topic of OpenDocument.  Pacheco did not want OpenDocument to be declared as the executive branch standard, primarily on procedural grounds.  Pacheco believed that the [[executive branch]] had to receive permission to set an executive standard from the multi-branch IT Advisory Board. In contrast, The Massachusetts Information Technology Division (ITD), and its general council, believe the Advisory board's role is to advise ITD, and ITD did discuss the issue with the IT Advisory Board, but ITD's Peter Quinn and Linda Hamel (ITD's General Counsel) asserted that there is no requirement that "ITD approach the Advisory Board for permission to adopt policies that will impact only the Executive Department." Hamel later filed a legal briefing justifying ITD's position (Hamel, 2005). Massachusetts' [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Court]] has ruled that the various branches of government are prohibited from mandating IT standards on each other; this ruling appears to support ITD's claim.  Pacheco also did not like the process used to select OpenDocument. However, Pacheco appears to have had many fundamental
misunderstandings of the issues. Andy Updegrove said that at the time, "Senator Pacheco doesn't understand the difference between open source and open standards (and certainly doesn't understand the difference between OpenDocument and OpenOffice). More than once, he indicated that he thought that the policy would require the Executive Agencies to use OpenOffice.org, not realizing that there are other compliant alternatives. He also thought that this would act to the detriment of Massachusetts software vendors, who (he thinks) would be excluded from doing business with the Commonwealth." Pacheco also thought that OpenOffice.org was under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], but in fact it is released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] (Jones, October 31, 2005) (Jones, November 14, 2005).  He attempted to halt implementation of OpenDocument in the executive branch via an amendment (to S. 2256), but the amended bill was never sent to the [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]].

Since then in 2007 Massachusetts has [https://web.archive.org/web/20100621051826/http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=afterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Research+%26+Technology&amp;L2=Information+Technology+Services+%26+Support&amp;L3=Application+Services&amp;L4=Open+Initiatives&amp;sid=Eoaf&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=itd_services_application_open_initiatives_odf_open_xml&amp;csid=Eoaf amended] its approved technical standards list to include [[Office Open XML]].

====Other states and organizations in the US====
In November 2005, James Gallt, associate director for the National Association of State Chief Information Officers, said that a number of other state agencies are also exploring the use of OpenDocument (LaMonica, November 10, 2005).

In April 2006, a bill was introduced in the Minnesota state legislature to require all state agencies to use open data formats. It is expected that the OpenDocument Format will be advanced as a way of meeting the proposed requirement. (Gardner, April 7, 2006).

In late 2007 and early 2008, New York State issued [https://web.archive.org/web/20080210050433/http://www.oft.state.ny.us/oftnews/erecords-study.htm a Request for Public Comment concerning electronic records policy].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12421">A '''plate heat exchanger''' is a  type of [[heat exchanger]] that uses [[metal]] plates to transfer [[heat]] between two [[fluid]]s. This has a major advantage over a conventional heat exchanger in that the fluids are exposed to a much larger [[surface area]] because the fluids are spread out over the plates. This facilitates the transfer of heat, and greatly increases the speed of the [[temperature]] change. Plate heat exchangers are now common and very small [[braze]]d versions are used in the hot-water sections of millions of [[Water heating#Tankless heaters|combination boilers]].  The high heat transfer efficiency for such a small physical size has increased the domestic hot water (DHW) flowrate of combination boilers.  The small plate heat exchanger has made a great impact in domestic heating and hot-water.  Larger commercial versions use [[gaskets]] between the plates, whereas smaller versions tend to be brazed.

The concept behind a heat exchanger is the use of pipes or other containment vessels to heat or cool one fluid by transferring heat between it and another fluid. In most cases, the exchanger consists of a coiled pipe containing one fluid that passes through a chamber containing another fluid. The walls of the pipe are usually made of [[metal]], or another substance with a high [[thermal conductivity]], to facilitate the interchange, whereas the outer casing of the larger chamber is made of a [[plastic]] or coated with [[thermal insulation]], to discourage heat from escaping from the exchanger.

The plate heat exchanger (PHE) was invented by Dr Richard Seligman in 1923 and revolutionised methods of indirect heating and cooling of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plate Heat exchangers|url=http://www.gold-bar.co.il/new/products/heat-exchangers/plate-heat-exchangers/|website=Gold-Bar Engineering ltd.|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Richard Seligman founded [[APV plc|APV]] in 1910 as the Aluminium Plant &amp; Vessel Company Limited, a specialist fabricating firm supplying welded vessels to the brewery and vegetable oil trades.

== Design of plate and frame heat exchangers ==

[[File:Plate frame 1.svg|thumb|right|Schematic conceptual diagram of a plate and frame heat exchanger.]]
[[File:Plate frame 2.png|thumb|right|An individual plate for a heat exchanger]]

The plate heat exchanger (PHE) is a specialized design well suited to transferring heat between medium- and low-pressure fluids. Welded, semi-welded and brazed heat exchangers are used for heat exchange between high-pressure fluids or where a more compact product is required. In place of a pipe passing through a chamber, there are instead two alternating chambers, usually thin in depth, separated at their largest surface by a corrugated metal plate. The plates used in a plate and frame heat exchanger are obtained by one piece pressing of metal plates. Stainless steel is a commonly used metal for the plates because of its ability to withstand high temperatures, its strength, and its corrosion resistance.

The plates are often spaced by rubber sealing gaskets which are cemented into a section around the edge of the plates. The plates are pressed to form troughs at right angles to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. These troughs are arranged so that they interlink with the other plates which forms the channel with gaps of 1.3–1.5&amp;nbsp;mm between the plates. The plates are compressed together in a rigid frame to form an arrangement of parallel flow channels with alternating hot and cold fluids. The plates produce an extremely large surface area, which allows for the fastest possible transfer. Making each chamber thin ensures that the majority of the volume of the liquid contacts the plate, again aiding exchange. The troughs also create and maintain a turbulent flow in the liquid to maximize heat transfer in the exchanger. A high degree of turbulence can be obtained at low flow rates and high heat transfer coefficient can then be achieved.

As compared to shell and tube heat exchangers, the [[temperature]] approach in a plate heat exchangers may be as low as 1&amp;nbsp;°C whereas shell and tube heat exchangers require an approach of 5&amp;nbsp;°C or more. For the same amount of heat exchanged, the size of the plate heat exchanger is smaller, because of the large heat transfer area afforded by the plates (the large area through which heat can travel). Increase and reduction of the heat transfer area is simple in a plate heat-exchanger, through the addition or removal of plates from the stack.

== Evaluating plate heat exchangers ==
[[File:Plate heat exchanger - dismantled pic02.jpg|thumb|Partially dismantled exchanger, with visible plates and gaskets]]
All plate heat exchangers look similar on the outside. The difference lies on the inside, in the details of the plate design and the sealing technologies used. Hence, when evaluating a plate heat exchanger, it is very important not only to explore the details of the product being supplied but also to analyze the level of research and development carried out by the manufacturer and the post-commissioning service and spare parts availability.

An important aspect to take into account when evaluating a heat exchanger are the forms of corrugation within the heat exchanger. There are two types: intermating and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] corrugations. In general, greater heat transfer enhancement is produced from chevrons for a given increase in pressure drop and are more commonly used than intermating corrugations.&lt;ref name=Hewitt&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=G|title=Process Heat Transfer|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optimization of Plate Heat Exchangers ==

To achieve improvement in PHE's, two important factors namely amount of heat transfer and pressure drop have to be considered such that amount of heat transfer needs to be increased and pressure drops need to be decreased. In plate heat exchangers due to presence of corrugated plate, there is a significant resistance to flow with high friction loss. Thus to design plate heat exchangers, one should consider both factors.
For various range of Reynolds numbers, many correlations and chevron angles for plate heat exchangers exist. The plate geometry is one of the most important factor in heat transfer and pressure drop in plate heat exchangers, however such  a feature is not accurately prescribed. In the corrugated plate heat exchangers, because of narrow path between the plates, there is a large pressure capacity and the flow becomes turbulent along the path. Therefore, it requires more pumping power than the other types of heat exchangers. Therefore, higher heat transfer and less pressure drop are targeted. The shape of plate heat exchanger is very important for industrial applications that are affected by pressure drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanei|first1=Hamed|date=2016|title=Numerical Investigation On The Effect Of Geometrical Shape Of Plate Heat Exchangers On Heat Transfer Efficiency|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324026378_Numerical_Investigation_of_the_Effect_of_Geometrical_Shape_of_Plate_Heat_Exchangers_on_Heat_Transfer_Efficiency|journal=International jurnal of Mechanical, Aerospace, Industrial, Mechatoronic and manufacturing Engineering|volume=10|pages=798–802|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flow distribution and heat transfer equation ==

Design calculations of a plate heat exchanger include flow distribution and pressure drop and heat transfer. The former is an issue of [[Flow distribution in manifolds]].&lt;ref name=Wang2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=J.Y.|title=Theory of flow distribution in manifolds|journal=Chemical Engineering J|year=2011|volume=168|issue=3|pages=1331–1345|doi=10.1016/j.cej.2011.02.050|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.02.050}}&lt;/ref&gt; A layout configuration of plate heat exchanger can
be usually simplified into a manifold system with two manifold
headers for dividing and combining fluids, which can be
categorized into U-type and Z-type arrangement according to
flow direction in the headers, as shown in manifold arrangement. Bassiouny and Martin developed the previous theory of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bassiouny|first=M.K.|author2=Martin, H. |title=Flow distribution and pressure drop in plate heat exchanges.

The total rate of heat transfer between the hot and cold fluids passing through a plate heat exchanger may be expressed as:
Q = UA∆Tm
where U is the [[Heat transfer coefficient#Overall heat transfer coefficient|Overall heat transfer coefficient]], A is the total plate area, and ∆Tm is the [[Log mean temperature difference]]. U is dependent upon the heat transfer coefficients in the hot and cold streams.&lt;ref name=Hewitt /&gt;

[[File:Wabenplisee.jpg|thumb|upright|Honeycomb pleated blind]]

'''Pleated blinds''' are [[Window blind|shades]] made from a [[pleat]]ed fabric (which helps to add texture to a room) that pull up to sit flat at the top of a window to hide from sight when open.

[[Hexagonal lattice|Honeycomb]] pleated blinds, or '''cellular blinds''' (actually [[cellular shades]]) are similar to pleated blinds except that they are made up of two or more layers joined at the pleats to form 'cellular' compartments that trap air, providing insulation.  Due to their cellular construction, cellular blinds (aka energy saver) are known to the energy conscious as one of the highest energy-efficient and sound-absorbent blinds of any window treatment.  For greater insulation, cellular blinds are available in a variety of cell sizes, including {{cvt|3/8|in|-1}} single cell, {{cvt|3/4|in|-1}} single cell, {{cvt|3/8|in|-1}} double cell and even triple cell.  The more cells, the greater energy efficiency.

One disadvantage with these cellular pleated blinds is that small insects crawl into the hollow chambers and die. Removing them is not easy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

All of the above can also be motorized, which is a great option for safety in homes with children and/or pets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23085">A '''resonant-tunneling diode''' ('''RTD''') is a [[diode]] with a resonant-tunneling structure in which electrons can tunnel through some [[resonance (particle physics)|resonant]] states at certain energy levels. The [[current–voltage characteristic]] often exhibits [[Negative resistance|negative differential resistance]] regions.

All types of [[tunneling diode]]s make use of [[quantum mechanical tunneling]].
Characteristic to the current–voltage relationship of a tunneling diode is the presence of one or more negative differential resistance regions, which enables many unique applications. Tunneling diodes can be very compact and are also capable of ultra-high-speed operation because the quantum tunneling effect through the very thin layers is a very fast process.

==Introduction==
[[File:Rtd seq v3.gif|thumb|350px|right|A working mechanism of a resonant tunneling diode device and negative differential resistance in output characteristic. There is a negative resistance characteristic after the first current peak, due to a reduction of the first energy level below the source Fermi level with gate bias. (Left: [[band diagram]]; Center: [[transmission coefficient]]; Right: current–voltage characteristics). The negative resistance behavior shown in right figure is caused by relative position of confined state to source [[Fermi level]] and [[bandgap]].]]
An RTD can be fabricated using many different types of materials (such as III–V, type IV, II–VI semiconductor) and different types of resonant tunneling structures, such as the heavily doped p–n junction in [[Esaki diode]]s, double barrier, triple barrier, [[quantum well]], or [[quantum wire]]. The structure and fabrication process of Si/SiGe resonant interband tunneling diodes are suitable for integration with modern Si complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor ([[CMOS]]) and [[Silicon|Si]]/[[SiGe]] heterojunction bipolar technology.

One type of RTDs is formed as a single [[quantum well]] structure surrounded by very thin layer barriers. This structure is called a double barrier structure. Carriers such as electrons and holes can only have discrete energy values inside the quantum well.  When a voltage is placed across an RTD, a [[terahertz wave]] is emitted, which is why the energy value inside the quantum well is equal to that of the emitter side. As voltage is increased, the terahertz wave dies out because the energy value in the quantum well is outside the emitter side energy.

Another feature seen in RTD structures is the [[negative resistance]] on application of bias as can be  seen in the image generated from [[Nanohub]]. The forming of negative resistance will be examined in detail in operation section below.

This structure can be grown by molecular beam [[heteroepitaxy]]. [[GaAs]] and [[AlAs]] in particular are used to form this structure. AlAs/[[InGaAs]] or [[InAlAs]]/InGaAs can be used.

The operation of electronic circuits containing RTDs can be described by a [[Liénard system]] of equations, which are a generalization of the [[Van der Pol oscillator]] equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JQE.2008.2000924|title=A Li&amp;#x00C9;nard Oscillator Resonant Tunnelling Diode-Laser Diode Hybrid Integrated Circuit: Model and Experiment|year=2008|last1=Slight|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Romeira|first2=Bruno|last3=Wang|first3=Liquan|last4=Figueiredo|first4=JosÉ M.

==Operation==
The following process is also illustrated from rightside figure. Depending on the number of barriers and number of confined states inside the well, the process described below could be repeated.

===Positive resistance region===
For low bias, as the bias increase, the 1st confined state between the potential barriers is getting closer to the source [[Fermi level]], so the current it carries increases.

===Negative resistance region===
As bias increases further, the 1st confined state becomes lower in energy and gradually goes into the energy range of bandgap, so the current it carries decreases. At this time, the 2nd confined state is still too high above in energy to conduct significant current.

===2nd positive resistance region===
Similar to the first region, as the 2nd confined state becomes closer and closer to source Fermi level, it carries more current, causing the total current to increase again.

==Intraband resonant tunneling==
[[Image:double square barrier potential.png|thumb|300px|right|A double-barrier potential profile with a particle incident from left with energy less than the barrier height.]]
In [[quantum tunneling]] through a single barrier, the transmission coefficient, or the tunneling probability, is always less than one (for incoming particle energy less than the potential barrier height). Considering a potential profile which contains two barriers (which are located close to each other), one can calculate the transmission coefficient (as a function of the incoming particle energy) using any of the standard methods.

Tunneling through a double barrier was first solved in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation by David Bohm in 1951, who pointed out the resonances in the transmission coefficient occur at certain incident electron energies. It turns out that, for certain energies, the transmission coefficient is equal to one, i.e. the double barrier is totally transparent for particle transmission. This phenomenon is called resonant tunneling.&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, Quantum Theory, Prentice-Hall, New York, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting that while the transmission coefficient of a potential barrier is always lower than one (and decreases with increasing barrier height and width), two barriers in a row can be completely transparent for certain energies of the incident particle.

Later, in 1964, L. V. Iogansen discussed the possibility of resonant transmission of an electron through double barriers formed in semiconductor crystals.&lt;ref&gt;L. V. Iogansen, “The possibility of resonance transmission of electrons in crystals through a system of barriers,” Soviet Physics JETP, 1964, '''18''', pp.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Tsu, Esaki, and Chang computed the two terminal current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of a finite superlattice, and predicted that resonances could be observed not only in the transmission coefficient but also in the I-V characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1654509|title=Tunneling in a finite superlattice|year=1973|last1=Tsu|first1=R.|last2=Esaki|first2=L.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=22|issue=11|pages=562|bibcode=1973ApPhL..22..562T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resonant tunneling also occurs in potential profiles with more than two barriers. Advances in the MBE technique led to observation of negative differential conductance (NDC) at terahertz frequencies, as reported by Sollner et al. in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.94434|title=Resonant tunneling through quantum wells at frequencies up to 2.5 THz|year=1983|last1=Sollner|first1=T.

D.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=43|issue=6|pages=588|bibcode = 1983ApPhL..43..588S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered a considerable research effort to study tunneling through multi-barrier structures.

The potential profiles required for resonant tunneling can be realized
in semiconductor system using heterojunctions which utilize semiconductors
of different types to create potential barriers or wells in the conduction
band or the valence band.

===III-V resonant tunneling diodes===
Resonant tunneling diodes are typically realized in [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V compound material]] systems, where heterojunctions made up of various III-V compound semiconductors are used to create the double or multiple potential barriers in the conduction band or valence band. Reasonably high performance III-V resonant tunneling diodes have been realized. Such devices have not entered mainstream applications yet because the processing of III-V materials is incompatible with Si CMOS technology and the cost is high.

Most of semiconductor optoelectronics use III-V semiconductors and so it is possible to combine III-V RTDs to make OptoElectronic Integrated Circuits (OEICS) that use the negative differential resistance of the RTD to provide electrical gain for optoelectronic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JQE.2007.898847|title=Investigation Into the Integration of a Resonant Tunnelling Diode and an Optical Communications Laser: Model and Experiment|year=2007|last1=Slight|first1=T.J.|last2=Ironside|first2=C.N.|journal=IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics|volume=43|issue=7|pages=580|bibcode = 2007IJQE...43..580S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1049/el:20080350|title=Self-oscillation and period adding from resonant tunnelling diode–laser diode circuit|year=2008|last1=Figueiredo|first1=J.M.L.|last2=Romeira|first2=B.|last3=Slight|first3=T.J.|last4=Wang|first4=L.|last5=Wasige|first5=E.|last6=Ironside|first6=C.N.|journal=Electronics Letters|volume=44|issue=14|pages=876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the device to device variability in an RTDs current-voltage characteristic has been used as a way to uniquely identify electronic devices, in what is known as a [[types of physical unclonable function|quantum confinement physical unclonable function]] (QC-PUF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Using Quantum Confinement to Uniquely Identify Devices|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16456|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2015-11-10|volume = 5|doi = 10.1038/srep16456|language = en|first = J.|last = Roberts|first2 = I.

===Si/SiGe resonant tunneling diodes===
Resonant tunneling diodes can also be realized using the Si/SiGe materials system. Both hole tunneling and electron tunneling have been observed. However, the performance of Si/SiGe resonant tunneling diodes was limited due to the limited conduction band and valence band discontinuities between Si and SiGe alloys. Resonant tunneling of holes through Si/SiGe heterojunctions was attempted first because of the typically relatively larger valence band discontinuity in Si/SiGe heterojunctions than the conduction band discontinuity for (compressively) strained Si&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layers grown on Si substrates. Negative differential resistance was only observed at low temperatures but not at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.584811|title=Resonant tunneling of holes through silicon barriers|year=1990|last1=Gennser|first1=Ulf|last2=Kesan|first2=V.

==Interband resonant tunneling diodes==
Resonant interband tunneling diodes (RITDs) combine the structures and behaviors of both ''intraband'' resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) and conventional ''interband'' tunneling diodes, in which electronic transitions occur between the energy levels in the quantum wells in the conduction band and that in the valence band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.100926|title=Resonant interband tunnel diodes|year=1989|last1=Sweeny|first1=Mark|last2=Xu|first2=Jingming|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=54|issue=6|pages=546|bibcode = 1989ApPhL..54..546S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kwok K. Ng|title=Complete Guide to Semiconductor Devices|edition=2|publisher= Wiley-Interscience|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like resonant tunneling diodes, resonant interband tunneling diodes can be realized in both the III-V and Si/SiGe materials systems.

===III-V RITDs===
In the III-V materials system, InAlAs/InGaAs RITDs with peak-to-valley current ratios (PVCRs) higher than 70 and as high as 144 at room temperature and Sb-based RITDs with room temperature PVCR as high as 20 have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.103503|title=Double quantum well resonant tunneling diodes|year=1990|last1=Day|first1=D.

===Si/SiGe RITDs===

In [[Silicon|Si]]/[[SiGe]] materials system, Si/SiGe resonant interband tunneling diodes have also been developed which have the potential of being integrated into the mainstream Si integrated circuits technology.&lt;ref name=rommel&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.122419|title=Room temperature operation of epitaxially grown Si/Si[sub 0.5]Ge[sub 0.5]/Si resonant interband tunneling diodes|year=1998|last1=Rommel|first1=Sean L.|last2=Dillon|first2=Thomas E.|last3=Dashiell|first3=M.

====Structure====
The five key points to the design are:
(i) an [[Intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]] [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] barrier, 
(ii) [[Delta doping|delta-doped]] injectors, 
(iii) offset of the delta-doping planes from the [[heterojunction]] interfaces,
(iv) low temperature [[Molecular beam epitaxy|molecular beam epitaxial]] growth (LTMBE), and
(v) postgrowth [[rapid thermal anneal]]ing (RTA) for activation of dopants and reduction of density of point defects.&lt;ref name=rommel/&gt;

====Performance====
A minimum PVCR of about 3 is needed for typical circuit applications. Low current density Si/SiGe RITDs are suitable for low-power memory applications, and high current density tunnel diodes are needed for high-speed digital/mixed-signal applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">[[File:Rumford_oven.svg|thumb| Cross section of a Rumford furnace, with the fuel chamber at the left]]

A '''Rumford furnace''' is a [[kiln]] for the industrial scale production in the 19th century of [[calcium oxide]], popularly known as quicklime or burnt lime. It was named after its inventor, Benjamin Thompson, also known as [[Count Rumford]], and is sometimes called a [[Rüdersdorf]] furnace after the location where it was first built and from where the design rapidly spread throughout Europe.

==Technology==
Rumford’s innovation was to separate the combustion chambers for the limestone and the fuel. In previous designs, the fuel (traditionally wood or charcoal, later coal) was mixed with the limestone before burning, which meant that the quicklime end product was contaminated with ash and had to be laboriously cleaned. By separating the two it was possible to produce large quantities of high-quality quicklime for the booming 19th-century European construction industry. 

[[File:MP Rüdersdorf Rumfordofen 1.jpg|thumb| A Rumford furnace at the Rüdersdorf Museum Park near Berlin]]

In a Rumford furnace, fuel compartments surround the actual combustion chamber, each one being connected to it by a single transverse channel through which the hot air produced by the burning fuel flows into the stack and moves upward through the pile of limestone. The fuel ash waste falls into a separate chamber, from which it can be removed.
The limestone in the central shaft collapses as it burns to quicklime, making space for new limestone to be added to the top of the stack. The quicklime cools down as it slowly descends through the space below the channel connecting the stack to the firing compartment and is finally removed through an outlet at the bottom of the shaft. 
The upper part of the limestone shaft extends above the fuel compartments and its walls contain separate cavities filled with coal dust. This insulation supports the prewarming of the limestone before it moves into the vicinity of the hot air source.

==Historical development==
The first Rumford kiln was constructed in 1802&lt;ref&gt;750 Jahre Kalksteinbergbau in Rüdersdorf, Rüdersdorfer Zement GmbH, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; in Rüdersdorf near Berlin, and one of them can still be explored at the Museumspark Rüdersdorf. The innovation rapidly spread throughout Europe because it made it possible to produce quicklime far more efficiently than predecessor technologies. These required either batch production, waiting for each load to be assembled, burn and cool before removal, or carefully mixing the fuel and limestone in the appropriate proportions, burning them together, and then cleaning the contaminated limestone afterward.
In a Rumford kiln continuous operation was possible for the first time, since the addition of fuel and limestone as well as the removal of ash and quicklime could be separately optimized according to need, and all these operations could take place simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Vom Bergbau zu Industriereivier, Enzo Baraldi, Ekkehard Westermann, 1993, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer''', or SBUV/2, is a series of operational remote sensors on [[NOAA]] weather satellites in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]]s which have been providing global measurements of stratospheric total ozone, as well as ozone profiles, since March 1985. The SBUV/2 instruments were developed from the SBUV experiment&lt;ref name=SBUV-TOMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1978-098A-09|website=National Space Science Data Center|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; flown on the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus-7 spacecraft]] which improved on the design of the original BUV instrument on Nimbus-4.&lt;ref name=BUV&gt;{{cite web|title=Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) Spectrometer|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1970-025A-05|website=National Space Science Data Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[nadir]] viewing [[Radiometry|radiometric]] instruments operating at mid to [[near UV]] wavelengths. SBUV/2 data sets overlap with data from SBUV and [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer|TOMS]] instruments on the Nimbus-7 spacecraft. These extensive data sets (January 1979 to the present) measure the density and vertical distribution of ozone in the Earth’s [[atmosphere]] from six to 30 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

SBUV/2 looks down at the Earth’s atmosphere and the reflected sunlight at wavelengths characteristic of ozone. The SBUV/2 wavelength "channels" range from 252 nanometer (nm) to 340&amp;nbsp;nm. Ozone is measured as a ratio of sunlight incident on the atmosphere to the amount of sunlight scattered back into space. From this information, the total [[ozone]] between the instrument and the ground can be calculated.

The SBUV/2 measures solar irradiance and Earth radiance (backscattered solar energy) in the near ultraviolet spectrum (160 to 400&amp;nbsp;nm). The SBUV is capable of determining the global ozone concentration in the stratosphere to an absolute accuracy of 1 percent; the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone to an absolute accuracy of 5 percent; the long-term solar spectral irradiance from 160 to 400&amp;nbsp;nm Photochemical process and the influence of “trace” constituents on the ozone layer.

The [[Ball Aerospace]]-built SBUV/2 helped to discover the [[ozone hole]] over [[Antarctica]] in 1987, and continues to monitor this phenomenon. Atmospheric ozone absorbs the sun’s ultraviolet rays, which are believed to cause gene mutations, [[skin cancer]], and [[cataracts]] in humans. Ultraviolet rays may also damage crops and aquatic ecosystems. The first SBUV/2 instrument was launched on NOAA-9 in December 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA 9|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1984-123A|website=National Space Science Data Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last instrument in this series was launched in February 2009 aboard the [[NOAA-19]] spacecraft.

A '''slot''' comprises the operation issue and data paths machinery surrounding a collection of one or more [[functional unit]]s (FUs) which share these resources. The term slot is common for this purpose in the [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] world where the relationship between operation in an [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] and [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] to execute it is explicit. In dynamically scheduled machines the concept is more commonly called an '''execute pipeline'''.

Modern conventional [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s have several compute pipelines (say two [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], one [[Floating point unit|FPU]], one [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]]/[[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], one [[Branch (computer science)|branch]]) each of which can issue one instruction per basic [[Instruction cycle|cycle]] but can have several in flight. These are what correspond to slots. The pipelines may have several FUs - an [[Adder (electronics)|adder]] and a [[Binary multiplier|multiplier]], say - but only one FU in a pipeline can be issued to in a particular cycle. The FU population of a pipeline/slot is a design option in a CPU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7027">'''Social journalism''' is a media model consisting of a hybrid of professional [[journalism]], contributor and reader content.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sussman|first1=Ed|title=Why Michael Wolff is Wrong|url=http://observer.com/2014/03/why-michael-wolff-is-wrong/|accessdate=10 February 2015|publisher=New York Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[open publishing]] platforms, like [[Twitter]] and [[WordPress.com]], except that some or most content is also created and/or screened by professional journalists. Examples include [[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]], [[Medium (service)|Medium]], [[BuzzFeed]], [https://www.sp-bx.com Soapbox] and [[Gawker Media|Gawker]]. The model, which in some instances has generated monthly audiences in the tens of millions, has been discussed as one way for professional journalism to thrive despite a marked decline in the audience for traditional journalism.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

=="Platishing"==

Writing in [[Re/code]], Jonathan Glick, CEO of Sulia, said the model of publishers as platforms (which he calls a "platisher") is "on the rise". Glick cites as examples Medium (from Twitter co-founders [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and [[Biz Stone]]), [[Vox Media]], Sulia, Skift, [[First Look Media]] (backed by eBay founder [[Pierre Omidyar]]) and BuzzFeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glick|first=Jonathan|title=Rise of the Platishers|url=http://recode.net/2014/02/07/rise-of-the-platishers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=136566982|work=Re/Code|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2014, Mark Little, the CEO of Storyful.com, now a division of News Corp., proposed "10 Principles that Power Social Journalism," including "UGC [User Generated Content] is governed by the same legal and ethical code as any other content" and "The currency of social journalism is authenticity not authority. We are not experts in every subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Little|first=Mark|title=10 Principles that Power Social Journalism|url=http://blog.storyful.com/2014/03/12/ten-principles-that-power-social-journalism/#.UzxieseT4aE|work=Storyful|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alan Rusbridger, said the Guardian was in the process of converting into a platform as well as a publisher. "For years, news organizations had a quasi monopoly on information simply because we had the means of distribution. I think if as a journalist you are not intensely curious about what has been created by people who are not journalists, then you’re missing out on a lot," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chozik|first=Amy|title=The Guardian’s Alan Rusbridger: ‘It’s Essential to Be Paranoid’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/the-guardians-alan-rusbridger-its-essential-to-be-paranoid.html|work=New York Times Sunday Magazine|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new rules==

On April 1, 2014, in a column in [[GigaOM]] entitled "Social journalism and open platforms are the new normal — now we have to make them work" Mathew Ingram asked "How can media entities take advantage of this phenomenon without losing their way in the process?" and proceeded to review suggested rules for social journalism proposed by former FastCompany.com president Ed Sussman, an early adopter of the model.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title=Social Journalism and Open Platforms Are the New Normal - Now We Have to Make Them Work|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/04/01/social-journalism-and-open-platforms-are-the-new-normal-now-we-have-to-make-them-work/|work=Giga Om|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram summarized Sussman's suggestions, including clear labeling types of contributors (e.g. staff, guest contributor, reader contribution); establishing guidelines, such as conflict of interest rules, that posters must consent to before posting; providing wiki-like tools for social improvements to content; elevating the best content with curators and algorithms; deleting weak or problematic content via curators or algorithms.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;

Social journalism has been attacked by media critic Michael Wolff in ''[[USA Today]]'' as the "Forbes vanity model letting ‘contributors’ write whatever they want under your brand (‘as I wrote in Forbes …’) and not having to pay them anything — ultimately, of course, devaluing your authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Michael|title=New cash, new questions for Business Insider|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/03/16/the-future-of-business-insider/6370473/|work=USA Today|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 20, 2014 [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', former [[FastCompany.com]] president Ed Sussman argued that social journalism does not devalue the authority of brands and that the success of Forbes.com in attracting a wide audience with its 1,000+ bloggers proved that the model could be successful for traditional media companies.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; Following revelations that some [[Forbes.com]] contributors used their columns to allegedly participate in a "pump and dump" scheme to promote, then sell stocks, Sussman followed up with "The New Rules of Social Journalism: A Proposal" in [[Pando Daily]], on March 29, 2014. Sussman proposed various rules for elevating the quality and ethics of social journalism content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The New Rules of Social Journalism|url=http://pando.com/2014/03/29/the-new-rules-of-social-journalism-a-proposal/|work=Pando Daily|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adopter==

An early, or perhaps the first "social journalism" platform at a major media company was FastCompany.com, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The Media is Social|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/665030/media-social/|work=FastCompany.com|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the platform launched, in its first six months, FastCompany.com signed up 2,000 bloggers and 50,000 members.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; "Fast Company is the first, but certainly not last, mainstream publication to integrate the majority of their site as a social community," wrote media analyst Jeremiah Owyang in 2008, then a senior social computing analyst for [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Owyang|first=Jeremiah|title=An Initial Analysis of the Fast Company Community|url=http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/02/09/an-initial-analysis-of-the-fast-company-community/|work=Web Strategist|accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ed Sussman left the website, the [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] print magazine editors reverted it to a standard journalism website.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

During her tenure at ICANN from 2005-2007, and the Council of the GNSO (Generic Names Supporting Organization), Bekele was instrumental in initiating policy dialogue over IDNs that resulted in the introduction of IDNs under which new Internet Domain names in Arabic, Cyrillic, Russian, Chinese and non-Latin alphabets will become available, thereby providing non-English/non-Latin language native speakers an opportunity to access and communicate on the Internet in their native languages. &lt;ref name="thereporter"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 6, 2013|author=The Reporter Daily|title=An Ethiopian woman fighting for .africa, a new generic Top-Level Domain|url=https://thereporterethiopia.com/index.php/living-and-the-arts/lifestyle/item/324-an-ethiopian-woman-fighting-for-africa-a-new-generic-top-level-domain|accessdate=Feb 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805000639/http://thereporterethiopia.com/index.php/living-and-the-arts/lifestyle/item/324-an-ethiopian-woman-fighting-for-africa-a-new-generic-top-level-domain|archivedate=August 5, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Policy|date= Nov 16, 2007|author=The Register, Cade Metz

In 2006 Bekele turned her focus to [[.africa ]]– a new generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) for the Africa geographic name that she championed during her appointment at ICANN.  The project has been introduced and will be delegated for operation under ICANN’s new gTLD programme.

Bekele re-started the DotAfrica initiative following the important experiences gained from her work as gNSO advisor to ICANN.  Bekele  made a clear case for a DotAfrica ([[.africa]]) gTLD for Africa within ICANN and also the global Internet Community on behalf of the global African and Pan-African constituency.  She soon led the [[.africa]] initiative with [[DotConnectAfrica]] introducing it to the Pan-African inter-governmental organizations – the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African Union Commission (AUC) and received endorsement for DCA.
 
Enterprise Technology Magazine called her "Sophia Bekele: Champion of .africa initiative" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Enterprise Technology]]|date=2011-11-30|author=Joyce Tonda|title=Sophia Bekele, Ethiopian champion of the dot africa \initiative|url=http://ictcreatives.com/component/k2/item/50-sophia-bekele-ethiopian-champion-of-the-dot-africa-initiative|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CIO East Africa calling her views "controversial" on who should run gTLDs, saying "Sophia Bekele has been in the news if not for promoting DotConnectAfrica’s bid for the DotAfrica geographical gTLD for the past three years, then in a controversial statement about the same":&lt;br /&gt;

Bekele currently{{when|date=October 2018}} oversees the [[.africa]] new gTLD initiative of DotConnectAfrica Trust.  As Executive Director of DCA Trust &amp; CEO of DotConnectAfrica Registry Services Limited, she has led a multi-national team of experts to prepare and submit an application for the DotAfrica (.AFRICA) generic Top-Level Domain. [[DotConnectAfrica]] Trust (DCA Trust) has already submitted an application in May 2012 for the .dotafrica (pronounced as ‘DotAfrica’) geographic name string to the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ICANN|date=2012-06-13|author=DCA|title= ICANN New gTLDs - Application Details|url=http://gtldresult.icann.org/applicationstatus/applicationdetails/1276;jsessionid=2500230032894FB8CB3F16550E33DF0Farchive.constantcontact.com/fs053/1102516344150/archive/1110237447043    |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controversies ==== 
Bekele's eight year .africa journey was not without  challenges over the issues of accountability and transparency on the bid for .africa, including the African Union Commission(AUC) who allegedly disavowed the first endorsement they gave her organization DotConnectAfrica in 2009 to apply for the .africa gTLD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ITWeb Online|date=August 12, 2010|title=African domain gets a nod|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T15354702680&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T15354702684&amp;cisb=22_T15354702683&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=366150&amp;docNo=17|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to subsequently request for the same directly from ICANN, at the ICANN 42 International meeting held in Dakar Senegal from 23–28 October 2011. 

AUC requested ICANN to include all similar name strings ".africa", ".afrique" and ".afriqia", in the list of "reserved names", to afford special legislative protection to the AUC to own these strings so as to make it unavailable to anyone, through a method of bypassing the formal application process of the ICANN's new generic top level domains (gTLDs). Bekele  opposed to the AUC's request as it became known later that ICANN could not reserve the names for the AU, however ICANN did recommend to the AUC to use Government Advisory Committee to raise concerns that an applicant is seen as potentially sensitive or problematic, or to provide direct advice to the Board, so as to change the outcome of the gTLD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ICANN|date=March 8, 2012 |author=CircleID, Sophia Bekele|title= Steve Crocker to Elham M.A. Ibrahim |url= http://www.icann.org/en/news/correspondence/crocker-to-ibrahim-08mar12-en |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUC implemented the advice during the GAC objection period at the detriment of DCA and subsequently went ahead to directly endorsed another firm from SouthAfrica to apply to ICANN, who was also supported by its own AU Dotafrica Task Force.&lt;ref name="The East African, Mwaura Kimani"&gt;{{cite web|work=Technology News|date=Dec 5, 2011|author=The East African, Mwaura Kimani|title=Internet war: Scramble for .africa domain as January deadline looms|url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Internet+war++Scramble+for++africa+domain/-/2558/1284440/-/item/0/-/gu5709/-/index.html|accessdate=Feb 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Technology News|date=April 27, 2012|author=The Human IPO|title=Guest Post: Who deserves control of .africa gTLD?|url=http://www.humanipo.com/news/277/guest-post-who-deserves-control-of-africa-gtld/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505113538/http://www.humanipo.com/news/277/guest-post-who-deserves-control-of-africa-gtld/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 5, 2014|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Technology News|date=Oct 24, 2012|author=CircleID, Sophia Bekele|title= The "ICANN Africa Strategy" Is Not the Same as the 'African Agenda'|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20121024_icann_africa_strategy_is_not_the_same_as_the_african_agenda/ |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the public part of their application, the South African company submitted a "non-community" application to ICANN naming AUC as a “co-applicant” and giving the .africa registry and intellectual property rights to the AUC in a separate contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ICANN|date=April 2012 |author=CircleID, Sophia Bekele|title= Application ID: 1-1243-89583, ZA Central Registry NPC trading as Registry.Africa|url= https://gtldresult.icann.org/applicationstatus/applicationdetails/1184|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These were later challenged through  the DCA Vs ICANN IRP case overseen by the constituted .africa International Tribunal. On 9 July 2015, the .Africa IRP International Tribunal in its final declaration[109] ruled that DCA Trust, was the prevailing party. The Tribunal also recommended that ICANN continue to refrain from delegating the .AFRICA gTLD and permit DCA Trust’s application to proceed through the remainder of the new gTLD application process. The Tribunal further declared that ICANN is to bear, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 18 of the Bylaws, Article 11 of Supplementary Procedures and Article 31 of the ICDR Rules, the totality of the costs of this IRP and the totality of the costs of the IRP Provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Register |accessdate=July 15, 2015|title= Unredacted: ICANN's hidden role in fierce battle over .Africa rights |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/15/icann_dot_africa_review/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= CIO East Africa |accessdate= July 15, 2015 |title= DCA Trust wins .africa IRP, ICANN to pay over Kshs 60 million in costs |url= http://cio.co.ke/news/main-stories/dca-trust-wins-.africa-irp,-icann-to-pay-over-kshs-60-million-in-costs |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150723131222/http://cio.co.ke/news/main-stories/dca-trust-wins-.africa-irp,-icann-to-pay-over-kshs-60-million-in-costs |archivedate= July 23, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DomainNewsAfrica |accessdate=July 15, 2015|title= ICANN loses .Africa case: IRP panel rules in favor of DCA |url= http://domainnewsafrica.com/icann-loses-dotafrica-case-irp-panel-rules-favor-dca/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Ethioinfodesk |accessdate= July 15, 2015 |title= Ethiopian Born Entrepreneur Sophia Bekele Wins .Africa Domain Name Accountability Suit Against ICANN |url= http://ethioinfodesk.com/ethiopian-born-entrepreneur-sophia-bekele-wins-africa-domain-name-accountability-suit-against-icann/ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150716001556/http://ethioinfodesk.com/ethiopian-born-entrepreneur-sophia-bekele-wins-africa-domain-name-accountability-suit-against-icann/ |archivedate= July 16, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Domainmondo |accessdate=July 15, 2015|title= DCA Trust IRP Decision: ICANN Failed the Global Internet Community |url= http://www.domainmondo.com/2015/07/dca-trust-irp-decision-icann-failed.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IpjJustice |accessdate=July 15, 2015|title= ICANN Loses Independent Review Panel Decision For Unfairly Treating TLD Applicant &amp; Improper Deference to Governments |url= http://www.ipjustice.org/digital-rights/icann-loses-independent-review-panel-decision-for-unfairly-treating-tld-applicants-improper-deference-to-governments/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= TandaaBiashara |accessdate= July 15, 2015 |title= Breaking: DotConnectAfrica Trust victorious on its challenge of ICANN Board over .africa |url= http://tandaabiashara.com/breaking-dotconnectafrica-trust-victorious-on-its-challenge-of-icann-board-over-dotafrica/ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150723124145/http://tandaabiashara.com/breaking-dotconnectafrica-trust-victorious-on-its-challenge-of-icann-board-over-dotafrica/ |archivedate= July 23, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BNA |accessdate=July 15, 2015|title= Review Panel Chides ICANN Board, Government Reps |url= http://www.bna.com/review-panel-chides-n17179933491/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Register |accessdate=Aug 5, 2015|title= Having been slammed and embarrassed, ICANN tells the world: We’ve done nowt wrong |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/16/icann_africa_latest/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Circleid |accessdate=Aug 5, 2015|title= Will 2016 Politics Trump Bipartisan Support for the MSM and DOTCOM Act?

'''The RNAi Consortium''', or TRC, is a [[public-private partnership]] whose mission is to create libraries of  [[small hairpin RNA]]s (shRNAs) for 15'000 human and 15'000 mouse [[gene]]s. These libraries should help the scientific community to analyse gene function by [[RNAi]]. The consortium is based at the [[Broad Institute]] of the [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University]], and includes 6 MIT- and Harvard-associated institutions and 5 international life sciences organizations. Verified RNAi clones and entire libraries are made available both by [[Sigma-Aldrich]] and [[Open Biosystems]].

== Hairpin selection ==

A set of candidate hairpins are selected based on the 1st [[Refseq]] [[transcription (genetics)|transcript]] from each [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] gene. They should be 21mers, be at least 25bp from start of the [[coding sequence]] and no closer than 150bp from its end. Candidates are scored based on various [[Empirical method|empirical]] rules (see the Broad Institute's web site for a complete list [http://www.broad.mit.edu/genome_bio/trc/rules.html]) and then [[BLAST]]ed against 2 [[transcriptome]] sets. Hairpins that are unique for a [[Unigene]] cluster and a RefSeq NM identifier are preferred. Lastly, the candidates are spaced to have 1 hairpin in the [[3' UTR|3' untranslated region]] and 4 in the coding sequence.

== Hairpin vector ==

Selected hairpins are cloned into the [[viral vector|vector]] pLKO1, which is a multipurpose [[plasmid]] that can be propagated in [[bacteria]], [[transfection|transfect]]ed into [[mammal]]ian [[cell line]]s or used for generation of [[lentivirus]]es. It contains [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance gene]]s against [[ampicillin]] and [[puromycin]].

== Release ==

Release 1 of the TRC lentiviral shRNA libraries consist of about 35'000 shRNA constructs against 5300 human (25'000 clones) and 2200 mouse genes (10'000 clones). Release 2 of the human shRNA library contained an additional 9'500 clones. Releases occur roughly every quarter. The completing of both mouse and human libraries is envisioned for the end of 2006 or beginning of 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1057">A '''tuned amplifier''' is an [[electronic amplifier]] which includes [[bandpass]] filtering components within the amplifier circuitry.  They are widely used in all kinds of wireless applications.

[[File:Stagger-tuned 3-stage amplifier.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|A typical multi-stage tuned amplifier]]

There are several tuning schemes in use,
* [[Staggered tuning]] where each amplifier stage is tuned to a slightly different frequency.
* Synchronous tuning (explained in more detail in the staggered tuning article) where each amplifier stage is tuned identically.  This scheme maximises the amplifier gain but has narrower bandwidth than staggered tuning.
* [[Double-tuned amplifier]].  This scheme is used on amplifier stages that are [[transformer]]-coupled rather than capacitor coupled.  Both the primary and secondary coils of the transformer are tuned.  This has the effect of widening the bandwidth.  Other tuning schemes are sometimes called '''single-tuned''' to distinguish them.

A '''virtual power plant''' ('''VPP''') is a [[Cloud_computing|cloud-based]] distributed power plant that aggregates the capacities of heterogeneous [[Distributed generation|Distributed Energy Resources]] (DERs) for the purposes of enhancing power generation, as well as trading or selling power on the electricity market. Examples of virtual power plants exist in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

==Power generation==
A virtual power plant is a system that integrates several types of power sources to give a reliable overall power supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3Aee01fc77-2d91-43bb-83d3-847e787494af/ Feasibility, beneficiality, and institutional compatibility of a micro-CHP virtual power plant in the Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt; The sources often form a cluster of different types of dispatchable and non-dispatchable, controllable or flexible load (CL or FL) [[distributed generation]] (DG) systems that are controlled by a central authority and can include [[microCHP]]s, natural gas-fired [[reciprocating engine]]s, small-scale [[wind power|wind power plants]] (WPP)s, [[photovoltaics]] (PVs), [[run-of-river hydroelectricity]] plants, [[small hydro]], [[biomass]],  back-up [[Engine-generator|gensets]], and [[energy storage]] systems (ESS).

This system has benefits such as the ability to deliver [[peaking power plant|peak load]] electricity or [[load following power plant|load-following power]] generation on short notice. Such a VPP can replace a conventional power plant while providing higher efficiency and more flexibility. More flexibility allows the system to react better to fluctuations, but whose complexity requires complicated optimization, control, and secure communications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6099519 Smart Grid - The New and Improved Power Grid: A Survey]; IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials 2011; X. Fang, S. Misra, G. Xue, and D. Yang; {{doi|10.1109/SURV.2011.101911.00087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 report by Pike Research, VPP capacity would, from 2011 to 2017, increase by 65%, from 55.6 gigawatts (GW) to 91.7 GW worldwide, generating from $5.3 billion to $6.5 billion in worldwide revenue in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Revenue from Virtual Power Plants Will Reach $5.3 Billion by 2017, Forecasts Pike Research |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120418005337/en/Revenue-Virtual-Power-Plants-Reach-5.3-Billion |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=[[Navigant Consulting|Pike Research]] |via=[[Business Wire]] |access-date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more aggressive forecast scenario, the clean-tech market intelligence firm forecasts that global VPP revenues could reach as high as $12.7 billion during the same period.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=need 2014, or later, report}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtual power plants represent an 'Internet of Energy{{' "}}, said senior analyst Peter Asmus of Pike Research. "These systems tap existing grid networks to tailor electricity supply and demand services for a customer. VPPs maximize value for both the end user and the distribution utility using a sophisticated set of software-based systems. They are dynamic, deliver value in real time, and can react quickly to changing customer load conditions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Energy trading==
A virtual power plant is also a cloud-based central or distributed control center that takes advantage of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and [[Internet of things]] (IoT) devices to aggregate the capacities of heterogeneous Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to form "a [[coalition]] of heterogeneous DERs" for the purpose of energy trading on the wholesale [[electricity market]]s or providing [[ancillary services]] for system operators on behalf of non-eligible individual DERs.&lt;ref name="VPP Bilateral 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Decision Making Tool for Virtual Power Plants Considering Midterm Bilateral Contracts | journal= 3rd Iranian Regional CIRED Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution, at Niroo Research Institute (NRI), Tehran, Iran | date = January 2015 | doi = 10.13140/2.1.5086.4969 | author = Shabanzadeh M | volume = 3 | pages = 1–6 | last2 = Sheikh-El-Eslami | first2 = M-K |last3 = Haghifam | first3 = P|last4 = M-R | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VPP Robust 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The design of a risk-hedging tool for virtual power plants via robust optimization approach | journal= Applied Energy | date = October 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.059 | author = Shabanzadeh M | volume = 155 | pages = 766–777 | last2 = Sheikh-El-Eslami | first2 = M-K |last3 = Haghifam | first3 = P|last4 = M-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VPP Coalition Forming 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = A medium-term coalition-forming model of heterogeneous DERs for a commercial virtual power plant | journal= Applied Energy | date = May 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.058 | author = Shabanzadeh M | volume = 169 | pages = 663–681 | last2 = Sheikh-El-Eslami | first2 = M-K |last3 = Haghifam | first3 = P|last4 = M-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VPP FSD 2017"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Risk-based medium-term trading strategy for a virtual power plant with first-order stochastic dominance constraints | journal=  IET Generation, Transmission &amp; Distribution | date = January 2017 | doi = 10.1049/iet-gtd.2016.1072 | author = Shabanzadeh M | volume = 11 | pages = 520–529 | last2 = Sheikh-El-Eslami | first2 = M-K |last3 = Haghifam | first3 = P|last4 = M-R | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VPP SSD 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Modeling the cooperation between neighboring VPPs: Cross-regional bilateral transactions | journal=  2016 Iranian Conference on Renewable Energy &amp; Distributed Generation (ICREDG) | date = April 2016 | doi = 10.1109/ICREDG.2016.7875909 | author = Shabanzadeh M | volume = 11 | pages = 520–529 | last2 = Sheikh-El-Eslami | first2 = M-K |last3 = Haghifam | first3 = P|last4 = M-R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A VPP acts as an intermediary between DERs and the wholesale electricity market and trades energy on behalf of DER owners who by themselves are unable to participate in that market.&lt;ref name=" VPP FSD 2017"/&gt; The VPP behaves as a conventional dispatchable power plant from the point of view of other market participants, although it is indeed a cluster of many diverse DERs. Also, in the competitive electricity markets, a virtual power plant acts as an arbitrageur between diverse energy trading floors (i.e., bilateral and PPA contracts, forward and futures markets, and the pool).&lt;ref name="VPP Bilateral 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" VPP Robust 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" VPP Coalition Forming 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" VPP SSD 2016"/&gt;

So far, for risk management purposes, five different risk-hedging strategies (i.e., IGDT, RO, CVaR, FSD, and SSD) have been applied to the decision-making problems of VPPs in the research articles to measure the level of conservatism of VPPs' decisions in diverse energy trading floors (e.g., day-ahead electricity market, derivatives exchange market, and bilateral contracts):

==United States==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Energy markets are those [[Commodity market|commodities markets]] that deal specifically with the trade and supply of energy. In the United States, virtual power plants not only deal with the supply side, but also help manage demand, and ensure reliability of grid functions through demand response (DR) and other load-shifting approaches, in real time.

An often-reported energy crisis in America has opened the door for government-subsidized companies to enter an arena that has only been available to utilities and multinational billion-dollar companies until now. With the deregulation of markets around the United States, the wholesale market pricing became the exclusive domain of large retail suppliers; however local and federal legislation along with large end-users are beginning to recognize the advantages of wholesale activities.

California is the leader in green technology, with governmental bodies subsidizing and pushing an agenda that is not shared by much of the rest of the United States. In California there are two electrical markets: private retail and wholesale. California Senate Bill 2X—which passed the California legislature on March 30, 2011—mandates 33% renewables by 2020 without mandating any particular method to reach that goal.

==Europe==
The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] in Germany pilot-tested a combined power plant that linked solar, wind, [[biogas]], and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power around the clock, completely from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant"&gt;{{Cite web  |url=http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html  |title=The Combined Power Plant: the first stage in providing 100% power from renewable energy  |date=January 2008  |accessdate=2008-10-10  |publisher=SolarServer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Virtual Power Station operators are also commonly referred to as aggregators.

To test the effects of [[micro combined heat and power]] on a [[smart grid]], 45 [[natural gas]] [[SOFC]] units (each generating 1.5{{nbsp}}kW) from Republiq Power ([[Ceramic Fuel Cells]]) will be placed in 2013 on [[Ameland]] to function as a virtual power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Bijlage persbericht 010/MK – Verleende subsidies – 3.

An example of a real-world virtual power plant can be found on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Inner Hebrides]] island of [[Eigg]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4. Costing the Earth- Electric Island&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In August 2016, [[AGL Energy]] announced a 5{{nbsp}}MW virtual-power-plant scheme for [[Adelaide]], Australia. The company will supply [[Grid energy storage|battery]] and [[photovoltaic]] systems from Sunverge Energy, of San Francisco, to 1000 households and businesses.  The systems will cost consumers [[Australian dollar|AUD]] $3500 and are expected to recoup the expense in savings in 7{{nbsp}}years under current [[Electric power distribution|distribution network]] tariffs. The scheme is worth AUD $20{{nbsp}}million and is being billed as the largest in the world.&lt;ref name="slezak-2016"&gt;

'''X-ray microtomography''', like [[tomography]] and [[x-ray computed tomography]], uses [[x-ray]]s to create cross-sections of a physical object that can be used to recreate a virtual model ([[3D modeling|3D model]]) without destroying the original object. The [[metric prefix|prefix]] ''[[micro-]]'' (symbol: µ) is used to indicate that the [[pixel]] sizes of the cross-sections are in the [[micrometre]] range.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|X-Ray+Microtomography}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pixel sizes have also resulted in the terms '''high-resolution x-ray tomography''', '''micro–computed tomography''' ('''micro-CT''' or '''µCT'''), and similar terms. Sometimes the terms [[high resolution CT|high-resolution CT]] (HRCT) and micro-CT are differentiated,&lt;ref name="pmid_16870669"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Dame Carroll JR, Chandra A, Jones AS, Berend N, Magnussen JS, King GG |date=2006-07-26 |title=Airway dimensions measured from micro-computed tomography and high-resolution computed tomography |journal=Eur Respir J |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=712–720 |pmid=16870669 |postscript=. |doi=10.1183/09031936.06.00012405}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in other cases the term '''high-resolution micro-CT''' is used.&lt;ref name="pmid_23308240"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Duan J, Hu C, Chen H |date=2013-01-07 |title=High-resolution micro-CT for morphologic and quantitative assessment of the sinusoid in human cavernous hemangioma of the liver |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053507 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=e53507 |pmid=23308240 |pmc=3538536 |postscript=.|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853507D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all tomography today is computed tomography.

Micro-CT has applications both in [[medical imaging]] and in [[industrial computed tomography]]. In general, there are two types of scanner setups. In one setup, the X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan while the sample/animal rotates. The second setup, much more like a clinical CT scanner, is gantry based where the animal/specimen is stationary in space while the X-ray tube and detector rotate around. These scanners are typically used for small animals (''[[in vivo]]'' scanners), biomedical samples, foods, microfossils, and other studies for which minute detail is desired.

The first X-ray microtomography system was conceived and built by Jim Elliott in the early 1980s. The first published X-ray microtomographic images were reconstructed slices of a small tropical snail, with pixel size about 50 micrometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1982.tb00376.x|title=X-ray microtomography|year=1982|last1=Elliott|first1=J. C.|last2=Dover|first2=S. D.|journal=Journal of Microscopy|volume=126|issue=2|pages=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working principle==

===Imaging system===

====[[Fan beam reconstruction]]====
The fan-beam system is based on a one-dimensional (1D) X-ray detector and an electronic X-ray source, creating 2D [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of the object. Typically used in human [[computed tomography]] systems.

====[[Cone beam reconstruction]]====
The cone-beam system is based on a 2D X-ray detector ([[camera]]) and an electronic X-ray source, creating [[projection images]] that later will be used to reconstruct the image cross-sections.

===Open/Closed systems===

====Open X-ray system====
In an open system, X-rays may escape or leak out, thus the operator must stay behind a shield, have special protective clothing, or operate the scanner from a distance or a different room. Typical examples of these scanners are the human versions, or designed for big objects.

====Closed X-ray system====
In a closed system, X-ray shielding is put around the scanner so the operator can put the scanner on a desk or special table. Although the scanner is shielded, care must be taken and the operator usually carries a dosimeter, since X-rays have a tendency to be absorbed by metal and then re-emitted like an antenna. Although a typical scanner will produce a relatively harmless volume of X-rays, repeated scannings in a short timeframe could pose a danger. Digital detectors with small pixel pitches and micro-focus x-ray tubes are usually employed to yield in high resolution images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghani|first=Muhammad U.|last2=Zhou|first2=Zhongxing|last3=Ren|first3=Liqiang|last4=Wong|first4=Molly|last5=Li|first5=Yuhua|last6=Zheng|first6=Bin|last7=Yang|first7=Kai|last8=Liu|first8=Hong|date=2016-01-21|title=Investigation of spatial resolution characteristics of an in vivo microcomputed tomography system|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=807|pages=129–136|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2015.11.007|pmc=4668590|pmid=26640309|bibcode=2016NIMPA.807..129G}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Closed systems tend to become very heavy because lead is used to shield the X-rays. Therefore, the smaller scanners only have a small space for samples.

==3D image reconstruction==

===The principle===
Because microtomography scanners offer [[Isotropy|isotropic]], or near isotropic, resolution, display of images does not need to be restricted to the conventional axial images. Instead, it is possible for a software program to build a volume by 'stacking' the individual slices one on top of the other. The program may then display the volume in an alternative manner.

===Image reconstruction software===
For X-ray microtomography, powerful open source software is available, such as the ASTRA toolbox.&lt;ref name="ASTRAEM"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Van Aarle, W., Palenstijn, W.J., De Beenhouwer, J., Altantzis T., Bals S., Batenburg K.

The toolbox supports parallel, fan, and cone beam, with highly flexible source/detector positioning. A large number of reconstruction algorithms are available, including FBP, ART, SIRT, SART, CGLS.

===Volume rendering===
[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, as produced by a microtomography scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

===Image segmentation===
Where different structures have similar threshold density, it can become impossible to separate them simply by adjusting volume rendering parameters. The solution is called [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], a manual or automatic procedure that can remove the unwanted structures from the image.

'''xAP''' is an open protocol used for home automation and supports integration of telemetry and control devices primarily within the home. Common communications networks include [[RS232]], [[RS485]], [[Ethernet]] and [[wireless]]. xAP protocol always uses broadcast for sending the messages. All the receivers listens to the message and introspects the message header to verify whether the message is of its interest. xAP protocol has the following key advantages.
* It makes use of existing infrastructure wherever possible (for example it can co-exist with various physical layers like RS232 or wireless LAN)
* It can even intercommunicate between multiple networks like RS232 or wireless by just deploying a physical bridge.
* xAP does not require any central controller. All nodes can act as sender or receiver.
* xAP system provides distributed and fault tolerant architecture which allows continuous operation of systems even in the event of component failures.
