The '''African Resistance Movement''' ('''ARM''') was a militant anti-[[apartheid]] resistance movement, which operated in [[South Africa]] during the early and mid-1960s. It was founded in 1960, as the '''National Committee of Liberation''' ('''NCL'''), by members of [[South Africa|South Africa’s]] [[Liberal Party (South Africa)|Liberal Party]], which advocated for the dismantling of apartheid and gradually transforming South Africa into a free multiracial society. It was renamed "African Resistance Movement" in 1964.{{sfn |Gunther|2004|p=210}}

==NLC/ARM==
Immediately after the 1960 [[Sharpeville Massacre]], the apartheid government imposed a [[state of emergency]], which allowed it to apply a broad range of sanctions against its political opponents, such as detention without trial and banning meetings, and enabled the [[Special Branch]] to secretly detain and interrogate whomever it deemed a threat to the government, without due process. 

After the state of emergency was lifted, the new Minister of Justice, [[B.J. Vorster]], introduced legislation that made many parts of the emergency regulations permanent (the [[Sabotage Act]] of 1962, and the [[General Law Amendment Act, 1963|90-day Detention]] Act of 1963). Much of the Liberal party’s leadership was banned, detained or forced underground, rendering it impotent.{{sfn|Robertson|1971|pp= 219-221}}

A number of young Liberals became increasingly frustrated, and, in 1960, formed the National Liberation Committee (NLC).{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p= 105}} Initially focused on helping hunted people escape the country, the NLC progressed to sabotage government installations and services, explicitly eschewing violence against people. It launched its first operation in September 1963. From then, until July 1964, the NLC/ARM bombed power lines, railroad tracks and rolling stock, roads, bridges and other vulnerable infrastructure, without any civilian casualties. It aimed to turn the white population against the government by creating a situation that would result in capital flight and collapse of confidence in the country and its economy. It launched four attacks in 1961, three in 1962, eight in 1963, and ten in 1964.{{sfn|Gunther|2004|p=246}}

In May 1964, the NLC was renamed the African Resistance Movement. The name change coincided with increased internal debate about the use of violence against people, i.e. guerrilla warfare.{{sfn|Gunther|2004|pp=246-247}}

===Discovery, arrests and convictions===
On 4 July 1964, the security police carried out a series of raids, including one on the flat of [[Adrian Leftwich]] in Cape Town. Leftwich, a former president of the South African Union of Students, and one of the organizers of ARM, possessed a collection of documents in his possession which described virtually the entire history of the NLC, and included a notebook containing the names of and dues paid by each member.{{sfn|Lewin|1974| p= 17}}{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p= 113}} During interrogation by the security forces, Leftwich informed on his colleagues. In July, the security police arrested 29 ARM members. After brutal interrogation, several pleaded guilty.{{sfn|Lewin|1976|pp= 34-37}}{{sfn|Driver|1969| p= 2}} Leftwich turned state witness in the trial of five members of the Cape Town group, and in the Johannesburg trial of four members of the Johannesburg group.&lt;ref name=granta.com /&gt; Of the 29 arrested, 14 were charged and 10 were convicted, receiving jail sentences of between 5 and 15 years.{{sfn|Gunther|2004|p=247}}

===Railway Station Bombing===
On 24 July, one of the few ARM members still at large, [[Frederick John Harris|John Harris]], placed a phosphorus incendiary device in the whites-only waiting room of [[Johannesburg Park Station]]. He telephoned a bomb warning to the police, who did not respond before it exploded, killing a woman and severely burning 23 others. Harris was arrested, following a confession by one of his colleagues, John Lloyd. Harris was convicted of murder and hanged on 1 April 1965, singing "[[We Shall Overcome]]" on his way to the gallows.{{sfn|Gunther|2004|p=249}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">The strategy of '''assumed incumbency''' is based on a recognition of the value of incumbency in a [[political campaign]].  A high correlation between election and incumbency has been demonstrated in congressional races.  The success rate of incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking re-election averaged 93.5 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, J.E. (1974). The effect of incumbency in congressional elections: A bibliographic essay of articles since 1973. ''Congressional Quarterly'' 13, July&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistically, the initial edge for the incumbent candidate is 2-4 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, R.S. (1971). The advantage of incumbency in presidential elections. ''Polity'' 3, pp. 395-401&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[incumbent]] is the person currently holding the office; that held position provides an automatic legitimacy, which usually results in an early conclusion of the person being the frontrunner in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;(Powell, L. &amp; Shelby, A. (1981). A strategy of assumed incumbency: A case study. ''Southern Speech Communication Journal'', 46(2) pp.105-123&lt;/ref&gt;  Powell and Shelby (1891) claim that being the frontrunner allows the candidate to be able to define the parameters of debate and put the burden of the proof on the challenger. 

The assumed incumbent strategy occurs when a political position becomes open with no incumbent seeking re-election.  The candidate that runs for the now open spot can assume the incumbency role for that position, usually through same-party affiliation. One case study that examined an assumed incumbency looked at [[Richard Shelby]] and his congressional campaign in 1978 in Alabama.  At the time, Shelby was an Alabama state senator, and had announced his intentions to run for the state lieutenant governor's position &lt;ref&gt;Fox, A. (1978). Shelby launches campaign calling for senate reform. ''Birmingham News'' 12, May, 3:1&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when Congressman [[Walter Flowers]] decided to leave his seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and run for a seat in the [[U.S. Senate]], Shelby decided to abandon his campaign for state lieutenant governor and run for Walter's congressional seat.  The congressional seat was now open with no incumbent seeking re-election.  Thus, the decision for Shelby to run was made using the assumed incumbency strategy. 

The strategy of assumed incumbency is developed through three progressive stages that complete a model of spiral progression as follows:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Stage
! Rhetorical Stance/Technique
! Goal
|-
| Legitimacy
| Identification
| Reinforcement
|-
| Logical Choice
| Increased Visibility
| Fulfillment of competency expectations
|-
| Perception as frontrunner, Generation of competency expectations
| Increased name recognition, Expanding competency expectations to larger audience
| Reinforcement
|}

The three stages of the model are as follows:

'''1. Legitimacy''' becomes the rhetorical goal of the strategy, and the initial stage of the strategy's development.  This starting point depends on the degree of name recognition that a candidate has with its given audience.  The goal is to generate expectations about the candidate as the likely winner, which is achieved through the rhetorical stance that identifies the candidate as the 'natural choice' for the position sought.  Success comes from identification of the candidate with the incumbent and/or the characteristics of the incumbency.

'''2. Identification''' stems from the increased visibility that is given to the candidate during the legitimacy stage, making the candidate a political celebrity.  The goal of this stage is increased voter recognition of a candidate's name.  Press coverage shifts from trying to establish legitimacy to maintaining one's name in the face of the public.

'''3. Reinforcement''' occurs when the candidate's campaign reaffirms the legitimacy of the candidate.  If the stages of legitimacy and identification succeed, then a set of expectations will be generated on what the candidate should be like - the 'ideal candidate' image that the voters begin to form and hold &lt;ref&gt;Nimmo &amp; Savage,&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumed incumbency model seeks to generate a specific ideal type in the early stage, then provide verification in the final stage. 

'''Assumptions of the Model'''

1. The importance of legitimacy as a campaign stage is noted. 

2. The strategy assumes that direct confrontation between the candidate and the opposition should not occur, as the confrontation would assign legitimacy to the opponent  and reduce the effectiveness of the strategy.

3. The strategy assumes that past voting behavior related to the actual incumbent can serve as the basis for establishing vote expectations for the new candidate.

4. The strategy assumes a progressive acceleration rate, attained by increased media exposure, which is intended to assist in the control of momentum so the candidate is perceived as starting from a strong position and growing stronger as the campaign develops. 

5. The strategy dictates what media should be employed and at what times to achieve the effects. 

One contingent condition must exist: the strategy is contingent upon the actual incumbent having strong voting appeal in the district.  If the strong vote appeal is not present, the advantage of assuming incumbency would be diminished.  This strategy worked for Shelby, as there was a strong vote appeal present for the actual incumbent; in this case, Walters.  Pre-campaign polls showed that Flowers was the most popular politician with a favorability rating of 67% &lt;ref&gt;Kitchens, J.T. &amp; Powell, L. (1977). Richard Shelby: Tuscaloosa survey results. ''Unpublished Pre-Campaign Poll'', June, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Welfare Square grain silo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Granary]] building at the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church's]] [[Welfare Square]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Welfare Square began in 1938 as a bishop's storehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4335 Welfare Square] entry in the [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]], 1992 ed., pgs 1558-9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''bishop's storehouse''' in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) usually refers to a commodity resource center that is used by [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] (lay leaders of local congregations analogous to [[pastor]]s or [[Priest#Protestanism|parish priests]] in other Christian denominations) of the church to provide goods to needy individuals. The storehouses stock basic foods and essential household items. The term can also be used figuratively to refer to all of the time, talents, skills, materials, compassion, and financial means of the members of the church that are available to be applied in the service of the needy.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2004). [http://www.providentliving.org/pfw/multimedia/files/pfw/pdf/57686_ProvidingLordsWay_lo_pdf.pdf ''Providing in the Lord's Way: A Leader's Guide to Welfare''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627125036/http://www.providentliving.org/pfw/multimedia/files/pfw/pdf/57686_ProvidingLordsWay_lo_pdf.pdf |date=June 27, 2008 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|January 2010}} there are 138 bishop's storehouses in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/welfare-square-place-of-hope-for-the-needy |title=Welfare Square: Place of Hope for the Needy |type=Press release |date= 6 January 2010 |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The concept of the bishop's storehouse is based on a revelation received by [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], on February 9, 1831, whereby he was instructed to keep goods "in my [the Lord's] storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/42/33,34,55#33 42:33–34, 55.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first bishop's storehouse was established in Bishop [[Newel K. Whitney]]'s store in [[Kirtland, Ohio]].

==Operation==
Most of the goods in the storehouse are purchased with [[fast offering]] funds or produced on church-owned agricultural property. The storehouses are staffed by volunteers or church service [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]]. Persons in need, whether members of the church or not, can access the storehouse by approaching a bishop or local [[Relief Society]] president. The bishop decides whether or not the person will be given assistance and works with the Relief Society president in determining what the person will be given. The usual practice is to ask the recipient to work or render some form of service in exchange for the good given them.

Bishop's storehouses are not commercial entities and goods are generally not for sale to the public through them.

==Building vs. available resources==
There are buildings owned throughout the world that serve as bishop's storehouses. In areas of the world without a dedicated building, the bishop can render assistance by purchasing food and household necessities with church [[fast offering]] funds and delivering the goods to the recipient. This may also be done when the recipient has special dietary needs not catered to through the storehouse. The bishop can also draw on the "storehouse" of church members' available time, talents, and abilities to assist the needy.

'''Bugoloobi Wastewater Treatment Plant''' ('''BWTP'''), also '''Bugoloobi Sewerage Treatment Plant''' ('''BSTP'''), is a wastewater treatment project in [[Uganda]]. When completed as expected in 2018, the treatment plant will be the largest wastewater treatment plant in the countries of the [[East African Community]], and capable of processing {{convert|45000000|liters|m3}} of wastewater daily.&lt;ref name="1R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=22 June 2018 |date=22 June 2018 |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Uganda-largest-waste-water-treatment-plant-pump-sewerage-power/688334-4625712-q857ntz/index.html |title=Uganda’s largest waste water treatment plant to pump sewerage into electricity |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |author=Monitor Reporter | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The water treatment facility is under construction in the neighborhood of [[Bugoloobi]], in [[Nakawa Division]], in the south-eastern section of [[Kampala]], the capital and largest city of Uganda. This is approximately {{convert|3.6|km|0}}, by road, east of the [[central business district]] of he city.&lt;ref name="2R"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Globefeed.com |date=22 June 2018

==Overview==
The Bugoloobi WTP, collects wastewater and sewerage from parts of the city, including [[Old Kampala]], [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo]], [[Katwe]], [[Nsambya]], [[Kibuli]], [[Mbuya]], [[Nakawa]], [[Naguru]], [[Bukoto]] and [[Kamwookya]].&lt;ref name="4R"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwsc.co.ug/index.php/home-mobile/itemlist/category/26-sewer |date=22 June 2018 | title=National Water and Sewerage Corporation: Sewer Services | publisher=[[National Water and Sewerage Corporation]] (NWSC) | access-date=22 June 2018 |author=NWSC |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new expanded STP is aimed at increasing and improving sanitation services in the city and reducing the pollution of the ''Nakivubo Channel'', a surface-water effluent into [[Lake Victoria]], thereby increasing the lake's environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name="5R"&gt;{{cite web|date=2 May 2014 | url=https://www.nwsc.co.ug/index.php/component/k2/item/195-construction-works-of-the-bugolobi-nakivubo-sewerage-treatment-plant-begins |title=Construction Works of the Bugolobi/Nakivubo Sewerage Treatment Plant Begins |access-date=22 June 2018 |
publisher=[[National Water and Sewerage Corporation]] (NWSC) | author=NWSC |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project involves the construction of an ultra-modern sewerage treatment plant in Bugoloobi, a sewerage pre-treatment plant in Kinawattaka, a sewerage pumping station on Kibira Road and a sewer network measuring {{convert|31|km|0}}. New areas to be added to the sewerage network include Bugoloobi, [[Kyambogo]], Kasokoso, Kinnawattaka, [[Banda, Uganda|Banda]],  [[Butabika]] and neighbouring areas.&lt;ref name="6R"/&gt;

The bio-digesters in this plant, are expected to generate gases, which will be heated to generate {{convert|630|kW}} of electricity, to be used internally in the plant.&lt;ref name="6R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="7R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=24 July 2018 |first=Javira |url=http://www.pmldaily.com/news/2018/07/nwsc-reveals-plans-to-generating-own-electricity.html |title=NWSC to generate own power from city waste |date=23 July 2018 |publisher=PMLDaily.com | last=Ssebwami |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the solid wastes removed from the wastewater, are expected to be dried and sold as [[fertilizer]], &lt;ref name="4R"/&gt; or as raw material for the manufacture of cooking [[briquette]]s.&lt;ref name="7R"/&gt;

==Ownership==
The water treatment facility is wholly owned by the [[National Water and Sewerage Corporation]] (NWSC), a government [[parastatal]] company, responsible for provision of [[potable water]] and sewerage services nationwide.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

==Construction==
Construction began in May 2014,&lt;ref name="5R"/&gt; and is expected to conclude in 2018.&lt;ref name="6R"/&gt; NWSC plans to construct new sewerage treatment plants in Nalukolongo, between [[Ndeeba]] and [[Nateete]], along the [[Kampala–Masaka Road]] and in [[Kajjansi]], in addition the one in [[Lubigi]], completed in 2014.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4R"/&gt;

==Financing==
This project has received funding from (a) the [[government of Uganda]], (b) the [[African Development Bank]] (c) the [[European Union]] and (d) [[KfW]].&lt;ref name="6R"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://chimpreports.com/nwscs-largest-sewerage-treatment-plant-in-east-africa-and-central-africa-nears-completion/ | title=NWSC’s Largest Sewerage Treatment Plant in East Africa and Central Africa Nears Completion |access-date=22 June 2018 |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7625">'''Corporate chambers''' ({{lang-et|kutsekojad}}, singular ''{{lang|et|kutsekoda}}'', lit. vocational chamber) were a series of [[Corporatism|corporate]] institutions in [[Estonia]] during the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref name=raun/&gt; The first of these – the Chamber of Commerce and Industry – was created in 1924, and the second, the Chamber of Agriculture, followed in 1931. However, most of the chambers were established after the 1934 coup d'état of [[Konstantin Päts]], and the [[Era of Silence]] which followed the coup became their heyday.&lt;ref name=karjaharm/&gt; 

The main proponent of the formation of the chambers was indeed Päts – according to his political views, a nation should be organized not by political views into parties, but by vocation into respective chambers.&lt;ref name=karjaharm/&gt; Päts had promoted the idea of corporate chambers already in 1918, shortly after the Republic of Estonia had been established, but the idea did not gain support at the time.&lt;ref name=karjaharm/&gt; Both of the earlier chambers were however formed during time when Päts was head of government ([[riigivanem]]). After the 1934 coup Päts established a moderate authoritarian regime, in which corporate chambers were deemed to play an important role.&lt;ref name=kalling/&gt; A corporative system, based on [[Corporatism#Fascist corporatism|the example of Fascist Italy]], was to replace the inherently unstable multi-party system.&lt;ref name=kalling/&gt; Fifteen more chambers were established between 1934 and 1936, bringing the total number to 17. The chambers also took part in legislative work – according to the 1937 constitution, 16 out of 40 seats in the upper chamber of the [[Riigikogu|parliament]] (''Riiginõukogu'') were allocated to them.&lt;ref name=karjaharm/&gt; 

All the corporate chambers were disbanded between 13 and 31 July 1940, about a month after Soviet Union occupied Estonia.&lt;ref name="aasmae"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79089">Under the rule of [[Fidel Castro]], the nation of [[Cuba]] underwent significant economic, political, and social changes. In the [[Cuban Revolution]], Castro and an associated group of revolutionaries toppled the ruling government of [[Fulgencio Batista]], forcing Batista out of power on 1 January 1959. Castro, who had already been an important figure in Cuban society, went on to serve as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] from 1959 to 1976. He was also the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], the most senior position in the [[Communist state]] from 1961 to 2011. In 1976, Castro officially became [[President of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of State (Cuba)|Council of State]] and [[Prime Minister of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Council of Ministers]]. He retained the title until 2008, when the presidency was transferred to his brother, [[Raúl Castro]], but retained his position of Party First Secretary until 2011.

Fidel Castro's staunch belief in a [[Communism|communist ideology]] and his criticisms of other international figures elevated the prominence of his rule. He launched a wide range of economic and social changes, and also promoted a [[cult of personality]] around himself. Castro's Cuba became a key element within the [[Cold War]] struggle between the [[United States]] and its allies versus the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Events such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, in which American-connected forces failed to topple Castro's administration, continue to attract attention from historians as well as laypeople worldwide.

Castro died of natural causes in late 2016 in [[Havana]]. He had dealt with severe health problems for the past decade, remarking publicly about struggles with mobility and other issues. Even after his death, Castro's ideas continue to be the foundation of Cuban government.

On February 16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]], and accepted the position on the condition that the Prime Minister's powers be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=173}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 15 and 26 April Castro visited the U.S. with a delegation of representatives, hired a [[public relations]] firm for a [[charm offensive]], and presented himself as a "man of the people". [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] avoided meeting Castro; he was instead met by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], a man Castro instantly disliked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=174–177}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=236–242}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=155–157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to Canada, Trinidad, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, Castro attended an economic conference in [[Buenos Aires]]. He unsuccessfully proposed a $30&amp;nbsp;billion U.S.-funded "[[Marshall Plan]]" for the whole region of [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=243}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After appointing himself president of the [[Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria|National Institute of Agrarian Reform]] (''Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria'' - INRA), on 17 May 1959, Castro signed into law the [[Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba|First Agrarian Reform]], limiting landholdings to {{convert|993|acre|km2}} per owner. He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke the control of the well-off landowning class over Cuba's agriculture. Though popular among the working class, it alienated many middle-class supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=177–178}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=159–160}}, {{cite web|url=http://revolutions.truman.edu/cuba/aboutme.htm|title=First Agrarian Reform Law (1959)|accessdate=August 29, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro appointed himself president of the National Tourist Industry as well. He introduced unsuccessful measures to encourage [[African-American]] tourists to visit, advertising it as a tropical paradise free of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=262–269, 281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to state wages were implemented; judges and politicians had their pay reduced while low-level civil servants saw theirs raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1959, Castro ordered rents for those who paid less than $100 a month halved, with measures implemented to increase the Cuban people's purchasing powers. Productivity decreased, and the country's financial reserves were drained within only two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he refused to initially categorize his regime as '[[socialist]]' and repeatedly denied specifically being a '[[communist]]', Castro appointed advocates of [[Marxism-Leninism]] to senior government and military positions. Most notably, [[Che Guevara]] became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries. Appalled, Air Force commander [[Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz]] defected to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=176–177}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=248}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=161–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although President Urrutia denounced the defection, he publicly expressed concern with the rising influence of Marxism. Angered, Castro announced his resignation as prime minister, blaming Urrutia for complicating government with his "fevered anti-Communism". Over 500,000 Castro-supporters surrounded the Presidential Palace demanding Urrutia's resignation, which was duly received. On July 23, Castro resumed his Premiership and appointed the Marxist [[Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado|Osvaldo Dorticós]] as the new President.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=181–183}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=248–252}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="Until Castro, the U.S. was so overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that the American ambassador was the second most important man, sometimes even more important than the Cuban president."|source=— [[Earl E.

Castro used radio and television to develop a "dialogue with the people", posing questions and making provocative statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His regime remained popular with workers, peasants and students, who constituted the majority of the country's population,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while opposition came primarily from the middle class.

This led to a six-year [[War against the Bandits|Escambray Rebellion]] that lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the revolution.

===Soviet support and U.S. opposition: 1960===

[[File:CheLaCoubreMarch.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Castro (far left), [[Che Guevara]] (center), and other leading revolutionaries, marching through the streets in protest at the [[La Coubre explosion]], 5 March 1960.]]

By 1960, the [[Cold War]] raged between two superpowers: the United States, a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[liberal democracy]], and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist-Leninist socialist state ruled by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist-Leninist states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=202}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting with Soviet [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] [[Anastas Mikoyan]], Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100&amp;nbsp;million loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=189&amp;ndash;190, 198&amp;ndash;199}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=292&amp;ndash;296}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=170&amp;ndash;172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries &amp;ndash; then controlled by the U.S. corporations [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], [[Esso]] and [[Standard Oil]] &amp;ndash; to process Soviet oil, but under pressure from the U.S. government, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and [[nationalization|nationalizing]] the refineries. In retaliation, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=205&amp;ndash;206}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=316&amp;ndash;319}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Cuba and the U.S. were further strained following the explosion of a French vessel, the ''[[Le Coubre]]'', in Havana harbor in March 1960. The ship carried weapons purchased from Belgium, the cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the U.S. government were guilty of sabotage. He ended this speech with "''¡Patria o Muerte!''" ("Fatherland or Death"), a proclamation that he made much use of in ensuing years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=201&amp;ndash;202}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=302}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by their earlier success with the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]], on 17 March 1960, U.S. President Eisenhower secretly authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to overthrow Castro's government. He provided them with a budget of $13&amp;nbsp;million and permitted them to ally with the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], who were aggrieved that Castro's government closed down their businesses in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=202, 211&amp;ndash;213}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=272&amp;ndash;273}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=172&amp;ndash;173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 1960, the U.S. prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba, initiating [[United States embargo against Cuba|an economic embargo]]. In retaliation, INRA took control of 383 private-run businesses on 14 October, and on 25 October a further 166 U.S. companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=214}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=349}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December, the U.S. ended its import quota of Cuban sugar, the country's primary export.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=215}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castro at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1960.]]

In September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]]. Offended by the attitude of the elite Shelburne Hotel, he and his entourage stayed at the cheap, run-down [[Hotel Theresa]] in the impoverished area of [[Harlem]]. There he met with journalists and anti-establishment figures like [[Malcolm X]]. He also met the Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and the two leaders publicly highlighted the poverty faced by U.S. citizens in areas like Harlem; Castro described New York as a "city of persecution" against black and poor Americans. Relations between Castro and Khrushchev were warm; they led the applause to one another's speeches at the General Assembly. Although Castro publicly denied being a socialist, Khrushchev informed his entourage that the Cuban would become "a beacon of Socialism in Latin America."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=206&amp;ndash;209}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=333&amp;ndash;338}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=174&amp;ndash;176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, visited by four other socialists, Polish First Secretary [[Władysław Gomułka]], Bulgarian chairman [[Todor Zhivkov]], Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Indian Premier [[Jawaharlal Nehru]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=209&amp;ndash;210}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=337}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]] organized an evening's reception for Castro, attended by [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[C. Wright Mills]] and [[I. F. Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro returned to Cuba on 28 September. He feared a U.S.-backed coup and in 1959 spent $120&amp;nbsp;million on Soviet, French and Belgian weaponry. Intent on constructing the largest army in Latin America, by early 1960 the government had doubled the size of the Cuban armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=300}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, and trained at least 50,000 supporters in combat techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1960, they created the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to weed out "counter-revolutionary" activities and could support the army in the case of invasion. They also organized health and education campaigns, and were a conduit for public complaints. Eventually, 80% of Cuba's population would be involved in the CDR.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=233}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=345}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro proclaimed the new administration a [[direct democracy]], in which the Cuban populace could assemble ''en masse'' at demonstrations and express their democratic will. As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] systems served the interests of socio-economic elites.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, critics condemned the new regime as un-democratic. The [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Christian Herter]] announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of communist rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties and the absence of freedom of speech and press.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=330}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro's government emphasised social projects to improve Cuba's standard of living, often to the detriment of economic development.&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=275&amp;ndash;276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Major emphasis was placed on education, and under the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=275&amp;ndash;276}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=324}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island, offering free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically.&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76"/&gt; A third aspect of the social programs was the construction of infrastructure; within the first six months of Castro's government, 600 miles of road had been built across the island, while $300&amp;nbsp;million was spent on water and sanitation schemes.&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76"/&gt; Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in a measure to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76"/&gt;

===The Bay of Pigs Invasion and embracing socialism: 1961&amp;ndash;62===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="There was... no doubts about who the victors were. Cuba's stature in the world soared to new heights, and Fidel's role as the adored and revered leader among ordinary Cuban people received a renewed boost. His popularity was greater than ever.

In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy to reduce its 300 staff, suspecting many to be spies. The U.S. responded by ending diplomatic relations, and increasing CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships trading with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=215&amp;ndash;216}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=353&amp;ndash;354, 365&amp;ndash;366}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Eisenhower and his successor [[John F. Kennedy]] supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961. On 15 April, CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]]'s bombed three Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as [[false flag]] misinformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=217&amp;ndash;220}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=363&amp;ndash;367}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=178&amp;ndash;179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=221&amp;ndash;222}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=371}}.&lt;/ref&gt; publicly proclaiming that "What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is that we have made a Socialist revolution under their noses". This was his first announcement that the government was socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=221&amp;ndash;222}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=369}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=180, 186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA and Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in [[Nicaragua]]. At night, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's [[Bay of Pigs]], and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch the counter-offensive, before taking personal control himself. After bombing the invader's ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade's surrender on 20 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=222&amp;ndash;225}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=370&amp;ndash;374}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=180&amp;ndash;184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated by a panel of journalists on live television, personally taking over questioning on 25 April. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=226&amp;ndash;227}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=375&amp;ndash;378}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=180&amp;ndash;184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained in the run-up to the invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many left Cuba for the United States and established themselves in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=185&amp;ndash;186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Che Guevara (left) and Castro, photographed by [[Alberto Korda]] in 1961.]]
Consolidating "Socialist Cuba", Castro united the MR-26-7, Popular Socialist Party and Revolutionary Directorate into a governing party based on the Leninist principle of [[democratic centralism]]: the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Integrated Revolutionary Organizations]] (''Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas'' - ORI), renamed the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=230}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=387, 396}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the USSR was hesitant regarding Castro's embrace of socialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=385&amp;ndash;386}}.&lt;/ref&gt; relations with the Soviets deepened. Castro sent Fidelito for a [[Moscow]] schooling and while the first Soviet technicians arrived in June&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=231}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=405}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1961, Castro proclaimed himself a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]], and in his Second Declaration of Havana he called on Latin America to rise up in revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1987|pp=230&amp;ndash;234}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|pp=395, 400&amp;ndash;401}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the U.S. successfully pushed the [[Organization of American States]] to expel Cuba; the Soviets privately reprimanded Castro for recklessness, although he received praise from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=232&amp;ndash;234}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=397&amp;ndash;401}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their ideological affinity with China, in the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], Cuba allied with the wealthier Soviets, who offered economic and military aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=232}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORI began shaping Cuba using the Soviet model, persecuting political opponents and perceived [[deviancy|social deviants]] such as prostitutes and homosexuals; Castro considered the latter a bourgeois trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials spoke out against his [[homophobia]], but many gays were forced into the [[Military Units to Aid Production]] (''Unidades Militares de Ayuda a la Producción'' - UMAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=188&amp;ndash;189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; something Castro took responsibility for and regretted as a "great injustice" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/08/31/cuba.castro.gays/index.html?hpt=T2 "Castro admits 'injustice' for gays and lesbians during revolution"], [[CNN]], Shasta Darlington, August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, Cuba's economy was in steep decline, a result of poor economic management and low productivity coupled with the U.S. trade embargo. Food shortages led to rationing, resulting in protests in [[Cárdenas, Cuba|Cárdenas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=233}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=203&amp;ndash;204, 410&amp;ndash;412}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Security reports indicated that many Cubans associated austerity with the "Old Communists" of the PSP, while Castro considered a number of them &amp;ndash; namely Aníbal Escalante and [[Blas Roca]] &amp;ndash; unduly loyal to Moscow. In March 1962 Castro removed the most prominent "Old Communists" from office, labelling them "sectarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=234&amp;ndash;236}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=403&amp;ndash;406}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal level, Castro was increasingly lonely, and his relations with Che Guevara became strained as the latter became increasingly anti-Soviet and pro-Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=258&amp;ndash;259}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=191&amp;ndash;192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Militarily weaker than [[NATO]], Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] [[MRBM]] nuclear missiles on Cuba to even the power balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=192&amp;ndash;194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief [[Ramiro Valdés]] knew the full plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide [[quarantine]] to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive, though Castro insisted they were defensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=238–239}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=425}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=196&amp;ndash;197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was left out of the negotiations, in which Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=198&amp;ndash;199}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling betrayed by Khrushchev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=239}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=443&amp;ndash;434}}, {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=199&amp;ndash;200, 203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, cease supporting dissidents, stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters and withdraw from [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]]. Presenting these demands to [[U Thant]], visiting [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=241&amp;ndash;242}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=444&amp;ndash;445}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1963, Castro received a personal letter from Khrushchev, inviting him to visit the USSR. Deeply touched, Castro arrived in April and stayed for five weeks. He visited 14 cities, addressed a [[Red Square]] rally and watched the [[May Day]] parade from the [[Kremlin]], was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Moscow State University]] and became the first foreigner to receive the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 245&amp;ndash;248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 204&amp;ndash;205.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Castro returned to Cuba with new ideas; inspired by Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', he amalgamated ''Hoy'' and ''Revolución'' into a new daily, ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; and oversaw large investment into Cuban sport that resulted in an increased international sporting reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 249&amp;ndash;250.&lt;/ref&gt; The government agreed to temporarily permit emigration for anyone other than males aged between 15 and 26, thereby ridding the government of thousands of opponents.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 213"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 his mother died. This was the last time his private life was reported in Cuba's press.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 250&amp;ndash;251.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Castro returned to Moscow, officially to sign a new five-year sugar trade agreement, but also to discuss the ramifications of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 263"&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations was officially renamed the "Cuban Communist Party" and published the membership of its Central Committee.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 213"/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="The greatest threat presented by Castro's Cuba is as an example to other Latin American states which are beset by poverty, corruption, feudalism, and plutocratic exploitation ... his influence in Latin America might be overwhelming and irresistible if, with Soviet help, he could establish in Cuba a Communist utopia."|source=— [[Walter Lippmann]], ''[[Newsweek]]'', April 27, 1964&lt;ref&gt;"Cuba Once More", by [[Walter Lippmann]], ''[[Newsweek]]'', April 27, 1964, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite Soviet misgivings, Castro continued calling for global revolution and the funding militant leftists. He supported Che Guevara's "Andean project", an unsuccessful plan to set up a guerrilla movement in the highlands of Bolivia, Peru and Argentina, and allowed revolutionary groups from across the world, from the [[Viet Cong]] to the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], to train in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered western-dominated Africa ripe for revolution, and sent troops and medics to aid [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]'s socialist regime in Algeria during the [[Sand war]]. He also allied with [[Alphonse Massemba-Débat]]'s socialist government in [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], and in 1965 Castro authorized Guevara to travel to [[Congo-Kinshasa]] to train [[Simba Rebellion|revolutionaries against the western-backed government]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 255&amp;ndash;256, 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 211&amp;ndash;212.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was personally devastated when Guevara was subsequently killed by CIA-backed troops in Bolivia in October 1967 and publicly attributed it to Che's disregard for his own safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 267&amp;ndash;268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Castro staged a [[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America|Tri-Continental Conference of Africa, Asia and Latin America]] in Havana, further establishing himself as a significant player on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; From this conference, Castro created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS), which adopted the slogan of "The duty of a revolution is to make revolution", signifying that Havana's leadership of the Latin American revolutionary movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro's increasing role on the world stage strained his relationship with the Soviets, now under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for passing state secrets to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 269&amp;ndash;270.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro ultimately relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 denounced the [[Prague Spring]] as led by a "fascist reactionary rabble" and praised the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 270&amp;ndash;271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 216&amp;ndash;217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Castro|first = Fidel|date=August 1968|url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1968/19680824.html|title = Castro comments on Czechoslovakia crisis|publisher=FBIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by China's [[Great Leap Forward]], in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closed all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denounced their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 227"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic stagnation and Third World politics: 1969–1974===

In January 1969, Castro publicly celebrated his administration's tenth anniversary in Revolution Square, using the occasion to ask the assembled crowds if they would tolerate reduced sugar rations, reflecting the country's economic problems.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 227"/&gt; The majority of the sugar crop was being sent to the USSR, but 1969's crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane; the government postponed the 1969/70 New Year holidays in order to lengthen the harvest. The military were drafted in, while Castro, and several other Cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats joined in.&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 273"&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The country nevertheless failed that year's sugar production quota. Castro publicly offered to resign, but assembled crowds denounced the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 230"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Cuba's economic problems, many of Castro's social reforms remained popular, with the population largely supportive of the "Achievements of the Revolution" in education, medical care and road construction, as well as the government's policy of "direct democracy".&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 230"/&gt; Cuba turned to the Soviets for economic help, and from 1970 to 1972, Soviet economists re-planned and organized the Cuban economy, founding the Cuban-Soviet Commission of Economic, Scientific and Technical Collaboration, while Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] visited in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 276&amp;ndash;277.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1972, Cuba joined the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (Comecon), an economic organization of socialist states, although this further limited Cuba's economy to agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, Florida-based dissident group [[Alpha 66]] sank two Cuban fishing boats and captured their crews, demanding the release of Alpha 66 members imprisoned in Cuba. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 230"/&gt; In April 1971, Castro gained international condemnation for ordering the arrest of dissident poet [[Herberto Padilla]]. When Padilla fell ill, Castro visited him {{when|date=February 2018}} in hospital. The poet was released after publicly confessing his guilt. Soon after, the government formed the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 232&amp;ndash;233.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1971 he made a [[Fidel Castro's state visit to Chile|state visit]] to [[Chile]], where Marxist President [[Salvador Allende]] had been elected as the head of [[Popular Unity (Chile)|a left-wing coalition]]. Castro supported Allende's socialist reforms, where he toured the country to give speeches and press conferences. Suspicious of right-wing elements in the Chilean military, Castro advised Allende to purge these before they led a coup. Castro was proven right; in 1973, Chile's military [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|led a coup d'état]], banned elections, executed thousands and established a military junta led by Commander-in-Chief [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 278&amp;ndash;280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 233&amp;ndash;236, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro proceeded to West Africa to meet socialist [[Guinea]]n President [[Sékou Touré]], where he informed a crowd of Guineans that theirs was Africa's greatest leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 237&amp;ndash;238.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on a seven-week tour visiting other leftist allies in Africa and Eurasia: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. On every trip he was eager to meet with ordinary people by visiting factories and farms, chatting and joking with them. Although publicly highly supportive of these governments, in private he urged them to do more to aid revolutionary movements in other parts of the world, in particular in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L0614-040, Berlin, Fidel Castro an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Fidel Castro and members of the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Politburo]] on his visit to the country in 1972.]]

In September 1973, he returned to [[Algiers]] to attend the Fourth Summit of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the [[Warsaw Pact]] and therefore should not be at the conference, particularly as he praised the Soviet Union in a speech that asserted that it was not imperialistic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 283&amp;ndash;284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Yom Kippur War]] broke out in October 1973 between [[Israel]] and an Arab coalition led by [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], Castro's government sent 4000 troops to prevent Israeli forces from entering Syrian territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Cuba broke off relations with Israel over the treatment of Palestinians during the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] and their increasingly close relationship with the United States. This earned him respect from leaders throughout the Arab world, in particular from the [[Libyan Arab Republic|Libyan]] socialist president [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who became his friend and ally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 239&amp;ndash;240.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Cuba experienced an economic boost, due primarily to the high international price of sugar, but also influenced by new trade credits with Canada, Argentina, and parts of Western Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on [[Henry Kissinger]]'s advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba's government called the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party, thereby officially announcing Cuba's status as a [[socialist state]]. It adopted a new constitution based on the Soviet model, abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro took the presidency of the newly created [[Council of State of Cuba|Council of State]] and [[Council of Ministers of Cuba|Council of Ministers]], making him both [[head of state]] and head of government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 240&amp;ndash;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{vanchor|Presidency}} 1976–2008==
[[Fidel Castro]] served as [[President of Cuba]] from 1976 to 2008. During this time he participated in many foreign wars including the Angolian Civil War, Mozambique Civil War, Ogaden War; as well as Latin American revolutions. Castro also faced other difficulties as the President of Cuba, for instance the economic crisis that occurred during the Reagan era.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}} As well as the deteriorating relationship between the Soviet Union and Cuba due to Glastnost and Perestroika (1980-1989). Beginning in the 1990s Castro led Cuba in an era of economic crisis known as the Special Period. During this decade Castro made many changes to the Cuban economy. Castro reformed Cuban Socialism due to the withdrawal of the Soviet's backing. Subsequently, Cuba received aid from Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], in a period known as The Pink Tide era (2000-2006). On July 31, 2006 Castro passed his duties as the President of Cuba to his brother Raúl due to health reasons. Castro renounced his positions as President of the Council of State and Commander and Chief at the February 24 National Assembly meetings in a letter dated February 18, 2008.

Castro considered Africa to be "the weakest link in the imperialist chain", in November 1975 he ordered 230 military advisors into Southern Africa to aid the Marxist [[MPLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]]. When the U.S. and South Africa stepped up their support of the opposition [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FLNA]] and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]], Castro ordered a further 18,000 troops to Angola, which played a major role in forcing a South African retreat.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 281, 284–287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling to Angola, Castro celebrated with President [[Agostinho Neto]], Guinea's [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] and Guinea-Bissaun President [[Luís Cabral]], where they agreed to support the Mozambique's [[FRELIMO|communist government]] against [[RENAMO]] in the [[Mozambique Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Castro visited Algeria and Libya and spent ten days with [[Muammar Gaddafi]] before attending talks with [[Yemeni Socialist Party|the Marxist government]] of [[South Yemen]]. From there he proceeded to Somalia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola where he was greeted by crowds as a hero for Cuba's role in opposing [[Apartheid]]-era South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 243–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the [[Ogaden War]] broke out as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; although a former ally of Somali President [[Siad Barre]], Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops under the command of General [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]], a measure Castro refused to support.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 245"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] in July 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro [[Carthage Foundation]]-funded [[Center for a Free Cuba]] has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 25, 2006|url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientgrants.php?recipientID=1892|title=Recipient Grants: Center for a Free Cuba|accessdate=August 25, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828125037/http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientgrants.php?recipientID=1892|archivedate=August 28, 2007|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Mary Anastasia |date=October 30, 2005 |url=http://www.cubacenter.org/media/news_articles/countingcastrosvictims.php |title=Counting Castro's Victims |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Center for a Free Cuba |accessdate=May 11, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008182246/http://www.cubacenter.org/media/news_articles/countingcastrosvictims.php |archivedate=October 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fidelcastro1978.jpg|thumb|left|Fidel Castro speaking in Havana, 1978.]]
In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was held in Havana, where Castro was selected as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders,&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 245" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourne. p. 294"&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref name="Bourne. p. 294" /&gt; Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President [[Luis Echeverría]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic embargo]] and stop [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] support for militant dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, Cuba's economy was again in trouble, following a decline in the market price of sugar and 1979's decimated harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gott 2004. p. 288"&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Desperate for money, Cuba's government secretly sold off paintings from national collections and illicitly traded for U.S. electronic goods through Panama.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 255"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of Cubans fled to Florida, who were labelled "scum" by Castro.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 250&amp;ndash;251.&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident, 10,000 Cubans stormed the Peruvian Embassy requesting asylum, and so the U.S. agreed that it would accept 3,500 refugees. Castro conceded that those who wanted to leave could do so from Mariel port. Hundreds of boats arrived from the U.S., leading to a mass exodus of 120,000; Castro's government took advantage of the situation by loading criminals and the mentally ill onto the boats destined for Florida.&lt;ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 295"&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 251&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] became U.S. President and then pursued a hard line anti-Castro approach,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 252"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1981, Castro was accusing the U.S. of [[biological warfare]] against Cuba.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 252"/&gt;

Although despising Argentina's [[National Reorganization Process|right wing military junta]], Castro supported them in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] against the United Kingdom and offered military aid to the Argentinians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro supported the leftist [[New Jewel Movement]] that seized power in [[Grenada]] in 1979, sent doctors, teachers, and technicians to aid the country's development, and befriended the Grenadine President [[Maurice Bishop]]. When Bishop was murdered in a Soviet-backed coup by hardline Marxist [[Bernard Coard]] in October 1983, Castro cautiously continued supporting Grenada's government. However, the U.S. used the coup as a basis for [[Invasion of Grenada (1983)|invading the island]]. Cuban soldiers died in the conflict, with Castro denouncing the invasion and comparing the U.S. to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro feared a U.S. invasion of Nicaragua and sent [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] to train the governing Sandinistas in [[guerrilla warfare]], but received little support from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 254&amp;ndash;255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he implemented measures to increase freedom of the press (''[[glasnost]]'') and economic decentralisation (''[[perestroika]]'') in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the [[socialist state]] and allow capitalist elements to regain control.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 256"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba,&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 256"/&gt; with [[Cuba–Soviet Union relations]] deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that ''perestroika'' meant an end to subsidies for Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 260&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring calls for liberalisation in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and [[Tony de la Guardia]], were investigated for corruption and complicity in [[Illegal drug trade|cocaine smuggling]], tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 258&amp;ndash;266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 279&amp;ndash;286.&lt;/ref&gt; On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking [[Cuban cigars]], helping to set an example for the rest of the populace.&lt;ref name="Coltman 224"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the [[Third World]] would never escape the debt that [[First World]] banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 255"/&gt;

[[File:Lobito Lighthouse 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Castro's image painted onto a now-destroyed lighthouse in [[Lobito]], [[Angola]], 1995.]]
By November 1987, Castro began spending more time on the Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favour of détente.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 257&amp;ndash;258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 276&amp;ndash;279.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Eastern Europe]], socialist governments fell to capitalist reformers between 1989 and 1991 and many western observers expected the same in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gott 286"&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with [[Manuel Noriega]]'s right-wing government in Panama &amp;ndash; despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega &amp;ndash; but it was overthrown in a [[United States invasion of Panama|U.S. invasion]] in December 1989.&lt;ref name="Gott 286"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 267&amp;ndash;268.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President [[Daniel Ortega]] and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded [[National Opposition Union]] in an election.&lt;ref name="Gott 286"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 268&amp;ndash;270.&lt;/ref&gt; With the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]], the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning [[Human rights in Cuba|Cuba's human rights violations]] at the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 270&amp;ndash;271.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Special Period: 1990&amp;ndash;2000===
[[File:Cuba.FidelCastro.02.jpg|thumb|Castro in front of a Havana statue of Cuban national hero [[José Martí]] in 2003.]]
With favourable trade from the Eastern bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a "[[Special Period|Special Period in Time of Peace]]." Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non-essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood began being used for cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open war, and that the country might have to resort to [[subsistence farming]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 287&amp;ndash;289.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, the [[Economy of Cuba|Cuban economy]] had declined by over 40% in under two years, with major food shortages, widespread malnutrition and a lack of basic goods.&lt;ref name="Gott 2004. p. 288"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro hoped for a restoration of [[Marxism–Leninism]] in the USSR, but refrained from backing the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup in that country]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 274&amp;ndash;275.&lt;/ref&gt; When Gorbachev regained control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further and Soviet troops were withdrawn in September 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dismantled]] as [[Boris Yeltsin]] abolished the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and introducing a capitalist [[multiparty democracy]]. Yeltsin despised Castro and developed links with the Miami-based [[Cuban American National Foundation]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. He welcomed western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended [[Manuel Fraga]] and took a particular interest in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies in the U.K., believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on low taxation and personal initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 290&amp;ndash;291.&lt;/ref&gt; He ceased support for foreign militants, refrained from praising [[FARC]] on a 1994 visit to Colombia and called for a negotiated settlement between the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] and the Mexican government in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 305&amp;ndash;306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Havana [[1991 Pan American Games|hosted]] the [[Pan-American Games]], which involved construction of [[Estadio Panamericano, Havana|a stadium]] and accommodation for the athletes; Castro admitted that it was an expensive error, but it was a success for Cuba's government. Crowds regularly shouted "Fidel! Fidel!" in front of foreign journalists, while Cuba became the first Latin American nation to beat the U.S. to the top of the gold-medal table.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 272&amp;ndash;273.&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Castro remained strong, and although there were small anti-government demonstrations, the Cuban opposition rejected the exile community's calls for an armed uprising.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 275&amp;ndash;276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1994, the most serious anti-Castro demonstration in Cuban history occurred in Havana, as 200 to 300 young men began throwing stones at police, demanding that they be allowed to emigrate to Miami. A larger pro-Castro crowd confronted them, and joined by Castro who informed the media that the men were anti-socials misled by U.S. media. The protests dispersed with no recorded injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 297&amp;ndash;299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 298&amp;ndash;299.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing that dissident groups would invade, the government organised the "War of All the People" defence strategy, planning a widespread guerrilla warfare campaign, and the unemployed were given jobs building a network of bunkers and tunnels across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 273&amp;ndash;274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro recognised the need for reform if Cuban socialism was to survive in a world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalised in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratisation was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 276&amp;ndash;281, 284, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 291&amp;ndash;294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro's government decided to diversify its economy into [[biotechnology]] and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 290, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on [[prostitution in Cuba]], fearing a political backlash.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic hardship led many Cubans to turn towards religion, both in the forms of [[Roman Catholicism]] and the syncretic faith of [[Santeria]]. Although he had long considered religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to the Church and religious institutions He recognised the psychological comfort it could bring, and religious people were permitted for the first time to join the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 278, 294&amp;ndash;295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he viewed the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro decided to organise a visit to Cuba by [[Pope John Paul II]], which took place in January 1998; ultimately, it strengthened the position of both the [[Roman Catholicism in Cuba|Church in Cuba]], and Castro's government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 309&amp;ndash;311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 306&amp;ndash;310.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Castro embraced [[environmentalism]], campaigning against the waste of natural resources and [[global warming]] and accused the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 312"&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; His government's environmentalist policies would prove highly effective; by 2006, Cuba was the only nation in the world which met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]], with an [[ecological footprint]] of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a [[Human Development Index]] of over 0.8 for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf untitled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Castro also became a proponent of the [[anti-globalisation]] movement. He criticized U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by [[multinational corporation|multinationals]].&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 312"/&gt; Castro also maintained his devout anti-apatheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, Castro was joined onstage by the South African political activist [[Nelson Mandela]], recently released from prison. Mandela would praise Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later attend Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]] through U.S. film.&lt;ref name="Coltman 2003. p. 312"/&gt;

Some of the earliest known diplomatic records are the [[Amarna letters]] written between the pharaohs of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] and the [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] rulers of [[Canaan]] during the 14th century BC. Following the [Battle of Kadesh] in ''c''. 1274 BC during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth dynasty]], the pharaoh of Egypt and the ruler of the [[Hittite Empire]] created one of the first known international peace treaties which survives in [[:File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Trattato di Qadesh fra ittiti ed egizi (1269 a.C.) - Foto G.

Some of these techniques would be used for the very first time in history and some of the battles they fought were on a truly massive scale. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304003519/http://www.history.com/schedule.do?action=daily&amp;linkDate=2008-05-141100&amp;timeZone=EST |archivedate=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations with the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (known to Italian states as the [[Sublime Porte]]) were particularly important to Italian states.&lt;ref name="Goffman, Daniel pp. 61"&gt;Goffman, Daniel. "Negotiating with the Renaissance State: The Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy." In The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 61–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maritime republics]] of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] depended less and less upon their nautical capabilities, and more and more upon the perpetuation of good relations with the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Goffman, Daniel pp. 61"/&gt; Interactions between various merchants, diplomats and clergy men hailing from the Italian and Ottoman empires helped inaugurate and create new forms of diplomacy and [[public policy|statecraft]]. Eventually the primary purpose of a diplomat, which was originally a negotiator, evolved into a persona that represented an autonomous state in all aspects of political affairs. It became evident that all other [[Head of state|sovereigns]] felt the need to accommodate themselves diplomatically, due to the emergence of the powerful political environment of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Goffman, Daniel pp. 61"/&gt; One could come to the conclusion that the atmosphere of diplomacy within the early modern period revolved around a foundation of conformity to Ottoman culture.

One of the earliest realists in [[international relations theory]] was the 6th century BC military strategist [[Sun Tzu]] (d. 496 BC), author of ''[[The Art of War]]''. He lived during a time in which rival states were starting to pay less attention to traditional respects of tutelage to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1050–256 BC) figurehead monarchs while each vied for power and total conquest. However, a great deal of diplomacy in establishing allies, bartering land, and signing peace treaties was necessary for each warring state, and the idealized role of the "persuader/diplomat" developed.&lt;ref&gt;

From the [[Battle of Baideng]] (200 BC) to the [[Battle of Mayi]] (133 BC), the [[Han Dynasty]] was forced to [[Heqin|uphold a marriage alliance]] and pay an exorbitant amount of tribute (in silk, cloth, grain, and other foodstuffs) to the powerful northern nomadic [[Xiongnu]] that had been consolidated by [[Modu Shanyu]]. After the Xiongnu sent word to [[Emperor Wen of Han]] (r. 180–157) that they controlled areas stretching from [[Manchuria]] to the [[Tarim Basin]] oasis city-states, a treaty was drafted in 162 BC proclaiming that everything north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] belong to nomads' lands, while everything south of it would be reserved for [[Han Chinese]]. The treaty was renewed no less than nine times, but did not restrain some Xiongnu ''[[tuqi]]'' from raiding Han borders. That was until the far-flung campaigns of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141–87 BC) which shattered the unity of the Xiongnu and allowed Han to conquer the [[Western Regions]]; under Wu, in 104 BC the Han armies ventured as far [[Fergana]] in [[Central Asia]] to battle the [[Yuezhi]] who had conquered [[Hellenistic|Hellenistic Greek areas]].

[[File:Zhigongtu full.jpg|thumb|upright=2.7|''[[Portraits of Periodical Offering]]'', a 6th-century Chinese painting portraying various emissaries; ambassadors depicted in the painting ranging from those of [[Hephthalites]], [[Persia]] to [[Langkasuka]], [[Baekje]](part of the modern Korea), [[Qiuci]], and Wo ([[Japan]]).]]

The [[Korea]]ns and [[Japan]]ese during the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) looked to the Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]] as the hub of civilization and emulated its central bureaucracy as the model of governance. The Japanese sent frequent embassies to China in this period, although they halted these trips in 894 when the Tang seemed on the brink of collapse. After the devastating [[An Shi Rebellion]] from 755 to 763, the Tang Dynasty was in no position to reconquer [[Central Asia]] and the [[Tarim Basin]]. After several conflicts with the [[Tibetan Kingdom|Tibetan Empire]] spanning several different decades, the Tang finally made a truce and signed a peace treaty with them in 841.

In the 11th century during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), there were cunning ambassadors such as [[Shen Kuo]] and [[Su Song]] who achieved diplomatic success with the [[Liao Dynasty]], the often hostile [[Khitan people|Khitan]] neighbor to the north. Both diplomats secured the rightful borders of the Song Dynasty through knowledge of [[cartography]] and dredging up old court archives. There was also a triad of warfare and diplomacy between these two states and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia Dynasty]] to the northwest of Song China (centered in modern-day [[Shaanxi]]). After warring with the [[Lý Dynasty]] of [[Vietnam]] from 1075 to 1077, Song and Lý [[History of the Song Dynasty#Relations with Lý of Vietnam and border conflict|made a peace agreement in 1082]] to exchange the respective lands they had captured from each other during the war.

Long before the Tang and Song dynasties, the Chinese had sent envoys into [[Central Asia]], [[India]], and [[Persia]], starting with [[Zhang Qian]] in the 2nd century BC. Another notable event in Chinese diplomacy was the Chinese embassy mission of [[Zhou Daguan]] to the [[Khmer Empire]] of [[Cambodia]] in the 13th century. Chinese diplomacy was a necessity in the distinctive period of [[Chinese exploration]]. Since the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), the Chinese also became heavily invested in sending diplomatic envoys abroad on [[Sailing|maritime]] missions into the [[Indian Ocean]], to India, Persia, [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]]. Chinese maritime activity was increased dramatically during the commercialized period of the Song Dynasty, with new nautical technologies, many more private ship owners, and an increasing amount of economic investors in overseas ventures.

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1294) the Mongols created something similar to today's diplomatic passport called paiza. The paiza were in three different types (golden, silver, and copper) depending on the envoy's level of importance. With the paiza, there came authority that the envoy can ask for food, transport, place to stay from any city, village, or clan within the empire with no difficulties.

From the 17th century the [[Qing Dynasty]] concluded a series of treaties with [[Czarist]] [[Russia]], beginning with the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] in the year 1689. This was followed up by the [[Aigun Treaty]] and the [[Convention of Peking]] in the mid-19th century.

As European power spread around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries so too did its diplomatic model, and Asian countries adopted European diplomatic systems.

=====Ancient India=====
[[History of India|Ancient India]], with its kingdoms and dynasties, had a long tradition of diplomacy. The oldest treatise on statecraft and diplomacy, ''[[Arthashastra]]'', is attributed to [[Kautilya]] (also known as [[Chanakya]]), who was the principal adviser to [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya dynasty]] who ruled in the 3rd century BC. It incorporates a theory of diplomacy, of how in a situation of mutually contesting kingdoms, the wise king builds alliances and tries to checkmate his adversaries. The envoys sent at the time to the courts of other kingdoms tended to reside for extended periods of time, and ''Arthashastra'' contains advice on the deportment of the envoy, including the trenchant suggestion that 'he should sleep alone'. The highest morality for the king is that his kingdom should prosper.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ancient.eu/Arthashastra/ Cristian Violatti, "Arthashastra" (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Ancient Greece and Hellenistic period====
{{Main|Proxeny}}
{{further|:Category:Ancient Greek diplomats}}

The [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek city-states]] on some occasions sent envoys to each other in order to negotiate specific issues, such as war and peace or commercial relations, but did not have diplomatic representatives regularly posted in each other's territory. However, some of the functions given to modern diplomatic representatives were in Classical Greece filled by a [[proxenos]], who was a citizen of the host city having a particular relations of friendship with another city&amp;nbsp;– a relationship often hereditary in a particular family. In times of peace diplomacy was even conducted with rivals such as the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia, though the latter eventually succumbed to the invasions of the Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great]]. The latter was also adept at diplomacy, realizing that in order to conquer certain territories it was important for his Macedonian and subject Greek troops to mingle and intermarry with native populations. For instance, Alexander even took a [[Sogdia]]n woman of [[Bactria]] as his wife, [[Roxana]], after the siege of the [[Sogdian Rock]], in order to quell the region (which had been troubled by local rebels such as [[Spitamenes]]). Diplomacy was a necessary tool of statecraft for the great [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic kingdoms]] such as the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] and [[Seleucid Empire]], who fought several wars in the Near East and often negotiated a peace treaty through [[Marriage of state|alliances through marriage]].

====Byzantine Empire====
[[File:Bulgarian king Omurtag sends delegation to Byzantine emperor Michael II from the Chronicle of John Skylitzes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Omurtag]], [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|ruler of Bulgaria]], sends delegation to [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Michael II]] (Madrid Skylitzes, Biblioteca Nacional de España, Madrid).]]
{{main|Byzantine diplomacy}}
The key challenge to the Byzantine Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its sundry neighbors, including the [[Georgians]], [[Caucasian Iberians|Iberians]], the [[Germanic peoples]], the [[Bulgars]], the [[Slavs]], the [[Armenians]], the [[Huns]], the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], the [[Franks]], the [[Lombards]], and the [[Arabs]], that embodied and so maintained its imperial status. All these neighbors lacked a key resource that Byzantium had taken over from Rome, namely a formalized legal structure. When they set about forging formal political institutions, they were dependent on the empire. Whereas classical writers are fond of making a sharp distinction between peace and war, for the Byzantines diplomacy was a form of war by other means. With a regular army of 120,000-140,000 men after the losses of the seventh century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabriel|first=Richard A.|title=The Great Armies of Antiquity|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0-275-97809-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC|ref=harv|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haldon|first=John F.|title=Warfare, State and Society in the Byzantine World, 565-1204|location=London, United Kingdom|publisher=University College London Press|year=1999|isbn=1-85728-495-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5G1rV7tS79sC|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; the empire's security depended on activist diplomacy.

Byzantium's "[[Bureau of Barbarians]]" was the first foreign intelligence agency, gathering information on the empire’s rivals from every imaginable source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonucci|first=Michael|title=War by Other Means: The Legacy of Byzantium|journal=History Today|volume=43|issue=2|date=February 1993|url=http://www.historytoday.com/michael-antonucci/war-other-means-legacy-byzantium|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on the surface a protocol office—its main duty was to ensure foreign envoys were properly cared for and received sufficient state funds for their maintenance, and it kept all the official translators—it clearly had a security function as well. ''On Strategy'', from the 6th century, offers advice about foreign embassies: "[Envoys] who are sent to us should be received honourably and generously, for everyone holds envoys in high esteem. Their attendants, however, should be kept under surveillance to keep them from obtaining any information by asking questions of our people."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennis|1985|loc=Anonymous, ''Byzantine Military Treatise on Strategy'', para. 43, p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval and Early Modern Europe====
{{further|:Category:Medieval diplomats|Niccolò Machiavelli|The Prince}}
In Europe, early modern diplomacy's origins&lt;ref&gt;Historical discontinuity between diplomatic practice of the ancient and medieval worlds and modern diplomacy has been questioned; see, for instance, [[Pierre Chaplais]], ''English Diplomatic Practice in the Middle Ages'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pR58WnXzh-wC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22study+of+English+diplomatic+practice%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; are often traced to the states of [[Northern Italy]] in the early [[Renaissance]], with the first embassies being established in the 13th century. [[Milan]] played a leading role, especially under [[Francesco Sforza]] who established permanent embassies to the other city states of Northern Italy. [[Tuscany]] and [[Venice]] were also flourishing centres of diplomacy from the 14th century onwards. It was in the [[Italian Peninsula]] that many of the traditions of modern diplomacy began, such as the presentation of an ambassador's credentials to the [[head of state]].

===Rules of modern diplomacy===
[[File:Talleyrand-perigord.jpg|thumb|left|[[France|French]] diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] is considered one of the most skilled diplomats of all time.]]

From Italy the practice was spread across Europe. Milan was the first to send a representative to the court of France in 1455. However, Milan refused to host French representatives fearing espionage and that the French representatives would intervene in its internal affairs. As foreign powers such as France and [[Spain]] became increasingly involved in Italian politics the need to accept emissaries was recognized. Soon the major European powers were exchanging representatives. Spain was the first to send a permanent representative; it appointed an ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]] (i.e. England) in 1487. By the late 16th century, permanent missions became customary. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]], however, did not regularly send permanent legates, as they could not represent the interests of all the German princes (who were in theory all subordinate to the Emperor, but in practice each independent).

In 1500-1700 rules of modern diplomacy were further developed.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Zeller, "French diplomacy and foreign policy in their European setting." in ''The New Cambridge Modern History'' (1961) 5:198-221&lt;/ref&gt; French replaced Latin from about 1715. The top rank of representatives was an [[ambassador]]. At that time an ambassador was a nobleman, the rank of the noble assigned varying with the prestige of the country he was delegated to. Strict standards developed for ambassadors, requiring they have large residences, host lavish parties, and play an important role in the court life of their host nation. In Rome, the most prized posting for a Catholic ambassador, the French and Spanish representatives would have a retinue of up to a hundred. Even in smaller posts, ambassadors were very expensive. Smaller states would send and receive [[Envoy (title)|envoys]], who were a rung below ambassador. Somewhere between the two was the position of [[minister plenipotentiary]].

Diplomacy was a complex affair, even more so than now. The ambassadors from each state were ranked by complex levels of precedence that were much disputed. States were normally ranked by the title of the sovereign; for Catholic nations the emissary from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was paramount, then those from the [[Monarchy|kingdoms]], then those from [[Duchy|duchies]] and [[Principality|principalities]]. Representatives from [[republic]]s were ranked the lowest (which often angered the leaders of the numerous German, Scandinavian and Italian republics). Determining precedence between two kingdoms depended on a number of factors that often fluctuated, leading to near-constant squabbling.

Ambassadors were often nobles with little foreign experience and no expectation of a career in diplomacy. They were supported by their embassy staff. These professionals would be sent on longer assignments and would be far more knowledgeable than the higher-ranking officials about the host country. Embassy staff would include a wide range of employees, including some dedicated to espionage. The need for skilled individuals to staff embassies was met by the graduates of universities, and this led to a great increase in the study of [[international law]], French, and history at universities throughout Europe.
[[File:Berlin .Gendarmenmarkt .Deutscher Dom 010.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of the Acts of the [[Congress of Vienna]].]]

At the same time, permanent foreign ministries began to be established in almost all European states to coordinate embassies and their staffs. These ministries were still far from their modern form, and many of them had extraneous internal responsibilities. Britain had two departments with frequently overlapping powers until 1782. They were also far smaller than they are currently. France, which boasted the largest foreign affairs department, had only some 70 full-time employees in the 1780s.

The elements of modern diplomacy slowly spread to [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]], arriving by the early 18th century. The entire edifice would be greatly disrupted by the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent years of warfare. The revolution would see commoners take over the diplomacy of the French state, and of those conquered by revolutionary armies. Ranks of precedence were abolished. [[Napoleon]] also refused to acknowledge diplomatic immunity, imprisoning several British diplomats accused of scheming against France.

After the fall of Napoleon, the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 established an international system of [[diplomatic rank]]. Disputes on precedence among nations (and therefore the appropriate diplomatic ranks used) were first addressed at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)#Diplomacy|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818, but persisted for over a century until after [[World War II]], when the rank of [[ambassador]] became the norm. In between that time, figures such as the German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] were renowned for international diplomacy.

Diplomats themselves and historians often refer to the foreign ministry by its address: the Ballhausplatz (Vienna), the Quai d’Orsay (Paris), the Wilhelmstraße (Berlin); and Foggy Bottom (Washington). For imperial Russia to 1917 it was the Choristers’ Bridge (St Petersburg). The "Consulta" referred to the Italian ministry of Foreign Affairs, based in the [[Palazzo della Consulta]] from 1874 to 1922.&lt;ref&gt;David Std Stevenson, "The Diplomats" in Jay Winter, ed. ''The Cambridge History of the First World War: Volume II: The State'' (2014) vol 2 p 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic immunity==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
{{Main|Diplomatic immunity}}

The sanctity of diplomats has long been observed. This sanctity has come to be known as [[diplomatic immunity]]. While there have been a number of cases where diplomats have been killed, this is normally viewed as a great breach of honour. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often wreak horrific vengeance against any state that violated these rights.

Diplomatic rights were established in the mid-17th century in Europe and have spread throughout the world. These rights were formalized by the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which protects diplomats from being persecuted or [[prosecute]]d while on a diplomatic mission. If a diplomat does commit a serious crime while in a host country he may be declared as [[persona non grata]] (unwanted person). Such diplomats are then often tried for the crime in their homeland.

Diplomatic communications are also viewed as sacrosanct, and diplomats have long been allowed to carry documents across borders without being searched. The mechanism for this is the so-called "[[diplomatic bag]]" (or, in some countries, the "diplomatic pouch"). While radio and digital communication have become more standard for embassies, diplomatic pouches are still quite common and some countries, including the United States, declare entire shipping containers as diplomatic pouches to bring sensitive material (often building supplies) into a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/ofm/customs/c37011.htm|title=Diplomatic Pouches|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of hostility, diplomats are often withdrawn for reasons of personal safety, as well as in some cases when the host country is friendly but there is a perceived threat from internal dissidents. Ambassadors and other diplomats are sometimes recalled temporarily by their home countries as a way to express displeasure with the host country. In both cases, lower-level employees still remain to actually do the business of diplomacy.

==Espionage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Diplomacy is closely linked to espionage or gathering of intelligence. Embassies are bases for both diplomats and spies, and some diplomats are essentially openly acknowledged spies. For instance, the job of [[military attaché]]s includes learning as much as possible about the military of the nation to which they are assigned. They do not try to hide this role and, as such, are only invited to events allowed by their hosts, such as military parades or [[air show]]s. There are also deep-cover spies operating in many embassies. These individuals are given fake positions at the embassy, but their main task is to illegally gather intelligence, usually by coordinating spy rings of locals or other spies. For the most part, spies operating out of embassies gather little intelligence themselves and their identities tend to be known by the opposition. If discovered, these diplomats can be expelled from an embassy, but for the most part [[counter-intelligence]] agencies prefer to keep these agents ''in situ'' and under close monitoring.

The information gathered by spies plays an increasingly important role in diplomacy. Arms-control treaties would be impossible without the power of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and agents to monitor compliance. Information gleaned from espionage is useful in almost all forms of diplomacy, everything from trade agreements to border disputes.

==Diplomatic resolution of problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Various processes and procedures have evolved over time for handling diplomatic issues and disputes.

===Arbitration and mediation===
[[File:Restabelecimento das relações entre Portugal e o Brazil.jpg|thumb|Brazilian President [[Prudente de Morais]] shakes hands with King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] during the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Brazil and Portugal after talks mediated by [[Queen Victoria]], 16 March 1895.]]
Nations sometimes resort to [[international arbitration]] when faced with a specific question or point of contention in need of resolution. For most of history, there were no official or formal procedures for such proceedings. They were generally accepted to abide by general principles and protocols related to [[international law]] and justice.

Sometimes these took the form of formal arbitrations and mediations. In such cases a commission of diplomats might be convened to hear all sides of an issue, and to come some sort of ruling based on international law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Diplomacy_The_Only_Legitimate_Way_of_Con.html?id=Q-wcAgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Diplomacy, The Only Legitimate Way of Conducting International Relations|last=Fahim Younus|first=Dr. Mohammad|publisher=Lulu|year=2010|isbn=9781446697061|location=|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, much of this work is often carried out by the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]], or other formal commissions, agencies and tribunals, working under the [[United Nations]]. Below are some examples.
* [[Hay-Herbert Treaty]] Enacted after the United States and Britain submitted a dispute to international mediation about the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].

===Conferences===
[[File:Berliner kongress.jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Werner]], ''Congress of Berlin'' (1881): Final meeting at the [[Reich Chancellery]] on 13 July 1878.]]
Other times, resolutions were sought through the convening of international conferences. In such cases, there are fewer ground rules, and fewer formal applications of international law. However, participants are expected to guide themselves through principles of international fairness, logic, and protocol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some examples of these formal conferences are:
* [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815)&amp;nbsp;– After [[Napoleon]] was defeated, there were many diplomatic questions waiting to be resolved. This included the shape of the map of [[Europe]], the disposition of political and [[nationalism|nationalist]] claims of various ethnic groups and nationalities wishing to have some political autonomy, and the resolution of various claims by various European powers.
* The [[Congress of Berlin]] (June 13&amp;nbsp;– July 13, 1878) was a meeting of the European Great Powers' and the Ottoman Empire's leading statesmen in Berlin in 1878. In the wake of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], 1877–78, the meeting's aim was to reorganize conditions in the Balkans.

===Negotiations===
[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Celebrating the signing of the Camp David Accords: [[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Anwar El Sadat]]]]

Sometimes nations convene official negotiation processes to settle a specific dispute or specific issue between several nations which are parties to a dispute. These are similar to the conferences mentioned above, as there are technically no established rules or procedures. However, there are general principles and precedents which help define a course for such proceedings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some examples are

* [[Camp David Accords]] – Convened in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter of the United States, at Camp David to reach an agreement between Prime Minister Mechaem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. After weeks of negotiation, agreement was reached and the accords were signed, later leading directly to the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979.
* [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] – Enacted after President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] brought together the delegates from [[Russia]] and [[Japan]], to settle the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Roosevelt's personal intervention settled the conflict, and caused him to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==Diplomatic recognition==
[[File:Palugyayov palác Pražská 1.jpg|thumb|Palugyay Palace in [[Bratislava]] - one of buildings of the [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic]]. ([[Slovakia]] as a new independent state was recognized by the international community during January 1993.)]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}

[[Diplomatic recognition]] is an important factor in determining whether a nation is an independent state. Receiving recognition is often difficult, even for countries which are fully sovereign. For many decades after its becoming independent, even many of the closest allies of the [[Dutch Republic]] refused to grant it full recognition.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Today there are [[List of unrecognized countries|a number]] of independent entities without widespread diplomatic recognition, most notably the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (ROC)/Taiwan]] on [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan Island]]. Since the 1970s, most nations have stopped officially recognizing the ROC's existence on Taiwan, at the insistence of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Currently, the United States and other nations maintain informal relations through ''[[de facto]]'' embassies, with names such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]]. Similarly, Taiwan's de facto embassies abroad are known by names such as the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]. This was not always the case, with the US maintaining official diplomatic ties with the ROC, recognizing it as the sole and legitimate government of "all of China" until 1979, when these relations were broken off as a condition for establishing official relations with PR China.

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] has its own diplomatic service, however Palestinian representatives in most Western countries are not accorded diplomatic immunity, and their missions are referred to as Delegations General.

Other unrecognized regions which claim independence include [[Abkhazia]], [[Liberland]], [[Transnistria]], [[Somaliland]], [[South Ossetia]], [[Nagorno Karabakh]], and the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]. Lacking the economic and political importance of Taiwan, these territories tend to be much more diplomatically isolated.

Though used as a factor in judging sovereignty, Article 3 of the [[Montevideo Convention]] states, "The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by other states."{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Informal diplomacy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Informal diplomacy (sometimes called [[Track II diplomacy]]) has been used for centuries to communicate between powers. Most diplomats work to recruit figures in other nations who might be able to give informal access to a country's leadership. In some situations, such as between the [[United States]] and the People's Republic of China a large amount of diplomacy is done through semi-formal channels using [[Interlocutor (politics)|interlocutors]] such as academic members of [[thinktank]]s. This occurs in situations where governments wish to express intentions or to suggest methods of resolving a diplomatic situation, but do not wish to express a formal position.

Track II diplomacy is a specific kind of informal diplomacy, in which non-officials (academic scholars, retired civil and military officials, public figures, social activists) engage in dialogue, with the aim of conflict resolution, or confidence-building. Sometimes governments may fund such Track II exchanges. Sometimes the exchanges may have no connection at all with governments, or may even act in defiance of governments; such exchanges are called Track III.

On some occasion a former holder of an official position continues to carry out an informal diplomatic activity after retirement. In some cases, governments welcome such activity, for example as a means of establishing an initial contact with a hostile state of group without being formally committed. In other cases, however, such informal diplomats seek to promote a political agenda different from that of the government currently in power. Such informal diplomacy is practiced by former US Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Bill Clinton]] and by the former [[Israel]]i diplomat and minister [[Yossi Beilin]] (see [[Geneva Initiative]]).

==Small state diplomacy==
[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Wilhelmstrasse, Tschechische Botschaft 01.jpg|thumb|Czech (originally Czechoslovak) Embassy in Berlin.]]

Small state diplomacy is receiving increasing attention in diplomatic studies and [[international relations]]. Small states are particularly affected by developments which are determined beyond their borders such as [[climate change]], [[water security]] and shifts in the [[global economy]]. Diplomacy is the main vehicle by which small states are able to ensure that their goals are addressed in the global arena. These factors mean that small states have strong incentives to support international cooperation. But with limited resources at their disposal, conducting effective diplomacy poses unique challenges for small states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Types==
There are a variety of diplomatic categories and diplomatic strategies employed by organizations and governments to achieve their aims, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

===Preventive diplomacy===
{{main|Preventive diplomacy}}
Preventive diplomacy through quiet means (as opposed to “gun-boat diplomacy” backed by threat of force or “public diplomacy” which makes use of publicity). It is also understood that circumstances may exist in which the consensual use of force (notably preventive deployment) might be welcomed by parties to a conflict with a view to achieving the stabilization necessary for diplomacy and related political processes to proceed. This is to be distinguished from the use of “persuasion”, “suasion”, “influence”, and other non-coercive approaches explored below.

“Preventive diplomacy”, in the view of one expert, is “the range of peaceful dispute resolution approaches mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter [on the pacific settlement of disputes] when applied before a dispute crosses the threshold to armed conflict.” It may take many forms, with different means employed. One form of diplomacy which may be brought to bear to prevent violent conflict (or to prevent its recurrence) is “quiet diplomacy”. When one speaks of the practice of quiet diplomacy, definitional clarity is largely absent. In part this is due to a lack of any comprehensive assessment of exactly what types of engagement qualify, and how such engagements are pursued. On the one hand, a survey of the literature reveals no precise understanding or terminology on the subject. On the other hand, concepts are neither clear nor discrete in practice. Multiple definitions are often invoked simultaneously by theorists, and the activities themselves often mix and overlap in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins and Packer|first=Craig and John|date=2006|title=Options and Techniques for Quiet Diplomacy|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/29575.pdf|journal=Edita Stockholm|volume=|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public diplomacy===
{{main|Public diplomacy}}
''Public diplomacy'' is exercising influence through communication with the general public in another nation, rather than attempting to influence the nation's government directly. This communication may take the form of [[propaganda]], or more benign forms such as [[citizen diplomacy]], individual interactions between average citizens of two or more nations. Technological advances and the advent of [[digital diplomacy]] now allow instant communication with foreign public, and methods such as [[Facebook diplomacy]] and [[Twitter diplomacy]] are increasingly used by world leaders and diplomats.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Soft power===
{{main|Soft power}}
''Soft power'', sometimes called ''hearts and minds'' diplomacy, as defined by [[Joseph Nye]], is the cultivation of relationships, respect, or even admiration from others in order to gain influence, as opposed to more coercive approaches. Often and incorrectly confused with the practice of official diplomacy, soft power refers to non-state, culturally attractive factors that may predispose people to sympathize with a foreign culture based on affinity for its products, such as the American entertainment industry, schools and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2006/02/23/think-again-soft-power/|title=Think Again: Soft Power|last=Nye|first=Joseph|date=2006|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A country's soft power can come from three resources: its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority).

===Economic diplomacy===
{{main|Economic diplomacy}}
''Economic diplomacy'' is the use of foreign aid or other types of economic policy as a means to achieve a diplomatic agenda.

===Counterinsurgency diplomacy===
''Counterinsurgency diplomacy'' or Expeditionary Diplomacy, developed by diplomats deployed to civil-military stabilization efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, employs diplomats at tactical and operational levels, outside traditional embassy environments and often alongside military or peacekeeping forces. Counterinsurgency diplomacy may provide political environment advice to local commanders, interact with local leaders, and facilitate the governance efforts, functions and reach of a host government.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Dan. [http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume5/september_2007/9_07_2.html "Counterinsurgency Diplomacy: Political Advisors at the Operational and Tactical levels." ], &lt;u&gt;Military Review&lt;/u&gt;, May–June 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174920/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume5/september_2007/9_07_2.html |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gunboat diplomacy===
{{main|Gunboat diplomacy}}
''Gunboat diplomacy'' is the use of conspicuous displays of military strength as a means of intimidation in order to influence others.

It must also be stated that since gunboat diplomacy lies near the edge between peace and war, victory or defeat in an incident may foster a shift into political and psychological dimensions: a standoff between a weaker and a stronger state may be perceived as a defeat for the stronger one. This was the case in the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|Pueblo Incident]] in which the Americans lost face with regard to North Korea.

===Migration diplomacy===
''Migration diplomacy'' refers to the use of [[human migration]] in a state's foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=2017|title=Migration diplomacy in the Global South: cooperation, coercion and issue linkage in Gaddafi’s Libya|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2017.1350102?journalCode=ctwq20|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=38 |issue=10|pages=2367–2385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientist Myron Weiner argued that international migration is intricately linked to states' international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Myron|date=1985|title=On International Migration and International Relations|jstor=1973247|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=11|issue=3|pages=441–455|doi=10.2307/1973247}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Kelly Greenhill]] has identified how states may employ 'weapons of mass migration' against target states in their foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/726824355|title=Weapons of mass migration : forced displacement, coercion, and foreign policy|last=1970-|first=Greenhill, Kelly M.,|date=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801458668|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|oclc=726824355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration diplomacy may involve the use of [[refugee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teitelbaum|first=Michael S.|date=1984/ed|title=Immigration, refugees, and foreign policy|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/immigration-refugees-and-foreign-policy/F6D59D4F0CBFEAE6C87BC79BD4ECF3EA|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=429–450|doi=10.1017/S0020818300026801|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenhill|first=Kelly M.|date=September 2002|title=Engineered Migration and the Use of Refugees as Political Weapons: A Case Study of the 1994 Cuban Balseros Crisis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-2435.00205|journal=International Migration|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=39–74|doi=10.1111/1468-2435.00205|issn=0020-7985}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic migrant|labor migrants]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|title=Labor Migrants as Political Leverage: Migration Interdependence and Coercion in the Mediterranean|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/advance-article/doi/10.1093/isq/sqx088/4986742|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|doi=10.1093/isq/sqx088}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[diaspora]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shain|first=Yossi|date=1994|title=Ethnic Diasporas and U.S. Foreign Policy|jstor=2152533|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=109|issue=5|pages=811–841|doi=10.2307/2152533}}&lt;/ref&gt; in states' pursuit of international diplomacy goals.

===Appeasement===
{{main|Appeasement}}
''Appeasement'' is a policy of making concessions to an aggressor in order to avoid confrontation; because of its failure to prevent World War 2, appeasement is not considered a legitimate tool of modern diplomacy.

===Nuclear diplomacy===

''Nuclear diplomacy'' is the area of diplomacy related to preventing [[nuclear proliferation]] and [[nuclear war]]. One of the most well-known (and most controversial) philosophies of nuclear diplomacy is [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD).

==Diplomatic training institutions==

{{main|List of diplomatic training institutions}}
Most countries provide professional training for their diplomats and some run establishments specifically for that purpose. Private institutions also exist as do establishments associated with organisations like the European Union and the United Nations.

The '''Edusave''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 教育储蓄) programme is part of a scheme implemented for [[education in Singapore]] by the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] (MOE) for Singapore. Its stated aim is to maximise opportunities for all [[Singapore]]an children.  The scheme aims to reward students who perform well or who make good progress in their academic and non-academic work, and provides students and schools who qualify with funds to pay for enrichment programmes or to purchase additional resources. It is applicable to Singaporeans between the age of 6 and 16 and studying full-time at government, government-aided or independent schools, [[junior college]]s (JC) and Centralised Institutes (CI), [[Institute of Technical Education]] (ITE) or [[special education]] schools.

The Edusave Endowment Fund is built from various contributions from the [[government of Singapore]]. The fund is invested into by the government and the interest earned is used to finance the contributions, grants and awards given to schools and students.

There are 3 main aspects of Edusave: the Edusave Pupils Fund, Edusave Grants and Edusave Scholarships and Awards.

==Edusave Pupils Fund==
Singaporeans between the age of 6 and 16 at the point of school admission will automatically be given an Edusave account and receive a yearly contribution from the Government’s Edusave Pupils Fund until they reach 16. However, only the first, second and third child were eligible for the Edusave account prior to 2004. In 2005, the Government will contribute $170 and $200 to the Edusave account of each eligible student at primary and secondary level respectively.

From 2014, eligibility to receive Edusave contributions has been extended to all Singaporean children aged 7 to 16, including those not studying in MOE-funded schools, such as those enrolled in the madrasahs, privately funded schools, as well as children who are home-schooled or residing overseas.

In addition, the Edusave contributions and top-ups have been revised to $200 for primary-level students and $240 for secondary-level students.

For Singaporeans who are currently not enrolled in any MOE-funded school, the annual Edusave contribution rate will be pegged to that of a typical student in a MOE-funded school. Those aged 7 to 12 will receive the quantum applicable to primary level students, and those aged 13 to 16 will receive the quantum applicable to secondary level students. For those who are required to sit for the [[Primary School Leaving Examination]] (PSLE) as part of the conditions for exemption from the Compulsory Education Act, they will receive contributions at the primary-level rate until they fulfil their PSLE requirements. Students above the age of 16 who are still in secondary school will also receive the top-up.

==Edusave Grants==
Government-supported special education schools and the Institute of Technical Education receive annual Edusave grants to be used to organise common enrichment programmes or purchase additional resources which benefit students.

==Edusave Scholarships and Awards==
There are various reward programmes for students who meet certain academic rankings as well, some of which is targeted at low-income households.

The Edusave Scholarships (ES) include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ministry of Education, Singapore: Edusave Scholarships|url = http://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/edusave/scholarships/|website = www.moe.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-12-03|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208145632/http://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/edusave/scholarships/|archivedate = 2015-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3112">{{Policy Debate}}

In [[policy debate]], the '''flow''' ('''flowing''' in verb form) is the name given to a specialized form of notetaking or [[shorthand]], which debaters use to keep track of all of the [[argument]]s in the round. 

It incorporates specialized and individualized abbreviations, notations, and symbols that allow debaters to keep up with the rapid speed of delivery in most speeches while making a record of as much as possible. Some examples of these abbreviations used on a flow are "DA" for a [[disadvantage]] and "K" for a [[kritik]] (critique).

==Utilization and restrictions==
[[File:Judge Flowing Debate.jpg|thumb|Judge flowing a debate]]
Flowing can be done on paper or on a laptop using a generic spreadsheet program such as [[Microsoft Excel]]. Debaters have utilized more specialized software or integrative programs that work in tandem with [[Microsoft Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kang|first=Caspian|title=High School Debate at 350 WPM|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_debateteam/|work=Wired Magazine|publisher=wired.com|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have been usually designed by debaters and former debaters for flowing.

In collegiate debate, computers may be used in any round, however some high school tournaments and organizations do not allow their use. Those tournaments that follow the [[National Forensic League]] regulations may or may not allow laptops depending on the district. Debaters often prefer to use legal paper to be able to capture the numerous arguments read on each position. Numerous sheets of paper (or tabs in a spreadsheet) are used each round as debaters normally use one sheet for each different type of argument read. Debaters often save flows from previous rounds to keep records of both affirmative cases and strategies used by opponents.

==Backflowing==

After the [[Structure of policy debate|1NC]] and 2AC, the [[negative (policy debate)|second negative speaker]] and the [[affirmative (policy debate)|first affirmative speaker]] will "'''backflow'''" their partner who has just given a speech. This can often be accomplished during the cross-examination or the prep time preceding the next speech.  The 1NC requires backflowing because they need to flow what issues they are going to argue ('take') in the 1NR and the 2AC needs backflowing because they need a flow of these arguments so that they can carry the argument to the end of the round ('extend') during the 2AR. 

The 1AC is not backflowed because most affirmative debaters are presumably already familiar with the arguments or they have flowed the arguments before or during the speech.  The negative block is not backflowed because the 1NR is [[preparation time|prepping]] during the 2NC and the 1NR has no further speeches. The rest of the rebuttals are not backflowed for the same reason.

'''Food First''', also known as the '''Institute for Food and Development Policy''', is a nonprofit organization based in [[Oakland, California]], [[United States|USA]]. Founded in 1975 by [[Frances Moore Lappé]] and Joseph Collins, it describes itself as a "people's think tank and education-for-action center".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodfirst.org/node/256 2001 Progress Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929234033/http://www.foodfirst.org/node/256 |date=2006-09-29 }}, ''Food First News and Views'', Winter 2002, Volume 25, Number 84. Accessed online 21 September 2006. The specific self-description comes from "About Food First" in that issue; see page footer for alternative name; Oakland address is on same page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its mission is “to eliminate the injustices that cause hunger”. According to the Food First website, its main goal is to forge [[food sovereignty]] for human rights and sustainable livelihoods, and to do so it has three programs of development: building local agri-foods systems, farmers forming food sovereignty, and democratizing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodfirst.org/fr/about/programs|title=Food First Website|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is meant to offer policy analysis on poverty, agriculture, and development, and is highly critical of the policies implemented by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The organization focuses on the [[Green Revolution]] which was supported in the 1970s and which did not produce the development people hoped for. Instead it put in place a system that has high input-costs, but does not produce a yield much higher than traditional farming methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurian-Sherman|first=Doug|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/failure-to-yield.pdf|title=Failure to Yield: Evaluating the Performance of Genetically Engineered Crops|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a recent resurgence of Green Revolution ideas, especially with the large-scale support of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and high-yield-variety agriculture. Food First claims that these policies will only further global inequalities, and has produced several policy briefs stating that the way to establish fair and effective development is through local sustainable agriculture.

==History and organizational structure==
The organization began in 1975 as the Institute for Food and Development Policy (IFDP). The institute was founded by [[Frances Moore Lappé]] and Joseph Collins, and actually began in New York in Lappe’s basement before relocating to San Francisco, and then later to Oakland where it is still located. In 1977 the IFDP published its first work, ''Food First: Beyond the Myth of Scarcity'', and has since continued publishing policy briefs and analysis on the world food system and the inequalities that are caused by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodfirst.org/fr/history|title=Food First History|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's Food First is managed by a board of trustees that has five members with backgrounds in different non-profit organizations. They have a shared vision of creating a more grass-roots based system of economic development through the endorsement of local and sustainable agriculture systems. The organization's president is Joyce E. King, whose work in sociology has focused on “women's participation in grass roots social change movements in Africa, South America and France”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodfirst.org/fr/about/who|title=Food First: Who We Are|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Board of Trustees, Food First has six staff members who work on the organization's policy briefs. The staff's executive director is [[Eric Holt-Gimenez]], who has published several books on global inequalities and the global food system, including ''Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice'', which outlines seven steps to solving the world food crisis. Finally, the organization benefits from the support of the general public through interns and volunteers who contribute to the process of policy research. Food First is a think-tank composed of many individuals from many different backgrounds, who share the organization's aim of eliminating global inequalities through the rethinking of the world's emphasis on industry-based economics, and shifting the paradigm towards a more inclusive form of economic development.

==Programs and guiding philosophy==
The organization has three programs that it implements in order to achieve this aim:
# Tackling class and racial inequalities in the agri-foods industry. There is a form of structural racism in the United States, as one study found “there were 30% fewer supermarkets in low-income areas than in higher-income areas, and these low-income areas had 55% less grocery store square footage than their wealthier income counterparts. The study also found that the levels of unmet food demand in these communities were as high as 70%”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holt-Gimenez|first=Eric|title=Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice|year=2009|publisher=Pambazuka Print|location=Cape Town|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an accessible availability of cheap, healthy foods, low-income communities show high levels of diabetes and heart problems. Food First attempts to counter this structural racism by providing information and analysis, helping spread awareness and debate, and by helping create a national coalition of urban communities of color for food security. By studying international economic development and U.S. inequalities and development, Food First is taking a holistic approach that aims to change the way that we view the relationship between access to food and economic development.
# Helping farmers form food sovereignty by creating projects such as The Campesino in Mexico and Central America, and by working with Via Campesina. These groups focus on farmer alternatives to the corporate agrifoods industry, helping farmers educate each other on strategies for alternatives. Food First’s strategy emphasizes the farmer’s sovereignty and acknowledges their self-determination. They believe a main flaw of the Green Revolution of the past and of the new Green Revolution is that the transnational institutions that implemented it failed to consult the people that would be affected by it the most, small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanyabwoya|first=Damas|title=Tanzania: New Agriculture Plan Ignores Small Farmers|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201103170045.html|accessdate=6 July 2011|newspaper=The Citizen|date=16 March 2011|via=allAfrica |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing power and sovereignty in the hands of the disenfranchised is crucial for development. 
# Empowering farmers by giving them a voice. This program focuses on the structural causes of hunger and poverty, supporting advocacy groups that are against the agrifoods industry and are in support of consumer-led alternatives that allow for "justice, equity and ecological sustainability". Food First helps through projects such as No Full Tanks with Empty Bellies: The Food and Fuel Sovereignty Campaign. This project aims to inform the public about the negative impacts caused by bio-fuels. The spread of advocacy is Food First’s key role, providing information that is essential for awareness, debate, and change. Lack of food sovereignty, poverty, and hunger, are all interrelated structural problems that take a collective effort to change; Food First aims to bring this collective together to spark this change.

Food First believes that world hunger is not an inevitable phenomenon that occurs simply because there is not enough food produced worldwide. Instead, it argues that there is an enormous surplus of food produced by corporate agri-businesses based in wealthy developed nations, and this enormous surplus of food is a reflection on broader global inequalities that deeply impact and harm marginalized third-world countries worldwide. While challenging the idea that world hunger exists because there is simply not enough food produced or available, Holz-Gimenez and Patel explain that, “…according to the FAO, with record grain harvests in 2007, there was more than enough food in the world to feed everyone-at least 1.5 times current demand”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holt-Gimenez|first=Eric|title=Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice|year=2009|publisher=Pambazuka Print|location=Cape Town|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food First argues that world hunger is not caused by food production shortages, and in fact points the blame to systemic causes such as speculation on the market, investments in large-scale GMO farms that have higher input-costs, and the bio-fuels market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holt-Gimenez|first=Eric|series=Policy Brief No. 16|url=http://www.foodfirst.org/sites/www.foodfirst.org/files/pdf/PB%2016%20World%20Food%20Crisis.pdf|title=The World Food Crisis: What's behind it and what can we do about it|publisher=Foodfirst.org|accessdate=6 July 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; By illustrating these ideas, Food First tries to bring to the table a new approach to global hunger that they believe has been largely ignored.

Food First supports a "bottom-up" approach to solving world hunger, asserting the ability of all countries to feed their own people if they focus on agriculture for [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence]] rather than for export.

Food First strongly opposes the policies of they deem to be [[free market]] institutions such as the [[World Trade Organization]], [[World Bank]], and [[International Monetary Fund]]. {{As of|2004}}, it is active in the campaign against the proposed [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]].

It also incorporates information from [http://www.mapmaster.co.jp/eng/ Toyota Mapmaster Inc.] which updates digital mapping information and is used by various international companies.

The subscription service replaces the need to periodically update in-car navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the drivers cellphone with a data download plan associated with the cellphone.

A G-Book application can be installed on select mobile devices, thereby providing the technology without having to purchase a vehicle installed with the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g-book.com/pc/smart_G-BOOK/default.asp|title=G-BOOK|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009015312/http://g-book.com/pc/smart_G-BOOK/default.asp|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proprietary service with additional functions for the Lexus division, '''G-Link''', debuted on Japan-market Lexus models starting in model year 2006.&lt;ref name=glink&gt;{{cite web|url=http://response.jp/issue/2005/0523/article70927_1.html|title=Lexus G-Link|publisher=response.jp|accessdate=2 August 2009|language=Japanese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716035902/http://response.jp/issue/2005/0523/article70927_1.html|archivedate=16 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota made available G-Book devices as optional equipment in all [[Japanese domestic market]] Toyota, Daihatsu and Lexus vehicles starting with model year 2007. An article posted by "Response.jp" stated in an article on July 15, 2009 that Toyota was introducing G-Book in a specially identified Toyota Camry to be sold in Beijing, China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://response.jp/issue/2009/0715/article127374_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718044748/http://response.jp/issue/2009/0715/article127374_1.html |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }} Camry "G-Book" sold in China (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2009 the G-Book-equipped Camry is available in [[Shanghai]] as well. G-Book was also introduced on Lexus models in China in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexus.com.cn/about_lexus/latest_news/release_20090908.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924013518/http://www.lexus.com.cn/about_lexus/latest_news/release_20090908.asp |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan ([http://g-book.com/pc/smart_G-BOOK/smartpass.asp T-Connect Japan]), and recently in Middle East countries (Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and UAE) [http://www.toyota-connect.com/pc/en/index.html T-Connect] is being offered as a download from Apple's AppStore and Google Play as a subscription telematics service, which uses the G-Book architecture.

==Technology==
There are three versions of G-Book being offered; G-Book mX (and G-Book mX Pro), G-Book Alpha (and G-Book Alpha Pro) and G-Book.

Some of the services G-Book offers are a Safety and Security service, which aids in requesting a tow truck and vehicle location service, Live Navigation where an operator gives turn-by-turn directions, Information Service which provides news, weather forecasts and stock market information, Communication Service that offers the ability to send and receive [[Webmail|web based e-mail]], and post and read on message boards, E-commerce Service, that allows merchandise to be purchased from the GAZOO Shopping Mall, and a live operator is available through OSS (Operator Support Service) for various issues.

One of the features offered exclusively on G-Book mX is Probe Communication Traffic Information. According to the press release from Toyota dated April 10, 2007, "This unique Toyota traffic information service gathers driving data – such as speed and position – from vehicles equipped with G-Book mX to provide drivers with alternate routes for avoiding traffic congestion.  Because it makes use of the on-board DCM (data communications module), the information gathering capability of this service is superior to similar systems, which rely solely on cell phones, and efficiently stores information about traffic congestion in real time at the G-Book Center.  In this way the Probe Communication Traffic Information service supplements [[Vehicle Information and Communication System]] (VICS) information with updates on traffic congestion, providing drivers with highly accurate predictions about the current traffic situation and suggestions for the best alternate routes to take."&lt;ref name="TOYOTA: News Releases"/&gt; This feature is being marketed as an ability to drive eco-friendly, by helping to avoid pollution created by cars idling in traffic and allowing the driver to reach their destination sooner, and affording the opportunity to turn the car off, limiting emissions being added to the atmosphere.

The wireless communications for Japan-market cars are handled by the DCM and transmits and receives information on the wireless network owned by Japanese [[telecommunications]] provider [[KDDI|KDDI Corporation]] headquartered in [[Okinawa]]. The cellular platform used is the [[CDMA2000]] 1x (CDMA 1X) method, and it is possible to receive up to 144kbit/s data. The same DCM is used for China-market models, thus the network provider for China-market G-Book services is [[China Telecom]]. Map updates and music downloads are not available for China-market G-Book-enabled cars, and traffic information is only available in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

G-Book Alpha Pro, mX Pro DCM-only, and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (CDMA 1X WIN) can send up to 2.4Mbit/s of data, and the DCM supports hands-free calls. The DCM model is also equipped with its own GPS receiver and features, to track a stolen vehicle, and it also has an emergency notification ability to transmit the location of airbag deployment.

===Secure Digital (SD) card-compatible terminal===
According to a press release from Toyota dated August 28, 2002 "Navigational maps and the on-board terminal's basic software are stored in a Secure Digital (SD) card. The card can be inserted into "E-TOWER" terminals at convenience stores and other locations to download local or new maps or to upgrade the on-board terminal's basic software. Music and games can also be downloaded, and the SD card is compatible with commercially available audio players, digital cameras and PDAs that use SD cards, making it possible to share content such as music files, images and games." E-Tower locations can be found at numerous locations, including [[Circle K]] of Japan.&lt;ref name="www2.toyota.co.jp"/&gt;

==G-Link==
[[File:Lexus GS450h 02.JPG|thumb|Japanese-market Lexus GS 450h with G-Link equipped touchscreen system.]]

Offered at Lexus' Japanese domestic market launch in 2005, G-Link is the proprietary Lexus telematics system for the Japanese market. G-Link has a different software configuration versus G-Book, particularly in its link to the 24-hour Lexus Owner's Desk hotline, and is offered standard for the first three years of ownership.&lt;ref name=glink/&gt; Other aspects of the system at its 2005 launch were based on G-Book Alpha capabilities.&lt;ref name=glink/&gt; The G-Link software runs off of the vehicle's [[hard disc drive]] navigation system and song library, and includes traffic updates, HelpNet compatibility, and the G-Security service. The G-Security service includes cellphone notification of vehicle lock and position status.  A G-Sound music distribution service offers samples and downloading to the vehicle's hard disc drive of [[MP3]]s from different genres. A U.S. equivalent of the G-Link system with similar but not identical functionality, called Lexus Enform with Safety Connect, was launched in 2009.&lt;ref name=jal/&gt;

In 2006, Japanese media reported that a Lexus-branded cellphone was also being produced with compatibility for the G-Link system.&lt;ref name=kddi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/eyeonasia/archives/2006/10/introducing_the.html |title=Introducing the Lexus phone |publisher=BusinessWeek |accessdate=2 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022210141/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/eyeonasia/archives/2006/10/introducing_the.html |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cellphone service would be produced in conjunction with the [[KDDI]] telecommunications service provider, and is called [http://www.au.kddi.com/english/whyau/ "au"], using Apple and Sony products.&lt;ref name=kddi/&gt;

'''Garrett James Hardin''' (April 21, 1915 – September 14, 2003) was an American [[ecologist]] and [[philosopher]] who warned of the dangers of overpopulation. His exposition of the [[tragedy of the commons]], in a famous 1968 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref name=tragedy /&gt; called attention to "the damage that innocent actions by individuals can inflict on the environment".&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt; He is also known for Hardin's First Law of Human Ecology: "We can never do merely one thing. Any intrusion into nature has numerous effects, many of which are unpredictable."&lt;ref name=Miller1993 /&gt;{{rp|112}}

==Biography==
Hardin received a B.S. in [[zoology]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1936 and a PhD in [[microbiology]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1941 where his dissertation research addressed symbiosis among microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |date=1944-07-01 |title=Symbiosis of Paramecium and Oikomonas |journal=Ecology |language=en |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=304–311 |doi=10.2307/1931278 |issn=1939-9170|jstor=1931278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1946, he served there as Professor of [[Human Ecology]] from 1963 until his (nominal) retirement in 1978. He was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].

== Major works and positions ==
A major focus of his career, and one to which he returned repeatedly, was the issue of [[human overpopulation]].  This led to writings on controversial subjects such as advocating [[abortion]] rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Stalking the Wild Taboo |publisher=William Kaufmann, Inc. |date=1973 |pages=3–9 |chapter=Chapter 1: I Become an Abortionist |isbn=978-0-913232-03-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned him criticism from the [[Right-wing politics|political right]], and advocating [[eugenics]] by [[forced sterilization]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and strict limits to non-western immigration, which earned him criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]].  In his essays, he also tackled subjects such as [[Conservation ethic|conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Naked Emperors |publisher=William Kaufmann, Inc. |date=1982 |pages=190–195 |chapter=Chapter 22: Conservation's Secret Question |isbn=978-0-86576-032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Naked Emperors |publisher=William Kaufmann, Inc. |date=1982 |pages=49–57 |chapter=Chapter 7: "Scientific Creationism" — Marketing Deception as Truth |isbn=978-0-86576-032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neomalthusian approach and "Tragedy of the commons" ===
In 1968 Hardin applied his conceptual model developed in his essay "The tragedy of the commons" to human population growth, the use of the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, and the welfare state.&lt;ref name=tragedy /&gt; His essay cited an 1833 pamphlet by the English economist [[William Forster Lloyd]] which included an example of herders sharing a common parcel of land, which would lead to overgrazing.

Hardin blamed the [[welfare state]] for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports over-breeding as a fundamental human right, [[Malthusian catastrophe]] is inevitable. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."&lt;ref name=tragedy /&gt;{{rp|1244}} However, [[environmental history|environmental historians]] [[Joachim Radkau]], [[Alfred Thomas Grove]] and [[Oliver Rackham]] denounced Hardin "as an American with no notion at all how Commons actually work".&lt;ref name=Radkau /&gt;

In addition, Hardin's pessimistic outlook was subsequently contradicted by [[Elinor Ostrom]]'s later work on success of co-operative structures like the management of [[common land]],&lt;ref name=Araral /&gt; for which she shared the 2009 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] with [[Oliver E. Williamson]]. In contrast to Hardin, they stated neither commons or "Allmende" in the generic nor classical meaning are bound to fail; to the contrary "the wealth of the commons" has gained renewed interest in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=BollierHelfrich /&gt; Hardin's work was also criticized&lt;ref name=Dasgupta /&gt; as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the [[demographic transition]], and for failing to distinguish between [[Common-pool resource|common property]] and [[Open access (infrastructure)|open access]] resources.&lt;ref name=Ciriacy /&gt;

It should be noted that Lloyd's original example, re-discovered by Hardin, could only apply to unregulated use of land regarded as a common resource. Normally, rights of use of Common land in England and Wales were, and still are, closely regulated, and available only to "commoners". If excessive use was made of common land, for example in overgrazing, a common would be "stinted", that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure; thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. Controls on usage can help mitigate the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt;

=== Living Within Limits ===
In 1993, Garrett Hardin published ''Living Within Limits: Ecology, Economics, and Population Taboos'', which he described at the time as a summation of all his previous works.  The book won the 1993 [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]]. In the book, he argues that the natural sciences are grounded in the concept of limits (such as the [[speed of light]]), while social sciences, such as economics, are grounded in concepts that have no limits (such as the widespread "infinite-Earth" economic models). He notes that most of the more notable scientific (as opposed to political) debates concerning [[ecological economics]] are between natural scientists, such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], and economists, such as [[Julian Simon]], one of Ehrlich's most well known and vocal detractors. A strong theme throughout the book is that economics, as a discipline, can be as much about mythology and [[ideology]] as it is about real science.

Hardin goes on to label those who reflexively argue for growth as "growthmaniacs",&lt;ref name=stalkers /&gt; and argues against the institutional faith in ''[[exponential growth]]'' on a finite planet. Typical of Hardin's
writing style, he illustrates exponential growth by way of a Biblical metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/docs/hardin_living_within_limits_ch_8.pdf |title=''Living Within Limits'', Chapter 8 |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |date=1993 |website= |publisher= |access-date=8 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[compound interest]], or "[[usury]]", he starts from the infamous "[[thirty pieces of silver]]" and, using 5% compounded interest, finds that after around 2,000 years, "every man, woman, and child would be entitled to only (!) 160,000 earth-masses of gold". As a consequence, he argues that any economy based on long-term compound interest must eventually fail due to the physical and mathematical impossibility of long-term exponential growth on a finite planet.&lt;ref name=HardinLiving /&gt; Hardin writes, "At this late date millions of people believe in the fertility of money with an ardor seldom accorded to traditional religious doctrines".&lt;ref name=HardinLiving /&gt;{{rp|67}} He argues that, contrary to some socially-motivated claims, population growth is also exponential growth, therefore even a little would be disastrous anywhere in the world, and that even the richest nations are not immune.

==Personal life==
===Participation in death-with-dignity movement and suicide===
Hardin, who suffered from a heart disorder and the aftermath of childhood [[poliomyelitis]],&lt;ref&gt;Uh, not sure what to put here. Personal acquaintance? Keynote Address 'We must learn again for ourselves what we have inherited', Wilderness Conference, SF, 1970, or perhaps *A 110. The economics of wilderness.
Natural History, 78(6):20-27. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, Jane, who suffered from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]], were members of [[Compassion &amp; Choices|End-of-Life Choices]], formerly known as the [[Hemlock Society]].

Believing in individuals' choice of when to die, they committed [[suicide]] in their [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] home in September 2003, shortly after their 62nd wedding anniversary. He was 88 and she was 81.&lt;ref name=SBNews /&gt;

===Controversy===
====Racist sentiments and association with white nationalism====
Hardin caused controversy for his support of [[anti-immigrant]] causes during his lifetime and possible connectons to the [[white nationalist]] movement. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] noted that Hardin served on the board of the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] and  [[Social Contract Press]] and co-founded the anti-immigraton [[Californians for Population Stabilization]] and The Environmental Fund, which according to the SPLC "served to lobby Congress for nativist and isolationist policies."&lt;ref name="Garrett Hardin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/garrett-hardin |title=Garrett Hardin |website=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |language=en |access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1974, he published the article "Living on a Lifeboat" in ''[[BioScience]]'' magazine, arguing that contributing food to help the [[Famines in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] would add to overpopulation, which he considered the root of [[Ethiopia]]'s problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin, Garrett|title=Commentary: Living on a Lifeboat|journal=BioScience|volume=24|issue=10|date=October 1974|pages=561–568|doi=10.2307/1296629|url=http://csmgeo.csm.jmu.edu/geollab/idls/lifeboat.pdf|jstor=1296629|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardin at points also supported [[racist]] and [[white nationalist]] thought. In 1994, he was one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]",&lt;ref name="gottfredson" /&gt; an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to [[race and intelligence]] following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. It claimed that the average IQ among the [[African-American]] population was only 85, amongst other pseudo-scientific and [[Scientific racism|scientifically racist]]- based claims.&lt;ref name="Garrett Hardin"/&gt; On February 11, 1998, he debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] at the University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name=DebateVideo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Hardin's last book ''The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia'' (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on "unqualified reproductive rights" and argued that [[affirmative action]] is a form of [[racism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3551">[[Image:Goldene Handfeste Berns.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Golden Charter of Bern.]]

The '''Golden Charter of Bern''' (also: ''[[Golden Bull]]'', in [[German language|German]]: ''Goldene Handfeste'' or ''Berner Handfeste'') is a medieval [[charter]] purporting to have been issued by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. It establishes the [[town privileges]] of [[Bern]] (now the capital of [[Switzerland]]), making it an [[Imperial Free City]] and, effectively, an [[Independence|independent]] state. The charter is dated to 1218, but is now believed by most scholars to be a Bernese forgery from the middle of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=HDS&gt;{{HDS|209|Bern city}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charter's 54 articles provided for extensive privileges, including the free election of the [[Schultheiss]] (i.e., [[mayor]]) and the right to autonomously legislate. It also provided for the establishment of an Imperial [[Mint (coin)|Mint]], which was established in 1228 at the latest, to coin ''Berner [[Pfennig]]e''. These rights were formally confirmed by King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf I]] in 1274, and the issue of the charter's authenticity thus made moot. The charter is called "golden" due to its impressive (and undoubtedly authentic) golden bull, or [[seal (device)|seal]]. Its face shows Frederick on the throne with his Emperor's [[regalia]], circumscribed "Frederick, by the Grace of God Roman King, ever increasing the Empire, [[King of Sicily]]."

[[Image:Bulle der Goldenen Handfeste.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The bull of the Golden Charter.]]

The issue of whether the charter — regarded as Bern's founding document for centuries — is authentic has been contentious among historians since the 1860s. Modern researchers now seem to agree that it is a forgery done on behalf of Bern's government during the middle of the 13th century, done to establish in writing the rights the city had in practice seized decades previously. They point out that the exceptional liberties granted by the charter were very atypical for the time, and that the writing seems to match that of one writer in the [[Frienisberg Abbey|Frienisberg]] monastery. Monasteries, at that time, were masters of the ''[[pia fraus]]'', the "pious fraud" of falsifying documents to match a dead benefactor's supposed intent. On the other hand, [[X-ray]] analysis in 2002 did not reveal any indication that (as had been assumed) the authentic bull had been removed from an authentic document and then re-affixed to the Bernese charter.

The '''Government of the Slovak Republic''' ({{lang-sk|Vláda Slovenskej republiky}}) is the head of the executive branch of state in [[Slovakia]].

It is led by the [[Prime Minister of Slovakia]], who is nominated by the [[President of Slovakia]], and is usually the leader of majority party or of majority coalition after an election to the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic]]. The Cabinet appointed by the president on recommendation of the prime minister must gain a vote of confidence in the National Council.

==Role and powers of the Government==

As the chief formulator of the nation's public policy under the [[Constitution of Slovakia|Slovak Constitution]], the Government has the authority to make major policy on the matters of national economy and social security.&lt;ref name="gov.sk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.gov.sk/government-of-the-slovak-republic/|title=Government of the Slovak Republic|author=|date=|work=gov.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting in the best interests of the nation, it is responsible for meeting the Government programme objectives within the scope of the adopted national budget. The main functions of the Government also include making proposals on the state budget, preparing the annual closing balance sheet, and issue government regulations and decrees under power given to it by law.  One of the Government's duties is the formulation and management of the nation's foreign policy.&lt;ref name="gov.sk"/&gt; It submits draft Bills to the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|National Council]] (the Slovak parliament), which are frequently preceded by nationwide discussions and consultations with the relevant organizations. As established by law, the Government can discuss in its proceedings a confidence vote motion, cases of pardoning criminal offenders, and appointment or removal from office of senior civil servants.&lt;ref name="gov.sk"/&gt;

==Cabinet==
The Cabinet is made up of the Prime Minister, presiding over it, his or her Deputies and Government Ministers. The Cabinet is appointed by the President of the Slovak Republic on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. For its policy and administration the members of the Cabinet are responsible to the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|National Council]] (the Slovak parliament).

==Current Cabinet==
Following the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016]], the current prime minister, [[Robert Fico]], has been serving with his government, the [[Third Fico Cabinet]], since 23 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20128205/new-government-meets-for-first-time-appoints-state-secretaries.html|title=New government meets for first time, appoints state secretaries|newspaper=[[The Slovak Spectator]]|date=31 March 2016|access-date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Metropolitan Green Belt among the green belts of England.svg|thumbnail|[[Green belt (United Kingdom)|Green belts in England]]]]
A '''green belt''' or '''greenbelt''' is a policy and land use zone designation used in [[land use planning]] to retain areas of largely undeveloped, wild, or agricultural [[landscape|land]] surrounding or neighbouring urban areas. Similar concepts are '''[[greenway (landscape)|greenways]]''' or '''green wedges''' which have a linear character and may run through an urban area instead of around it. In essence, a green belt is an invisible line designating a border around a certain area, preventing development of the area and allowing wildlife to return and be established.

==Purposes==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
In those countries which have them, the stated objectives of green belt policy are to:
* Protect natural or semi-[[natural environment]]s;
* Improve [[air quality]] within [[urban area|urban]] areas;
* Ensure that urban dwellers have access to countryside, with consequent educational and recreational opportunities; and
* Protect the unique character of [[rural]] communities that might otherwise be absorbed by expanding [[suburbs]].

The green belt has many benefits for people:
* Walking, camping, and biking areas close to the cities and towns.
* Contiguous [[habitat]] network for wild [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[wildlife]].
* Cleaner air and water
* Better land use of areas within the bordering cities.

The effectiveness of green belts differs depending on location and country. They can often be eroded by [[urban rural fringe]] uses and sometimes, development 'jumps' over the green belt area, resulting in the creation of "satellite towns" which, although separated from the city by green belt, function more like suburbs than independent communities.

==History==
The [[Old Testament]] outlines a proposal for a green belt around the [[Levite]] towns in the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 35:1–5&lt;/ref&gt; Moses [[Maimonides]] expounded that the greenbelt plan from the Old Testament referred to all towns in ancient Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna Torah, Zeraim, Shmittah &amp; Yovel 13:4–5&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] established a green belt around [[Medina]]. He did this by prohibiting any further removal of trees in a 12-mile long strip around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, Munawwar (2005). ''Islamic Perspectives on Sustainable Development''. p.&amp;nbsp;27. Published jointly by Palgrave Macmillan, University of Bahrain, and Islamic Research and Training Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1580 [[Elizabeth I of England]] banned new building in a 3-mile wide belt around the [[City of London]] in an attempt to stop the spread of plague. However, this was not widely enforced and it was possible to buy dispensations which reduced the effectiveness of the proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Underground to Everywhere |last=Halliday |first= Stephen|year=2004 |publisher=Sutton Publishing Limited |isbn= 978-0-7509-3843-3|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the term emerged from continental Europe where broad boulevards were increasingly used to separate new development from the centre of historic towns; most notably the [[Ringstraße]] in [[Vienna]]. Green belt policy was then pioneered in the [[United Kingdom]] confronted with ongoing [[rural flight]]. Various proposals were put forward from 1890 onwards but the first to garner widespread support was put forward by the [[London Society]] in its "Development Plan of Greater London" 1919. Alongside the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] they lobbied for a continuous belt (of up to two miles wide) to prevent urban sprawl, beyond which new development could occur.

There are fourteen green belt areas in the UK covering 16,716&amp;nbsp;km² or 13% of England, and 164&amp;nbsp;km² of [[Scotland]]; for a detailed discussion of these, see [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|Green belt (UK)]]. Other notable examples are the [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)|Ottawa Greenbelt]] and [[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)|Golden Horseshoe Greenbelt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ourgreenbelt.ca | title=Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ontario]], Canada.

Accessed 28 June 2008, unavailable February, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The more general term in the United States is '''green space''' or '''greenspace''', which may be a very small area such as a [[park]].

The dynamic [[Adelaide Park Lands]], measuring approximately 7.6&amp;nbsp;km² surround, unbroken, the city centre of [[Adelaide]]. On the fringe of the eastern suburbs, an expansive natural greenbelt in the [[Adelaide Hills]] acts as a growth boundary for Adelaide and cools the city in the hottest months.

The concept of "green belt" has evolved in recent years to encompass not only "Greenspace" but also "Greenstructure" which comprises all urban and peri-urban greenspaces, an important aspect of sustainable development in the 21st century. The [[European Commission]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20060329125020/http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11-book/index.htm COST Action C11]
([[COST]] – European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is undertaking
[https://web.archive.org/web/20060329125428/http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11-book/pdfs/b-Cases.pdf "Case studies in Greenstructure Planning"] involving 15 European countries.

An act of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]] from 1994 has declared a series of parks in  [[Stockholm]] and the adjacent municipality of [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] to its north a "national city park" called [[Royal National City Park]].

==Criticism==
===House prices===
When paired with a city which is economically prospering, homes in a Green belt may have been motivated by or result in considerable premiums. They may also be more economically resilient as popular among the retired and less attractive for short-term renting of modest homes.&lt;ref name=harford&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345494016&amp;view=excerpt ''The Undercover Economist'', [[Tim Harford]], 2007, Random House. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the city itself demand exceeds supply in housing, green belt homes compete directly with much city housing wherever such green belt homes are well-connected to the city.&lt;ref name=harford/&gt; Further, they in all cases attract a future-guaranteed premium for protection of their views, recreational space and for the preservation/conservation value itself.&lt;ref name=harford/&gt; Most also benefit from higher rates of urban [[gardening]] and [[farming]], particularly when done in a [[community]] setting,  which have positive effects on [[nutrition]], [[Physical fitness|fitness]], [[self-esteem]], and happiness, providing a benefit for both physical and mental health, in all cases easily provided or accessed in a green belt.&lt;ref&gt; Sarah Wakefield, Fiona Yeudall, Carolin Taron, Jennifer Reynolds, Ana Skinner, [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/2/92.short "Growing urban health: Community gardening in South-East Toronto"] Health Promotion International, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Government planners also seek to protect the green belt as its local farmers are engaged in [[peri-urban agriculture]] which augments [[carbon sequestration]], reduces the urban [[heat island]] effect, and provides a [[habitat]] for [[organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoi-Fei Mok, Virginia G. Williamson, James R. Grove, Kristal Burry, S. Fiona Barker, Andrew J. Hamilton,[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13593-013-0156-7 "Strawberry fields forever? Urban agriculture in developed countries: a review"] Agronomy for Sustainable Development, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Peri-urban agriculture may also help [[recycle]] urban [[greywater]] and other products of [[wastewater]], helping to conserve water and reduce waste.&lt;ref&gt;Hoi-Fei Mok, Virginia G. Williamson, James R. Grove, Kristal Burry, S. Fiona Barker, Andrew J. Hamilton, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13593-013-0156-7 "Strawberry fields forever? Urban agriculture in developed countries: a review"] Agronomy for Sustainable Development, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The housing market contrasts with more uncertainty and [[economic liberalism]] inside and immediately outside of the belt:&lt;ref name=harford/&gt; Green Belt homes have by definition nearby protected landscapes.&lt;ref name=harford/&gt; Local residents in affluent parts of a Green Belt, as in parts of the city, can be assured of preserving any localised [[bourgeois]] [[status quo]] present and so assuming the Green Belt is not from the outset an area of more [[social housing]] proportionately than the city, it naturally tends toward greater economic wealth. In a protracted housing shortage, reduction of the Green Belt is one of the possible solutions.  All such solutions may be resisted however by private [[landlords]] who profit from a scarcity of housing, for example by lobbying to restrain new housing across the city. The stated motivation and benefits of the green belt might be well-intentioned (public health, social gardening and agriculture, environment), but inadequately realised relative to other solutions.  

Inherently partial critics include [[Mark Pennington]] and the economics-heavy think tanks such as the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/liberating-the-land-the-case-for-private-land-use-planning Liberating the Land: The Case for Private Land-Use Planning | Institute of Economic Affairs]. Iea.org.uk (2002-03-18). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; who would see a reduction in many Green Belts. Such studies focus on widely inherent limitations of Green Belts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  In most examples only a small fraction of the population uses the green belt for leisure purposes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The IEA study claims that a green belt is not strongly causally linked to clean air and water.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Rather, they view the ultimate result of the decision to green-belt a city as one to prevent housing demand within the zone to be met with supply,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; thus exacerbating high housing prices and stifling competitive forces in general. &lt;!-- This paragraph could be a lot clearer and shorter without so much marxist baggage --&gt;&lt;!--I completely agree. I have just kept that in for balance with the positives highlighted in the more informative article on peri-urban agriculture, with a mention of farming and gardening which was completely left out somehow--&gt;

===Increasing urban sprawl===
Another area of criticism comes from the fact that, since a greenbelt does not extend indefinitely outside a city, it spurs the growth of areas much further away from the city core than if it had not existed, thereby actually ''increasing'' urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;How Much Open Space is Enough?" St. Paul Pioneer Press (MN) – April 22, 2007 – A1 MAIN&lt;/ref&gt; Examples commonly cited are the [[Ottawa]] suburbs of [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]] and [[Orléans, Ontario|Orleans]], both of which are outside the city's greenbelt, and are currently undergoing explosive growth (see [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)]]). This leads to other problems, as residents of these areas have a longer commute to work places in the city and worse access to [[public transport]]. It also means people have to commute through the green belt, an area not designed to cope with high levels of transportation. Not only is the merit of a green belt subverted, but the green belt may heighten the problem and make the city unsustainable.

There are many examples whereby the actual effect of green belts is to act as a land reserve for future freeways and other highways. Examples include sections of the 407 highway north of Toronto and the Hunt Club Rd./Richmond Rd. south of Ottawa. Whether they are originally planned as such, or the result of a newer administration taking advantage of land that was left available by its predecessors is debatable.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Green belt (United Kingdom)}}
In the UK, greenbelt around the major conurbations has been criticized as one of the main protectionist bars to building housing, the others being other planning restrictions (Local Plans and [[restrictive covenant]]s) and developers' [[land banking]]. Local Plans and land banking are to be relaxed for home building in the 2015-2030 period by law and the green belt will be reduced by some local authorities as each local authority must now consider it among the available shortlisted options in drawing development plans to meet higher housing targets. Critics argue that the greenbelts defeat their stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces. Such criticism falls shorts when considering the other, broader benefits such as [[peri-urban agriculture]] which includes gardening and carries many benefits, especially to the retired. It also ignores the strategic aims of the [[Attlee Ministry]] in 1946, just as in France, of shifting capital away from the capital (addressing regional disparity) and avoiding intra-urban gridlock.  The restrictions of the Green Belt were particularly in the 1940s-1980s mitigated with planned, government-supported, new towns under the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and [[New Towns Act 1981]]. These saw establishment beyond the greenbelts of new homes, [[infrastructure]], businesses and other facilities.  Without large scale sustainable development, [[infill development]] sees urban green space lost. A chronic housing shortage with inadequate new settlements and/or extension of those outside of the green belt and/or no green belt reduction has seen many brownfield sites, often well-suited to industry and commerce, lost in existing conurbations.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Barriers To Housebuilding In Britain: A Critical Case Study Of Protectionism &amp; Its Industrial-Commercial Effects'', Industrial Systems Research/ Google Books, revised electronic edition 2013.

==Notable examples==

===Australia===
* [[Adelaide]]'s Central Business District is completely encircled by the [[Adelaide Parklands]], as was [[Light's Vision|initially planned]] in 1837.
* The [[Shire of Nillumbik|Nillumbik Shire Council]] which is located approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km (19 miles) north-east of [[Melbourne]] is considered as "The Green Wedge Shire" because of the agreement with the [[Victorian Government]] which prevents high-density infrastructure to be built.

===Brazil===
*The [[São Paulo City Green Belt Biosphere Reserve]] – GBBR, an integral part of the [[Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve]], was created in 1994 stemming from a people's movement that collected 150 thousand signatures. It extends throughout 73 municipalities including [[São Paulo]] metro and the [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]] area. With approximately 17,000&amp;nbsp;km², it is inhabited by about 23 million people, corresponding to more than 10% of the country's total population in an area equivalent to 2 thousandth of the Brazilian territory. There are over 6,000&amp;nbsp;km² of forests and other Atlantic Forest ecosystems at the Reserve, one of the planet's most threatened biomes. In addition to a spectacular biological diversity, the GBBR's ecosystems render valuable [[ecosystem services]].

===Canada===
* [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)|Ottawa Greenbelt]] – Surrounds the Capital city of Ottawa
*[[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)]], is a 7300&amp;nbsp;km² band of land that encompasses the rural and agricultural land surrounding the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and [[Niagara Peninsula]], and parts of the [[Bruce Peninsula]]. It is larger than Canada's smallest province of [[Prince Edward Island]]. Most of the land consists of the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]], an environmentally sensitive land that is a major [[aquifer]] for the region, and the [[Niagara Escarpment]], a [[UNESCO]] [[Biosphere reserve|Biosphere Reserve]]. In an effort to restrain urban sprawl that has encroched on these lands, the Ontario government created the Greenbelt Act in February 2005 to protect this greenspace from all future development, with the exception of limited agricultural use.
* [[British Columbia]] – the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] protects agricultural land throughout this mountainous province from urban development, including around [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]. This protection is strict and urban development of agricultural land is only allowed if no reasonable alternative exists. However, it does not protect non-agricultural land, particularly hillsides, leading to substantial, and highly visible, leapfrog-type hillside sprawl.
* [[Quebec]] – The ''Commission de protection du territoire agricole du Québec'' asserts its mission, namely to keep a territory (the agricultural zones) that is favorable for the practice and the development of agricultural activities. In so doing, the commission safeguards the agricultural territory and helps make its protection a local priority. The agricultural zones cover an area of 63 000 square kilometres in 952 local municipalities.

===Dominican Republic===
* The [[Greater Santo Domingo]] has a Greenbelt ([[Santo Domingo Greenbelt]]) project surrounding the whole [[Distrito Nacional]]. It is composed of the National botanical Garden, Mirador Del Norte, Mirador del Este, and other parks surrounding the area from its outer ''municipios''. It has largely been affected by uncontrolled urbanization, but other parts remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dataurbana.gov.do/memorias/proyecto/Cinturon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terradominicana.blogspot.com/2008/05/cinturn-verde.html Grupo Terra Dominicana: Cinturón Verde].

===Iran===
[[File:Tochal from Modarres Expressway.jpg|thumb|right|280px|afforestation beyond an expressway in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]]]
*Green Belt in [[Tehran]] has always been a consequential matter due to the rapid increase of the city size, population, cars, factories, pollution and other expansions which hardened breathing. By a big project, the green belt of Tehran increased from 29 square kilometres in 1979 to 530 square kilometres in 2017 and the number of parks also increased from 75 in 1979 to 2,211 in 2017 in total urban and suburb areas. Such actions and afforestation increased the humidity level and precipitation chance in the city which cools the summer's temperatures down by up to 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Tehran municipality announced to increase the green belt by 10 square kilometres each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.mehrnews.com/news/3865345/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DB%B3%DB%B9-%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%87%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF | title=مساحت کمربند سبز تهران به بیش از ۳۹ هزار هکتار رسید| date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fartaknews.com/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D9%85%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%DB%8C-5/48981-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%DA%A9%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AA%DA%A9%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84-%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%AF | title=طرح کمربند سبز تهران باید تکمیل شود}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Public Works Administration]] of the [[New Deal]] created three Greenbelt communities based on the ideas of [[Ebenezer Howard]] which are now the municipalities of [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], [[Greenhills, Ohio]], and [[Greendale, Wisconsin]].
* More than 20 cities in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] have UGBs (see [[Greenbelt Alliance]], a Bay Area organization that has been involved in establishing these boundaries).
* [[Staten Island Greenbelt]] and [[Brooklyn-Queens Greenway]] in New York City
* [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]], [[Austin]]
* [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] is acquiring conservation easements on agricultural land around the city without the establishment of an urban growth boundary. While the city's initial plan did not include the participation of surrounding townships, at least four townships have participated directly or have initiated their own efforts to protect agricultural land surrounding the city.

'''Harriet Maxwell Converse''' (née, '''Harriet Arnot Maxwell'''; [[Seneca language|Seneca clan]] name, '''Gayaneshaoh'''; Seneca tribal name, '''Ya-ih-wah-non''' or '''Gaiiwanoh'''; 11 January 1836 - 18 November 1903) was an American author of Scottish and Irish heritage. She was a [[folklorist]], poet and historian of the Iroquois; by the late 19th century, they were a loose confederacy of six nations in New York State and Canada. She became an advocate for the rights of the Seneca and other Iroquois tribes in New York state, helping them retain their lands and preserve their culture. In recognition of her contributions, the Seneca made her a member of the tribe and gave her an honorary position as a [[sachem]] or chief of the Six Nations.&lt;ref name="conversebio"&gt;[{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=James|first1=Edward T.|last2=James|first2=Janet Wilson|last3=Boyer|first3=Paul S.|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=PA375|year=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=375–376|isbn=978-0-674-62734-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an appropriation in 1897 from the New York State Museum, Converse made extensive purchases of Iroquois artifacts from private collectors and tribes to have them preserved by the state. She also donated a family collection that was a century old. She persuaded the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] to transfer their collection of historic wampum belts of the Five Nations to the state museum for preservation.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

==Early years==
Harriet Arnot Maxwell was born in [[Elmira, New York]], in 1836, daughter of [[Thomas Maxwell]] and Maria (Purdy) Maxwell. Her father had a concern for Native Americans in New York State and was active in politics; he was elected and served in office at the county, state and federal level, being elected as a Congressman. He later became vice-president of the [[Erie Railroad]]. Her mother was a woman of culture and education. Her paternal grandfather, [[Guy Maxwell]], had been an Indian trader in Virginia and New York, moving to Elmira in the late 18th century after the United States achieved independence. Both men had been adopted by the Seneca to honor them.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Biography of Harriet Maxwell Converse|url=https://www.pbs.org/warrior/content/bio/converse.html|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Maria died when Harriet was nine, and her father sent the girl to live with relatives in [[Milan, Ohio]]. There she attended public school.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=200}}

==Career==
Converse entered a larger public life after her second marriage. After she and her husband traveled, in the late 1860s they happened to meet [[Ely S. Parker]] in New York City. He was a Seneca who had become an engineer and served with General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the American Civil War. He was highly influential in the Seneca Nation and in New York politics.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

Harriet Converse became increasingly involved in learning about the Seneca, with Parker's help. She became inspired to defend the rights of the Iroquois by aiding them politically with her wealth and support, and helped to preserve their culture.

In 1885 Converse was formally adopted by the Snipe Clan ia Seneca family.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

In 1883 she published her first volume of poems, ''Sheaves'' ([[New York City]], 1883), which passed through several editions. She also wrote an ode ''The Ho-de-no-sau-nee: The Confederacy of the Iroquois'' (1884).

Converse was a productive writer of non-fiction, contributing to several magazines and newspapers. Among her works are the historical volumes, ''The Religious Festivals of the Iroquois Indians'' and ''Mythology and Folk Lore of the North American Indians.''{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=201}} These have been criticized as being sentimental accounts.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

In 1891 Converse was a member of a delegation to [[Albany, New York]] to oppose the Whipple Bill before the [[New York State Assembly]]; it was designed to force the distribution of communal land in allotments to individual heads of households, along the lines of the federal [[Dawes Act]] to extinguish Indian land claims. It was an action designed to assimilate the Iroquois to subsistence farming in the European-American model and force a break-up of their reservations in the state. She helped achieve its defeat in committee. Converse had been invited by the Iroquois to sit in their Six-Nation Council held in Albany.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;  No white woman except [[Mary Jemison]], who had been adopted and assimilated by the Seneca as a young woman after being taken captive in a raid, had ever been honored in this way.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt; Most of the Iroquois had been forced from the area during and after the American Revolutionary War, as four of the Six Nations had allied with the British in the hopes of pushing out the Anglo-American settlers.

After the bill was defeated, the Seneca National Council convened at [[Carrollton, New York|Carrollton]], in the [[Allegany Reservation]]. During this 1891 session, members moved to make Converse an official member of the Seneca Nation as an honor, naming her ''Ya-ie-wa-noh,'' after the wife of their notable chief [[Cornplanter]]. The motion was passed by the Council. In 1892 the Onondaga Nation "raised her up" to the position of [[sachem]], to take the place of one who had died, and she was considered an honorary chief of the Six Nations.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

Among her most important work was Converse's purchases and donations to preserve Iroquois artifacts; many are held today by the [[New York State Museum]] in Albany and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. In 1897 she was given an appropriation to buy from private collectors and tribes; she also donated her family's collection, which had items that were a century old. She also persuaded the Onondaga to have the NY State Museum made the repository for their historic collection of wampum belts of the Five Nations.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

In 1902 Converse publicized her opposition to a federal bill in both New York City and Washington, DC, and helped achieve its defeat. It would have required the Seneca to pay a crushing $200,000 to settle a claim by the [[Ogden Land Company]], over an early 19th-century transaction.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Harriet Maxwell married George B. Clarke in Ohio, who was a part owner of the Congress Spring in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. He died relatively young. Inheriting his estate as well as from her father in 1864, who was vice-president of the [[Erie Railroad]] before his death, left her independently wealthy. In 1861 the widow Clarke had married again, to Franklin Buchanan Converse, whom she knew from childhood. He was a musician, inventor and writer. She had no children from either marriage. The couple traveled extensively for several years.&lt;ref name="conversebio"/&gt;

Originally, the state of [[New Jersey]] was a single [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] [[crown colony|colony]], the [[Province of New Jersey]]. After the [[English Civil War]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] assigned [[New Jersey]] as a [[proprietary colony]] to be held jointly by [[Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]]. Eventually, the collection of land fees, or [[quit-rents]], from colonists proved inadequate for colonial profitability. Sir George Carteret sold his share of the colony to the [[Quakers]] in 1673. Following the sale, the land was divided into [[East Jersey|East]] and [[West Jersey|West]] Jersey. In 1681, [[West Jersey]] adopted a constitution. In 1683, [[East Jersey]] adopted one as well. In 1702, the colonies were united again under [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], and adopted a constitution in 1776.

New Jersey is governed under a constitution that was enacted in 1947 during a convention held at [[Rutgers University]]'s [[College Avenue Gymnasium]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey. [http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp New Jersey State Constitution (1947)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |date=June 30, 2009 }}. Retrieved September 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the political structure of the 1844 constitution was carried into the 1947 document.  The governor, elected by the people, was elected for a four-year term instead of a three-year term.

However, the old means of electing legislators with state senators decided by county boundaries was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Under this system, a county with a large population made equal to a county with a small population in having only one senator.  The Supreme Court in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' 369 U.S. 186 (1962) and ''Reynolds v. Simms'', 377 U.S. 533 (1964) found this to violate the "one-man, one-vote" doctrine embodied in the Federal Constitution's 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause.  A constitutional convention held in 1966 created a state legislature with 40 coterminous legislative districts represented by one state senator and two state assemblymen.

In 2005, the constitution was amended to create the post of [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]], and to alter the order of succession in the event the governor's office was vacated.  The resignation of two governors in 2001 and 2004 led to the state being led by several acting governor who simultaneously served as the president of the state senate. The issues regarding the separation of executive and legislative powers, and other concerns created a political controversy where public and media pressure sought a permanent solution to this problem which was inherited from previous state and colonial constitutions and political conventions.

New Jersey has been governed under the authority of several constitutional documents.  As a colony, the first, the ''[[Concession and Agreement]]'' (1665), was written by the colony's Lords Proprietors, [[Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]], which offered broad provisions for religious freedom. After the interests of Lord Berkeley and Carteret were sold to investors, New Jersey was divided into two distinct proprietary colonies [[West Jersey]], and [[East Jersey]] each with their own constitutions enacted in 1681&lt;ref&gt;Avalon Project (Yale Law School).

At the onset of the American Revolution, New Jersey was governed by waning British colonial authority. [[William Franklin]], the province's last royal governor before the [[American Revolution]] (1775–83), was marginalized in the last year of his tenure, as the province was run ''[[de facto]]'' by the [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey]].  Franklin considered the Provincial Congress to be an "illegal assembly" and attempted to reassert royal authority.&lt;ref name="SkempFranklin1990"&gt;Skemp, Sheila L. ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King''. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1776, the Provincial Congress formally deposed Franklin and had him arrested, adopted its first [[state constitution (United States)|state constitution]] on July 2, 1776, and reorganized the province into an independent state. The newly formed State of New Jersey elected [[William Livingston]] as its first governor on August 31, 1776—a position he would be reelected to until his death in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robert K., Jr., MacGregor, Morris J., Jr. "William Livingston" in ''Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution''. (CMH Publication 71-25) (Washington D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History, 1987), 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress.

''The American Whig: William Livingston of New York''. (New York: Garland Publishers, 1990/1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

While New Jersey was in a state of war, delegates of the Provincial Congress drafted the first constitution in a span of five days and ratified it only two days later. Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework that would assume control of the territory after the collapse of royal authority and maintain civil order. This constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey. [http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10.htm "The New Jersey Constitution of 1776"]. Retrieved September 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its provisions, the document granted suffrage rights to unmarried women and African-Americans who met the requirements of possessing sufficient assets or property as "freeholders". The legislature was elected each year and selected the state's governor.  It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]]. The suffrage rights in the 1776 constitution were limited by the state legislature in 1807 to restrict voting rights to white male citizens who paid taxes.  Women who voted in earlier elections tended to support the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]], and this effort was largely an effort of the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]]'s attempt to unify its factions for the 1808 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Klinghoffer, Judith Apter; and Elkins, Lois. "'The Petticoat Electors': Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776-1807," ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (Summer 1992), 12(2):159-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's second constitution was adopted on June 29, 1844.  Among its provisions was a distinct [[separation of powers]] into three branches (executive, legislative and judicial branches), limiting the right to vote to white males, and granted the people (as opposed to the legislature) the right of a popular election for the state's governor.  The document limited the state government's ability to accumulate public debt.&lt;ref name="state.nj.us"&gt;State of New Jersey.

==During Colonial Period==
===Concession and Agreement (1664)===
{{Main|Concession and Agreement}}
'''Concession and Agreement''' was a legal document that guaranteed rights; including, but not only, religious freedom. It served as the basic governing document of the colony of New Jersey. Although the document is most commonly recognized as an enticement for settlers, it is in the basic form of any colonial [[charter]] or constitution, and guarantees such rights.

===West Jersey Constitution===
{{See also|Province of West Jersey}}
In 1681, [[West Jersey]] adopted a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj08.htm |title=Province of West New-Jersey, in America, The 25th of the Ninth Month Called November |author=Avalon Project |publisher=Yale Law School |accessdate=2006-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102120721/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj08.htm |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of [[East Jersey]], unlike West Jersey's, did not seemingly have a section of the traditional colonial constitution missing. Within their constitution was a detailed creation of a great Council, who would control the colony. The constitution also created a somewhat abbreviated enumeration of rights. The constitution also bans the admission of any non-Christian into the council. A vestige from the [[Stamp Act]], Article XVIII is an archaic section of a since-repealed act.

==Constitution of 1776==
===Initial Drafting===
New Jersey's first state constitution was adopted on October 31, 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] was underway and [[George Washington]] had recently been defeated in [[New York (state)|New York]], putting [[New Jersey]] in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days at the end of June and ratified just two days later on July 2, 1776, the first New Jersey State Constitution reflected the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework and preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet despite being conceived in a state of military emergency, this Constitution was durable enough to serve as the charter document for the State government for the next 68 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10.htm|title=The New Jersey Constitution of 1776| accessdate=2006-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vote not limited by race or gender===
A notable aspect of this original 1776 New Jersey State Constitution is that it provisioned [[suffrage]] to citizens without regard to gender or race. [[New Jersey]] stood alone among the original thirteen states of the Revolutionary period in excluding these distinctions. As set out in its defining constitutional document, only three provisos restricted those claiming the vote: (i) being of "full age", (ii) having attained a threshold level of wealth, and (iii) having residence within a county during the year prior to an election. Section IV of this original State of New Jersey Constitution captures these ideas in its single sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money, clear estate in the same, and have resided within the county in which they claim a vote for twelve months immediately preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote for Representatives in Council and Assembly; and also for all other public officers, that shall be elected by the people of the county at large.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;New Jersey State Constitution of 1776, Section IV; The Avalon Project: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy. Lillian Goldman Law Library (Yale Law School). Retrieved 2012-12-5. http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nj15.asp#1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey State Constitution of 1776, Section IV; Official Website of the State of New Jersey. Retrieved 2012-12-5. http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The New Jersey legislature did amend this constitution on September 20, 1777, by substituting the words " State " and " States " for " colony " and " colonies." &lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"/&gt;

===Women's Right Clarified in 1797===
Some have argued that New Jersey's gender-neutral language was a mistake, but most historians agree that the clear intention was to allow some women and African Americans to vote.

The minimum property requirement would have meant that some married women would be regarded differently than single women.

Although common laws of [[Coverture]] enforced in some areas prevented even married women who had sufficient property from holding it their own name or as joint property in the way needed to meet that requirement for voting, coverture was not universally applied.  Also some couples might have been exercising civil disobedience of the laws of coverture and the women would have voted pursuant to this open stance of verbalized objection to the law.

Large numbers of single women did regularly participate in elections and spoke out on political issues in New Jersey in the 1790s and 1800s.
&lt;ref name="Blyth"&gt;"Did you know that New Jersey women voted in the 1790s?" by Bob Blythe, from "The American Revolution, Lighting Freedom's Flame", National Park Service, Department of the Interior.

If there were any lingering doubts about their intentions, the passage of New Jersey's 1797 voting law—which introduced the phrase "he or she" in reference to voters—erased them and clarified for all that the right to vote across the state was for both men and women. The Act—passed by the New Jersey Assembly on February 22, 1797—was called "An Act to regulate the Election of Members of the Legislative-Council and the General Assembly, Sheriffs and Coroners, in this State" and it revised the regulations for the election of public officials. The law specifically included women in the franchise. Section XI of the Act stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And be it enacted, That every voter shall openly, and in full view deliver his or her ballot (which shall be a single written ticket, containing the names of the person or persons for whom he or she votes) to the said judge, or either of the inspectors, who, on receipt thereof, shall, with an audible voice, pronounce the name of such voter, and if no objection is made to the voter, put the ballot immediately into the election box, and the clerk of the election shall thereupon take down the name of such voter in a book or poll list, to be provided for the purpose.&lt;ref name="Notable"&gt;New Jersey Women's History, Notable Facts 1776-1843.

===Vote Rescinded for Women, non-Whites===
Between 1797 and 1807 women voted in large numbers in New Jersey. But in 1807 the state's legislature ignored the constitution and restricted suffrage to white male citizens who paid taxes. This was largely a result of the Democratic-Republican Party's attempt to unify its factions for the 1808 presidential election. A faction within the party wanted to deny the vote to aliens and the non-tax-paying poor. The liberal faction within the party gave way on this, but also took the vote from women, who tended to vote for the Federal.&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herritage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elkis"&gt;Judith Apter Klinghoffer and Lois Elkis, " 'The Petticoat Electors': Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776-1807," Journal of the Early Republic 12/2 (Summer 1992):159-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey's 30-year experiment with female suffrage ended not mainly because of open opposition to the idea of women voting, but as a casualty of party politics and backroom bartering. Another factor was the renewed push by some groups to reinforce the importance of women in the home—and out of the public realm. It also did not help that in the intervening decades no other state had followed New Jersey's more progressive voting approach. 
&lt;ref name="Blyth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herritage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elkis" /&gt;
Some historians have viewed the New Jersey episode as evidence that the founders entertained the possibility that women could have political rights. The emphasis on liberty and natural rights in the Revolutionary period brought previously excluded groups into the political process. For example, women took the lead in organizing boycotts of British goods in the disputes over colonial rights that led to the Revolution. The writers of New Jersey's 1776 constitution took the natural rights sentiment further than other states were willing to go. But by 1807, the Revolutionary era had passed and Revolutionary fervor was a dimming memory. New Jersey therefore succumbed and fell in line with the practice of the other states.&lt;ref name="Notable" /&gt;

==Constitution of 1844==
The 2nd constitution was adopted on June 29, 1844.  Among its provisions was a distinct [[separation of powers]] into three branches (executive, legislative and judicial branches), limiting the right to vote to white males, and granted the people (as opposed to the legislature) the right of a popular election for the state's governor.  The document limited the state government's ability to accumulate public debt.&lt;ref name="state.nj.us"/&gt;

==Constitution of 1947==
===Drafting===
The Constitutional Convention that drafted the state's 1947 constitution met at the Rutgers University Gymnasium on College Avenue in New Brunswick.

===Subsequent amendments===
Another constitutional convention was held at the Rutgers University campus to rectify the apportionment of legislative districts after the Supreme Court invalidated the state's scheme for electing state senators geographically by county boundaries instead of population as violative of the "one-man, one-vote" doctrine embodied in the Federal Constitution's 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause.  This was compelled in the wake of court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1962) 369 U.S. 186 and Reynolds v. Simms, 377 U.S. 533 (1964).

A 2005 amendment changed the order of succession and created a position of [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]].

'''Jean Ziegler''' ({{IPA-fr|ziglɛʁ|lang}}; born April 19, 1934 as '''Hans Ziegler''') is a former professor of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Geneva]] and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], [[Paris]]. Currently vice-president of the Advisory Committee to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. He was a Member of Parliament for the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]] in the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland]] from 1981 to 1999. He has also held several positions with the [[United Nations]], especially as [[Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food]] from 2000 to 2008,&lt;ref name="rapporteur"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Food/Pages/FoodIndex.aspx  |publisher=UN Human Rights Council |title=Special Rapporteur on the right to food |accessdate=2012-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a member of the Advisory Committee of the UN Human Rights Council from 2008 to 2012. Jean Ziegler has authored numerous works, is a lecturer, and is well known for this sentence: "A child who dies from hunger is a murdered child."&lt;ref&gt;"''Un enfant qui meurt de faim est un enfant assassiné.''" (''Destruction massive: Géopolitique de la faim'', Paris, Seuil, 2011.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and teaching career==
Jean Ziegler was born on April 19, 1934 in [[Thun]], Switzerland. His father was the president of the town’s court and a reserve artillery colonel.

Ziegler married and had one son. He studied at the universities of [[University of Bern|Bern]] and [[University of Geneva|Geneva]] and has doctorates in Law and Sociology. He also earned his barrister brevet at the [[bar association]] of [[Geneva]]. In 1952, he met [[Abbé Pierre]] in [[Paris]], and became the first director of the [[Emmaus (charity)|Emmaus]] charitable community of Geneva. In 1964, Ziegler admired the Cuban rebels, and was [[Che Guevara]]'s chauffeur in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;Bollag, Burton.  "[http://chronicle.com/article/For-One-Swiss-Professor-Ve/32353/ For One Swiss Professor, Vexing His Fellow Citizens Is a Duty and a Delight]", [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] (1998-10-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziegler was professor at the [[University of Grenoble]] and until 2002 at the [[University of Geneva]] and at the [[Graduate Institute of Development Studies]], where he taught sociology. He also held the position of associate professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris.

==Election and appointment to public offices==
In 1963 Jean Ziegler was elected at the [[municipal council]] of Geneva as a [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|social democrat]]. From 1967 to 1983 and from 1987 to 1999 he held a seat at the [[National Council of Switzerland|Swiss National Council]]. While there he was the president of the “Swiss-Third World” [[parliamentary group]]. He joined the commissions for foreign affairs, science and international trade.

Nominated by Switzerland, he was the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the Right to Food from 2000 to 2008.&lt;ref name="rapporteur" /&gt; Following Ziegler's election, the Swiss government stated that it "attaches great importance to human rights and is pleased that a Swiss candidate will be able to contribute his expertise to the committee."&lt;ref name=ABC1 /&gt; As one of the 18 initial members of the Advisory Committee to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] who were elected on 26 March 2008, Jean Ziegler served a one-year term  receiving forty of forty-seven votes in 2008 to finish first in a field of seven candidates. He concluded his second term 30 September 2012, but was reelected on 26 September 2013 with a term lasting until September 30, 2016.  He is also a member of the advisory board of the [[non-profit organization]] Business Crime Control which targets [[white-collar crime]].

==Honors==
Jean Ziegler was made knight (chevalier) of the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 1994. He has an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Mons]] in Belgium. He was awarded the [[Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic]]. The Republic of [[Cape Verde]] awarded him the National Order of [[Amílcar Cabral]], first degree. He received the [[Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights|Gaddafi Human Rights Prize]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxMJ0uYLMiE |title=Video of "Ziegler Receives the Gaddafi Human Rights award" - ceremony in 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2009 he received an [[honorary degree]] from the [[Paris 8 University|University of Paris VIII]]. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the left-wing [[South East Europe]]an magazine ''[[Novi Plamen]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noviplamen.org|publisher=Novi Plamen|title=O Novom Plamenu (About ''Novi Plamen'')|date=|accessdate=2011-08-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803193549/http://www.noviplamen.org/|archivedate=2011-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria Jean Ziegler was awarded with the "Federal State Salzburg prize for future research" by Federal State Salzburg Governor Gabi Burgstaller on 20 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6up4iNhWw |title=Video of the "Federal State Salzburg prize for future research" - ceremony on 20th November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was honored with [[ethecon]]'s 2012 "Blue Planet Award"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offene-akademie.org/?p=189 |publisher=offene Akademie |title=Jean Ziegler erhält den "Blue Planet Award 2012" |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his "outstanding efforts towards humanitarian ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethecon.org/de/1586 |publisher=ethecon foundation |title=Blue Planet Dossier 2012: Jean Ziegler |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues during diplomatic career==
As a United Nations official, Ziegler has dealt with both general worldwide issues such as the use of [[biofuel]]s, as well as country-specific issues.  Regarding the former,  Ziegler has criticised the uptake of biofuels because their production can come [[Food vs. fuel|at the expense of growing food]]. On 26 October 2007 Ziegler told a news conference at the UN that "it's a crime against humanity to convert agricultural productive soil into soil ... which will be burned into biofuel... What has to be stopped is ... the growing catastrophe of the massacre (by) hunger in the world."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/production-of-biofuels-is-a-crime-398066.html|date=2007-10-27|title=Production of biofuels 'is a crime'|first=Edith|last=Lederer|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swiss banks===
In 1997, Ziegler alleged that Swiss banking officials were lying to protect the assets of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], former President of [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Ziegler said, "This is grotesque... This is a financial empire and it is here in Switzerland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9706/03/mobutu/ |title=Swiss banks find only $3.4 million in Mobutu assets |work=[[CNN]] |date=1997-06-03 |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he had already proposed to the Swiss parliament to confiscate the finances of Mobutu and give it back to the country after the end of Mobutu's dictatorship, but his proposal was declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=19933632 |title=Mobutu. Vermögenswerte in der Schweiz  |work=Swiss parliament |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also criticized the Swiss banks in connection with the [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks|dormant accounts scandal]]. In 1998, he testified before Senator [[Al D'Amato|Alfonse D'Amato]]'s hearing on the assets of Holocaust victims by the US Senate Banking Committee, against the Swiss banks and in support of the claims of the World Jewish Congress. His book ''The Swiss, the Gold and the Dead: How Swiss Bankers Helped Finance the Nazi War Machine'' was published in America in 1998.&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Peter |last=Grose |date=1998-04-05 |title=Gnomes and Nazis |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0D7173BF936A35757C0A96E958260&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Gaddafi Prize and Roger Garaudy===
A prize foundation fund in the name of [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] was established in [[Geneva]] in 1989, and [[Nelson Mandela]] was selected the first recipient of the fund's Gaddafi International Human Rights Prize.&lt;ref&gt;"Mandela wins Gadhafi prize", ''The Record'', 24 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Some newspaper accounts have identified Ziegler as one of the panel members who administered the fund in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"Gadhafi honors Mandela", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 24 April 1989, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He has denied launching the award, however, and has said that he was merely "consulted."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzz.ch/2006/06/25/il/articlee8t7c_1.42071.html Zieglers Libyen-Connection]", ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (2006-06-25).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Libya funded the award, its winners were to be chosen by the Swiss foundation, and Ziegler said that "ironclad guarantees" had been established to ensure that "[[Tripoli]]'s influence would not be felt."&lt;ref name="World Notes Prizes"&gt;{{cite news |title=World Notes Prizes |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957634,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1989-05-08 |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi Prize officials announced thirteen disparate winners in 2002, including Ziegler and the French philosopher and convicted Holocaust denier [[Roger Garaudy]]. ''Agence France-Press'' noted the irony of Ziegler, who had worked for Holocaust reparations in Switzerland, sharing the award with Garaudy.&lt;ref&gt;"French Holocaust denier, Swiss campaigner for victims share Kadhafi prize", ''Agence France-Press'', 30 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler turned down the prize, saying that he "could not accept an award or distinction from any country because of my responsibilities at the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;"Swiss human rights campaigner turns down "Kadhafi" award", ''Agence France-Press'', 1 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziegler's alleged associations with the Gaddafi Prize has been the subject of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN rights official Jean Ziegler created "Qaddafi Prize", reports Swiss TV|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3LksIV0D0o&amp;list=WL5ABC371F9A2AC9F7|work=[[UN Watch]]|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Johnson, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' online in 2008, criticized Ziegler for "launching" the prize four months after the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] (which many believe to have been the work of Libyan agents).&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson, Alan. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/05/appointmentwithfarce "Appointment with Farce"], ''The Guardian'' 5 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Muravchik from the [[American Enterprise Institute]] also criticized his involvement with the award in a 2006 article for the ''[[Weekly Standard]]''.&lt;ref name=Weelystandard1&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Joshua Muravchik |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/198ikivt.asp |date=2005-05-15 |title=Qaddafi's Good Friend at the U.N. |first=Joshua |last=Muravchik |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |id=Vol. 11, No. 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2011, the Swiss television channel [[Schweizer Fernsehen]] ran a report on Ziegler's alleged associations with Gaddafi. The piece included criticism of Ziegler from Pierre Weiss, a sociologist and member of the [[Swiss Liberal Party]]. Ziegler, for his part, said that he was never a friend of Gaddafi and repeated his claim that he never oversaw the Human Rights Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[[10vor10]]: http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/10vor10/video/ruecktrittsforderung-an-jean-ziegler?id=199ccfc1-2cc4-46e9-ad97-99eb72de2f0b{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, the Salzburg Music Festival withdrew an invitation to Ziegler to speak at the event's opening, citing his alleged links to Gaddafi. In the same period, Ziegler said that he now regarded Gaddafi as "completely mad" and as a psychopath and murderer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.ch/104/20110404/ "Swiss politico dropped from music fest over Qaddafi links"], ''The Local'', 4 April 2011, accessed 31 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Ziegler signed a letter of support for Roger Garaudy. He later clarified that he intended to express "his respect for Garaudy's battle against all fundamentalisms — and Muslim fundamentalism, in particular," and that he "most firmly condemned all revisionist activity or ideas whose purpose is to deny or to minimize the genocide of the Jewish people by the Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 23 April 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and South Africa===

During the [[Ethiopian famine]] of the mid-1980s, Ziegler described the world as an "immense extermination camp", wherein 40,000 people died of hunger every day.  He blamed this on an economic system that allowed the rich to become richer, and the poor to become poorer.&lt;ref&gt;"L'AFRICA, IL DEBITO E IL RAP DIPLOMAZIA PUNK. "JUBILEE 2000" - CAMPAGNA PER LA CANCELLAZIONE DEI...", ''La Stampa'', 27 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Ziegler's critics have accused him of working as an adviser to Ethiopian dictator [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in the drafting of [[1987 Constitution of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's 1986 constitution]], which established the country as a one-party state.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;

Ziegler defended the principle of [[Zimbabwe]]an [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]]'s land reforms in 2002, saying that Mugabe had "history and morality on his side".  He described agrarian reforms as "an absolute necessity" in Zimbabwe and South Africa, and was quoted as saying:

{{cquote|
South Africa is threatened by a social disaster because it has not touched white lands. The whites are the colonisers... they are not people who came after independence and bought their land. They are on despoiled land."
}}

He added that Mugabe's land reforms were being undertaken "in a despicable context", however, and said that agrarian reform under democratic conditions would bring "equitable distribution of the property titles to rural communities".  He also clarified that he was speaking in a personal context, and not as a representative of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Swiss sociologist defends Zimbabwean land reforms", ''Agence France-Presse'', 22 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq and its wars with the United States===

During the buildup to the [[1990 Gulf War]], [[Iraq]]i [[President of Iraq|President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] took several Swiss nationals in Iraq as hostages.  Ziegler was involved in efforts to release them, initially working with former [[Algeria]]n [[President of Algeria|President]] [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] and later traveling to [[Baghdad]] himself as part of an independent delegation that managed to secure the release of some hostages.  The Swiss government did not endorse this effort, and Ziegler argued that his delegation could have freed all of the hostages had the government agreed to allow the export to Iraq of medicines and powdered milk for children.&lt;ref&gt;"Italy criticises EC partners' efforts to free Gulf hostages", ''Reuters News'', 16 October 1990; Samantha McArthur, "91 hostages freed from Iraq arrive back in Europe", ''Reuters News'', 22 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Ziegler proposed that Saddam Hussein be granted a Swiss exile to prevent war from breaking out.  The Swiss government did not take up this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;"Swiss rights campaigner urges Swiss exile for Saddam", ''Agence France Presse'', 5 February 2003; Irene Harnischberg, "U.S. military planes banned from Swiss airspace except for Iraq surveillance, aid missions", ''Associated Press Newswires'', 21 February 2003, 11:50 am.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2003 invasion, Ziegler accused British and American forces of using water and food as weapons of war in Iraqi cities under attack by insurgents, to encourage civilians to flee.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cuba and its relations with the United States===
Ziegler has praised Cuba, stating in November 2007 that it is a world model for how it provides its people with food and praised it for cooperating with the United Nations and agreeing to allow him to report on the country's respect for the "[[right to food]]."&lt;ref name="Klapper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-un-cuba-journalists,0,7122133.story |title=UN Regrets Undercover Cubans at Event |first=Bradley S. |last=Klapper |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Newsday]] |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2008-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115172907/http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-un-cuba-journalists%2C0%2C7122133.story |archivedate=2007-11-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}
Via archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding a visit he made to Cuba, Ziegler stated: "We cannot say that the right to food is totally respected in Cuba, but we have not seen a single malnourished person."&lt;ref name="reuters-cuba"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler's trip to Cuba was the first in several years by a U.N. rights rapporteur, and his invitation to Havana followed a decision by the U.N. Human Rights Council to stop scrutinizing Cuban human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="reuters-cuba" /&gt;

According to ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', Ziegler believes that the United States is an 'imperialist dictatorship' that is guilty, among other atrocities, of 'genocide' against the people of Cuba by means of its [[embargo|trade embargo]]."&lt;ref name=Weelystandard1/&gt;

===Comments about Israel===
Ziegler criticized Israel's conduct in the [[2006 Lebanon War]], stating that the [[International Criminal Court]] should investigate whether Israel is guilty of war crimes for a bombing campaign in Lebanon that blocked access to food and water. Specifically, Ziegler stated that "The government of Israel should be held responsible under international law for the violations of the right to food of the Lebanese civilian population."&lt;ref name=haaretz1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=771030 |date=2006-10-05 |title=UN envoy tells international court to probe Israel for war crimes |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Itzhak Levanon, Israel's ambassador to the UN responded that "In all of his reports, Mr. Ziegler always transgresses the limits of his mandate. The latest report - which touches upon several external issues - is no exception." Israel also noted that Ziegler's report focused only on the impact of Israeli bombing in Lebanon and did not cover the effects of Hezbollah rocket fire on northern Israel."&lt;ref name=haaretz1/&gt;

Ziegler, according to a pro-Palestinian website, stated on television that "the Israeli occupation is a colonial regime and an illegal military occupation from the UN's point of view, it continues to annex more Palestinian lands; and thus the Israeli occupation is the worst in the history of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/en/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2BcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2Bi1s7leKnnQwmY9duRHZ09yVBqV%2Fphl5aopldmusl%2Bua7P5TW300dIVvWcHJnTWasRg3bcbYdgKJrCu1eyPsUMRVnl%2FX56Xpaqlv37tbMzwshG3w%3D |title=Ziegler: Israel is the worst colonial regime |publisher=Palestinian Information Center |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2008-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312084233/http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/en/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2BcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2Bi1s7leKnnQwmY9duRHZ09yVBqV%2Fphl5aopldmusl%2Bua7P5TW300dIVvWcHJnTWasRg3bcbYdgKJrCu1eyPsUMRVnl%2FX56Xpaqlv37tbMzwshG3w%3D |archivedate=2008-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ziegler likened [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] to "an immense [[concentration camp]]", adding that he was glad the "guards" were about to leave (this was a reference to Israel's unilateral disengagement plan under [[Ariel Sharon]]'s government). Ziegler later rejected as "absurd and patently false" the suggestion that he had compared Israelis to Nazis, saying that he was actually quoting an Israeli scholar when he made the remark.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with North Korea===

Ziegler had several interactions with the government of [[North Korea]] while serving as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food.  In 2001, he reported that some of the one million tonnes of aid provided by the [[World Food Programme]] had been taken by the army, the secret services and the government.&lt;ref&gt;“North Korean government hiving off food aid for itself: MSF”, ‘’Agence France-Presse’’, 30 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2004, a writer in the ''[[Asian Wall Street Journal]]'' called on North Korea to accept Ziegler's repeated requests for a visit, and to help establish an accountable network for food aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Seok, “Speak Out About Human Rights In North Korea”, ‘’The Asian Wall Street Journal’’, 16 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the same year, Ziegler said that five of his requests to visit North Korea had been turned down by officials in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Campiotti, “Jean Ziegler défend les petits pêcheurs, oublie les criquets et prend une volée de bois vert”, ‘’Le Temps’’, 29 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Ziegler's appointment as U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food was criticized by ''The Weekly Standard'', on the grounds that Ziegler is a sociologist by training and had no particular expertise on food or agriculture.&lt;ref name="Weelystandard1"/&gt;

Ziegler's appointment was also criticized by an independent group of political figures including [[Irwin Cotler]] and [[Per Ahlmark]].  This group criticized Ziegler for his associations with figures such as [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] and [[Robert Mugabe]], his involvement with the Gaddafi Prize, and his support for [[Roger Garaudy]].  Their letter opposing Ziegler was issued by the group [[UN Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;"Suspension Of Jean Ziegler's UN Nomination Urged", ''UN Watch'', 25 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]], a Cuban-American and the [[ranking member|ranking]] Republican on the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee]], sharply criticized Ziegler's appointment as an advisor to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]]. Ros-Lehtinen's stated:

{{quote|Mr. Ziegler has drawn criticism for his unyielding support of many of the world's most vicious dictators. He expressed "total support for the [[Cuban revolution]]" and its leader, [[Fidel Castro]], whose repressive regime has left hundreds of political dissidents to languish in jail.&lt;ref name=ABC1 /&gt;}}

Ros-Lehtinen also accused Ziegler of ignoring various famine emergencies using "his platform to consistently attack America and Israel".&lt;ref name=ABC1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Mar26/0,4670,UNRightsCouncil,00.html |title=Outspoken Swiss Tapped by UN Council |first=Eliane |last=Engeler |work=[[Fox News]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2008-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407163234/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Mar26/0,4670,UNRightsCouncil,00.html |archivedate=2008-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC) opposed Ziegler's bid for re-election to the UN Human Rights Office in 2009.  The AJC cited  his past support for Roger Garaudy and his criticisms of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"AJC Criticizes Nomination of Jean Ziegler for UN Human Rights Office" [press release] 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">{{distinguish|Jonah Warren House}}
'''Jonah House''' is a faith-based community centered on the concept of "Nonviolence, resistance and community". Founded in 1973 by a group that included [[Philip Berrigan]], a [[Holy Orders|Catholic priest]], and [[Elizabeth McAlister]], formerly a Catholic nun, Jonah House has grown to be situated on a {{convert|22|acre|m2|adj=on}} area of land in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] encompassing St. Peter's Cemetery, caring for the grounds.

''Jonah House'' has been specifically regarded as a prime example of a [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker House of Resistance]].

==Nonviolence==
{{Main|Plowshares Movement}}
Much of the non-violent resistance direct actions undertaken by Jonah House have taken the form of [[Plowshares Movement|Plowshares actions]]. Additionally non-violence is practiced in the community both as a way of thought and action. Education of the injustice present in violence is contemplated.

==Food pantry==
Jonah House donates food and clothes to persons in need.

==Sister communities==

Jonah House is part of a network of individuals and communities along the east coast that calls itself "[[Atlantic Life Community|The Atlantic Life Community]]".

The [[Pacific Life Community]] is a similar organization encompassing the west coast of the United States of America, Pacific Islands and East Asia.

Jonah House is also a sister community with [[Dorothy Day Catholic Worker House]] (in [[Washington, D.C.|D.C]]) [[Viva House Catholic Worker]], and The [[P. Francis Murphy|P. Francis Murphy Justice/Peace Initiative]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the people of Jonah House, part of the Catholic Worker movement founded by Dorothy Day more than 72 years ago, have done much more than that. They've served years in prison for nonviolent acts of civil disobedience. Almost every arrest, every sentence, has come for actions seeking to abolish nuclear weapons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

KCP works internationally with in-country partners to lead peacebuilding trainings and dialogue workshops.  Since 1994, KCP staff has led programs in conflict transformation in 26 countries in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa and America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/umarmot/?p=778 ''Karuna Center for Peacebuilding Records, 1994-2006.'']  Special Collections and Archives, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, W.E.B. DeBois Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Past areas of work have included  training members of [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Nepal’s Constituent Assembly]] in collaboration and negotiation skills and engaging community-based peace committees in the [[Casamance]] region of Senegal. Current areas of work include workshops for women leaders in [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] in partnership with the [[Hunt Alternatives Fund]], and a multi-year program in Northeast [[Sri Lanka]], in partnership with the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]], that engages 80 [[Buddhist]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]] and [[Christian]] leaders in joint community projects and reconciliation following the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].

==Programs ==
KCP’s first long-term project took place in Bosnia from 1997-2002, first working with women community leaders and then with educators from [[Sanski Most]] and [[Prijedor]] in Northern [[Bosnia]], most of whom were survivors of [[Prijedor]] concentration camps which were discovered in 1993 by reporter [[Roy Gutman]]. In May 1997, KCP received funding for a [[Sanski Most]] training program focused on survivors of sexual abuse, incarceration, and war-based trauma. The program was co-implemented with the Women’s Association of [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]]. Three years after the program's initiation, in May 2000, KCP funding to implement Project DIACOM, a dialogue program in the [[Sanski Most]] and [[Prijedor]].&lt;ref&gt;"AJ Muste Memorial Institute International Nonviolence Training Fund." AJ Muste Memorial Institute International Nonviolence Training Fund. Accessed March 17, 2017. http://www.ajmuste.org/intfgrants.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was aimed towards “inter-ethnic tolerance and understanding, conflict transformation, and peacebuilding” through educators. This shift collected support from the [[Seattle]]-based [[NGO]], Foundation for Community Encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia, Ignasi Torrent, and Rafael Grasa.

Project DIACOM was named to signify dialogues and community building in which erstwhile antagonists are led to mend their mutual suspicions and to begin working together.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Paula.

=== Notable Impacts by Region ===

&lt;big&gt;'''West Africa'''&lt;/big&gt;

* '''Senegal:''' KCP has led peacebuilding programs in [[Senegal]] since 2006. In 2014 and 2016, KCP worked to promote a peace process in the Casamance by helping priestesses to intervene with rebel combatants in remote communities.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Kim Mahling. Final Report: Support to the Casamance Peace Process. United States Agency for International Development/Senegal. December 2008. http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pdacp094.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, KCP began their work with [[AECOM]] International in [[Senegal]] to support development of a civil society network, Alliance pour la Paix en Casamance, which remains active.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Justice and Conflict Transformation." African Consultants International. Accessed March 24, 2017. http://www.acibaobab.org/social-justice-and-conflict-transformation.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, World Education partnered with KCP to launch training programs for peace advocacy in the region.&lt;ref&gt;African Consultants International Annual Report. Dakar, Senegal: Baobab Center, 2007. http://www.baobabcenter.org/sites/default/files/reports/annual/aci_annualreport_2007.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''REWARD Program:''' Since 2015, KCP has co-implemented Creative Associates International’s Reacting to Early Warning and Response Data program with USAID and Fund for Peace. The program objective is to dually strengthen early warning threat systems to reduce violence in [[West Africa]] and support multi-scalar stakeholders in these states to prevent electoral violence.&lt;ref&gt;"West Africa - Reacting to Early Warning and Response Data in West Africa." Creative Associates International. March 08, 2017. Accessed March 24, 2017. http://www.creativeassociatesinternational.com/projects/west-africa-reacting-to-early-warning-and-response-data-in-west-africa/9/.&lt;/ref&gt; REWARD was signed into agreement by USAID West Africa Mission Director Alexandre Deprez and ECOWAS President Kadre Desire Ouedrogo, with the approval of U.S. [[Nigerian Embassy in Washington|Embassy Nigeria]] Deputy Chief of Mission, [[Maria Brewer]] November 19, 2015 in [[Abuja, Nigeria]]. The program is an extension of the [[United States Government|U.S Government]] REWARD initiative to be completed in March 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet: Reacting to Early Warning Response Data in West Africa Project (REWARD). West Africa: United States Agency for International Development, December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Partnerships for Peace:''' Since September 2016, KCP has been involved in preventing and countering violent extremism within the West African Sahel, including but not limited to the countries of: [[Burkina Faso]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Mauritania]]. Karuna Center led a five-month assessment to examine and classify “the existing Countering Violence Extremism ([[Countering violent extremism|CVE]]) understanding and capacity of [[ECOWAS]], the [[Sahel G5]] and the national governments of Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Mauritania."&lt;ref&gt;"Partnerships for Peace | Fact Sheet | West Africa Regional."

* '''CONTACT Program:''' When it was realized that peacebuilding programs in [[West Africa]] were available exclusively in [[English language|English]], Karuna Center collaborated with Africa Consultants International and World Education to translate the CONTACT program that had been implemented previously in [[South Asian]] states.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Justice and Conflict Transformation." Social Justice and Conflict Transformation | Africa Consultants International. Accessed March 24, 2017. http://www.acibaobab.org/social-justice-and-conflict-transformation.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''East Africa'''&lt;/big&gt;

* '''Rwanda:''' KCP has led peacebuilding programs in [[Rwanda]] since the mid-1990s. From 2002 to 2012, KCP and graduates at the SIT Graduate Institute led field seminars and worked with Gisozi Museum and Proof: Media for Social Justice. This led to the development of a traveling high school exhibit in Rwanda, in 2010, to honor and introduce those who sheltered opposing community members from other ethnicities during the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]]. During this time KCP authored a conflict assessment for United States Agency for Human Rights and the [[Rwandan government]]. After receiving a grant from the [[Ignacio Martín-Baró|Martin-Baro]] Fund, the Karuna Center held workshops and seminars aimed at social healing.&lt;ref&gt;http://martinbarofund.org/projects/2006.html&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were done cooperatively with Pro-Femmes Twese Hamwe, a conglomeration of 40 Rwandan NGOs. In 2014, KCP attended the Rwanda Women Parliamentary forum intended to better understand the post-genocide development of the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.gov.rw/yourviews/newsdetails/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=428&amp;cHash=7e1f81265bb713b7af18b2e08cd8e032&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Central Africa'''&lt;/big&gt;

* '''Central African Republic:''' As of 2015 KCP became active in the [[Central African Republic]] with the intention of mitigating violence before [[UN Peacekeeping]] troop arrival. Additionally, KCP collaborated with [[United States Institute for Peace]] (UISP) to lead in-depth workshops toward design for the Planning Commission for the [[Bangui National Forum]].

&lt;big&gt;'''South Asia and Southeast Asia'''&lt;/big&gt;

* '''Nepal:''' Karuna Center has worked in [[Nepal]] and collaborated with Nepali NGOs since 1996. Beginning in 2010, KCP trained members of parliament in conflict transformation and interest-based negotiation, working with a group of 75 members of the interim parliament to resolve some of the most contentious issues in the way of developing a new constitution. KCP also trained the [[Asian Development Bank]] and [[World Bank]] in conflict-sensitive development.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.guidestar.org/profile/04-3437359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajmuste.org/intfgrants.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Afghanistan:''' In September 2007 KCP and the Initiative for Inclusive Security held a training seminar for Afghani women in [[Kabul]]. KCP has been active in [[Afghanistan]] since 2005, conducting similar seminars to other communities of women, parliament, and government ministries. The seminars—mainly focused on women’s social and legal issues was supported by, and held in conjunction with the Afghan Women’s Network, an aggregate of 90 NGOs based in Afghanistan. This work was cited in the [[United Nations]]’ Resolution 1325, which required protective rights for women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usip.org/gender_peacebuilding/about_UNSCR_1325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tides.org/fileadmin/user/pdf/Tides-Foundation-List-of-Grantees-2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhltv.net/playlist/afghanistan/PL0717B09A2EF9D90C&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''North America'''&lt;/big&gt;

* '''Local Programs:''' In 2015, KCP hosted campus-wide training at [[Amherst College]] on inclusiveness and justice. Previous to work on the Amherst College campus, KCP has been involved in the local community through partnership with the [[Paulo Freire]] Social Justice Charter School in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]]. KCP efforts within the local community have been focused on promoting greater inter-religious and inter-cultural understanding and resolving intra-community tensions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/update-on-college-response-to-amherst-uprising&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
Karuna Center for Peacebuilding has collaborated with the [[School for International Training|SIT Graduate Institute]] in Brattleboro, Vermont to teach courses in CONTACT (Conflict Transformation Across Cultures), a program that Dr. Paula Green founded in 1997 to provide intensive training and graduate certification in peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Paula (2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">{{Provinces of the Netherlands imagemap|200px}}

The '''King’s Commissioner''' ({{lang-nl|Commissaris van de Koning}}, abbreviated to ''CvdK'') is the head of a [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The officeholder chairs of both the [[States-Provincial]] (directly elected provincial legislature) and the [[Provincial-Executive (Netherlands)|Provincial-Executive]] (executive branch), but has a right to vote only in the latter. When the reigning monarch is a female, the office is '''Queen's Commissioner''' (''Commissaris van de Koningin''). As there are twelve provinces in the Netherlands, there are twelve King's Commissioners.

There are two levels of [[local government]] in the Netherlands: the provinces and the municipalities. The twelve provinces form the tier of [[Public administration|administration]] between [[central government]] and the [[municipalities]]. The three tiers are organised in largely the same way, with a directly elected legislature, which in turn chooses the executive branch, headed by an appointed chairman. At the national and municipal levels, these are the King and the Mayor; at the provincial level it is the King's Commissioner.

==Tasks of the King’s Commissioner==
The King’s Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the [[The Dutch Crown|Dutch Crown]] (the ministers, presided over by the monarch), for a term of six years, renewable. The King’s Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Dutch Crown. When a vacancy arises, the provincial council gives the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior]] a profile of the kind of candidate it would like to see in the job. Although all King’s Commissioners are prominent members of one or another of the major national [[political parties]], they are expected to be politically impartial while they are in office.

The King's Commissioners play a role within the provincial administration and are the official representatives of central government in the provinces. They coordinate [[disaster management]] and prevention and pay regular official visits to the municipalities in their region.

The King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal [[mayors]]. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]] for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior, recommending a candidate. Since the King's Commissioners are both the chairs and full members of the provincial executives, they may include some of the executive's tasks in their [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]]. They also oversee the official apparatus{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}} and any provincial utilities and represent the province in its dealings with business.

==Naming practice in Limburg==
In the Dutch province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the King’s Commissioner is usually informally called ''Gouverneur'' ("[[governor]]"), as in [[Belgium]]. Similarly, the ''Provinciehuis'' ("Province Hall") at [[Maastricht]] is called ''Gouvernement'' ("Governor’s Residence"). This local custom arose from the [[Duchy of Limburg (1839–1867)|particular status of the province in the nineteenth century]]. The official name of the office is currently the same as in the other provinces.

{{Liberalism sidebar}}

A '''liberal autocracy''' is a non-democratic government that follows the principles of [[liberalism]]. Until the twentieth century, "most countries in Western Europe were liberal autocracies, or at best, semi-democracies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fareedzakaria.com/articles/other/democracy.html The Rise of Illiberal Democracy, Fareed Zakaria, Foreign Affairs, November/ December 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051015040527/http://fareedzakaria.com/articles/other/democracy.html |date=2005-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a "classic liberal autocracy" was the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Sondra. The Democracy Reader. IDEA. 2002. page 174&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fareed Zakaria]], a more recent example is [[Hong Kong]] until July 1, 1997, which was ruled by the British Crown. He says that until 1991 "it had never held a meaningful election, but its government epitomized [[constitutional liberalism]], protecting its citizens' basic rights and administering a fair court system and bureaucracy." [[Friedrich Hayek|F.A. Hayek]] contended that the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile was also a liberal autocracy, claiming that he had "not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]." However, the historical record and many accounts by other observers indicate otherwise, citing the [[Human rights violations in Pinochet's Chile|human rights abuses and suppression of civil society]] that occurred during Pinochet's rule.

The existence of real [[liberties]] in many of these autocracies is very questionable. Nineteenth century autocracies often abolished feudal institutions like [[serfdom]], [[guild]]s, privileges for the [[nobility]], and inequality before the law. However, [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]] were at best limited. As such, liberal autocracy often preceded various forms of electoral democracy in the evolution of these nations, being much more open than feudal monarchies but less free than modern liberal democracies.

Hong Kong is arguably a special case, where during the latter stages of British colonial rule there was considerable freedom of speech and freedom of association, but also the common knowledge that China would not allow an independent state with free elections.

It was also suggested that since 2005 Egypt has been leaning towards liberal autocracy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0624_egypt_alanani.aspx Liberal Autocracy in Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201045142/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0624_egypt_alanani.aspx |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|de|Leibgarde}}''''' (also '''life-guard''', or '''household troops'''&lt;ref&gt;''Langenscheidt's Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the English and German language'': "Der Große Muret-Sander", Part I German-English, First Volume A–K, 9th edition 2002, p. 1006 – «de: Leibgarde / en: mil. especially – lifeguard, Br. life-guard»&lt;/ref&gt;) has been, since the 15th century, the designation for the military security guards who protected ''{{lang|de|[[Fürst]]en}}'' (royals and nobles) — usually members of the highest [[nobility]] who ruled over states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later its former territory — from danger. The ''{{lang|de|Leibgarde}}'' should not be mixed up with [[bodyguard]] (''{{lang|de|Leibwächter}}''), which may refer also to a single private individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary to the German Military History'', 1st edition (Liz.5, P189/84, LSV:0547, B-Nr. 746 635 0), military publishing house of the GDR (VEB) – Berlin, 1985, Volume 1, page 223, definition: ''Garde, Leibgarde''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kingdom of France]], the [[Garde du Corps (France)|Garde du Corps]] was established (with reference to the ''{{lang|fr|sargeants d'arms}}'') in 1440. It was abolished after the [[French Revolution]], re-established in 1815, and finally dissolved in 1830. In addition, [[Napoleon III]] set up the [[Cent-gardes]] for his own protection.

The children of Magyarons have already considered themselves Magyar, not Ukrainians. Thus, children of madyaron {{ill|Kurtyak Ivan Fedorovich|uk|Куртяк Іван Федорович}} were educated in the Hungarian spirit, belonged to the Magyar chauvinistic youth organization «[[Levente (organization)|Levente]]» and considered themselves Hungarians.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karpatoukraina-1939.blogspot.com/p/1.html|title=Карпатська Україна - історія, якою маємо пишатися: другий розділ ДВАДЦЯТЬ РОКІВ У ЧСР|website=karpatoukraina-1939.blogspot.com|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "Magyaron" and "Magyaronian" originated in the 19th century&amp;nbsp;— the first half of the 20th century in [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (Ukrainian) environments, meant national treason and was used to denote smeared ones [[Ukrainians#Ethnonym|Ruthenians]] (Ukrainians).

The main factor of the emergence of the Magyarons was [[Magyarization]], which was conducted by the Hungarian authorities. In the Hungarian kingdom, such living conditions and a psychological climate for national minorities were created which forced the latter, often contrary to personal principles and beliefs, to adapt to new living conditions by renouncing their own national culture, language, political, religious, and other views. In the Hungarian society, which has a high level of intolerance towards non-Magyar nationalities, only renunciation of its nationality, the recognition of itself as a Magyar and "patriotic" activity, as a rule, made it possible to obtain education, maintain or occupy a high position and advance on a career ladder, or simply have means of subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;Шандор В. Закарпаття. Історично-правовий нарис від ІХ ст. до 1920 / [[Шандор Вікентій Іванович|Вікентій Шандор]]. – Нью-Йорк: Карпатський Союз, 1992. – С. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Сміян Петро Кіндратович|ПетроСміян]].

Сміян. – Л.: Вид-во Львівського університету, 1968. – С. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the chauvinistic policy of the Hungarian authorities, but also the negative features of the mentality and the behavior of the Hungarians themselves, who at everyday level in communicating with the Ukrainians constantly tried to show their superiority, emphasize the simple-mindedness, ignorance of Transcarpathians, called them "not only", but also "savage Rushniaks", "stupid Rusyns",&lt;ref&gt;З угорської Руси // Буковина. – Чернівці. – 1895. – Ч. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; "Smelly Ruthens", "pigs", and even did not consider people as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Гнатюк В. Угроруська мізерія // Житє і слово. – Львів. – 1897. – Т. 6. Кн. 1. – С. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme attitude of the Magyars was characteristic not only to Ukrainians, but also to other Slavic peoples, as well as Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Лихутин М.Д. Записки о походh въ Венгрію въ 1849 году / М.Д. Ли-хутин. – Москва: Типографія А.И. Мамонтова и К, 1875. – С. 85-86{{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Transcarpathian Magyaron [[Alexander Dukhnovich]] wrote: {{text|For them (Magyars) all peoples - a cattle, cattle, only one Madyar was a man, "who is not Magyar, that and not a man".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Загадковий Духнович|author=Гаврош, О.|date=2013|publisher=Polihraft︠s︡entr "Lira"|isbn=9786175961315|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=y-gfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|page=39|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The children of the Magyarons usually became also the Magyarons. So, the sons of Ivan Kurtyak studied in the Magyar high school in [[Komárom]] (now [[Komárno]], [[Slovakia]]), were educated in the Hungarian spirit and belonged to the Magyar chauvinistic youth organization «[[Levente (organization)|Levente]]».&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt; One of the priests in Laborca, said: "I am only Rusyn in the church, but leaving the church&amp;nbsp;– Magyar».&lt;ref&gt;«Изъ Угорской Руси» // Слово. – Львів. – 1862. – Ч. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time of [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukrainian Revolution]] the Magyarons conducted activities against the accession of Transcarpathia to [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="zakarpattya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakarpattya.net.ua/News/118594-IAk-Zakarpattia-pryiednuvaly-do-ZUNR|website=zakarpattya.net.ua|title=Як Закарпаття приєднували до ЗУНР @ Закарпаття онлайн|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] Magyarons worked closely with the Hungarian government, attacked the Sichovyks,&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Єфремов Сергій. Бої 14-15 березня 1939 року на Карпатській Україні|author1=Сергій, Є.|author2=Олександр, П.|author3=Світлана, К.|author4=Микола, М.|date=2009|publisher=Graz͡hda|isbn=9789668924484|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=sO2iBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|page=50|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; participated in torture and shootings of soldiers of «[[Carpathian Sich]]».&lt;ref&gt;[http://territoryterror.org.ua/uk/publications/details/?newsid=312 Угорський терор в Карпатській Україні навесні 1939 року] {{ill|Museum «Terror Territory» |uk|Музей «Територія Терору»}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magyarons are also referred to as the undersigned Slovaks, who advocate the return to Hungary of at least the eastern part of Slovakia. Local Magyarons consider themselves separate from the Slovaks by the people&amp;nbsp;— Sloviaks. Back in the 19th century, Sloviak activists worked on the codification of mountains [[Slovak language#Dialects|East-Slovak dialects]] into a separate literary language. The inventors of the Sloviaks maintained loyalty to Budapest and did not support the pan-Slavic fascinations of other Slovak figures.&lt;ref name="likbez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://likbez.org.ua/ua/ukrayinska-narod-slov-yaki-abo-slovatski-madyaroni.html|title="Народ слов'яки" або словацькі мадярони &amp;#8211; Лікбез|website=likbez.org.ua|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== «Ugro-Rusyn People's Council» ==
On November 9, 1918 in Ungvár (now Uzhgorod, [[Ukraine]]) the "Ugro-Rusyn People's Council" was formed by the Magyarons. (Council of Ruthenians of Hungary), headed by the canon of the Mukachevo Greek Catholic Diocese Simeon Sabov (1863–1929). The Ugric-Rutheian People's Council adopted the "Memorandum," in which it stated that the Ugric-Rutheian people join their homeland-Hungary and advocate for the integrity of its territory.&lt;ref&gt;Гай-Нижник П., Яремчук В. На шляху до Української державності в Закарпатті // Збірник наукових праць НДІ українознавства. Київ, 2008. Т. ХХІІ. С. 300—319.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Magyarons party in Transcarpathia supported by Hungary was «{{ill|Autonomous-Agricultural Union|uk|Автономно-землеробський союз}}», founded in 1924 by the Magyaron {{ill|Kurtyak Ivan Fedorovich|uk|Куртяк Іван Федорович}}. Among the people, this party was called "Kurtyakiv", and its followers&amp;nbsp;– kurtyakivtsi. After the death of its founder 1933, the leadership of the party was taken by the editor of the party newspaper «{{ill|Russky Vistnik|uk|Русскій Вістникъ}}»&amp;nbsp;— {{ill|Brody Andriy Ivanovych|uk|Андрій Бродій}}.&lt;ref name="zakarpattya2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakarpattya.net.ua/Blogs/98731-Kovner-Pam%E2%80%99iat-antyukrainskoho-teroru.-IV|website=zakarpattya.net.ua|title=Ковнер: Пам'ять антиукраїнського терору.

'''Meena Keshwar Kamal''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/{{lang-fa|مینا کشور کمال}}; February 27, 1956 – February 4, 1987), commonly known as '''Meena''', was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[revolutionary]] [[political activist]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[women's rights]] [[activist]] and founder of [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA), who was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in 1987.

==Biography==
[[File:RAWA logo.png|thumb|Logo of the [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA)]]
In 1977, when she was a student at [[Kabul University]],&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/30/afghanistan-women-feminists-burqa|title=Afghan feminists fighting from under the burqa|author=Jon Boone|work=the Guardian|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she founded [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] ([[RAWA]]), an organization formed to promote equality and education for women and continues to "give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan". Even after the [[Saur Revolution]] there was no vast changes of women's deprivation in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afgan Narimukti Andoloner Agnishika (Bengali)|last=Seisab Shahidera|first=Biswas, P|publisher=Atirikto Publication|year=2014|isbn=978-81-928741-0-4|location=Kolkata|pages=44, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 she campaigned against [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|DRA]], and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, she launched a [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] feminist [[magazine]], ''Payam-e-Zan'' (Women's Message).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pz.rawa.org|title=پیام زن، نشریه جمعیت انقلابی زنان افغانستان - راوا|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chavis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melody Ermachild Chavis|title=Meena: Heroine Of Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyJEynFyznkC&amp;pg=PT1|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4464-8846-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gioseffi|first=Daniela|authorlink=Daniela Gioseffi|title=Women on War: An International Anthology of Women's Writings from Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH2FtB14fcEC&amp;pg=PA283|year=2003|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=978-1-55861-409-3|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also founded Watan Schools to aid [[Afghan refugees|refugee]] children and their mothers, offering both [[hospital]]ization and the teaching of practical skills.&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laconneau.com/NewsletterNovember2009.html Brave Women in a War-Torn World: RAWA and Afghanistan]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1981, by invitation of the French Government Meena represented the Afghan resistance movement at the [[French Socialist Party]] Congress. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation at the Congress, headed by [[Boris Ponamaryev]], left the hall as participants cheered when Meena started waving a victory sign.&lt;ref name="rawa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.org/meena.html|title=Biography of Martyred Meena, RAWA's founding leader|publisher=RAWA |accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=November 2015}}

== Personal life ==
Kamal was married to [[Afghanistan Liberation Organization]] leader [[Faiz Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Brodsky, Anne E.]] ''With all our strength : the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan''. [[New York City]]: [[Routledge]], 2003. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; who was murdered by agents of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] on November 12, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160918/http://web.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/AC9DD311C800E73C87256CCF005E323F?OpenDocument Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, CIA Op and Homicidal Thug]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninwar.org/CMann_afghanwomanhood.pdf Models and Realities of Afghan Womanhood: A Retrospective and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313114943/http://www.womeninwar.org/CMann_afghanwomanhood.pdf |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children, whose whereabouts are unknown.

==Assassination==
Kamal was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] on February 4, 1987. Reports vary as to who the assassins were, but are believed to have been agents of the Afghan Intelligence Service [[KHAD]], the Afghan [[secret police]], or of fundamentalist [[Mujahideen]] leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1973184.stm|title=BBC News - SOUTH ASIA - Afghan activist's killers hanged|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In a special issue of the [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] on November 13, 2006, included Meena among "60 Asian Heroes" and wrote that "Although she was only 30 when she died, Meena had already planted the seeds of an Afghan women's rights movement based on the power of knowledge." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html TIME Magazine | 60 Years of Asian Heroes: Meena] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202432/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html |date=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAWA says of her "Meena gave 12 years of her short but brilliant life to struggle for her homeland and her people. She had a strong belief that despite the darkness of illiteracy, ignorance of fundamentalism, and corruption and decadence of sell outs imposed on our women under the name of freedom and equality, finally that half of population will be awaken and cross the path towards freedom, democracy and women's rights. The enemy was rightly shivering with fear by the love and respect that Meena was creating within the hearts of our people. They knew that within the fire of her fights all the enemies of freedom, democracy and women would be turned to ashes."&lt;ref name="rawa.org"/&gt;{{Primary inline|date=November 2015}}

An enduring quote from Meena states:&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orr2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tamra Orr|title=We Visit Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLyXBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=15 September 2011|publisher=Mitchell Lane Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61228-102-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ministry of Strategy and Finance(South Korea).JPG|thumb|Headquarters in Sejong City]]
The '''Ministry of Economy and Finance''' (abbreviated to '''MOEF''') oversees the financial policies of the [[South Korean government]]. It publishes a monthly report on the national economy, known as the "Green Book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.mofe.go.kr/publications/view.html?sn=4015&amp;sub=02&amp;page=1&amp;q=&amp;flag=]&lt;/ref&gt; The current minister is [[Kim Dong-yeon]]. The headquarters is in the Sejong Government Complex in [[Sejong City]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://english.mosf.go.kr/abo/location.do?bcd=A0005 Location]." ([https://archive.is/20140101000522/http://english.mosf.go.kr/abo/location.do?bcd=A0005 Archive]) Ministry of Strategy and Finance. Retrieved on December 31, 2013. "Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Government Complex-Sejong, 477, Galmae-ro, Sejong Special Self-Governing City 339-012, Korea"&lt;/ref&gt;

MOEF has enforcement functions as well. It oversees the National Tax Tribunal and the Financial Intelligence Unit.

The ministry was formed in 1994 through the merger of the old Economic Planning Board (est. 1961) and Ministry of Finance (est. 1948).

==History==
'''1948'''

Three years after gaining independence from Japan, the Korean government was set up and it established the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Planning Board. The Ministry of Finance took charge of designing tax, financial and monetary policies as well as managing state-owned property and exchange rates. On the other hand, the Economic Planning Board was empowered in 1961 and assumed an important mandate of designing 5 year economic development plans in addition to its usual functions such as managing the government's budget and securing foreign loans. 

'''1994'''
 
As the need arose for an integrated approach to implement the government's functions on economic affairs in an efficient and coherent way, the Economic Planning Board and the Ministry of Finance was merged into the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE). 

'''1998'''
 
In a response to the financial crisis, the MOFE's functions were separated and transferred to other Ministries so as to mitigate the overconcentration of decision-making authority by MOFE. Its budgetary authority was transferred to the National Budget Administration, its financial supervision authority to the Financial Supervisory Commission, and its trade negotiating authority to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 

'''1999'''

The Planning and Budget Commission and the National Budget Administration was merged into the Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPB). 

'''2008'''
 
The Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) and the Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPB) was again merged into the Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF) in order to put under one roof fiscal policy functions and inter-ministerial policy coordination. On the other hand, the MOFE's authority on financial policies regarding the financial market was transferred to the Financial Services Commission. In 2018, the ministry changed its official English name to the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

==Offices==
Currently this Ministry is in [[Sejong Government Complex]] in Sejong City. Previously the office had its headquarters in the [[Government Complex Gwacheon]], in [[Gwacheon]], [[Gyeonggi Province]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20120611102510/http://english.mosf.go.kr/abo/location.do?bcd=A0005 Location]" (English) (). Ministry of Strategy and Finance. April 9, 2011. Retrieved on December 31, 2013. "Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Government Complex II, 49 Gwanmoonro, Gwacheon City, Gyeonggi Province, 427-725, Korea"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasks==
1. Planning and coordination of the mid- to long-term socio-economic development goals and setting economic policy direction on an annual basis

2. Distributing resources effectively and assessing the effectiveness of budget execution

3. Planning/reforming Korea's tax policy and system

4. Planning and management of policies for treasury, government properties, government accounting and the national debt

5. Coordination of policies for foreign currency transactions and international finance

6. Enhancement of international cooperation and promotion of inter-Korean economic exchanges and cooperation

7. Management and monitoring of public institutions' operation

==Criticism==
The Ministry of Economy and Finance was accused of releasing a comprehensive review on welfare-related campaign promises of each political parties before the [[South Korean legislative election, 2012|2012 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Finance Ministry Accused of Violating Election Rules | date = 2012-04-05 | url = http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Po_detail.htm?No=89419&amp;id=Po | work = KBS | accessdate = 2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minusinsk Uprising''' was a peasant uprising in November 1918 around [[Minusinsk]] in the Yenisei Province against the policy of extortion, forcible mobilization into the Siberian Army and repression by the White Guards. 

== History ==
The rebellion began on November 9, 1918 with the defeat of a punitive White detachment in the village of Dubenskoe. On November 11, the rebels captured the Cossack village of Karace. In mid-November they created a unified leadership and launched an attack on [[Minusinsk]] to defeat the punitive detachment of General Shilnikov there and establish Soviet power. On November 19, 7 detachments (about 10.000 people) under command of the Chief of the General Staff, V. Oshchepkov (a Corporal in the Tsarist army), attacked Minusinsk from three sides. However, the detachment of Shilnikov (about 3.000 soldiers) managed to repulse the persistent attacks of the rebels between 19 – 21 of November. On November 27, the uprising was suppressed, and fights against individual detachments lasted until December 7.

The defeat of the rebellion was due to poor armament (no artillery, only 2,000 rifles and a small number of cartridges) and inconsistent actions by the rebel detachments. 
The White military field court dealt brutally with the rebels: 87 people were shot, 50 forced into servitude, about 200 sentenced to imprisonment, and some 300 to a large fine. The main mass of surviving rebels went to the woods and continued a guerrilla struggle from there.

'''Order, Law and Justice''' ({{lang-bg|Ред, законност и справедливост}}, ''Red, zakonnost i spravedlivost''), abbreviated to '''RZS''', was a [[conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Bulgaria]]. Its main focus is on fighting crime and corruption.&lt;ref name="Chary"/&gt; It won the minimum ten seats in the [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|National Assembly]] at the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]], making it the smallest of the six parties in the legislature.&lt;ref name="Order, Law and Justice parliamentary group"&gt;{{cite news |title=Order, Law and Justice parliamentary group officially disbanded |first=Petar |last=Kostadinov |newspaper=[[Sofia Echo]] |date=9 December 2009 |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2009/12/09/827871_order-law-and-justice-parliamentary-group-officially-disbanded }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later some of the deputies left the parliamentary group and it broke the minimum of ten, which inevitably made all parliamentary representatives of the party independent deputies.

It is led by [[Yane Yanev]], who has frequently revealed classified documents backing up his claims of corruption.&lt;ref name="Borisov's turn"&gt;{{cite news |title=Borisov's turn |first= |last= |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=9 July 2009 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is close to the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="Chary"/&gt;

The logo of Order, Law and Justice is a blue and orange checkerboard pattern.

==History==
The party was founded by renaming and reforming the [[National Association - Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union]] (NS-BZNS), which had been part of the [[United Democratic Forces]], decided on the fourth congress of the NS-BZNS in the end of 2005. Its main goal is fighting corruption.&lt;ref name="Borisov's turn" /&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 2007 (Bulgaria)|2007 European election]], RZS won only 0.5% of the vote. By the time of the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Bulgaria)|2009 election]], this had increased to 4.7%, with RZS claiming that only [[electoral fraud]] had prevented it from receiving 10%, which would have given it two seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulgaria Opposition RZS Suspicious of Vote Manipulation |first= |last= |newspaper=[[Sofia News Agency]] |date=8 June 2009 |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=104488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, RZS took part in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|elections to]] the [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|National Assembly]]. Its parliamentary ticket was headed by [[Atanas Semov]], a law professor at the [[University of Sofia]]. Its platform called for the formation of a stable center-right coalition that would exclude the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]], a proactive campaign against political corruption, compulsory education until age 16, greater efforts to fight illiteracy, and the rejection of [[ethnic nationalism]] in politics.

The election saw RZS win 4.13% of the vote: just clearing the 4% [[election threshold|threshold]] and entitling it to ten seats.  The party supported the new centre-right government under [[Boyko Borisov]], but refused to sign an official declaration of support, after pressure from the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] over the involvement of [[Attack (political party)|Attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulgaria Conservative Party Refuses to Sign GERB Memorandum |first= |last= |newspaper=[[Sofia News Agency]] |date=17 July 2009 |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=105871&amp;FORM=ZZNR6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of RZS's MPs, [[Mario Tagarinski]], left the party on 9 December 2009, pushing the party below the minimum of ten MPs required to form an official [[parliamentary group]].&lt;ref name="Order, Law and Justice parliamentary group" /&gt;  Another MP, [[Dimitar Choukarski]], left on 11 March 2010, reducing it further to eight MPs.&lt;ref name="Order, Law, and Justice party loses one" /&gt;

The party nominated [[Atanas Semov]] for president during the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2011|2011]] presidential election. He finished seventh with only 1.84% of the popular vote.

In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|2013]] parliamentary election the party won only 1.67% of the popular vote and failed to win a seat.

'''Russian oligarchs''' (see the related term "[[New Russians]]") are [[business oligarch]]s of the [[former Soviet republics]] who rapidly accumulated wealth during the era of [[privatization in Russia|Russian privatization]] in the aftermath of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the 1990s. The [[Failed state| failing]] [[USSR| Soviet]] state left the ownership of state assets contested, which allowed for [[Blat (favors)| informal deals]] with former USSR officials (mostly in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]) as a means to acquire state property. Historian [[Edward L. Keenan]] has drawn a comparison between the current Russian phenomenon of oligarchs and the system of powerful [[Boyar#Boyars in Muscovy |boyars]] which emerged in late-Medieval [[Muscovy]].&lt;ref name="Russia's Oligarchy, Alive and Well"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/opinion/russias-oligarchy-alive-and-well.html?_r=0 "Russia's Oligarchy, Alive and Well"], by Andrew S. Weiss, ''New York Times'', December 30, 2013.  {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170204210417/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/opinion/russias-oligarchy-alive-and-well.html?_r=0 |date= February 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern Russian [[oligarchy| oligarchs]] emerged as [[business sector | business-sector]] [[entrepreneur]]s under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union| General Secretary]] 1985–1991) during his period of [[Market economy |market]] liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel, Walter]] (2017). ''The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century''. Princeton University Press. pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 51] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 222-223]&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  The term [[oligarchy| "oligarch"]] derives from the Ancient Greek word ὀλιγάρχης (oligárkhēs), meaning literally "one of few rulers".

==Yeltsin era==
By the end of the Soviet era in 1991 and during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]], many Russian businessmen imported or smuggled goods such as [[personal computer]]s and [[jeans]] into the country and sold them, often on the [[black market]], for a hefty profit.
[[File:Анатолий Чубайс.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Anatoly Chubais]], the man most credited with the Yeltsin-era privatization that led to the growth of the oligarchs&lt;ref name=ProfileAnatoly&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357755.stm Profile: Anatoly Chubais,” BBC News, March 17,2005]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the 1990s, once [[Boris Yeltsin]] became [[President of Russia]] in 1991, the oligarchs emerged as well-connected entrepreneurs who started from nearly nothing and became rich through participation in the [[market (economics)|market]] via connections to the corrupt, but elected, [[government of Russia]] during the state's transition to a [[market-based economy]]. The so-called [[voucher privatization|voucher-privatization]] program enabled a handful of young men to become billionaires, specifically by [[arbitrage|arbitraging]] the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities (e.g. [[Natural gas|gas]], oil) and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in private [[Swiss bank accounts]] rather than investing in the [[Russian economy]], they were dubbed "[[kleptocrat]]s".&lt;ref name=Granville&gt;Johanna Granville, [https://www.academia.edu/5597850/The_Russian_Kleptocracy_and_Rise_of_Organized_Crime  "The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime."] ''Demokratizatsiya'' (summer 2003), pp. 448-457.&lt;/ref&gt; These oligarchs became extremely unpopular with the Russian public, and are commonly thought of as the cause of much of the turmoil that plagued the country following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Holmstrom, Nancy; Richard Smith (February 2000). [http://monthlyreview.org/2000/02/01/the-necessity-of-gangster-capitalism "The Necessity of Gangster Capitalism: Primitive Accumulation in Russia and China"]. ''Monthly Review''. Monthly Review Foundation. '''51''' (09).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the oligarchs as "about as popular with your average Russian as a man idly burning bundles of £50s outside an orphanage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6708103.stm Profile: Boris Berezovsky] [[BBC]] Retrieved on April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,1655229,00.html What a carve-up!] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved on April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Soviet business oligarchs include relatives or close associates of government officials, even government officials themselves, as well as [[crime in Russia|criminal bosses]] often connected to the Russian government&lt;ref&gt;https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/organized-crime-russia&lt;/ref&gt; who achieved vast wealth by acquiring state assets very cheaply (or for free) during the [[privatization in Russia|privatization process]] controlled by the Yeltsin government of 1991–1999.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chrystia Freeland|Freeland, Chrystia]] (2000). ''Sale of the Century: Russia's Wild Ride from Communism to Capitalism''. New York: Crown Business.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific accusations of [[Corporate crime|corruption]] are often leveled at [[Anatoly Chubais]] and [[Yegor Gaidar]], two of the "Young Reformers" chiefly responsible for [[Russian privatization]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~gusev/russian/gybio.html|title=Grigory Yavlinsky|website=www.cs.ccsu.edu|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/SAM-Advanced-Management-Journal/98831087.html Privatization in Russia: its past, present, and future] SAM Advanced Management Journal, 1 January 2003.

Retrieved 31 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Satter]], author of ''Darkness at Dawn'', "what drove the process was not the determination to create a system based on [[universal value]]s but rather the will to introduce a system of private ownership, which, in the absence of law, opened the way for the criminal pursuit of money and power".&lt;ref&gt;Satter, David. ''Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State''. Yale University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, outright criminal groups – in order to avoid attention – assign front-men to serve as executives and/or "legal" owners of the companies they control.

Although the majority of oligarchs were not formally connected with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], there are allegations that they were promoted (at least initially) by the communist [[apparatchik]]s, with strong connections to Soviet power structures and access to the monetary funds of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Politics – Faking Democracy in the Post-Soviet World, [[Andrew Wilson (historian)|Andrew Wilson]], [[Yale University Press]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braguinsky, Serguey, and Roger Myerson. "A macroeconomic model of Russian transition." ''Economics of Transition'' 15.1 (2007): 77–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Official Russian media usually depict oligarchs as the enemies of "communist forces". The latter is a [[stereotype]] that describes political power that wants to restore Soviet-style communism in Russia.

During Yeltsin's presidency (1991–1999) oligarchs became increasingly influential in Russian politics; they played a significant role in financing the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|re-election of Yeltsin in 1996]]. With [[insider information]] about financial decisions of the government, oligarchs could easily increase their wealth even further. The [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] hit some of the oligarchs hard, however, and those whose holdings were still based mainly on banking lost much of their fortunes.

The most influential and exposed oligarchs from the Yeltsin era include [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], [[Mikhail Fridman]], [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Alexander Smolensky]], [[Pyotr Aven]], [[Vladimir Vinogradov]] and [[Vitaly Malkin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/oligarchs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LCYNMjG-y8oJ:www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1996/11/article/british-paper-names-banking-clique/316590.html+&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk British Paper Names Banking Clique] at ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', November 5, 1996 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Butrin.

''[[Kommersant]]'', March 5, 2002 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; They formed what became known as [[Semibankirschina]] (or seven bankers), a small group of business moguls with a great influence on Boris Yeltsin and his political environment. Together they controlled from 50% to 70% of all Russian finances between 1996 and 2000.

Fridman, Potanin, Aven and Malkin are the only ones on the list to have retained their influence in the Putin era, which began in 1999. Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky and Gusinsky "have been purged by the Kremlin", according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/19/russia Billionaires boom as Putin puts oligarchs at N2 in global rich list The Guardian, 19 Feb 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Putin era==
{{further|Russia under Vladimir Putin}}
The most famous oligarchs of the Putin era include [[Roman Abramovich]], [[Alexander Abramov]], [[Oleg Deripaska]], [[Mikhail Prokhorov]], [[Alisher Usmanov]], [[German Khan]], [[Viktor Vekselberg]], [[Leonid Mikhelson]], [[Vagit Alekperov]], [[Mikhail Fridman]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Pyotr Aven]], and [[Vitaly Malkin]].

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin apparently engaged in a power-struggle with some oligarchs, reaching a "grand bargain" with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain their powers, in exchange for their explicit support of – and alignment with – Putin's government.&lt;ref&gt;''Putin: Russia's Choice''.

Fernández Jilberto, Barbara Hogenboom (Routledge, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Many more [[business people]] have become oligarchs during Putin's time in power, and often due to personal relations with Putin, such as the rector of the institute where Putin obtained a degree in 1996, [[Vladimir Litvinenko]],&lt;ref name="Bureau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/03/02/the-fabulous-riches-of-putins-inner-circle/ |title=The fabulous riches of Putin's inner circle |publisher=The Bureau Investigates |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Putin's childhood friend and [[judo]]-teacher [[Arkady Rotenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/russian-oligarchs-2013-4/ Oligarchology] by Alex Yablon, ''New York Magazine'', Mar 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, other analysts argue that the oligarchic structure has remained intact under Putin, with Putin devoting much of his time to mediating power-disputes between rival oligarchs.&lt;ref name="Russia's Oligarchy, Alive and Well" /&gt; Some had been imprisoned, such as [[Mikhael Mirilashvili]].

During Putin's presidency, a number of oligarchs came under fire for various illegal activities, particularly [[tax evasion]] in the businesses they acquired. However, it is widely speculated and believed that the charges were also politically motivated per these tycoons falling out of favor with the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/european_court_rules_khodorkovskys_rights_violated/24210627.html European Court Rules That Khodorkovsky's Rights Were Violated], Radio Free Europe, 31 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/22/former-russian-tycoon-mikhail-khodorkovsky-first-news-conference-released-prison/ "Khodorkovsky speaks out on plight of Russia's political prisoners"].

This was subsequently extended to 14 years, and after Putin pardoned him,  he was released on 20 December 2013.&lt;ref name="YukosCase"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hague court awards $50 bn compensation to Yukos shareholders|url=http://www.russiaherald.com/index.php/sid/224207121/scat/723971d98160d438/ht/Hague-court-awards-50-bn-compensation-to-Yukos-shareholders|accessdate=29 July 2014 |work=Russia Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'oligarch' has also been applied to technology investors such as [[Yuri Milner]], although without involvement in Russian politics.&lt;ref name=wired-mag&gt;[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/10/mf_milner/all/ Wired Magazine: "How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley" by Michael Wolff] October 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the out-of-favor oligarchs, often associated with Chubais's party—the [[Union of Right Forces]], argue that the companies they acquired were not highly valued at the time because they still ran on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] principles, with non-existent [[stock control|stock-control]], huge payrolls, no financial reporting and scant regard for profit. They turned the businesses around and made them profitable for shareholders. They obtain little sympathy from the Russian public due to resentment over the economic disparity they represent.

An economic study distinguishes 21 oligarchic groups as of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Guriev |first1= Sergei |last2= Rachinsky |first2= Andrei |title= The role of oligarchs in Russian capitalism |journal= Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=2005|pages=131-150|doi= 10.1257/0895330053147994|url= https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0895330053147994 |volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed 36 billionaires of Russian citizenship, with a note: "this list includes businessmen of Russian citizenship who acquired the major share of their wealth privately, while not holding a governmental position". In 2005, the number of billionaires dropped to 30, mostly because of the [[Yukos]] case, with Khodorkovsky dropping from #1 (US$15.2&amp;nbsp;billion) to #21 (US$2.0&amp;nbsp;billion).

A 2013 report by Credit Suisse found that 35% of the wealth of Russia was owned by the wealthiest 110 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The world's wealthy: where on earth are the richest 1%? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/09/worlds-wealthy-where-russia-rich-list |website=The Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire, philanthropist, art patron and former KGB agent [[Alexander Lebedev]] has criticized the oligarchs, saying "I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption." Lebedev has also described them as "a bunch of uncultured ignoramuses", saying "They don't read books. They don't have time. They don't go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht." He also notes that the oligarchs have no interest in social injustice.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/25/russian-oligarchs-oleg-deripaska |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Twilight of the oligarchs |first=Luke |last=Harding |date=October 25, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oligarchs in London===
A significant number of Russian oligarchs have bought homes in upmarket sections of [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Weiss, ''IN PLAIN SIGHT: The Kremlin's London Lobby'', World Affairs, Vol. 175, No. 6 (MARCH / APRIL 2013), pp. 84-91.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]], which has been dubbed "Moscow on Thames."&lt;ref&gt;According to British journalist Nick Watt, reporting for ABC's ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. (broadcast of June 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as [[Eugene Shvidler]], [[Alexander Knaster]], [[Konstantin Kagalovsky]] and Abram Reznikov, are [[expatriate]]s, having taken permanent residency in London. This community has led to journalists calling the city "Londongrad". Most own homes in both countries as well as property and have acquired controlling interests in major European companies. They commute on a regular basis between the [[European Union|EU]] and Russia; in many cases their families reside in London, with their children attending school there. In 2007 Abram Reznikov bought one of Spain's mega recycling companies, Alamak Espana Trade SL, while [[Roman Abramovich]] bought the English football club, [[Chelsea F.C.]], in 2003, spending record amounts on players' salaries.&lt;ref&gt;"Over there: American and other foreign owners are revolutionizing British football", ''[[Boston Globe]],'' May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 global recession and credit crisis===
According to the financial news-agency [[Bloomberg L.P.]], Russia's wealthiest 25 individuals have collectively lost US $230&amp;nbsp;billion (£146 billion) since July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Chorafas, D.

Billionaires in Russia and Ukraine have been particularly hard-hit by lenders seeking repayment on [[balloon loan]]s in order to shore up their own balance sheets. Many oligarchs took out generous loans from Russian banks, bought shares, and then took out more loans from western banks against the value of these shares.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2008/10/23/billionaires-margin-calls-biz-billies-cx_af_1023billiemargin.html |title=Margin Calls Ignite Billionaire Fire Sale|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026022503/http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/10/23/billionaires-margin-calls-biz-billies-cx_af_1023billiemargin.html|archivedate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to get hit by the global downturn was [[Oleg Deripaska]], Russia's richest man at the time, who had a net worth of US$28&amp;nbsp;billion in March 2008. As Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral, the collapse in share price forced him to sell holdings to satisfy the [[margin call]]s.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com" /&gt;

{{for|the literal means of preparing salami sausage|Salami}}

'''Salami slicing''' refers to a series of many small actions, often performed by clandestine means, that as an accumulated whole produces a much larger action or result that would be difficult or unlawful to perform all at once.  The term is typically used [[pejoratively]].  Although salami slicing is often used to carry out illegal activities, it is only a strategy for gaining an advantage over time by accumulating it in small increments, so it can be used in legal ways as well.

An example of [[salami]] slicing, also known as '''penny shaving''', is the [[fraud]]ulent practice of stealing money repeatedly in extremely small quantities, usually by taking advantage of [[rounding]] to the nearest cent (or other monetary unit) in financial transactions.  It would be done by always rounding down, and putting the fractions of a cent into another account. The idea is to make the change small enough that any single transaction will go undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all.net/CID/Attack/papers/Salami2.html|title=Salami Attacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[information security]], a '''salami attack''' is a series of minor attacks that together results in a larger attack. Computers are ideally suited to automating this type of attack.

In politics, the term [[salami tactics]] has been used since the 1940s to refer to a [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition.

In academia, salami slicing refers to the practice of creating several short publications out of material that could have, perhaps more validly, been published as a single article in a journal or review. (See also [[least publishable unit]]).

==Salami slicing attacks==
In January 1993, four executives of a rental-car franchise in Florida were charged with defrauding at least 47,000 customers using a salami technique.&lt;ref name=networkworld&gt;[http://www.mekabay.com/nwss/116p--salami_fraud.pdf Salami fraud] By M. E. Kabay Network World Security Newsletter, 07/24/02&lt;/ref&gt;

In Los Angeles, in October 1998, district attorneys charged four men with fraud for allegedly installing computer chips in gasoline pumps that cheated consumers by overstating the amounts pumped.&lt;ref name=networkworld/&gt;

In 2008, a man was arrested for fraudulently creating 58,000 accounts which he used to collect money through verification deposits from online brokerage firms a few cents at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/201252/hacker-takes-50000-a-few-cents-at-a-time.html|title=Hacker takes $50,000 a few cents at a time|date=2008-05-28|publisher=PC Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In politics ==
On 6 September 2018 British [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] [[Tom Tugendhat]], in a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] speech, accused the Russian Government of salami slicing tactics:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-09-06/debates/7073CC9A-53E4-4157-88F9-495945616E03/GlobalBritainAndTheInternationalRules-BasedOrder|title=Hansard 6 September 2018 - Global Britain and the International Rules-based Order|last=|first=|date=6 September 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6328">The '''Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre''' (SAIC) was set up in 2014, funded by the [[Scottish Funding Council]], [[Scottish Enterprise]], and [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]], with funding matched by the industry. It is hosted by the [[University of Stirling]].

The role of SAIC is to transform the relationship between the aquaculture industry and research communities in Scotland. By developing connections and collaboration between them, it aims to promote innovative solutions to industry-defined issues and problems.

== Aquaculture and Scotland ==
[[Aquaculture]] is a “pillar of rural industry in Scotland”, according to the Scottish Government, contributing as much as £1.4 billion turnover and 8,000 jobs to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Scotland (April 2014). “An Assessment of the Benefits to Scotland of Aquaculture”.  http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0045/00450799.pdf. Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its industry and academic researchers also contribute to Scotland’s reputation abroad. The main activities within the sector are the farming / culturing of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and seaweed, much of them in the [[seas west of Scotland]] and north of Scotland.

Salmon dominates the sector, and Scotland is the largest producer in the EU and the third largest globally.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, Annual Report 2013. http://scottishsalmon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FINAL-Annual-Report-aug-14.pdf Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Current annual production of salmon in Scotland is about 160,000 tonnes, generating global retail sales of more than £1 billion. Fresh salmon is exported to over 50 countries, with the US the main export market for fresh whole salmon in 2013, followed by France.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, Annual Report 2013. http://scottishsalmon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FINAL-Annual-Report-aug-14.pdf Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims of SAIC ==
By bringing together the industry and research communities, SAIC aims to foster further economic growth in the industry, introduce more sustainable practices, and prepare the industry for the future. To target its work most effectively, it has identified four Priority Innovation Actions for its first year of operations:
•	Improved sea lice control in Scottish aquaculture
•	Alternative sustainable feeds for finfish
•	Rapid detection methods for viral pathogens and diseases
•	Development of secure health-certified Scottish mollusc spat production systems.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre, Executive Summary. {{cite web |url=http://scottishaquaculture.com/scottish-aquaculture-news-events |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141114155808/http://scottishaquaculture.com/scottish-aquaculture-news-events |archivedate=2014-11-14 |df= }} Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

All these areas have been identified by the industry, its customers and communities as the most pressing areas requiring innovation and collaboration.

Scotland and its rural communities could benefit greatly from action in these areas. It is estimated that each additional 10,000 tonnes of salmon creates an additional £96 million for the Scottish economy, of which over £43 million is at the farm gate.&lt;ref&gt;Science Scotland, Issue 16, Special Issue: Innovation Centres (Autumn 2014). http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/publications/sciencescotland/ScienceScotland16.pdf Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and structure of SAIC ==
The Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre was launched by the Scottish Government’s Minister for Environment and Climate Change, Paul Wheelhouse, at the Royal Highland Show at Ingliston in 2014. Its Chair is Jack Perry, a former CEO of Scottish Enterprise, and its CEO is Heather Jones.

One of its first actions was to secure £1.7 million funding for state-of-the-art equipment to help address key issues in the industry. The equipment will be installed at higher education institutions across Scotland, including the University of St Andrews, University of the Highlands and Islands, University of Aberdeen and University of Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;SAIC, “£1.7 million capital investment for Scottish Aquaculture” (6 November 2014). {{cite web |url=http://scottishaquaculture.com/scottish-aquaculture-news-events |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141114155808/http://scottishaquaculture.com/scottish-aquaculture-news-events |archivedate=2014-11-14 |df= }} Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

SAIC is one of eight Innovation Centres funded by the Scottish Funding Council, which is investing up to £110 million in core funding over five years. In addition to the Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre, they include: the Innovation Centre for Sensors and Imaging Systems (CENSIS); Digital Health Institute (DHI); Oil &amp; Gas Innovation Centre (OGIC); and Stratified Medicine Scotland Innovation Centre (SMS-IC).&lt;ref&gt;Science Scotland, Issue 16, Special Issue: Innovation Centres (Autumn 2014). http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/publications/sciencescotland/ScienceScotland16.pdf Retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the launch of the Centres and their work, the Scottish Government Education Secretary Mike Russell stated: “The innovation centre collaborations ... will help develop the skills that Scottish business needs to success in the global marketplace in a range of sectors.

“By using Scotland’s exceptional research base, we are able to respond nimbly to opportunities for potential growth.”&lt;ref&gt;“£14 million boost for Scotland’s innovation centres”. The Scotsman. 20 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''secretariat''' of an organization is the department that fulfils its [[Central administration|central administrative]] or [[General Secretary|general secretary]] duties. The term is especially associated with [[government]]s and [[intergovernmental organization]]s such as the [[United Nations Secretariat|United Nations]], although some [[non-governmental organization]]s (for example, the [[International Organization for Standardization]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/contact.htm Contact ISO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524173200/http://www.iso.org/iso/contact.htm |date=2012-05-24 }}, official web site of ISO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm About ISO], official web site of ISO.&lt;/ref&gt;) also refer to their administrative department as their secretariat. The building or office complex that houses such a department may also be referred to as its secretariat or secretariat building.

In some cases, the secretariat is not a bureaucratic organ, but one which includes a certain organization run by all its members who collectively help to organize the larger group, such as the secretariat of the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], which is an office that rotates irregularly between its member Federations.

The [[Zhongshu Sheng]] or simply the Secretariat was one department in the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] structure in the [[history of China]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13505">{{About|secretaries as leaders in organizations|the common meaning of secretary as an office support worker, which can also be a title|secretary}}
'''Secretary''' is a title often used in organizations to indicate a person having a certain amount of [[authority]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], or importance in the organization. Secretaries announce important events and communicate to the organization. The term is derived from the Latin word {{lang|la|secernere}}, "to distinguish" or "to set apart", the passive participle ({{lang|la|secretum}}) meaning "having been set apart", with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential, as with the English word ''secret.'' A {{lang|la|secretarius}} was a person, therefore, overseeing business confidentially, usually for a powerful individual (a king, pope, etc.).

The official title of the leader of most [[communist party|communist]] and [[socialist party|socialist]] political parties is the "'''General Secretary of the Central Committee'''" or "'''First Secretary of the Central Committee'''". When a communist party is in power, the General Secretary is usually the country's ''[[de facto]]'' leader (though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions to monopolize power, such as a [[President#Presidents_as_head_of_state|presidency]] or [[premier]]ship in order to constitute ''[[de jure]]'' leadership of the state), such as [[China]] and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Xi's here to stay: China leader tipped to outstay term|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3730755/Xis-stay-China-leader-tipped-outstay-term.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=9 August 2016|quote="A lot of analysts now see it as a given" that Xi will seek to stay [[Communist Party of China|Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], the [[China|country]]'s most powerful [[Paramount leader|post]], said Christopher K. Johnson, a former CIA analyst and now China specialist at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the term ''secretarius'' was used "from the beginning of the thirteenth century in the varying meanings of a confidential clerk, an ambassador, or a member of the king's council".&lt;ref name="Ruthven"&gt;J. Otway-Ruthven, ''The King's Secretary and the Signet Office in the XV Century'' (1939), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourteenth century, the title became strongly associated with the keeper of the king's [[signet ring|signet]].&lt;ref name="Ruthven"/&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] to the late 19th century, men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful assumed the title of secretary. With time, like many titles, the term was applied to more and varied functions, leading to compound titles to specify the authority associated with its use, like general secretary or [[financial secretary]].

In some countries, such as the United States, the term ''secretary'' is used to indicate the holder of a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level post. This usage derives in part from the desire of the founders of the United States to differentiate the country from the United Kingdom,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} which denoted such offices as [[minister (government)|ministers]]. There are a number of popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has a high degree of authority, such as '''general secretary''' (or, following usage in the [[Norman language]], '''secretary-general'''), '''first secretary''', and '''executive secretary'''.

In a [[club (organization)|club]] or [[society]], the secretary is also considered to be, in most cases, the third person in charge of the organization, after the president/chairman and vice president/vice chairman.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', 4th edition, Scott, Foresman and Company, Chicago, 1915, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–247.&lt;/ref&gt;  In smaller organizations, the secretary typically takes [[meeting minutes]], notifies members of meetings, contacts various persons in relation to the society, administers the day-to-day activities of the organization, and creates the order of business. The secretary of a [[non-governmental organization]] or [[international non-governmental organization]] can be vice president/vice chairman.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

==General secretary==

[[File:Social Justice Week Cardboard Village.JPG|thumb|upright=2|College students live in tents for a week to call attention to perceived social injustice]]

'''Social justice''' is a concept of fair and [[Justice|just]] relations between the [[individual]] and [[society]]. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the [[distribution of wealth]], opportunities for personal activity, and [[Privilege (social inequality)|social privileges]]. In [[Western Civilization|Western]] as well as in older [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their [[Role theory|societal roles]] and receive what was their due from society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[The Politics]]'' (ca 350 BC)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Augustine "&gt;{{cite book |url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5cQDUWg9Kd8djVCRFoyQTZYS0k |title = "Augustine on Justice," a Chapter in Augustine and Social Justice |publisher = Lexington Books |author = Clark, Mary T. |year = 2015 |pages = 3–10 |isbn = 978-1-4985-0918-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Dynamics"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5cQDUWg9Kd8eXZMWHU3ckpQVUk |title = Social Justice, Global Dynamics : Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher = Taylor and Francis |author1 = Banai, Ayelet |author2 = Ronzoni, Miriam |author3 = Schemmel, Christian |year = 2011 |location = Florence |isbn = 978-0-203-81929-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the current global [[grassroots]] movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for [[social mobility]], the creation of [[Social safety net|safety nets]] and [[Economic inequality|economic justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5cQDUWg9Kd8V3hpa0V1ekFQZms |title = Seeking Social Justice Through Globalization Escaping a Nationalist Perspective |publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press |author = Kitching, G.

Social justice assigns rights and duties in the [[institution]]s of society, which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation. The relevant institutions often include [[taxation]], [[social insurance]], [[public health]], [[State school|public school]], [[public services]], [[labor law]] and [[regulation]] of [[Market (economics)|markets]], to ensure [[fair]] [[distribution of wealth]], and [[equal opportunity]].&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (1971) 4, "the principles of social justice: they provide a way of assigning rights and duties in the basic institutions of society and they define the appropriate distribution of benefits and burdens of social co-operation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations that relate justice to a [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocal relationship]] to society are mediated by differences in cultural traditions, some of which emphasize the individual responsibility toward society and others the equilibrium between access to power and its responsible use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5cQDUWg9Kd8cTlPd2dzZ3d3TG8 |title = The Antecedents Of Help Giving In Chinese   Culture: Attribution, Judgment Of Responsibility, Expectation Change And The Reaction Of Affect |author1 = Aiqing Zhang |author2 = Feifei Xia |author3 = Chengwei Li |journal = Social Behavior and Personality |year = 2007 |volume = 35 |issue = 1 |pages = 135–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures such as [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], in philosophical debates about differences among human beings, in efforts for gender, racial and [[social equality]], for advocating justice for [[Emigration|migrants]], prisoners, the [[environmental justice|environment]], and the physically and developmentally [[disability|disabled]].&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples "&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5cQDUWg9Kd8R1pZQm1WeVEwVVE |title = Indigenous Peoples and the Capitalist World System:  Researching, Knowing, and Promoting Social Justice |author = Jalata, Asafa |journal = Sociology Mind |year = 2013 |volume = 3 |issue = 2 |pages = 156–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Nature"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5cQDUWg9Kd8MWRYV0xVUzNlRlU |title = Nature, Human Nature, and Human Difference : Race in Early Modern Philosophy |publisher = Princeton University Press |author = Smith, Justin E.

While the concept of social justice can be traced through the theology of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and the philosophy of [[Thomas Paine]], the term "social justice"  became used explicitly from the 1840s. A [[Jesuit]] priest named [[Luigi Taparelli]] is typically credited with coining the term, and it spread during the [[revolutions of 1848]] with the work of [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]].&lt;ref name="Augustine " /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Paine |first1 = Thomas |title = Agrarian Justice }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

In the later 20th century, social justice was made central to the philosophy of the [[social contract]], primarily by [[John Rawls]] in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971). In 1993, the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] treats social justice as a purpose of [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the International Labour Organization|The Preamble of ILO Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II, D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors such as [[Friedrich Hayek]]  criticize the concept of social justice, arguing the lack of objective, accepted moral standard; and that while there is a legal definition of what is just and equitable "there is no test of what is socially unjust", and further that social justice is often used for the reallocation of resources based on an arbitrary standard which may in fact be inequitable or unjust.

== History ==
{{Main|Social contract|Justice|Corrective justice|Distributive justice}}

The different concepts of [[justice]], as discussed in ancient [[Western philosophy]], were typically centered upon the community.
* [[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|An Artist's rendering of what Plato might have looked like, From Raphael's early 16th century painting, &lt;i&gt;Scuola di Atene&lt;/i&gt;]] [[Plato]] wrote in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that it would be an ideal state that "every member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (ca 380BC)&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for J.N.V University, author D.R. Bhandari says, "Justice is, for Plato, at once a part of human virtue and the bond, which joins man together in society. It is the identical quality that makes good and social. Justice is an order and duty of the parts of the soul, it is to the soul as health is to the body. Plato says that justice is not mere strength, but it is a harmonious strength. Justice is not the right of the stronger but the effective harmony of the whole. All moral conceptions revolve about the good of the whole-individual as well as social".&lt;ref name="bu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Anci/AnciBhan.htm |title = 20th WCP: Plato's Concept Of Justice: An Analysis |publisher =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161005111127/http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Anci/AnciBhan.htm |archivedate = 5 October 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman copy in marble of a Greek bronze bust of Aristotle by Lysippos, c. 330 BC.The alabaster mantle is modern.]] [[Plato]] believed rights existed only between free people, and the law should take "account in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality."  Reflecting this time when [[slavery]] and subjugation of women was typical, ancient views of justice tended to reflect the rigid class systems that still prevailed. On the other hand, for the privileged groups, strong concepts of fairness and the community existed. [[Distributive justice]] was said by [[Aristotle]] to require that people were distributed goods and assets according to their merit.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' V.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Head of Socrates in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme (Rome).JPG|thumb|upright|Socrates]] [[Socrates]] (through [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Crito]]'') is attributed with developing the idea of a [[social contract]], whereby people ought to follow the rules of a society, and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Crito]]'' (ca 380 BC)&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, religious scholars particularly, such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued discussion of justice in various ways, but ultimately connected being a good citizen to the purpose of serving God.

After the [[Renaissance]] and [[Reformation]], the modern concept of social justice, as developing human potential, began to emerge through the work of a series of authors. [[Baruch Spinoza]] in ''[[On the Improvement of the Understanding]]'' (1677) contended that the one true aim of life should be to acquire "a human character much more stable than [one's] own", and to achieve this "pitch of perfection... The chief good is that he should arrive, together with other individuals if possible, at the possession of the aforesaid character."&lt;ref&gt;B Spinoza, ''[[On the Improvement of the Understanding]]'' (1677) [[s:On the Improvement of the Understanding#12|para 13]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and responding to the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s, [[Thomas Paine]] similarly wrote in ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1792) society should give "genius a fair and universal chance" and so "the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward... all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions."&lt;ref&gt;[[T Paine]], ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1792) 197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fr. Luigi Taparelli.jpg|thumb|right|''Social justice'' has been traditionally credited to be coined by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Luigi Taparelli]] in the 1840s, but the expression is older]]

Although there is no certainty about the first use of the term "social justice", early sources can be found in Europe in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="pérez27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pérez-Garzón|first=Carlos Andrés|date=2018-01-14|title=Unveiling the Meaning of Social Justice in Colombia|url=https://revistas.juridicas.unam.mx/index.php/mexican-law-review/article/view/11892|journal=Mexican Law Review|language=en-US|volume=10|issue=2|pages=27–66|issn=2448-5306|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some references to the use of the expression are in articles of journals aligned with the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which social justice is described as an obligation of the monarch;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TnMLHOwjqgMC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=%22justice+sociale%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22justice%20sociale%22&amp;f=false|title=Journal encyclopédique...

Dissertazione|date=1789|publisher=na|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to this sources and the context, social justice was another term for "the justice of society", the justice that rules the relations among individuals in society, without any mention to socio-economic equity or human dignity.&lt;ref name="pérez27"/&gt;

The usage of the term started to become more frequent by Catholic thinkers from the 1840s, including the [[Jesuit]] [[Luigi Taparelli]] in ''Civiltà Cattolica'', based on the work of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He argued that rival [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]] theories, based on subjective [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking, undermined the unity of society present in [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[metaphysics]] as neither were sufficiently concerned with [[ethics|moral]] [[philosophy]].  Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, [[John Stuart Mill]] stated in ''[[Utilitarianism]]'' his view that "Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge."&lt;ref&gt;[[JS Mill]], ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (1863)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 19th and early 20th century, social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy, particularly in the work of [[John Dewey]], [[Roscoe Pound]] and [[Louis Brandeis]]. One of the prime concerns was the ''[[Lochner era]]'' decisions of the [[US Supreme Court]] to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement, such as the [[eight-hour day]] or the right to join a [[trade union]]. After the First World War, the founding document of the [[International Labour Organization]] took up the same terminology in its preamble, stating that "peace can be established only if it is based on social justice". From this point, the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse.

Thus, in 1931, the [[Pope Pius XI]] stated the expression for the first time in the [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic Social Teaching]] in the encyclical [[Quadragesimo anno|Quadragesimo Anno]]. Then again in [[Divini Redemptoris|Divini Redepmtoris]], the Church pointed out that the realisation of social justice relied on the promotion of the [[Human dignity|dignity of human person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19370319_divini-redemptoris.html|title=Divini Redemptoris (March 19, 1937) {{!}} PIUS XI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, and because of the documented influence of [[Divini Redemptoris]] in its drafters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyn|first=Samuel|date=2014|title=The Secret History of Constitutional Dignity|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol17/iss1/2/|journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Journal|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=|issn=1548-2596|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was the first one to establish the term as a principle of the economy in the State, and then other countries around the world did the same throughout the 20th century, even in [[Socialism|Socialist regimes]] such as the [[Constitution of Cuba|Cuban Constitution]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="pérez27"/&gt; 

In the late 20th century, a number of liberal and conservative thinkers, notably [[Friedrich von Hayek]] rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything, or meant too many things.&lt;ref&gt;[[FA Hayek]], ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'' (1973) vol II, ch 3&lt;/ref&gt; However the concept remained highly influential, particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as [[John Rawls]]. Even though the meaning of social justice varies, at least three common elements can be identified in the contemporary theories about it: a duty of the State to [[Distributive justice|distribute]] certain vital means (such as [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]]), the protection of [[human dignity]], and [[affirmative action]]s to promote [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for everybody.&lt;ref name="pérez27"/&gt;

==== Cosmic values ====

[[Hunter Lewis]]' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] as a key premise in social justice. His manifesto on [[sustainability]] ties the continued thriving of human life to real conditions, the environment supporting that life, and associates injustice with the detrimental effects of [[unintended consequences]] of human actions. Quoting classical Greek thinkers like [[Epicurus]] on the good of pursuing happiness, Hunter also cites ornithologist, naturalist, and philosopher [[Alexander Skutch]] in his book Moral Foundations:

{{quote|The common feature which unites the activities most consistently forbidden by the moral codes of civilized peoples is that by their very nature they cannot be both habitual and enduring, because they tend to destroy the conditions which make them possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anh-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Sustainability-the-Complete-Concept1.pdf |author = Hunter Lewis |title = Sustainability, The Complete Concept, Environment, Healthcare, and Economy |date = 14 October 2009 |publisher = ChangeThis }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cosmic harmony, justice and peace are closely interrelated:

In ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'', [[Thomas Sowell]] writes that seeking utopia, while admirable, may have disastrous effects if done without strong consideration of the economic underpinnings that support contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowell |first1=Thomas |title=The quest for cosmic justice |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0684864630 |edition=1st Touchstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Rawls ====
{{Main|John Rawls}}

Political philosopher [[John Rawls]] draws on the [[utilitarian]] insights of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], the [[social contract]] ideas of [[John Locke]], and the [[categorical imperative]] ideas of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. His first statement of principle was made in ''A Theory of Justice'' where he proposed that, "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (2005 reissue), Chapter 1, "Justice as Fairness" – 1. The Role of Justice, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deontological]] proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] terms. His views are definitively restated in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' where society is seen "as a fair system of co-operation over time, from one generation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''Political Liberalism'' 15 (Columbia University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

All societies have a basic structure of social, economic, and political institutions, both formal and informal. In testing how well these elements fit and work together, Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract. To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate, he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it, but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding. Obviously, not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved, so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable. Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement:
* The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes, and, to that extent, X holds these powers as a [[trustee]] for the citizen.
* X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate. The citizen, therefore, is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way.
This applies to one person who represents a small group (e.g., the organiser of a social event setting a dress code) as equally as it does to national governments, which are ultimate trustees, holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries. Governments that fail to provide for [[social welfare|welfare]] of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate. To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments, Rawls asserted that, "There is ... a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason. But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, Political Liberalism 291–92 (Columbia University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold&amp;nbsp;— to some extent, the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome. According to Rawls, the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are:
* [[Freedom of thought]];
* Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion, philosophy, and morality;
* Political liberties (e.g., representative democratic institutions, [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]], and [[freedom of assembly]]);
* [[Freedom of association]];
* Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (namely: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and
* Rights and liberties covered by the [[rule of law]].

==== Thomas Pogge ====

[[Thomas Pogge]]'s arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits. He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution, that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable.  Pogge argues that social institutions have a [[negative duty]] to not harm the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = James |first1 = Nickel |title = Human Rights |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-human/ |website = stanford.edu |publisher = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate = 10 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Pogge |first1 = Thomas Pogge |title = World Poverty and Human Rights |url = http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/ |website = thomaspogge.com |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150919070037/http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/ |archivedate = 19 September 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge speaks of "institutional cosmopolitanism" and assigns responsibility to institutional schemes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = North |first1 = James |title = The Resource Privilege |url = http://www.thenation.com/article/181724/resource-privilege# |website = thenation.com |accessdate = 10 February 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150210065716/http://www.thenation.com/article/181724/resource-privilege |archivedate = 10 February 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for deficits of human rights.  An example given is slavery and third parties.  A third party should not recognize or enforce slavery.  The institutional order should be held responsible only for deprivations of human rights that it establishes or authorizes.  The current institutional design, he says, systematically harms developing economies by enabling corporate tax evasion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Pogge |first1 = Thomas |title = Human Rights and Just Taxation – Global Financial Transparency |url = http://thomaspogge.com/human-rights-and-just-taxation-global-financial-transparency/ |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150210074345/http://thomaspogge.com/human-rights-and-just-taxation-global-financial-transparency/ |archivedate = 10 February 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; illicit financial flows, corruption, trafficking of people and weapons.

==== United Nations ====

The United Nations’ 2006 document ''Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations'', states that "Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth..."&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web |title = Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations", The International Forum for Social Development, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Social Policy and Development, ST/ESA/305 |publisher = United Nations |location = New York |year = 2006 |url = https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/ifsd/SocialJustice.pdf |format = PDF |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170829123826/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/ifsd/SocialJustice.pdf |archivedate = 29 August 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

The term "social justice" was seen by the U.N. "as a substitute for the protection of human rights [and] first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s. At the initiative of the Soviet Union, and with the support of developing countries, the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development, adopted in 1969."&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;{{rp|52}}

The same document reports, "From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence, repression and chaos."&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;{{rp|6}} The report concludes, "Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent [[redistribution of income and wealth|redistributive policies]] conceived and implemented by public agencies."&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The same UN document offers a concise history: "[T]he notion of social justice is relatively new. None of history’s great philosophers—not Plato or Aristotle, or Confucius or Averroes, or even Rousseau or Kant—saw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective. The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine. It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist [[exploitation of labour]] and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition. It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity. Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s, social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists.... By the mid-twentieth century, the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world..."&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

== Religious perspectives ==

=== Hinduism ===

The present-day [[Jāti]] hierarchy is undergoing changes for a variety of reasons including 'social justice', which is a politically popular stance in democratic India. Institutionalized affirmative action has promoted this. The disparity and wide inequalities in social behaviour of the jātis – exclusive, endogamous communities centred on traditional occupations – has led to various [[Social reformers of India|reform movements]] in [[Hinduism]]. While legally outlawed, the caste system remains strong in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Patil |first1 = Vijaykumar |title = Caste system hindering the goal of social justice: Siddaramaiah |url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caste-system-hindering-the-goal-of-social-justice-cm/article6822818.ece |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050652/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caste-system-hindering-the-goal-of-social-justice-cm/article6822818.ece |archivedate = 4 September 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In Muslim history, Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice.{{additional citation|date=April 2018}} Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the [[Umayyad#Insurrection|Abbasid revolt]] against the Umayyads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[John L. Esposito]] |title = Islam and Politics |publisher = Syracuse University Press |year = 1998 |page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shi'a believe that the return of the ''Mahdi'' will herald in "the messianic age of justice" and the Mahdi along with the Isa (Jesus) will end plunder, torture, oppression and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[John L. Esposito]] |title = Islam and Politics |publisher = Syracuse University Press |year = 1998 |page = 205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of [[consumerism]] and [[communism]]. The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work. However, the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need. It held that ''zakat'' (alms-giving) was not voluntary charity, but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[John L. Esposito]] |title = Islam and Politics |publisher = Syracuse University Press |year = 1998 |pages = 147–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the ''zakat'' through taxes.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Tikkun olam}}

In ''To Heal a Fractured World: The Ethics of Responsibility'', Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that social justice has a central place in [[Judaism]]. One of Judaism’s most distinctive and challenging ideas is its [[ethics]] of responsibility reflected in the concepts of [[simcha]] ("gladness" or "joy"), [[tzedakah]] ("the religious obligation to perform charity and philanthropic acts"), [[chesed]] ("deeds of kindness"), and [[tikkun olam]] ("repairing the world"). {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

From its founding, Methodism was a Christian social justice movement. Under [[John Wesley]]'s direction, Methodists became leaders in many social justice issues of the day, including the [[prison reform]] and [[abolitionism|abolition]] movements. Wesley himself was among the first to preach for slaves rights attracting significant opposition.&lt;ref&gt;S. R.

The ''Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church'' says, "We hold governments responsible for the protection of the rights of the people to free and fair elections and to the freedoms of speech, religion, assembly, communications media, and petition for redress of grievances without fear of reprisal; to the [[right to privacy]]; and to the guarantee of the rights to adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, and health care."&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2012 ¶164 V, [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5066539&amp;ct=6467671&amp;notoc=1 umc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206020517/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5066539&amp;ct=6467671&amp;notoc=1 |date=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Methodist Church also teaches [[Human population control|population control]] as part of its doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008 ¶ 162 K, [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5066539&amp;ct=6467635&amp;notoc=1 umc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206012803/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5066539&amp;ct=6467635&amp;notoc=1 |date=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholicism ====
{{Main|Catholic social teaching}}

Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life. A distinctive feature of Catholic social doctrine is its concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. Two of the seven key areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/projects/socialteaching/excerpt.htm |title = Seven Key Themes of Catholic Social Teaching |publisher = Web.archive.org |date =  |accessdate = 29 March 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608113958/http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/projects/socialteaching/excerpt.htm |archivedate = 8 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of "Catholic social teaching" are pertinent to social justice:
* Life and dignity of the human person: The foundational principle of all "Catholic Social Teaching" is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person, from conception to natural death. Human life must be valued above all material possessions.
* Preferential option for the poor and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]]: Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the [[Day of Judgement]] God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy: "Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church believes that through words, prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with, and compassion for, the poor. The moral test of any society is "how it treats its most vulnerable members. The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation. People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Option for the Poor, [http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm Major themes from Catholic Social Teaching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216183419/http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm |date=16 February 2006 }}, Office for Social Justice, Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine, social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church:
* [[Pope Leo XIII]], who studied under Taparelli, published in 1891 the [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (On the Condition of the Working Classes; lit. "On new things"), rejecting both socialism and capitalism, while defending labor unions and private property. He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not [[class conflict]] and [[competition]]. In this document, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony.
* The encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (On Reconstruction of the Social Order, literally "in the fortieth year") of 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]], encourages a [[living wage]],&lt;ref&gt;Popularised by [[John A. Ryan]], although see [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897)&lt;/ref&gt; [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order, saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] added much to the corpus of the [[Catholic social teaching]], penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics, politics, geo-political situations, ownership of the means of production, private property and the "[[social mortgage]]", and private property. The encyclicals ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice. Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and [[human rights]], and spoke forcefully for the poor. He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused, and admits a fear that the "progress" of the world is not true progress at all, if it should denigrate the value of the human person. He argued in ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' that private property, markets, and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person.
* [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' ("God is Love") of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics, and not of the church, which has charity as its central social concern. It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate, using reason and natural law, and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics.
* The official Catholic doctrine on '''social justice''' can be found in the book ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', published in 2004 and updated in 2006, by the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace|Pontifical Council ''Iustitia et Pax'']].

The Catechism (§&amp;nbsp;1928–1948) contain more detail of the Church's view of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |title = Catechism of the Catholic Church – Social justice |publisher = Vatican.va |date =  |accessdate = 29 March 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105063620/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |archivedate = 5 November 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional Chinese religion ===
{{main|Mandate of Heaven}}

The Chinese concept of Tian Ming has occasionally been perceived{{by whom|date=May 2018}} as an expression of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Jen-der (2014), "Crime and Punishment: The Case of Liu Hui in the Wei Shu", ''Early Medieval China: A Sourcebook'', New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 156–165, {{ISBN|978-0-231-15987-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through it, the deposition of unfair rulers is justified in that civic dissatisfaction and economical disasters is perceived as [[Tian|Heaven]] withdrawing its favor from the Emperor. A successful rebellion is considered definite proof that the Emperor is unfit to rule.

== Social justice movements ==
{{Progressivism}}

Social justice is also a concept that is used to describe the movement towards a socially just world, e.g., the [[Global Justice Movement]]. In this context, social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality, and can be defined as ''"the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society"''.&lt;ref&gt;Just Comment – Volume 3 Number 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[social movement|movements]] are working to achieve social justice in society. These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society, regardless of background or procedural justice, have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Capeheart |first1 = Loretta |first2 = Dragan |last2 = Milovanovic |title = [[Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberation theology ===
{{Main|Liberation theology}}

Liberation theology&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. This article uses the term in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a movement in [[Christian]] [[theology]] which conveys the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianity perverted by [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist-Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=4 September 2013 }}," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Catholic Church]] in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;''Liberation Theology and Its Role in Latin America''. Elisabeth Erin Williams. Monitor: Journal of International Studies. The College of William and Mary.&lt;/ref&gt; It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. The term was coined by the [[Peruvian]] priest, [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation'' (1971). According to [[Sarah Kleeb]], "Marx would surely take issue," she writes, "with the appropriation of his works in a religious context...there is no way to reconcile Marx's views of religion with those of Gutierrez, they are simply incompatible. Despite this, in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world, and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path, the two have much in common; and, particularly in the first edition of [A Theology of Liberation], the use of Marxian theory is quite evident."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kleeb, "[https://www.academia.edu/172232/Envisioning_Emancipation_Karl_Marx_Gustavo_Gutierrez_and_the_Struggle_of_Liberation_Theology Envisioning Emancipation: Karl Marx, Gustavo Gutierrez, and the Struggle of Liberation Theology]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Checkingfax |fix-attempted=yes }}"; Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion (CSSR), Toronto, 2006. Retrieved 22 October 2012. {{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noted exponents are [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Carlos Mugica]] of Argentina, [[Jon Sobrino]] of El Salvador, and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, ''Catholicism'' (Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care ===

Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of [[bioethics]]. Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care, especially for low income households and families. The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families, and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare. [[Ruth Faden]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics]] and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most. They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings.

Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686–1691&lt;/ref&gt; These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level, gender, education or any other stratifying factors. Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1868&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights education ===
{{Main|Human rights education}}

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] affirm that "Human rights education should include peace, democracy, development and social justice, as set forth in [[international human rights instruments|international and regional human rights instruments]], in order to achieve common understanding and awareness with a view to strengthening universal commitment to human rights."&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II, paragraph 80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice. [[moral relativism|Moral relativists]] deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general. [[non cognitivism|Non-cognitivists]], [[moral skepticism|moral skeptics]], [[moral nihilism|moral nihilists]], and most [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice. [[Political realism|Political realists]] believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the [[status quo]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Many other people{{who|date=November 2018}} accept some of the basic principles of social justice, such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value, but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this. One example is the statement by [[H. G. Wells]] that all people are "equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen."&lt;ref&gt;"The Rights of Man", ''Daily Herald'', London, February 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics: rejects the very idea of social justice as meaningless, religious, self-contradictory, and ideological, believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible, and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty:
{{quote|There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed, and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such (as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined) would appear just to us. [Social justice] does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense, like the term 'a moral stone'.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F.A. (1982). ''Law, Legislation and Liberty, Vol. 2''. Routledge. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ben O'Neill of the [[University of New South Wales]] argues that, for proponents of "social justice":&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Ben (16 March 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice The Injustice of Social Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028092912/http://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice |date=28 October 2014 }}, ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|the notion of "rights" is a mere term of entitlement, indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good, no matter how important or trivial, abstract or tangible, recent or ancient. It is merely an assertion of desire, and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire.

In fact, since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods, paid for through the efforts of others, the term actually refers to an intention to use ''force'' to acquire one's desires. Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action, production and voluntary exchange, but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them!}}

The '''Southern Movement''' ({{Lang-ar|الحراك الجنوبي}} ''al-Ḥirāk al-Janūbiyy''), sometimes known as the '''Southern Separatist Movement''', or '''South Yemen Movement''', and colloquially known as '''al-Hirak''',&lt;ref name="time2011"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2081756,00.html | work=Time | title=Is South Yemen Preparing to Declare Independence? | date=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[political movement]] and [[paramilitary]] organization active in the south of [[Yemen]] since 2007, demanding secession from the [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]] and a return to the former independent state of [[South Yemen]]. At present, its political branch, the [[Southern Transitional Council]] led by [[Aidarus al-Zoubaidi]], is the de facto leadership in all provinces of the south.&lt;ref name="ALMONITOR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/01/south-yemen-separatists-advances-aden-uae.html|title=Advancing separatists could restore South Yemen|date=1 February 2018|agency=[[Al-Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Divided Yemen.svg|thumb|Yemen prior to unification|300px]]
After the union between [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen|South Yemen]] and [[North Yemen]] on May 22, 1990, a [[1994 civil war in Yemen|civil war]] broke out in 1994. This came after leaders of the former independent southern state declared an end to the unity deal amidst an alleged power-grabbing usurp by their northern counterparts. The result was a swift defeat of the weakened southern forces and the expulsion of most of its leaders out of Yemen, including the former Secretary-General of the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] and the Vice-President of the unified Yemen, [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=al-Suwaidi|editor1-first=Jamal S.|year=1995|title=The Yemeni War of 1994: Causes and Consequences|publisher=Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research|isbn=0863563007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1994 civil war, calls for southern independence were successfully put down and the national unity was maintained. Grievances however remained high amongst many residents of the south. Accusations of corruption, nepotism and electoral fraud were levelled against the new ruling party based in Sana'a, led by President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], as well as a mishandling of the power-sharing arrangement agreed to by both parties in the 1990 unity deal.

Many in the south also felt that their land, home to much of the country's oil reserves and wealth resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-05-25|title=North Yemeni Troops Seize Oil Field Center; Region Controls Country's Chief Resource|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-892404.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was being exploited after the unity deal. Privately owned land was seized and distributed amongst people affiliated with the Sana'a government. Several hundred thousand military and civil employees from the south were forced into early retirement, and compensated with pensions below the subsistence level. Although equally low living standards were prevalent throughout the whole of Yemen, many in the south felt that they were being intentionally targeted and dismissed from important posts,&lt;ref name= Kambeck&gt;Kambeck, Jens (2016). [http://carpo-bonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carpo_policy_report_03_2016.pdf "Returning to Transitional Justice in Yemen"]. Bonn: Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient.&lt;/ref&gt; and being replaced with northern officials affiliated with the new government. The city of Aden, the former capital city of South Yemen, was also seen to be neglected both socially and economically, whilst investments appeared to be focussed instead on Sana'a, the new capital.

Beyond the economic grievances were also cultural and social ones too. Many in the south long believed they held a distinct historical path with their northern neighbours, which became more evident after the 1990 unity. After 128 years of British rule, South Yemen was an independent state for 23 years. Despite economic difficulty in its later years with the collapse of its main backer the [[Soviet Union]], the socialist state prided itself on its free healthcare, education and welfare system. Many in [[Aden]] today speak foreign languages or have technical skills as a result of their state-sponsored education abroad enjoyed in the days of pre-unity South Yemen. Unlike the north, tribalism was looked upon with disdain and generally stamped out of everyday life in the south, which instead preferred the law and order of civil society passed onto them from British rule. Post-1994 unity saw a gradual return of tribalism into southern society. It is not uncommon for residents of the south to even refer to those from the north as being "mutikhalifeen" or backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-south/in-yemens-aden-anger-mixes-with-nostalgia-idUSTRE60K25220100121|title=In Yemen's Aden, anger mixes with nostalgia|date=2010-01-21|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, grieving pensioners who had not been paid for years began to organise small demonstrations demanding better rights and an end to the economic and political marginalization of the south. As the protests spread throughout Aden and grew more popular, so too did the demands of those protesting. Eventually, calls were being made once again for the secession of the south and the re-establishment of South Yemen as an independent state. The government's response to these peaceful protests was heavy-handed, labelling them as 'apostates of the state' and using live ammunition to disperse the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/12/15/name-unity/yemeni-governments-brutal-response-southern-movement-protests|title=In the Name of Unity|date=2009-12-15|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This eventually gave birth to the Southern Movement, which grew to consist of a loose coalition of groups seeking a complete secession from the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/12/15/yemen-end-harsh-repression-south|title=Yemen: End Harsh Repression in South|date=2009-12-15|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence in the south was restricted, and their actions were limited to the organising of protests and marches across the south which were often met with deadly violence. To raise the former flag of South Yemen was considered a crime in Aden, although a common practice outside of the city where government control was limited.

===Since 2015===
In 2015, the Southern Movement rose to prominence after entering into a loose alliance with the exiled President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi|Hadi]] and proving to be a vital force in the [[Battle of Aden (2015)|pushback]] against Houthi forces from the southern city of Aden,&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/world/middleeast/yemen-aden-houthis-saudi-arabia.html?referer=https://www.google.co.uk/ | title=Saudi-Backed Forces Said to Wrest Aden, Yemen, From Houthis | date=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving both financial and military assistance from members of the  [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Gulf coalition]] as a result.

Today, the Southern Movement through its political branch the [[Southern Transitional Council]] has a significant presence in all areas of the former southern territories. Flags of the former southern republic are flown from Aden to Hadramout, often alongside those of the Arab coalition as a gesture of gratitude for their ongoing support.

[[File:Official southern transitional council logo.png|thumb|Logo of the STC|150px]]

In January 2018, the [[Southern Transitional Council|STC]] broke away from Hadi after [[Battle of Aden (2018)|clashes]] in the city of Aden saw their forces overrun all governmental buildings aligned to the president in exile. At present, the STC, led by [[Aidarus al-Zoubaidi]], is the de facto leadership in all provinces of the south.

According to [[Reuters]] after the 1994 [[Yemeni unification]], the leaders of al-Hirak were exiled in [[Hezbollah]]-controlled [[Beirut]] and received training from [[Iran]]'s [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]]. In 2015, the leaders of the movement moved to [[Abu Dhabi]] and allied themselves with the [[United Arab Emirates]], leaving Iran's orbit. "They want to fight Iranian militias trying to seize our lands, and we do too. This is enough for the alliance to make sense for now," one southern official told Reuters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-uae-security-yemen-somalia/uae-extends-military-reach-in-yemen-and-somalia-idUKKBN1IC12B|title=UAE extends military reach in Yemen and Somalia|first=Noah|last=Browning|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Appendix to the Journals of the Senate and Assembly of the session of the Legislature of the State of California (1917) (14595351117).jpg|thumb|A spreading ground in California, circa 1917]]

A '''spreading ground''' is a water conservation facility that retains surface water long enough for it to percolate into the soil.  Spreading grounds must be located where underlying soils are permeable and connected to a target [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dpw.lacounty.gov/wrd/SpreadingGround/ |title=spreading grounds |website=Public Works, Water Resources Division |publisher=[[Government of Los Angeles County]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locating them above silt or clay would prevent the surface water from reaching formations that store water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrd.org/engineering/groundwater-replenishment-spreading-grounds.php |title=Groundwater Replenishment |website=Water Replenishment District of Southern California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When natural percolation of precipitation is insufficient to [[groundwater recharge|replenish groundwater]] withdrawn for human use, artificial recharge helps prevent aquifer depletion, subsidence and [[saltwater intrusion]]. Spreading grounds are one of several available technologies, and are useful to harness [[storm water runoff]] in populated areas with low annual precipitation.
For example, [[Los Angeles County, California]] has 27 such facilities, and four more operated in conjunction with the department, many of which date to the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dpw.lacounty.gov/wrd/SpreadingGround/information/ |title=Spreading Facilities Owned and Operated by the Department |publisher=[[Government of Los Angeles County]] |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mozingo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mozingo|first1=Joe|title=A behind-the-scenes battle to divert L.A.'s storm water from going to waste|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-storm-water-capture-20160311-story.html|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While managed aquifer recharge (MAR) projects utilizing storm water and diverted surface water runoff augment groundwater recharge, data suggests that the infiltration capacity of spreading grounds in drought-prone regions is underused due to the seasonality of rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works Water Resources Division. Hydrologic Report, 2013−2014; County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works: Los Angeles, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, interest is being generated around MAR projects that utilize recycled water to supplement other water sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, Jonathan L.; Luthy, Richard G. (2017-10-06). "Modeling and Optimization of Recycled Water Systems to Augment Urban Groundwater Recharge through Underutilized Stormwater Spreading Basins". ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology''. '''51''' (20): 11809–11819. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1021/acs.est.7b02671. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0013-936X.&lt;/ref&gt; Orange County's Groundwater Replenishment System serves as an example of one such system that is combining recycled water and storm water to recharge groundwater through spreading grounds to meet the municipality's annual water needs.&lt;ref&gt;Orange County Water District. About GWRS &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ocwd&lt;/nowiki&gt;. com/gwrs/about-gwrs/ (accessed December 26, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many spreading grounds, which were once considered single-purpose facilities, are being converted to combine municipalities' goals for groundwater recharge with demands for additional recreational opportunities, green space and wildlife habitat. The Dominguez Gap Wetlands in Long Beach, CA, which consists of two spreading grounds, is an example of one of these multi-purpose facilities. While the facility's east basin was converted into constructed wetlands, the west basin remains a spreading ground that recharges the local aquifer by an estimated 450-acre feet annually.&lt;ref&gt;Landers J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4970">'''Texas Senate Bill 5''' ('''SB 5''') is a bill that implements a form of [[Voter Identification laws|voter identification law]] in the state of [[Texas]]. It is a revamped version of a previous Texas voter ID law ('''SB 14''') that was introduced in 2011.

SB 5 was filed on February 21, 2017 during the regular session of the [[eighty-fifth Texas Legislature]]. The bill passed the [[Texas Senate]] with a 21-10 vote, and it passed the [[Texas House of Representatives]] with a 92-56 vote with 1 present, not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.senate.texas.gov/sjrnl/85r/pdf/85RSJ05-27-F.PDF#page=99|title=Senate Journal - 65th Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.house.texas.gov/hjrnl/85r/pdf/85RDAY84FINAL.PDF#page=25|title=Texas House Journal - 84th Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor [[Greg Abbott]] signed the bill on June 1, 2017, and it became effective January 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;Bill=SB5|title=Texas Legislature Online - 85(R) Actions for SB 5|website=capitol.texas.gov|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bill Content ==
Texas Senate Bill 5 requires voters to present an acceptable form of photo ID before casting a ballot at the polls. There are currently 7 acceptable forms of ID:

# Texas Driver License
# Texas Election Identification Certificate 
# Texas Personal Identification Card
# Texas Handgun License
# U.S. Military Identification Card (with a photograph of the voter)
# U.S. Citizenship Certificate (with a photograph of the voter)
# U.S. Passport &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/advisory2018-08.shtml|title=Voter Identification Procedures under Senate Bill 5 (2017)|website=www.sos.state.tx.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For voters between the ages of 18-69, the above ID’s cannot be expired for more than 4 years. For voters aged over 70, any of the above valid ID’s can be expired for more than 4 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under the bill, voters who do not possess any of the seven forms of ID and are unable to obtain one through reasonable means may vote if they complete a Reasonable Impediment Declaration and show one of the following supporting forms of ID:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

# Copy of/original  government document with name and address of voter and voter registration certificate
# Copy of/original current utility bill
# Copy of/original bank statement

# Copy of/original paycheck
# Copy of/original of a certified domestic birth certificate
# Copy of/ original document that confirms the voter's identity and birth (a foreign birth certificate would apply).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legal Challenges ==
On August 23, 2017, U.S. District Judge [[Nelva Gonzales Ramos]] ruled that Texas Senate Bill 5 failed to sufficiently reform the discriminatory effect the original voter ID law (SB 14) had on Hispanic and black voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/23/federal-judge-tosses-new-texas-voter-id-law/|title=Federal judge tosses new Texas voter ID law; state plans to appeal|last=Tribune|first=The Texas|date=2017-08-23|work=The Texas Tribune|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SB 14 had previously been ruled against by both the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals]] and Judge Ramos for its discriminatory impact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The August 23, 2017 decision by Judge Ramos was appealed by the State of Texas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case on December 5, 2017 and ultimately reversed Ramos' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/12/05/texas-heads-back-5th-circuit-long-winding-voter-id-fight/|title=Federal appeals judges question challenge to revised Texas voter ID law|last=Tribune|first=The Texas|date=2017-12-05|work=The Texas Tribune|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/27/5th-circuit-decision-texas-voter-id/|title=Federal appellate court upholds embattled Texas voter ID law|last=Tribune|first=The Texas|date=2018-04-27|work=The Texas Tribune|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2017, the Appellate Court upheld SB 5 in a 2-1 decision on the grounds that intentional discrimination cannot be traced from SB 14 to the newly revised SB 5 without a new legal challenge directed specifically at SB 5.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression''''' is a 1997 book by [[Stéphane Courtois]], [[Nicolas Werth]], [[Andrzej Paczkowski]] and several other European academics{{r|contributors_note|group=note}} documenting a history of [[political repression]]s by [[Communist state]]s, including genocides, [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial executions]], [[deportation]]s, killing population in labor camps and artificially created [[famine]]s. The book was originally published in France as ''Le Livre noir du communisme: Crimes, terreur, répression'' by [[Éditions Robert Laffont]]. In the United States, it was published by [[Harvard University Press]],{{r|"Dennis_et.al_2003"|p=217}} with a foreword by [[Martin Malia]]. The German edition, published by [[Piper Verlag]], includes a chapter written by [[Joachim Gauck]]. The introduction was written by Courtois. Historian [[François Furet]] was originally slated to write the introduction, but was prevented from doing so by his death.{{r|Rousso_2002|p=51}} The book has been translated into numerous languages, sold million of copies and is considered one of the most influential, although one of the most controversial, books written about communism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigir Suny. Russian "Terror/ism and Revisionist Historiography". ''Australian Journal of Politics and History'': Volume 53, Number 1, 2007, pp. 5-19. "The Black Book may be the single most influential text on the Soviet Union and other state socialist regimes and movements published since The ''GULag Archipelago''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronso.n Review: Communism's Posthumous Trial Reviewed Work(s): The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression by Stéphane Courtois; The Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century by François Furet; The Burden of Responsibility: Blum, Camus, Aron, and the French Twentieth Century by Tony Judt; Le Siècle des communismes by Michel Dreyfus. ''History and Theory'', Vol. 42, No. 2 (May 2003), pp. 222-245&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book's title was chosen to echo the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]]'s ''[[Black Book (World War II)|Black Book]]'', a documentary record of Nazi atrocities by [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]].{{r|Russo_et.al_2004|p=xiii}}

== "Introduction: The Crimes of Communism" ==
In the first chapter of the book entitled "Introduction: The Crimes of Communism", [[Stéphane Courtois]] states that "[[Communist state|Communist regime]]s turned mass crime into a full-blown system of government" and they are responsible for a greater number of deaths than [[Nazism]] or any other political system.{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|p=2}}

=== Estimated number of victims ===
According to the chapter, the number of people killed by the Communist governments amounts to more than 94 million.{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|p=4}} The statistics of victims include deaths through executions, man-made hunger, famine, war, deportations and [[Unfree labour|forced labor]]. The breakdown of the number of deaths is given as follows:
* 65 million in the [[People's Republic of China]]
* 20 million in the [[Soviet Union]]
* 2 million in [[Cambodia]]
* 2 million in [[North Korea]]
* 1.7 million in [[Ethiopia]]
* 1.5 million in [[Afghanistan]]
* 1 million in the [[Eastern Bloc]]
* 1 million in [[Vietnam]]
* 150,000 in [[Latin America]]
* 10,000 deaths "resulting from actions of the international Communist movement and Communist parties not in power"{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|p=4}}

According to Courtois, the crimes by the Soviet Union included the following: 
* The execution of tens of thousands of hostages and prisoners
* The murder of hundreds of thousands of rebellious workers and peasants from 1918 to 1922
* The [[Russian famine of 1921]], which caused the death of 5 million people
* The [[Decossackization]], a policy of systematic repression against the [[Don Cossacks]] between 1917 and 1933

=== Comparison of Communism and Nazism ===
Courtois considers Communism and Nazism to be distinct, but comparable [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian systems]]. He says that Communist regimes have killed "approximately 100 million people in contrast to the approximately 25 million victims of the Nazis".{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|p=15}} Courtois claims that Nazi Germany's methods of mass extermination were adopted from Soviet methods. As an example, he cites the Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] official [[Rudolf Höss]] who organized the infamous [[extermination camp]], [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. According to Höss:{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|p=15}} {{quote|The Reich Security Head Office issued to the commandants a full collection of reports concerning the Russian concentration camps. These described in great detail the conditions in, and organization of, the Russian camps, as supplied by former prisoners who had managed to escape. Great emphasis was placed on the fact that the Russians, by their massive employment of forced labor, had destroyed whole peoples.}}

Courtois argues that the Soviet crimes against peoples living in the Caucasus and of large [[social group]]s in the Soviet Union could be called "genocide" and that they were not very much different from similar policies by Nazis. Both Communist and Nazi systems deemed "a part of humanity unworthy of existence. The difference is that the Communist model is based on the class system, the Nazi model on race and territory".{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|p=15}} Courtois further stated: {{quote|The "genocide of a "class" may well be tantamount to the genocide of a "race"—the deliberate starvation of a child of a Ukrainian [[kulak]] as a result of the famine caused by Stalin's regime "is equal to" the starvation of a Jewish child in the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw ghetto]] as a result of the famine caused by the Nazi regime.}}

He added: {{quote|After 1945 the Jewish genocide became a byword for modern barbarism, the epitome of twentieth-century mass terror. [...] [M]ore recently, a single-minded focus on the Jewish genocide in an attempt to characterize [[the Holocaust]] as a unique atrocity has also prevented the assessment of other episodes of comparable magnitude in the Communist world. After all, it seems scarcely plausible that the victors who had helped bring about the destruction of a genocidal apparatus might themselves have put the very same methods into practice. When faced with this paradox, people generally preferred to bury their heads in sand. [...] Communist regimes have victimized approximately 100 million people in contrast to the approximately 25 million of the Nazis.}}

== German edition ==
The German edition contains an additional chapter on the Soviet-backed Communist regime in [[East Germany]] titled "Die Aufarbeitung des Sozialismus in der DDR". It consists of two subchapters, "Politische Verbrechen in der DDR" by [[Ehrhart Neubert]]; and "Vom schwierigen Umgang mit der Wahrnehmung" by [[Joachim Gauck]].{{r|Courtois_et.al_1998_Ger}}

== Reception ==
The book has evoked a wide variety of responses, ranging from enthusiastic support to severe criticism.

=== Support ===
''The Black Book of Communism'' received praise in many publications in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], including ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[Library Journal]]'', ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[National Review]]'' and ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''.{{r|reviews_harvard}} The book has also been influential in [[Eastern Europe]], where it was uncritically embraced by prominent politicians and intellectuals—many of these intellectuals popularized it using terminology and concepts popular with the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]].{{r|USHMM|p=47,59}}

Historian [[Tony Judt]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "The myth of the well-intentioned founders—the good czar Lenin betrayed by his evil heirs—has been laid to rest for good. No one will any longer be able to claim ignorance or uncertainty about the criminal nature of Communism".{{r|reviews_harvard}} Similarly, historian Jolanta Pekacz remarked that the "archival revelations of ''The Black Book'' collapse the myth of a benign, initial phase of communism before it was diverted from the right path by circumstances".{{r|Pekacz_2001|p=311}} [[Anne Applebaum]], journalist and author of ''[[Gulag: A History]]'', described the book as "a serious, scholarly history of Communist crimes in the Soviet Union, Eastern and Western Europe, China, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, Africa, and Latin America [...]. ''The Black Book'' does indeed surpass many of its predecessors in conveying the grand scale of the Communist tragedy, thanks to its authors' extensive use of the newly opened archives of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe".{{r|reviews_harvard}}

Historian [[Martin Malia]], who prefaced the English-language edition of the book,{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|pp=ix-xx}} described it as "the publishing sensation in France [...] detailing Communism's crimes from Russia in 1917 to Afghanistan in 1989... [''The Black Book of Communism''] gives a balance sheet of our present knowledge of Communism's human costs, archivally based where possible, and otherwise drawing on the best secondary works, and with due allowance for the difficulties of quantification".{{r|reviews_harvard}}

Political scientist [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], whose work focuses on Eastern Europe, wrote that "the ''Black Book of Communism'' succeeds in demonstrating is that Communism in its Leninist version (and, one must recognize, this has been the only successful application of the original dogma) was from the very outset inimical to the values of individual rights and human freedom". Tismaneanu argued that Courtois' comparison of Communism to Nazism was broadly justifiable, writing that while "[a]nalytical distinctions between them are certainly important, and sometimes Courtois does not emphasize them sufficiently", their "commonality in terms of complete contempt for the bourgeois state of law, human rights, and the universality of humankind regardless of spurious race and class distinctions is in my view beyond doubt".{{r|Tismaneanu_2001|p=126}} Tismaneanu further noted that in making his comparison, Courtois was drawing on Grossman's earlier explorations of the same theme in ''[[Life and Fate]]'' and ''[[Forever Flowing]]''.

Several reviewers have singled out Nicolas Werth's "State against its People"{{r|Courtois_et.al_1999|pp=33-268}} as being the most notable and best researched contribution in the book.{{r|Scammell_1999}}{{r|Kenez_1999}} [[Intellectual historian]] Ronald Aronson wrote: "[Werth] is concerned, fortunately, neither to minimize nor to maximize numbers, but to accurately determine what happened".{{r|Aronson_2003|p=233}}

=== Criticism ===
Whereas chapters of the book, where it describes the events in separate Communist states, were highly praised, some generalizations made by Courtois in the introduction to the book became a subject of criticism both on scholarly and political{{r|Torpey_2001|p=139}} grounds.{{r|Aronson_2003|p=236}}{{r|Goslan_2006|p=13}}{{r|Dean_2010|p=68-72}} Moreover, two of the book's main contributors—Nicolas Werth and Jean-Louis Margolin—as well as Karel Bartosek{{r|LeMonde_Chemin_1997}} publicly disassociated themselves from Courtois' statements in the introduction and criticized his editorial conduct. Werth and Margolin felt Courtois was "obsessed" with arriving at a total of 100 million killed which resulted in "sloppy and biased scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017|title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|page=140|isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R. Ghodsee}}&lt;/ref&gt; and faulted him for exaggerating death tolls in specific countries.{{r|LeMonde_Chemin_1997}}{{r|Gvosdev_2008|p=194}}{{r|Ghodsee_2017|p=123}} They also argued that based on the results of their studies, one can tentatively estimate the total number of the victims at between 65 and 93 million.{{r|LeMonde_Margolin_Werth_1997}} In particular, Margolin, who authored the ''Black Book''{{'}}s chapter on Vietnam, clarified "that he has never mentioned a million deaths in Vietnam".{{r|LeMonde_Chemin_1997}} Historians [[Jean-Jacques Becker]] and [[J. Arch Getty]] have criticized Courtois{{r|Becker_1998|p=178}} for failing to draw a distinction between victims of neglect and famine and victims of "intentional murder".{{r|Getty_2000}} [[Economic historian]] [[Michael Ellman]] has argued that the book's estimate of "at least 500,000" deaths during the [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|Soviet famine of 1946–1947]] "is formulated in an extremely conservative way, since the actual number of victims was much larger", with 1,000,000–1,500,000 excess deaths.{{r|Ellman_2000}} Regarding these questions, historian [[Alexander Dallin]] has argued that moral, legal, or political judgments hardly depend on the number of victims.{{r|Dallin_}}

Many observers have rejected Courtois's numerical and moral comparison of Communism to Nazism in the introduction.{{r|Goslan_2006|p=148}}{{r|Bartov_2002}} According to Werth, there was still a qualitative difference between Nazism and Communism, saying: "Death camps did not exist in the Soviet Union".{{r|Getty_2000}} He further told ''[[Le Monde]]'': "The more you compare Communism and Nazism, the more the differences are obvious".&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 21 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In a critical review, historian Amir Weiner wrote: "When Stalin's successors opened the gates of the Gulag, they allowed 3 million inmates to return home. When the Allies liberated the Nazi death camps, they found thousands of human skeletons barely alive awaiting what they knew to be inevitable execution".{{r|Weiner_2002|pp=450-52}} Historian [[Ronald Suny]] remarked that Courtois' comparison of 100 million victims of Communism to 25 million victims of Nazism "[leaves out] out most of the 40-60,000,000 lives lost in the Second World War, for which arguably Hitler and not Stalin was principally responsible".{{r|Suny_2007|p=8}} A report by the [[Wiesel Commission]] criticized the comparison of [[Gulag]] victims with Jewish [[Holocaust]] victims as an attempt to [[Holocaust trivialization|trivialize the Holocaust]].{{r|USHMM}}

Historian [[Peter Kenez]] criticized the chapter written by [[Nicolas Werth]]: "Werth can also be an extremely careless historian. He gives the number of Bolsheviks in October 1917 as 2,000, which is a ridiculous underestimate. He quotes from a letter of Lenin to [[Alexander Shliapnikov]] and gives the date as 17 October 1917; the letter could hardly have originated at that time, since in it Lenin talks about the need to defeat the Tsarist government, and turn the war into a civil conflict. He gives credit to the Austro-Hungarian rather than the German army for the conquest of Poland in 1915. He describes the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] as 'elected'. He incorrectly writes that the peasant rebels during the civil war did more harm to the Reds than to the Whites, and so on".{{r|Kenez_1999}} Historian Mark Tauger challenged the authors' thesis that the famine of 1933 was largely artificial and [[genocidal]].{{r|Tauger_2000}} According to journalist [[Gilles Perrault]], the books ignores the effect of international factors, including military interventions, on the communist experience.{{r|LMD_Perrault_1997}}

Social critic [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized the book and its reception as one-sided by outlining economist [[Amartya Sen]]'s research on hunger. While India's democratic institutions prevented famines, its excess of mortality over China—potentially attributable to the latter's more equal distribution of medical and other resources—was nonetheless close to 4 million per year for non-famine years. Chomsky argued that "supposing we now apply the methodology of the ''Black Book''" to India, "the democratic capitalist 'experiment' has caused more deaths than in the entire history of [...] Communism everywhere since 1917: over 100 million deaths by 1979, and tens of millions more since, in India alone".{{r|Chomsky_SP9}} 

''Le Siècle des Communismes'', a collective work of twenty academics, was a response to both François Furet's ''Le passé d'une Illusion'' and Courtois's ''The Black Book of Communism''.{{r|Dreyfus_2000}} It broke Communism down into series of discrete movements, with mixed positive and negative results.

''The Black Book of Communism'' prompted the publication of several other "black books" which argued that similar chronicles of violence and death tolls can be constructed from an examination of [[colonialism]] and [[capitalism]].{{r|Ferro_2003}}{{r|Kurz_2001}}{{r|Perrault_2001}}

== Sequel ==
The reception of ''The Black Book of Communism'' led to the publication of a series entitled ''Du passé faisons table rase! Histoire et mémoire du communisme en Europe'' in 2002, with the same imprint. The first edition included a subtitle: "''The Black Book of Communism'' has not said everything". Like the first effort, this second work was edited by Stéphane Courtois. The book focused on the history of Communism in Eastern Europe.

Several translations of the book were marketed as the second volume of ''The Black Book of Communism'': ''Das Schwarzbuch of Kommunismus 2. Das Erbe der schwere Ideology'' (Germany, Piper, 2004), ''Черната книга на комунизма 2. част'' (Bulgaria, Prosoretz, 2004) and ''Il libro del nero comunismo europeo'' (Italy, Mondadori, 2006).

The ''[[Epoch Times]]'' and Boda Publishing House got agreement with original publisher to translate ''The Black Book of Communism'' into Chinese. The preface is published on Chinese version of ''Epoch Times'' website in 1 January 2018.

{{Quakers in Canada}}
'''The Children of Peace''' (1812–1889) were an [[Upper Canada|Upper Canadian]] [[Quaker]] sect under the leadership of [[David Willson (1778–1866)|David Willson]], known also as 'Davidites', who separated during the [[War of 1812]] from the Yonge Street Monthly Meeting in what is now [[Newmarket, Ontario]], and moved to the Willson's farm. Their last service was held in the Sharon Temple in 1889.

Between 1825 and 1832, a series of buildings was constructed on the farm, the most notable of which is the [[Sharon Temple]], an architectural symbol of their vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality and social justice, which is now part of an [[open-air museum]] that was in 1990 designated as [[National Historic Site of Canada]].

They were a "[[testimony of simplicity|plain folk]]", former Quakers with no musical tradition, who went on to create the first civilian band in Canada and build the first organ in Ontario.&lt;ref name=Awaiting&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Awaiting the Millennium: The Children of Peace and the Village of Hope 1812-1889|year=1993|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They built an ornate temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province's first shelter for the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/sharon-temple/index.aspx Sharon Temple], On-line Exhibition&lt;/ref&gt; By 1851, Sharon Temple was the most prosperous agricultural settlement in the province. They took a lead role in the organization of the province's first co-operative, [[Farmers' Storehouse Company|the Farmers' Storehouse]], and opened the province's first credit union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title='Union is Strength': W.L.

== The Children of Peace ('Davidites') ==
[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sharon Temple.]]
The group is primarily associated with the community of Hope (now [[Sharon, Ontario|Sharon]]) in [[East Gwillimbury]], York Region, Ontario, where they built their [[meeting house]]s (places of worship) and the [[Sharon Temple|Temple]]. They were, however, active throughout the old "[[Home District]]" and especially in Toronto. Although they never numbered more than 350 members, Reform politician and Rebellion leader [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] noted “they afford ample proofs, both in their village and in their chapels, that comparatively, great achievements may be accomplished by a few when united in their efforts and persevering in their habits.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Colonial Advocate|year=18 September 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple was constructed between 1825 and 1831. It was constructed in imitation of [[Solomon's Temple]] and the [[New Jerusalem]] described in Revelation 21, and used once a month to collect alms for the poor; two other meeting houses in the village of "Hope" were used for regular Sunday worship. The Children of Peace, having fled a cruel and uncaring English pharaoh, viewed themselves as the new Israelites lost in the wilderness of Upper Canada; here they would rebuild God’s kingdom on the principle of charity. The village of “Hope” was their new Jerusalem, the focal point of God’s kingdom on earth.

=== Leadership ===
[[File:David wilson Ontario Archives.jpg|thumbnail|left|David Willson, leader of the Children of Peace]]
The leader of this group was David Willson, who was born of Presbyterian parents in New York State in 1778 and migrated to Canada in 1801. He joined the Quakers, of which his wife was a member, but his ministry was rejected when he began to preach at the beginning of the War of 1812. Willson was particularly concerned to take up the Society's [[peace testimony]] "from where [[George Fox]] left it, and raise it so high, that all the Kingdoms of the Earth should see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharon Temple Museum|title=OSHT 990.1.2|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was joined by a majority of the Quakers living on Yonge Street, including the Master Builder of the Temple and meeting houses, [[Ebenezer Doan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Awaiting the Millennium: The Children of Peace and the Village of Hope 1812-1889|year=1993|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doan’s farmhouse and out buildings now stand on the [[Sharon Temple|Sharon Temple Museum]] grounds. [[Samuel Hughes (Children of Peace)]], another leading member, played a large role in the development of the [[Farmers' Storehouse Company|Farmers’ Storehouse]], and reform politics.

=== The village of Hope and its cooperative economy===
[[File:Second Meeting House.jpg|thumb|Second meeting house, Sharon, Ontario]]
In 1828, [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] visited Hope for the first time, describing it as a “village composed of about forty or fifty remarkably neat, clean dwellings; but what gives the most imposing effect is, the handsome newly built Temple, which is built nearly on the summit of the hill, and is now nearly finished.  It is intended for their public worship, and is built somewhat after the manner of [[Solomon's Temple]]. The new church or chapel of the Children of Peace is certainly calculated to inspire the beholder with astonishment; its dimensions - its architecture - its situation - are all so extraordinary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=William Lyon|title=Sketches of Canada and the United States|year=1833|publisher=E. Wilson|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The consolidation of the Children of Peace in a single village, Hope, was accompanied by their adoption of a cooperative economy. Through cooperative marketing, the establishment of a credit union, and a land-sharing system, the Children of Peace all became prosperous farmers in an era when new farmers frequently failed. The Children of Peace were never communal like many of the other new religious movements then sprouting up in the United States (like the [[Shakers]], the early [[Mormons]] or the [[Oneida Community|Oneida Perfectionists]]). The Children of Peace viewed trade as a necessarily moral act; in selling their wheat they were not concerned to simply obtain the "highest market price." Since they did not have to calculate for profit, the logic of their commercial exchanges was based on moral principles, not economic ones. David Willson urged the members of his sect not to bargain at all, but seek a fixed price that represented their own needs, not the highest amount the market would bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title='Union is Strength': W.L. Mackenzie, The Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=41–49,115–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after they completed their temple and began collecting alms there, members of the Children of Peace complained that the remainder of the unspent Charity Fund was “a loss of interest obstructing to benevolence and makes money useless like the misers’ store.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ms 733, Series A, page 7, Committee Records|location=Ontario Archives,|pages=29 Sept. 1832.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Children of Peace began using the same fund for both gifts of charity as well as for loans to members. Those members who borrowed from the Charity Fund paid interest, transforming the fund into an endowment for further charity (and further loans) like today's [[Community foundation|Community Foundations]]. Since they controlled the loan process themselves, they could ensure that terms were manageable, that no one was denied credit, and that the repayment of the principal remained flexible in difficult times. Members of the Children of Peace took a lead role in a similar joint stock company, [[Farmers' Storehouse Company|the Farmers’ Storehouse]], Canada’s first farmers’ co-operative, which also began to offer loans to members in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Union is Strength': W.L. Mackenzie, The Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=97–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political contributions ===
[[File:Rebellion box.jpg|thumb|Rebellion Box, Sharon Temple Museum]]
Although captivated by visions of equality, the Children of Peace lived in an autocratic colony. They inspired other settlers to fight for democracy within a loose-knit "[[Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Reform Movement]]" of disenchanted farmers and tradesmen. David Willson had long been an active political figure. He had, for example, suggested the “General Convention of [Reform] Delegates” held in February 1834 to nominate candidates for the four [[Riding (country subdivision)|ridings]] of the County of York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title='Union is Strength': W.L. Mackenzie, The Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=135–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the foundation on which the Canadian Alliance Society (the first political party in the province) was erected; these candidates were required to pledge in advance to fight for a democratic reform platform in the House. David Willson was the main speaker before the convention and “he addressed the meeting with great force and effect”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Colonial Advocate|date=20, 27 Feb. 1834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Montgomery's Tavern.jpg|thumb|left|Montgomery's Tavern]]
[[File:Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.jpg|thumbnail|left|Louis-Hyppolite LaFontaine]]

[[William Lyon Mackenzie]] was the elected representative for their riding, and was eventually to attempt to overthrow the government in the [[Rebellion of 1837]]. Some of the Children of Peace, including Willson’s sons and son-in-law, participated. The events and consequences of the rebellion are well known: the skirmish at [[Montgomery's Tavern]], the hanging of [[Samuel Lount]], [[Lord Durham's Report]], political reform and [[Responsible Government]] (Cabinet rule). Less well known is the tedium of the jail cell in harsh winter conditions endured by many of the rebels. To while away the long hours, many prisoners carved small, ornate boxes as presents for their families. The boxes memorialize friends lost in battle, and express a defiant call for liberty and democracy. They were the sole consolation for those who had been widowed, or whose husbands remained in jail; for example, David Willson’s daughter, a pregnant Mary Willson Doan, wrote to her husband in jail wishing “you would be permitted to come to your little home”, acknowledging the reality, and desiring a “box” for her yet unborn child. That child, David Willson Doan, was born twelve days after the letter was written. Charles Doan remained in jail for a further five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Letters from Prison|journal=The York Pioneer|year=1987|pages=25–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Rebellion, the Children of Peace resisted [[Orange Order]] violence in the pursuit of democratic reform. Many members took part in a "Durham Meeting" in 1838 in which the Orange Order attacked the crowd with clubs, and in the melee, a young 19-year-old member of the Children of Peace, David Leppard, was killed when struck with a rock to his temple. Leppard’s death became a rallying point for Reformers across the province. Everyone knew who was responsible for his death. The Sheriff, William Jarvis, had egged on the Orange Order, and George Duggan Jr., a Toronto Alderman and Orange Order organizer had directed the mob. Yet no arrests were made. There was no inquiry into the death. And no one could hope for justice when the Sheriff himself – one of the co-accused – was responsible for picking the jurors at a trial.

During the 1840s, Willson continued his association with the Reform Party; he was, for example, the campaign manager in the area for both [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis LaFontaine]], the “Fathers of [[Responsible Government]]” and first elected premiers of the province. It was the Children of Peace who ensured the election of Montreal lawyer Louis LaFontaine as their representative in Upper Canada. Willson argued that this was an opportunity, as he said, “to show our impartial respect to the Canadian people of the Lower province.” Here, Willson is expressing a clear Canadian identity that overcame differences in language and religion. It was a vision of Canadian citizenship that was ultimately successful, as LaFontaine was elected in the 4th Riding of York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historica-dominion.ca/content/heritage-minutes/baldwin-lafontaine?]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, they elected Baldwin in their riding. The band of the Children of Peace was a familiar sight at Baldwin's campaign rallies. In 1844, they held a campaign rally for Baldwin concurrently with the illumination of the Temple. Over 3000 people attended, an event that helped end the reign of Orange Order electoral violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Union is Strength: W.L. Mackenzie, The Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=211–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious life ==

=== Meeting houses ===
{{rquote|left|The Temple is calculated to inspire the beholder with astonishment; its dimensions—its architecture—its situation—are all so extraordinary.|W. L. Mackenzie 18 Sept. 1828}}

[[File:David Willsons study.jpg|thumb|David Willson's Study, Sharon Temple Museum]]
[[File:Sharon Temple Jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Jacob's Ladder, Sharon Temple]]
Most of the meeting houses of the Children of Peace are attributed to Master Builder [[Ebenezer Doan]].

The first meeting house of the Children of Peace was built in 1819 on David Willson’s farm. It was square, forty feet to each side, and sixteen feet high. With one of Coates’s organs installed in 1820, the building acquired its more popular name, the Music Hall.

By far the best known of their buildings was the [[Sharon Temple|Temple]], now a national historic site. The Temple's design is loosely based on a description of [[Solomon's Temple]] found in 1 Kings, chapter 6 and the [[New Jerusalem]] described in Revelation 21. The building was undertaken after Willson had a vision in which he was called "To ornament the Christian Church with all the glory of Israel." Preparation for the construction would have begun in 1822, with actual construction taking place between 1825 and 1831. A symbolic seventh year was taken to build the "ark" at its centre. The building was three stories high; the first was an auditorium, built without a pulpit, and the second floor was a musician's gallery reached by a curved staircase, "Jacob's Ladder." The Temple was used only once a month for an alms collection, again at Christmas, and for two special "Illumination" ceremonies in which its 2,952 panes of glass were set aglow.

David Willson's Study was completed in September 1829. Its exterior colonnade and arches can be seen as the Temple “turned inside out”. It was also referred to as "the counting house" and was no doubt the office in which Willson wrote his many books, and operated the "Farmer's Storehouse."

The second meeting house was three times the size of the first. Its design was based on David Willson’s study.  Construction began in 1834 and completed in 1842. The building was 100&amp;nbsp;ft. long by 50&amp;nbsp;ft. wide surrounded by a colonnade of pillars. This building was painted a light yellow with green facings, and had a large room upstairs for Sabbath Schools, and band rehearsals. The main part of the building which was used for services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Emily|title=Children of Peace|year=1898|publisher=Era &amp; Express|location=Newmarket|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
As an offshoot of the Society of Friends, the Children of Peace shared most Quaker belief, especially in the innate presence of God (the "[[inner light]]") in every person. Like the Quakers, they practiced a spontaneous ministry, and eschewed a "hireling clergy." David Willson was thus never their paid minister, and he never, in fact, entered the Temple during the monthly alms ceremony there. Like the Quakers, they also rejected any written creed or tests of faith: "We have no written creed, and therefore we have no image to quarrel about, or literal rule to argue for, we are against nobody, but for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=David|title=unnamed pamphlet written on the completion of the Temple|year=1831|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willson, however, did receive "impressions on the mind", visions calling him to "ornament the Christian Church with the glory of Israel." He interpreted this as a call to rebuild Solomon's Temple as the new Jerusalem. During the 1830s, his preaching became more millenarian, prophesying the coming of a Messiah who would overthrow the British empire and establish God's kingdom on earth. He viewed his small group as the new Israelites lost in the wilderness of Upper Canada, who the new Messiah would come to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=David|title=Letters to the Jews|year=1835|location=Toronto|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_42794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Rebellion of 1837, the sect lost many of the more distinctive theological features that marked its early stages.

=== Music ===
[[File:Sharon keyboard organ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Richard Coates' Keyboard Organ, Sharon Temple Museum]]
Among the Protestant nominations, the Quakers were distinct for their rejection of music in worship. They argued that congregational singing was an empty form, and hence worshipped in silence until someone was moved to spontaneous ministry. David Willson, in contrast, began to "sing in the ministry" as early as 1811. He regarded music as another facet of the ministry, a spontaneous expression of God's word. He was to boast, "I never repeat one communication twice over, nor sing one old hymn in worship: bread from heaven is our lot - descending mercies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=David|title=Impressions of the Mind|year=1835|publisher=J.H. Lawrence|location=Toronto|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constant production of new hymn lyrics, like manna from heaven, "were composed to suit the occasion on which they were sung."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Colonial Advocate|date=3 Sep 1829}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These hymns, eventually numbering in the thousands, were recorded in a special "Book of Sacred Record" stored in a secret compartment in the Arc at the centre of the Temple. At the beginning and end of each worship service, Willson would "read out" a hymn, line by line, which would then be sung back by the choir, and then the congregation. The lining out of hymns had been the traditional singing style of the 18th century, when hymn books were expensive and rare. Songs were sung a cappella, resulting in slow, improvised singing in which each singer was allowed to decorate the tunes as he or she saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Awaiting the Millennium: The Children of Peace and the Village of Hope 1812-1889|year=1993|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Quakers who joined the Children of Peace were skilled craftsmen, but the Quaker “testimony” on plainness discouraged them from embracing the arts; adornment of any kind was considered little but a sign of pride. Thus, when David Willson’s vision commanded him to “ornament the Church with all the glory of Israel,” the sect had to turn to an outsider, Richard Coates, for guidance. Coates, a former British Army Bandmaster, exerted tremendous influence on the art and music by which the Children of Peace came to be known outside their community. Coates was commissioned by the Children of Peace to build the first of their organs — said, in fact, to be the first built in Ontario; it sat on an elevated platform in the first meeting house. This was a "barrel organ", in effect, a large music box played by turning a handle. It is thus also potentially the first music recording made in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children of Peace|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/children-of-peace|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time that Coates gave lessons to the Children of Peace in the rudiments of musical performance, teaching members how to play the instruments of a brass band. The band sat under the platform on which the organ played. He also painted “the symbolic decorations of the interior of the Temple at Sharon,” and painted the banners that they carried in front of their processions. He also organized a choir of “virgins” (schoolgirls). The musical accompaniment provided by the choir, band and organs was in large part responsible for the fame — or infamy — which accrued to the Children of Peace. One Anglican clergyman in nearby Thornhill scathingly described them in the early 1830s: "King David (Willson) frequently goes to a great distance, in order to edify the people of other townships by his music and eloquence... He never performs such religious errantry without being accompanied by his virgins, six in number, selected from among the females of his household, for their superior voices. These virgins are conveyed in the same wagon with himself over which there is an awning, to shelter them from the inclemency of the weather, and from sultry rays. In one of the other wagons follow as many youths, who form an accompaniment to the damsels, and swell the anthems and hosannahs by vocal and instrumental music. In the remaining wagon are transported... their musical instruments... He never fails to attract a large assemblage of people... The music of his sacred band is considered curious; and the oddity of his manner, and his condemnation of the Established Church, and of the government, are approved by many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fidler|first=Isaac|title=Observations on Professions, Literature, Manners and Emigration, in the United States and Canada, Made during a Residence there in 1832|year=1832|location=London|pages=325–6|url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_36495#page/n345/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, the Children of Peace hired Daniel Cory, a music teacher from Boston, to teach them the unison singing style of the mainstream, and Willson produced three books of hymns for the members.

The largest of the organs built by Coates was a keyboard organ (now in the Temple) completed in 1848 for the second meeting house. The organ stood against the back wall of the second meeting house between the two rear doors. It stands about fourteen feet high, housed in an impressive case assembled in three towers; to the front are three semi-circles of gilded dummy pipes which hide the wooden pipework within. The organ has a manual 49-note direct mechanical keyboard, four drawstops, and 200 wooden flue pipes in four ranks. A manual bellows is pumped from the left side.

The Sharon Silver (or Temperance) Band was formed after a set of silver instruments was purchased in Boston for a reputed $1,500 in the 1860s. The bandleaders were Jesse Doan and from 1866 his nephew John Doan Graham.

Soon after they separated from the Society of Friends in 1812, the Children of Peace established their first school; a boarding school taught by William Reid, "a man of more than ordinary intellect" with "an excellent English education." One of Willson's first books was a "Lesson of Instruction", a reader on the group's distinctive beliefs for this school. The school was eventually known as "the female institution" after it was moved to Sharon. A day school for boys and girls was also opened. The boarding school was housed in a two storey "Square House" with David Willson and his wife Phebe as caretakers. The boarding school for girls was a bulwark of the community, and the young girls formed the sect's choir. The day school eventually moved into quarters on the second floor of the second meeting house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Awaiting the Millennium: The Children of Peace and the Village of Hope, 1812-1889|year=1993|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissolution ==
1851 represents the apogee of the community of Hope (Sharon). Their cooperative economy, their concern for charity and the equal prosperity of all, made them the most prosperous agricultural community in the entire province; substantial farmhouses now dotted the surrounding landscape. Their political influence was at its peak, with deep long-standing ties to both Baldwin and LaFontaine. But age was taking its toll on the village’s patriarch, David Willson, now in his seventies. He remained their only minister until his death in 1866, their numbers slowly dwindling.
Willson’s son, John David Willson, led the Children of Peace thereafter, reading his father’s sermons to an aging congregation. Ministers from other denominations were gradually invited to preach in their meeting houses. In 1876, they incorporated as a “charitable society.” In 1889, after the death of Willson’s sons, the group ceased to exist, and the Temple was allowed to fall into ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFall|first=Jean|title=The Last Days of the Children of Peace|journal=The York Pioneer|year=1973|volume=68|pages=22–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The last service was held in the Temple in 1889. The derelict Temple was purchased by the York Pioneer and Historical Society in 1917, and restored, making it one of the earliest examples of historic preservation in Canada. The temple is now a National Historic Site and Museum as well as a National Peace Site. The site has a collection of restored buildings and displays pioneer artefacts and historic items related to the sect.

The '''United Arab Emirates''' ('''UAE'''; {{lang-ar|دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة}} ''{{transl|ar|Dawlat al-ʾImārāt al-ʿArabīyyah al-Muttaḥidah}}''), sometimes simply called the '''Emirates''' ({{lang-ar|الإمارات}} ''{{transl|ar|al-ʾImārāt}}''), is a country in [[Western Asia]] at the southeast end of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] on the [[Persian Gulf]], bordering [[Oman]] to the east and [[Saudi Arabia]] to the south, as well as sharing maritime borders with [[Qatar]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the north. The [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[absolute monarchy]] is a [[federation]] of [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|seven emirate]]s consisting of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]] (which serves as the capital), [[Emirate of Ajman|Ajman]], [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]], [[Fujairah]], [[Ras al-Khaimah]], [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] and [[Umm al-Quwain]]. Each emirate is governed by a ruler; together, they jointly form the [[Federal Supreme Council]]. One of the rulers serves as the [[President of the United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Arab Emirates's Constitution of 1971 with Amendments through 2004|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_Arab_Emirates_2004.pdf|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the UAE's population was 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million are [[Emiratis|Emirati citizens]] and 7.8 million are [[expatriates in the United Arab Emirates|expatriates]].&lt;ref name="natur"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/labor-migration-united-arab-emirates-challenges-and-responses|title=Labor Migration in the United Arab Emirates: Challenges and Responses|publisher=migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14703998|title=United Arab Emirates country profile|date=28 September 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in [[Mleiha Archaeological Centre|Mleiha]], [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]]. Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Following decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, [[Ras al-Khaimah]], joined the federation on 10 February 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land of the Emirates has been occupied for thousands of years. Stone tools recovered from Jebel Faya in the emirate of Sharjah reveal a settlement of people from [[Africa]] some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered at Jebel Barakah on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-archaeologist-discovers-the-swiss-army-knife-from-130-000-years-ago|title = UAE archaeologist discovers the Swiss Army knife from 130,000 years ago|last = Pennington|first = Roberta|date = 5 February 2014|work = The National |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no proof of contact with the outside world at that stage, although in time lively trading links developed with civilisations in [[Mesopotamia]], Iran and India's [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan culture]]. This contact persisted and became wide-ranging, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Hajar Mountains]], which commenced around 3000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adias-uae.com/ |title=Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS) |publisher=Adias-uae.com |accessdate=12 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumerian sources talk of the UAE as home to the 'Makkan' or [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Early History of Civilisation|last=Woolley|first=Leonard|publisher=UNESCO|year=1963|isbn=|location=|page=611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six major periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the pre-Islamic UAE: the [[Hafit period]] from 3200-2600 BCE; the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar culture]] spanned from 2600-2000 BCE, the [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq peopl]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e dominated from 2000–1300 BCE. From 1200 BC to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive iron ages (Iron age 1, 1200–1000 BC; Iron age 2, 1000–600 BC and Iron age 3 600–300 BC) and the Mleiha period (300 BC onward), the area was variously occupied by [[Achaemenid Empire|Archaemenid]] and other forces and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the [[Qanat|falaj]] irrigation system.

In ancient times, Al Hasa (today's Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia) was part of [[Al Bahreyn]] and adjoined Greater Oman (today's UAE and [[Oman]]). From the second century AD, there was a movement of tribes from Al Bahreyn towards the lower Gulf, together with a migration among the Azdite Qahtani (or Yamani) and Quda'ah tribal groups from south-west Arabia towards central Oman. Sassanid groups were present on the Batinah coast. In 637, Julfar (in the area of today's [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ra's al-Khaimah]]) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the [[Sassanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="AbedHellyer2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ibrahim Abed|author2=Peter Hellyer|title=United Arab Emirates, a New Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcMz3zV0qAMC&amp;pg=PA83|year= 2001|work=Trident Ltd|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the Al Ain/Buraimi Oasis was known as Tu'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last = Bey|first = Frauke|work= Longman|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0582277281|location = UK|pages = 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as [[Sir Bani Yas|Sir Bani Yas Island]] and which dates back to the 7th century. Thought to be Nestorian and built in 600 AD, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/ancient-secrets-of-sir-bani-yas-island-unveiled|title = Ancient secrets of Sir Bani Yas unveiled|last = Thomas|first = Jen|date = 12 December 2012|work = The National|accessdate = 19 February 2017|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103357/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/ancient-secrets-of-sir-bani-yas-island-unveiled|archivedate = 22 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 AD following trade routes. Certainly, by the 5th century, Oman had a bishop named John – the last bishop of Oman being Etienne, in 676 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Trucial States|last = Hawley|first = Donald|work= Allen &amp; Unwin|year = 1971|isbn = 9780049530058|location = UK|pages = 48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
The spread of Islam to the North Eastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], to the rulers of Oman in 630 AD, nine years after the [[Hegira|hijrah]]. This led to a group of rulers travelling to [[Medina]], converting to Islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids, who dominated the Northern coasts at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last = Bey|first = Frauke|work= Longman|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0582277281|location = UK|page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders.

The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the "versatile tribesman", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led to not only frequent clashes between groups but also the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the [[Bani Yas]] and [[Al Nahyan family|Al Bu Falah]] of Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Liwa and the west coast, the [[Dhawahir]], Awamir, [[Al-Ali (tribe)|Al Ali]] and [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] of the interior, the [[Sharqiyin]] of the east coast and the [[Al-Qasimi|Qawasim]] to the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia|last = Lorimer|first = John|work= Government of India|year = 1908|isbn = |location = Bombay|pages = 1432–1436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, ports in the [[Persian Gulf]] and part of the population that today form the coastal Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, came under the direct influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ottoman Gulf: The Creation of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar|last = Anscombe|first = Frederick F.|work= Columbia University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ottoman View of British Presence in Iraq and the Gulf: The Era of Abdulhamid II |last = Çetinsaya|first = Gökhan|work= Frank Cass|year = 2003|isbn = |location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Portuguese, English and Dutch colonial forces also appeared in the Persian Gulf region.

British expeditions to protect the Indian trade from raiders at [[Ras al-Khaimah]] led to campaigns against that headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1809 and subsequently 1819. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a treaty to combat piracy along the Persian Gulf coast, giving rise to the term [[Trucial States]], which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and, in 1853 the Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Truce was agreed. To this was added the 'Exclusive Agreements', signed in 1892, which made the [[Trucial States]] a British protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na.ae/en/education/historicalperiods/britishprince.aspx|title=British Era|website=www.na.ae|access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. The Exclusive Agreement was signed by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and [[Umm Al Quwain]] between 6 and 8 March 1892. It was subsequently ratified by the [[Viceroy of India]] and the British Government in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kjeilen, Tore |url=http://looklex.com/e.o/trucial_states.htm |title=Trucial States |publisher=Looklex.com |date=4 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131182401/http://looklex.com/e.o/trucial_states.htm |archivedate=31 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security.

In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at [[Khawr al Udayd]] and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans, whose flag was occasionally seen flying there. Khawr al Udayd was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his sheikhdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |date=15 February 2016|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn= 9781780235806|pages=49–50 |url=http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British era and discovery of oil===
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History &amp; Traditions: Pearls &amp; pearling |work=UAEinteract |accessdate=12 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.

The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803020019/http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archivedate=3 August 2008|title=Al Khaleej News Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed [[Adi Bitar]], Dubai's [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid]]'s legal advisor, as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the Council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ae_tsc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011257/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ae_tsc.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Trucial States Council until 1971 (United Arab Emirates) |publisher=Fotw.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The [[Trucial Oman Scouts]] was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.

In 1953, a subsidiary of BP, D'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with [[Compagnie Française des Pétroles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cousteau|first1=Jacques|title=Calypso explores for underwater oil |url=https://www.librarything.com/work/18080895 |journal=National Geographic Magazine|date=August 1955|volume=CVIII|issue=2 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Calypso in the Arabian Gulf: Jacques Cousteau's Undersea Survey of 1954|journal=Liwa|date=June 2015|volume=7|issue=13|pages=3–28|url=https://www.academia.edu/13056568|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg, Germany, and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama, a rock formation that would provide many valuable oil finds. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the Fateh oilfield off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butt|first1=Gerald|title=Oil and Gas in the UAE|url=https://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/11.pdf|website=UAE Interact|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123003948/http://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/11.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the United Kingdom represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5444.htm|title=United Arab Emirates (06/07)|publisher=State.gov|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]], but this has not been ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Matthew|title=Global Security Watch – Saudi Arabia|date=7 October 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-38699-2|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dxvFBAAAQBAJ|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE's border with Oman was ratified in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/government/historic-uae-oman-accord-involves-272km-of-border-1.119592|title=Historic UAE-Oman accord involves 272km of border|date = 22 July 2008|work = Gulf News |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 413–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, PDTC became the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern [[global city]] of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703998|title=Middle East &amp;#124; Country profile: United Arab Emirates|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===

By 1966, it had become clear the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] could no longer afford to administer and protect what is now the United Arab Emirates. British [[Members of Parliament (UK)|MP]]s debated the preparedness of the [[Royal Navy]] to defend the sheikhdoms. [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Denis Healey]] reported that the [[British Armed Forces]] were seriously overstretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped to defend the sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms, that had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates. The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government rejected the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gornall, Jonathan |date=2 December 2011 |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sun-sets-on-british-empire-as-uae-raises-its-flag#page5 |title=Sun sets on British Empire as UAE raises its flag |work=The National|location=Abu Dhabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Labour MP [[Goronwy Roberts, Baron Goronwy-Roberts|Goronwy Roberts]] informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/basics/history_of_the_emirates.php |title=History the United Arab Emirates (UAE)&amp;nbsp;– TEN Guide |work=Guide.theemiratesnetwork.com |date=11 February 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fears of vulnerability were realized the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the [[Tunb islands]]. The islands were taken by force, civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tonb |title=TONB ISLANDS (GREATER and LESSER), two tiny islands of arguable strategic importance in the eastern Persian Gulf, south of the western tip of Qešm island |last1=Mirfendereski |first1=Guive |date=25 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704222708/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tonb |archive-date=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A destroyer group approached the island [[Abu Musa]] as well. But there, Sheikh [[Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi]]  had already negotiated with the Iranian Shah, and the island was quickly leased to Iran for $3 million a year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krane |first1=Jim |year=2009 |title=City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism |pages=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates, Bahrain became independent in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, they became fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1021.html |title=Bahrain&amp;nbsp;– INDEPENDENCE |publisher=Country-data.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 1971, at the Dubai Guesthouse, now known as Union House, six of the emirates agreed to enter into a union called the United Arab Emirates.

The first ever national elections were held in the UAE on 16 December 2006. A small number of hand-picked voters chose half of the members of the Federal National Council, an advisory body.

The land border with Qatar in the [[Khawr al Udayd]] area is about {{convert|19|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} in the northwest; however, it is a source of [[Saudi Arabia – United Arab Emirates border dispute|ongoing dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabmediawatch.com/amw/CountryBackgrounds/SaudiArabia/SaudiUAEdisputes/tabid/174/Default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408121304/http://www.arabmediawatch.com/amw/CountryBackgrounds/SaudiArabia/SaudiUAEdisputes/tabid/174/Default.aspx |archivedate=8 April 2010 |title=Saudi-UAE Disputes |publisher=Arabmediawatch.com |date=21 August 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Britain's military departure from the UAE in 1971, and its establishment as a new state, the UAE laid claim to islands resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved. The UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaeprison.com/uae_disputes.htm|title=UAE Disputes, International UAE Disputes, UAE Boundary Dispute, UAE National Disputes, UAE Emirate Disputes,  Claims Three Islands, Abu Musa Island, Greater &amp; Lesser Tumb, The History of  Islands, Human Resources UAE, Arab Emirates.|website=www.uaeprison.com|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest emirate, [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]], accounts for 87% of the UAE's total area ({{convert|67340|km2|0|abbr=out}}). The smallest emirate, [[Ajman]], encompasses only {{convert|259|km2|0|abbr=on}}(see figure).

The UAE coast stretches for more than {{convert|650|km|0|abbr=on}} along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Most of the coast consists of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] that extend far inland. The largest [[harbor|natural harbor]] is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al Bāţinah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.

South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive [[Liwa Oasis]] is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Liwa is the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. [[Lake Zakher]] is a [[Man-made lake|human-made lake]] near the border with Oman.

Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]
The oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of [[grasses]] and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on [[Bani Yas]] Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, [[Arabian Oryx]], [[Arabian camel]] and [[leopard]]s. [[Coastal fish]] and [[mammals]] consist mainly of [[mackerel]], [[Estuary perch|perch]], and [[tuna]], as well as [[shark]]s and whales.

===Climate===
The climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above {{convert|45|°C|°F|0}} on the [[coastal plain]]. In the [[Al Hajar Mountains]], temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manmm.net/eng/?page_id=35 |title= UAE Climate |publisher=Manmm.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112072308/http://www.manmm.net/eng/?page_id=35 |archivedate=12 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between {{convert|10|and|14|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abudhabi.ms/weather.html |title=Weather in Abu Dhabi |publisher=Abudhabi.ms |date=8 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429193142/http://www.abudhabi.ms/weather.html |archivedate=29 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e. "Easterner") makes the coastal region especially unpleasant. The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than {{convert|120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches {{convert|350|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

The United Arab Emirates is a federation of [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] [[absolute monarchies]]. It is governed by a [[Federal Supreme Council]] made up of the seven emirs of [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]], [[Emirate of Ajman|Ajman]], [[Fujairah]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]], [[Ras al-Khaimah]] and [[Umm al-Quwain|Umm al-Qaiwain]].

Although elected by the Supreme Council, the [[President of the United Arab Emirates|presidency]] and [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Arab Emirates|prime ministership]] are essentially hereditary; the Emir of Abu Dhabi holds the presidency, and the Emir of Dubai is prime minister. All prime ministers but one have served concurrently as vice president. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was the UAE's president from the nation's founding until his death on 2 November 2004. On the following day the Federal Supreme Council elected his son, [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], to the post. Abu Dhabi's crown prince, [[Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], is the [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabruleoflaw.org/countryprofiles/uae.html|title=UAE|publisher=Arabruleoflaw.org|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UAE convened a half-elected [[Federal National Council]] in 2006. The FNC consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates. Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates, and the other half are indirectly elected to serve two-year terms. However, the FNC is restricted to a largely [[:wikt:consultation|consultative]] role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.ae/gov/en/gov/federal/politics.jsp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027123241/http://www.government.ae/gov/en/gov/federal/politics.jsp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 October 2005 |title=UAE Federal e-Government Portal |publisher=Government.ae |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[E-Government in the United Arab Emirates|UAE eGovernment]] is the extension of the UAE Federal Government in its electronic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.ae/en/web/guest/service-channels|title=Service Channels- The UAE Government Official Portal|author=UAE federal eGovernment|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2016, 22-year-old Oxford and NYU-Abu Dhabi graduate [[Shamma Al Mazrui]] was named Minister of State for Youth Affairs, the youngest minister in the cabinet.

The UAE has extensive diplomatic and commercial relations with other countries. It plays a significant role in [[OPEC]] and the UN, and is one of the founding members of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC). One of the main anchorers of the UAE’s foreign policy has been building cooperation-based relations with all countries of the world. Substantial development assistance has increased the UAE's stature among recipient states. Most of this foreign aid (in excess of $15 billion) has been to Arab and Muslim countries.

In August 2018, [[the New York Times]] published a report claiming that the United Arab Emirates rulers had been using an Israeli spyware to secretly tap the phone calls of Qatari emir, a Saudi Arabian prince, [[Saad Hariri]], prime minister of Lebanon and some journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/world/middleeast/hacking-united-arab-emirates-nso-group.html|title=Hacking a Prince, an Emir and a Journalist to Impress a Client|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/31/uae-used-israeli-spyware-hack-saudi-qatari-lebanese-rivals/|title=UAE used Israeli spyware to hack Saudi, Qatari and Lebanese rivals|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Arab Emirates Armed Forces is commonly nicknamed as "Little Sparta" by [[United States Armed Forces]] Generals and US defense secretary [[James Mattis]] due to its active and effective military role, particular in [[War on Terrorism]], despite its small active personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the UAE, the United States has a quiet, potent ally nicknamed ‘Little Sparta’

Although initially small in number, the UAE armed forces have grown significantly over the years and are presently equipped with some of the most modern weapon systems, purchased from a variety of outside countries, mainly France, the US and the UK. Most officers are graduates of the United Kingdom's [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]], with others having attended the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], and [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|St Cyr]], the military academy of France. France opened its base installation Forces de présence aux Emirats arabes unis in Abu Dhabi in May 2009. In March 2011, the UAE agreed to join the enforcement of the [[Operation Odyssey Dawn|no-fly-zone over Libya]] by sending six [[F-16]] and six [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]] [[Multirole combat aircraft|multi-role fighter aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12806112|title=BBC News – Libya no-fly zone: Coalition firepower|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gulf war]], the US had troops and equipment stationed in the UAE as well as other parts of the [[Persian Gulf]].

The United Arab Emirates is divided into seven emirates. [[Dubai]] is the most populated Emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population. The Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]] has a further 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population live in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

Abu Dhabi has an area of {{convert|67340|km2|0|abbr=off}}, which is 86.7% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. It has a coastline extending for more than {{convert|400|km|-1|abbr=on}} and is divided for administrative purposes into three major regions.
The Emirate of Dubai extends along the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE for approximately {{convert|72|km|0|abbr=on}}. Dubai has an area of {{convert|3885|km2|0|abbr=off}}, which is equivalent to 5% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. The Emirate of Sharjah extends along approximately {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} of the UAE's Persian Gulf coastline and for more than {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} into the interior. The northern emirates which include Fujairah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, and [[Umm al-Quwain|Umm al-Qaiwain]] all have a total area of {{convert|3881|km2|0|abbr=off}}. There are two areas under joint control. One is jointly controlled by Oman and Ajman, the other by Fujairah and Sharjah.

There is an Omani [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] surrounded by UAE territory, known as [[Madha|Wadi Madha]]. It is located halfway between the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam]] peninsula and the rest of Oman in the Emirate of Sharjah. It covers approximately {{convert|75|km2|0|abbr=off}} and the boundary was settled in 1969. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khor Fakkan-Fujairah road, barely {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} away. Within the Omani exclave of Madha, is a UAE exclave called [[Nahwa]], also belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about {{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and [[telephone exchange]].

The UAE has a federal court system. There are three main branches within the court structure: civil, criminal and Sharia law. The UAE's judicial system is derived from the [[civil law system]] and [[Sharia law]]. The court system consists of civil courts and [[Sharia]] courts. UAE's criminal and civil courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law.

[[Flogging]] is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="usdep"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2013/nea/220380.htm|title=2013 Human Rights Reports: United Arab Emirates|work=[[US Department of State]]|quote=Sharia (Islamic law) courts, which adjudicate criminal and family law, have the option of imposing flogging as punishment for adultery, prostitution, consensual premarital sex, pregnancy outside marriage, defamation of character, and drug or alcohol abuse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/559bd52e12.html|title=2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – United Arab Emirates

Freedom of association is also severely curtailed. All associations and NGOs have to register through the Ministry of Social Affairs and are therefore under de facto State control.

[[Dubai Media City]] and [[twofour54]] are the UAE's main media zones. The UAE is home to some pan-Arab broadcasters, including the [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] and [[Orbit Showtime Network]]. In 2007, Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] decreed that journalists can no longer be prosecuted or imprisoned for reasons relating to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:5g6YUlYAidYJ:www.carnegieendowment.org/files/UAE_APS.doc+uae+government+appoints+all+imams&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj0L8k7sdundREDL2RHAxLQF1O_e5Bvo5Bl2Hq_1puqFDjc2DfE9hoCBcb9dWNUEBhZhmDHWKHkhd-9ibSEmli_3W59aNVcrDn3FGkjGenIFyZogo1j8DhZR_Yw2EycMUdlbs13&amp;sig=AHIEtbQypf9XPQ-JSOKs0KxjF_hlaIs2lg |title=United Arab Emirates |work=Carnegie Endowment}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the UAE has made it illegal to disseminate online material that can threaten "public order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejustice.gov.ae/downloads/latest_laws/cybercrimes_5_2012_en.pdf|title=Federal Decree-Law no.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE's economy remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues.

These developments are particularly evident in the larger emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The northern emirates are rapidly following suit, providing major incentives for developers of residential and commercial property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/arunkodiyeri/uae-yearbook-2009 |title=UAE yearbook 2009 |publisher=Slideshare.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UAE law does not allow trade unions to exist.&lt;ref name="ituc"/&gt; The right to [[collective bargaining]] and the [[right to strike]] are not recognised, and the [[Ministry of Labour]] has the power to force workers to go back to work.

In fact, just over eighty percent of Emirati workers hold government posts, with many of the rest taking part in state-owned enterprises such as [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airlines]] and [[Dubai Properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krane |first=Jim |title=City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism |place=New York, NY|publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2009 |pages=267–270 |isbn=978-0-312-53574-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luqaimat.jpg|thumb|[[Arabic coffee]] with [[Lugaimat]]; a traditional Emirati sweet.]]
The traditional food of the Emirates has always been rice, fish and meat. The people of the United Arab Emirates have adopted most of their foods from other West and South Asian countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and Oman. Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. Meat and rice are other staple foods, with [[lamb and mutton]] preferred to goat and beef. Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be complemented with [[cardamom]], [[saffron]], or [[Spearmint|mint]] to give them a distinctive flavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/travel/food.asp |title=UAE Travel&amp; Tourism: Food &amp; Drink |work=UAEinteract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611160248/http://www.uaeinteract.com/travel/food.asp |archivedate=11 June 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] is the largest and the official [[state religion]] of the UAE. The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely interferes in the activities of non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=208416|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2012 – United Arab Emirates|work=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, non-Muslims are expected to avoid interfering in Islamic religious matters or the Islamic upbringing of Muslims.

The government imposes restrictions on spreading other religions through any form of media as it is considered a form of proselytizing. There are approximately 31 churches throughout the country, one Hindu temple in the region of [[Bur Dubai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Al Jandaly, Bassma |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/churches-and-temples-in-the-uae-1.96526 |title=Churches and temples in the UAE |work=Gulf News |date=5 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one Sikh Gurudwara in Jebel Ali and also a Buddhist temple in Al Garhoud.

Based on the Ministry of Economy census in 2005, 76% of the total population was [[Muslim]], 13% Christian, and 11% other (mainly [[Hindu]]).&lt;ref name=religiousfreedom/&gt; Census figures do not take into account the many "temporary" visitors and workers while also counting [[Baha'is]] and [[Druze]] as Muslim.&lt;ref name=religiousfreedom/&gt; Among Emirati Muslim citizens, 97% are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], while 3% are [[Shia Islam in the United Arab Emirates|Shi'a]], mostly concentrated in the emirates of Sharjah and [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="religiousfreedom" /&gt; Omani immigrants are mostly [[Ibadi]], while [[Sufi]] influences exist too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/testimony/337.pdf |title=Islam: Sunnis and Shiites |publisher=investigativeproject.org |format=PDF |date=23 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the national language of the United Arab Emirates. The [[Gulf Arabic|Gulf dialect]] of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Shane|title=Frommer's Dubai|year=2010|work=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-71178-1|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the area was occupied by the British until 1971,{{dubious|date=January 2018|reason=English isn't common because of that, but because of the too many foreigners who can't find other common languages}} English is the primary ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the UAE.

In February 2008, the Ministry of Health unveiled a five-year health strategy for the public health sector in the northern emirates, which fall under its purview and which, unlike Abu Dhabi and Dubai, do not have separate healthcare authorities. The strategy focuses on unifying
healthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost, at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment. The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14, and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86. Nine were scheduled to open in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/health.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612101330/http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/health.htm|archivedate=12 June 2008 |title=UAE Health |publisher=Uae.gov.ae }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of mandatory [[health insurance]] in Abu Dhabi for [[expatriate]]s and their dependants was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy. Abu Dhabi nationals were brought under the scheme from 1 June 2008 and Dubai followed for its government employees. Eventually, under federal law, every Emirati and expatriate in the country will be covered by compulsory health insurance under a unified mandatory scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/health/health-cover-is-mandatory-1.43089|author=El Shammaa, Dina |title=Health cover is mandatory |work=Gulf News |date=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
