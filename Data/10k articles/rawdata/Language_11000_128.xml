'''Bagirmi''' (also '''Baguirmi'''; autonym: ''ɓarma)'' is the language of the [[Baguirmi people]] of [[Chad]], belonging to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan family]].  It was spoken by 44,761 people in 1993, mainly in the [[Chari-Baguirmi Region]]. It was the language of the [[Kingdom of Baguirmi]].

Baguirmi was given written form, and texts providing basic literacy instruction were composed through the efforts of Don and Orpha Raun late in their Chadian careers, during the 1990s. A font to support the [[Baguirmi alphabet]], and a Keyman input method for Latin keyboards, were developed by [[Anthony Kimball]] in 2003, and the body of published Baguirmi literature continues to expand. The majority of this literature is distributed in Chad by [[David Raun]] at a token cost, as a service to the Baguirmi-speaking peoples of Chad.

[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (28).jpg|thumb|240px|Depiction of the buggery of a goat, by [[Paul Avril]]]]
The [[British English]] term '''buggery''' is very close in meaning to the term [[sodomy]], often used interchangeably in law and popular speech.  It may also be a specific [[common law offence]] encompassing both sodomy and [[bestiality]].

==Etymology==
The modern English word "[[bugger]]" is derived from the French term ''{{lang|fr|bougre}}'', that evolved from the [[Latin]] ''[[Bulgars|Bulgarus]]'' or "Bulgarian". The [[Catholic Church]] used the word to describe members of a religious [[sect]] known as the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], who originated in [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] in the 10th Century and spread throughout [[Western Europe]] by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered [[heretic]]al. The first use of the word "buggery" appears in [[Middle English]] in 1330 where it is associated with "abominable heresy"; though the sexual sense of "bugger" is not recorded until 1555.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form: "bowgard" (and "bouguer"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics "as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian]]". Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' gives the only meaning of the word "bugger" as a [[Sodomy|sodomite]], "from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bugger'' is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation while "buggery" is synonymous with the act of [[sodomy]].

==Legal history==
In [[English law]] "buggery" was first used in the [[Buggery Act 1533]], while Section 61 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], entitled "Sodomy and Bestiality", defined punishments for "the abominable Crime of Buggery, committed either with Mankind or with any Animal". The definition of "buggery" was not specified in these or any statute, but rather established by judicial [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone]] |title=[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]|edition=4th|volume=11 |issue=1|page= 505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the courts have defined buggery as including either
# [[anal sex|anal intercourse]] or [[oral sex|oral intercourse]] by a man with a man or woman&lt;ref&gt;''R v Wiseman'' (1718) Fortes Rep 91.&lt;/ref&gt; or
# [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]] by either [[Zoophilia|a man or a woman with an animal]],&lt;ref&gt;''R v Bourne'' (1952) 36 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 135; [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] also reports "... a great lady had committed buggery with a baboon and conceived by it..." at 3 Inst 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
but not any other form of "unnatural intercourse",&lt;ref name=RvJacobs&gt;{{cite book|title=Crown cases reserved for consideration: and decided by the Twelve judges of England, from the year 1799 to the year 1824|pages=331–332|year=1825|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bW0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; the implication being that anal sex with an animal would not constitute buggery. Such a case has not, to date, come before the courts of a common law jurisdiction in any reported decision. In the 1817 case of ''Rex v. Jacobs'', the Crown Court ruled that oral intercourse, even with an underage and/or non-consenting animal, did not constitute buggery or sodomy.&lt;ref name=RvJacobs /&gt;

At common law consent was not a defence&lt;ref&gt;Because consent was not required, heavier penalties require proof of lack of consent &amp;ndash; see ''R v Sandhu'' [1997] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 288; ''R v Davies'' [1998] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 252.&lt;/ref&gt; nor was the fact that the parties were [[marriage|married]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Jellyman'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 604.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]], the punishment for buggery was reduced from [[hanging]] to [[life imprisonment]] by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. As with the crime of [[rape]], buggery required that penetration must have occurred, but [[ejaculation]] is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Reekspear'' (1832) 1 Mood CC 342; ''R v Cozins'' (1834) 6 C &amp; P 351; the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], §63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decriminalisation and abolition ===
{{main|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom#Same-sex sexual activity}}
Most common law jurisdictions have now modified the law to permit anal sex between consenting adults. In England, the first relaxation of the law came from the [[Wolfenden Report]], published in 1957. The key proposal of the report was that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cabinet Papers|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/before-after-wolfenden-report.htm|website=The National Archives|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law was not changed until 1967, when the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] decriminalised consensual "homosexual acts" as long as only two men were involved, both were over 21 and the acts happened in private. However, the Act concerned acts between men only, and anal sex between men and women remained an offence until 1994, when the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] decriminalised consensual anal sex between a man and a woman, if both were over 18. The Act also reduced the age at which two men could engage in anal sex to 18, but it was not until 2000, with the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]], that the age of consent for anal sex was reduced to 16 for men and women. In 2003, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003|Sexual Offences Act]] significantly reformed English law in relation to sexual offences, introducing a new range of offences relating to underage and non-consensual sexual activity that were concerned with the act that occurred, rather than the sex/gender or sexual orientation of those committing it.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=Buggery and Parliament, 1533-2017|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3155522|website=[[SSRN]]|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buggery in as much as it related to sexual intercourse with animal ([[bestiality]]) remained untouched until the Sexual Offences Act 2003, when it was replaced with a new offence of "intercourse with an animal".&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 69, Sexual Offences Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/69|website=[[Legislation.gov.uk]]|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 abolished the offence of "buggery between persons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/sec0002.html Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993; §2: Abolition of offence of buggery between persons.] Irish Statute Book.&lt;/ref&gt; For some years prior to 1993, criminal prosecution had not been made for buggery between consenting adults. The 1993 Act created an offence of "buggery with a person under the age of 17 years",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/sec0003.html Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993; §3: Buggery of persons under 17 years of age]. Irish Statute Book.&lt;/ref&gt; penalised similar to [[statutory rape]], which also had 17 years as the [[age of consent]]. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 replaced this offence with "defilement of a child", encompassing both "sexual intercourse" and "buggery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0015/print.html Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 §§1,2,3 and Schedule.] Irish Statute Book.&lt;/ref&gt; Buggery with an animal is still unlawful under Section 69 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. In 2012 a man was convicted of this offence for supplying a dog in 2008 to a woman who had intercourse with it and died;&lt;ref name="ll4456858"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local/court-told-mother-died-after-acting-on-sexual-fantasy-1-4456858|title=Court told mother died after acting on ‘sexual fantasy’|last=Sheridan|first=Anne|date=8 November 2012|work=[[Limerick Leader]]|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a [[suspended sentence]] and was required to sign the [[sex offender registry]], ending his career as a [[bus driver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.limerickpost.ie/2012/12/19/bus-driver-avoids-prison-in-bestiality-case/|title=Bus driver avoids prison in bestiality case|work=[[Limerick Post]]|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hong Kong]] did so retroactively in 1990, barring prosecution for "[[crimes against nature]]" committed before the ''Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 1990'' entered into force except those that would still have constituted a crime if they had been done thereafter.

'''Conducting''' is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an [[orchestra]]l or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. It has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture."&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller-Maitland; eds. (1922). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgBKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA588&amp;dq=conducting+dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjix-69nPbWAhUO42MKHWDCDmoQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=conducting%20dictionary&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Volume 1]'', p.581. Macmillan. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary duties of the '''conductor''' are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score, set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|first1=Michael|last1=Kennedy|authorlink1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|first2=Joyce|last2=Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey their ideas and interpretation, conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.&lt;ref name=CambComp3&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=Raymond|chapter=The technique of conducting|page=3|editor-last=Bowen|editor-first=José Antonio|title=The Cambridge Companion to Conducting|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|date=2003|isbn=0-521-52791-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.&lt;ref name=CambComp3 /&gt;

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments or voices. Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor|author=Espie Estrella|date=6 March 2017|website=thoughtco.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. [[Orchestra]]s, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.

==Nomenclature==
The principal conductor of an [[orchestra]] or [[opera]] company is sometimes referred to as a ''[[music director]]'' or ''chief conductor'', or by the German words ''[[Kapellmeister]]'' or ''Dirigent''. Conductors of [[choir]]s or choruses are sometimes referred to as ''choral director,'' ''chorus master,'' or ''choirmaster,'' particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of [[concert band]]s, [[military band]]s, [[marching band]]s and other bands may hold the title of ''band director'', ''bandmaster'', or ''drum major''. Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word, ''[[maestro]]'' ("master" as in "one who has mastered the art").

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

===Middle Ages to 18th century===
An early form of conducting is [[cheironomy]], the use of hand gestures to indicate [[melody|melodic]] shape. This has been practiced at least as far back as the [[Middle Ages]]. In the [[Christian]] church, the person giving these symbols held a [[Staff of office|staff]] to signify his role, and it seems that as music became [[rhythm]]ically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of [[Baton (conducting)|baton]].

In the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled up sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period. The large staff was responsible for the death of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], who injured his foot with one while conducting a [[Te Deum]] for the [[Louis XIV of France|King]]'s recovery from illness. The wound became [[gangrene|gangrenous]] and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jérôme de La Gorce]]|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42477pg1?q=lully+gangrene&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=(1) Jean-Baptiste Lully (Lulli, Giovanni Battista) (i)|work=[[Oxford Music Online]] (New Grove)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|accessdate=8 October 2008}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the [[concertmaster]], who could use his [[bow (music)|bow]] as a baton, or a [[lute]]nist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the [[harpsichord]] in pieces that had a [[basso continuo]] part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors – the keyboard player was in charge of the singers, and the principal violinist or '''leader''' was in charge of the orchestra.

On Fri, 30 Sep 1791 in Vienna, [[Mozart]]'s opera Die Zauberflöte ([[The Magic Flute]]) premiered at the Theater auf der Wieden (also known as the “Wiednertheater”), with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra, according to documents and publicity posters from that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edge |first1=Dexter |title=The earliest published report on the premiere of Die Zauberflöte (1 Oct 1791) |url=https://sites.google.com/site/mozartdocuments/documents/1791-10-01 |website=Mozart: New Documents |publisher=Dexter Edge and David Black |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, [[Joseph Haydn]] conducted the premiere of [[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]] with his hands and a baton while ''Kapellmeister

===19th century===
[[File:Verdi conducting Aida in Paris 1880 - Gallica - Restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Verdi]] conducting his opera ''[[Aida]]'' in 1881]]
By the early 19th century (ca. 1820), it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor, who did not also play an instrument during the performance. While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were [[Louis Spohr]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Kurt Masur]], [[James Conlon]], [[Yuri Temirkanov]],&lt;ref&gt;Libbey, Theodore (2006).

Workman. {{ISBN|9780761120728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold Stokowski]], [[Vasily Safonov]], [[Eugene Ormandy]] (for a period), and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;Galkin, Elliott W. (1988). ''A History of Orchestral Conducting: In Theory and Practice'', p. 521. Pendragon. {{ISBN|9780918728470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composers [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Richard Wagner]] attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include [[François Habeneck]], who founded the [[Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire]] in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] was also a conductor.

Wagner's one-time champion [[Hans von Bülow]] (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of [[Franz Liszt]], whose daughter [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] he married – although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).

Bülow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra ("sectional rehearsal"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]], and [[Berlin Philharmonic]] he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like [[Richard Strauss]], who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and [[Felix Weingartner]], who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer [[Gustav Mahler]] was also a noted conductor.

===20th century===
The next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels; perhaps most notable was the Hungarian-born [[Arthur Nikisch]] (1855–1922), who succeeded Bülow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. He had previously served as head of the [[Leipzig Opera]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], and was to serve as music director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Nikisch premiered important works by [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who greatly admired his work; [[Johannes Brahms]], after hearing him conduct his [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], said it was "quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better."

Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] of a complete symphony: the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven Fifth]] with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film – alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as [[Fritz Reiner]] stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.

Conductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1867–1957) and the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] (1886–1954). Toscanini played in orchestras under [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and made his debut conducting ''[[Aida]]'' in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as [[James Levine]] as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Bülow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.

Furtwängler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo – but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist [[Heinrich Schenker]], who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and [[Resolution (music)|resolutions]] in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R92264, Herbert von Karajan.jpg|thumb|[[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1941]]

The two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like [[Leopold Stokowski]] (1882–1977), [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885–1973), [[Herbert von Karajan]] (1908–1989) and [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918–1990) – incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame – had widely varied techniques.

Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] (1957–69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 – performing Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] – he tried to get the orchestra to produce an "ugly" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).

Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him – he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc – but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.

In the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique – particularly with the right hand and the baton – became increasingly standardized. Conductors like [[Willem Mengelberg]] in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.

[[Women in music#Conducting|Women conductors]] were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like {{ill|Hortense von Gelmini|de}},&lt;ref&gt;David Mutch: "The gathering critical judgement of Hortense von Gelmini, Germany's only woman conductor, is that she has not only the talent but the education, energy, and persistance to make her mark in this difficult and competive profession" – 1976 in: ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' {{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marin Alsop]] and [[Simone Young]] are to be seen conducting leading orchestras. Alsop was appointed music director of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] in 2007 – the first woman ever appointed to head a major US orchestra – and also of the [[Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo]] in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of [[The Proms]]. Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the [[Hamburg State Opera]] and [[Philharmoniker Hamburg]] in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the [[Ring Cycle]] of [[Richard Wagner]].

While Mexico has produced several major international conductors, [[Alondra de la Parra]] has become the first Mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession. Similarly, Asian origin has become unremarkable, because of the international successes of conductors from the Far East such as [[Seiji Ozawa]], who was the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]'s music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto, and [[Myung-Whun Chung]], who has held major posts in Germany and France and now is bringing the [[Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra]] to international attention.

For more information on black conductors, see [[Black conductors]].

Conducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance. Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in [[rehearsal]] frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.

Conducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], but may sometimes be spontaneous.

A distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.

===Beat and tempo===
&lt;!--[[Ictus]] links directly here.--&gt;
At the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his hands (or hand if he only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the [[upbeat]]. The [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every [[bar (music)|bar]] (measure) depending on the [[time signature]], indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Maestro's Mojo – Breaking Conductors' Down by Gesture and Body Part|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/arts/music/breaking-conductors-down-by-gesture-and-body-part.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] indicates the first beat of the bar, and the [[upbeat]] indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the ''[[Wikt:ictus|ictus]]'' (plural: ''{{lang|la|ictūs}}'' or ''ictuses''), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, "ictus" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a [[music stand]] where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the "preparation", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the "{{lang|de|takt}}" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).

If the [[tempo]] is slow or slowing, or if the [[time signature]] is [[Metre (music)#Compound metre|compound]], a conductor will sometimes indicate "subdivisions" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.&lt;!---I can't find the words to make this more clear right now, but I don't think this is clear or understandable to the layman yet---not just quadruple metre---&gt;

Changes to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a [[rallentando]] (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.

While some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for [[Musical cue|cueing]] the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.

During an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.

There is a difference between the "textbook" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual [[performance practice]] in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud [[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes and accented notes|sforzando]] chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly ''after'' the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.

===Dynamics===
[[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a [[crescendo]]; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]]. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.

Dynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.

===Cueing===
The indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called "cueing". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a [[pedal point]] with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by "engaging" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible "sniff" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.

===Other musical elements===

Articulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for [[staccato]], to long and fluid for [[legato]]. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a "cutoff" or "release", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.

Conductors&lt;!-- would a reference improve this? Strauss said (light-heartedly) "never look at the brass, it only encourages them", and Karajan sometimes conducted with his eyes closed --&gt; aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.

In some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a {{music|time|4|4}} piece that the conductor will beat "in two" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were {{music|time|2|2}}), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his chest.

In most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E{{music|b}} clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called [[attacca]]. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.

==Roles==

The roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the [[musical director]] of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the [[audition]]s for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.

Some conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known [[celebrity|celebrities]], such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], most are only known within the classical music scene.

==Training and education==

Classical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees in conducting.

In addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of [[classical music]] and regarding [[music theory]]. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the [[piano]] or the [[pipe organ]], a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.

In 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/mobile/music-directors-and-composers.htm|title=Music Directors and Composers : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelor's degrees (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.

Another topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.

Master of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.

[[Doctor of Musical Arts]] (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a [[terminal degree]], and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as [[youth orchestra]]s, school orchestras and community orchestras.

A small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).

The average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

[[Image:Counterbore hole stainless steel.jpg|thumb|A counterbore in a metal plate]]
A '''counterbore''' (symbol: [[Miscellaneous Technical#Miscellaneous Technical (2300–23FF) in Unicode|'''⌴''']]) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed hole that enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool used to create that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a [[hex key|socket head cap screw]], is required to sit flush with or below the level of a workpiece's surface. 

Whereas a counterbore is a ''flat-bottomed'' enlargement of a smaller coaxial hole, a [[countersink]] is a ''[[cone|conical]]'' enlargement of such. A [[spotface]] often takes the form of a very shallow counterbore. 

As mentioned above, the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutters]] that produce counterbores are often also called counterbores; sometimes, to avoid ambiguity, the term '''counterbore cutter''' is used instead. 

==Description==
[[File:Countersunk and counterbored holes cross-section.png|thumb|Comparison of countersunk and counterbored holes.]]
[[File:Machined Holes.svg|thumb|Counterbore cutter marked '''E'']]
A counterbore hole is usually used when the head of a fastener, such as a [[Screw#Types of screws and bolts|hex head or socket head capscrew]], is required to be flush with or below the level of a workpiece's surface.

For a spotface, material is removed from a surface to make it flat and smooth, usually for a [[fastener]] or a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are [[forging|forged]] or [[casting|cast]]. A tool referred to as a counterbore is typically used to cut the spotface, although an [[endmill]] may also be used. Only enough material is removed to make the surface flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=606}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A counterbore is also used to create a perpendicular surface for a fastener head on a non-perpendicular surface. If this is not feasible then a [[self-aligning nut]] may be required.

By comparison, a [[countersink]] makes a conical hole and is used  to seat a [[Screw#Shapes of screw head|flathead screw]].

[[Technical standard|Standards]] exist for the sizes of counterbores, especially for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between [[standards organization]]s. For example, in [[Boeing]] Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spotfaced surface is the same as the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the [[ASME]] Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter.

==Machining==
[[Image:CounterBores.jpg|thumb|Two types of counterbore tools]]

Counterbores are made with standard dimensions for a certain size of screw or are produced in sizes that are not related to any particular screw size. In either case, the tip of the counterbore has a reduced diameter section referred to as the pilot, a feature essential to assuring concentricity between the counterbore and the hole being counterbored.  Counterbores matched to specific screw sizes generally have integral pilots that fit the clearance hole diameter associated with a particular screw size (e.g., .191 inches for a number 10 machine screw).  Counterbores that are not related to a specific screw size are designed to accept a removable pilot, allowing any given counterbore size to be adapted to a variety of hole sizes. The pilot matters little when running the cutter in [[Milling machine|a milling setup]] where rigidity is assured and hole center location is already achieved via X-Y positioning.

The uppermost counterbore tools shown in the image are the same device. The smaller top item is an insert, the middle shows another three-fluted counterbore insert, assembled in the holder.  The shank of this holder is a [[machine tapers#Morse|Morse taper]], although there are other [[machine tapers]] that are used in the industry.  The lower counterbore is designed to fit into a [[Chuck (engineering)#drill|drill chuck]], and being smaller, is economical to make as one piece.

'''Democratic Collective Centralism''', also known as '''DCC''', is an offspring ideology of ''[[Democratic centralism]]''.

''[[Democratic centralism]]'', first proposed by [[Lenin]], held that a policy decided upon by a majority vote must be upheld by all participants.&lt;ref name=freedomunity&gt;{{cite web |author=Lenin, V.|year=1906|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/rucong/viii.htm|title=Report on the Unity Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.|accessdate=2016-08-08|authorlink=Vladimir Lenin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic Collective Centralism supports this belief whilst combining it with [[Collectivism]].

== Major Beliefs ==

The key belief within Democratic Collective Centralism is [[Collectivism]], the idea of prioritizing the group rather than yourself or your family. These prioritizations could be goals, outcomes, rights and so on.

This belief has been criticized for being inhuman or unnatural as people will naturally build preferences towards individuals and parties. Socialists have argued the only way for this to work is to have common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. From "Definitions of market and socialism" (pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59): "The control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process...The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else."&lt;/ref&gt;

The main or commonly spoken role which Collectivism plays within Democratic Collective Centralism is to shrink the wealth inequality within the public by having the significant majority of the population within the middle-class. This is done by the government enforcing strict tax laws within the state which effects low incomes very minorly however, large incomers significantly. The logic or reasoning behind the act is the belief that the money will have a better use if it's being used on the country's needs rather than materialistic needs. This relates to Collectivism as the money is being used for the public or the whole rather than individual unnecessary materialistic needs.

This is viewed as a major factor within the ideology because of some country's [[We are the 99%|One percent]] progressively owning very large sums of money whilst the middle class are progressively becoming less wealthy.

=== Minor Beliefs ===
{{sources|date=November 2016}}
Democratic Collective Centralism also holds the belief that when electing an individual you must vote for who you believe is the best for the state rather than who's best for you. This belief is practically impossible to enforce however, is seen as a moral.

Lastly, collectivism wants it's people to prioritize the country's problems. What's meant by 'country's problems' could be the environment, science, unemployment and so on... The 'country's problems' can change dependent on the current situation. However, the key aspect to this belief is how citizens should view these problems. The people or citizens should believe in these beliefs as they're important for the country's health or survival which again links to [[Collectivism]] because of the aspect in prioritizing the country's problems.

== Effects upon Capitalism ==
{{sources|date=November 2016}}
Democratic Collective Centralism supports free market of all private organizations with one simple guideline. As long as the private organization is not intentionally damaging the country's or state's health for profit reasons, they're freely allowed to carry out all forms of legal business upon the public. However, if the private organization is found to be unintentionally damaging the country's or state's health when there is an option not to damage the country's or state's health; the government will step in and force that switch. All of this falls under collectivism because when the government acts, there reasoning will be for benefiting the country or state.

'''[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/D/DoubleEscrow.aspx Double escrow]''' is a set of [[real estate transaction]]s involving two [[contracts]] of sale for the same property, to two different back-to-back buyers, at the same or two different prices, arranged to [[closing (real estate)|close]] on the same day.  At close of [[escrow]], all participants, lenders, sellers, buyers and brokers are informed of all parties involved and all monies that change hands.

For example, a double escrow might be arranged in which Alpha sells Greenacre to Beta, the [[Sales|sale]] to close at 10:00 am this morning; and Beta then immediately sells Greenacre to Gamma at 2:00 pm this afternoon.  Because the two escrows are arranged to close back-to-back on the same day, they are regarded as one "double escrow."

If the underlying purpose of the double escrow is legal, the double escrow will be legal. If the double escrow is undertaken for a criminal purpose, it will not be legal.  Otherwise, whether legal or not, a double escrow may not be physically possible.

By definition, both escrows must close on the same day, or it is not "double" escrow but two single escrows.  The second sale cannot close until the deed from the first sale is recorded, which means the deed must be recorded on the same day that both closings happen.  If a county clerk or recorder's office has a 10:00 am deadline for same-day recording, and if the first sale does not close until after that deadline; then the deed will not be recorded until the next day, and the second escrow cannot close on the same day as the first.  This is one situation in which double escrow is impossible.

Another, possible more common reason for double escrow to be impossible is that the county clerk's office might not do same-day recording of deeds, especially if the county is understaffed.  Many counties have a time lag of several days to several weeks (even a month or more) between accepting a deed for recording and actual recording (as of the date it was received). In these jurisdictions, double escrow will be completely impossible because the back-to-back sales may not even close during the same week or month, let alone on the same day.

'''Duit''' is an extinct [[Chibcha language]], spoken by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] of present-day [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], [[Colombia]]. The language appears in the modern name of the pre-Columbian settlement and last ruler [[Tundama]]; [[Duitama]].&lt;ref name=PueblosTundama&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/biografias/tundama.html Biography Cacique Tundama] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The language is only known from one fragment analysed by [[List of Muisca scholars|scholar]] [[Ezequiel Uricoechea]] in 1871. The linguist mentioned that the analysed text was part of a larger work that hitherto has not been found. From the short text it was clear that the Duit language differed slightly from the main version of Chibcha, Muysccubun, spoken by the Muisca on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LSA |last=[[Ezequiel Uricoechea|Uricoechea]] |first=Ezequiel |year=1871 |title=Gramática, vocabulario, catecismo y confesionario de la lengua chibcha, según antiguos manuscritos anónimos e inéditos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Muisca did not have a script, only for their [[Muisca numerals|numerals]], written Duit language texts do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Get your hand away from my wound, doctor!
You don´t know the cure of my pain
What kind of a doctor are you? You don't have medicine.
My wound is on my heart, you can´t bandage it.

I say you, o false-hearted!
May nobody pull the string of fate's bow
You demolished and destroyed the palace of heart.
You can´t take and put back even one stone of it.

I am Emrah, you listened to my words.
I hide your love in home of my heart:
Why do you stop, cry my eyes.
You can't see the beloved one more time.}}

An '''executor''' is someone who is responsible for executing, or following through on, an assigned task or duty. The feminine form, '''executrix''', may sometimes be used. The role of an '''executor''' should not be confused with that of an [[executioner]], a person who carries out a death sentence ordered by a government or other legal authority.

==Overview==
[[File:Auguste Renoir - Portrait of a Woman, called of Mme Georges Hartmann - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Auguste Renoir]], ''Portrait of a Woman, called of Mme Georges Hartmann'', gift from [[Jean Camille Albert Bourjat|General Bourjat]], executor of [[Georges Hartmann]] ([[Musée d'Orsay]])]]
An executor is a legal term referring to a person named by the maker of a [[Will and testament|will]] or nominated by the [[testator]] to carry out the instructions of the will. Typically, the executor is the person responsible for offering the will for [[probate]], although it is not required that they fulfill this. The executor's duties also include [[disbursing]] [[property]] to the beneficiaries as designated in the will, obtaining information of potential [[heir]]s, collecting and arranging for payment of [[debt]]s of the estate and approving or disapproving [[creditor]]s' claims.

An executor will make sure  [[estate tax]]es are calculated, necessary forms are filed, and [[tax]] payments are made. They will also assist the [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] with the estate. Additionally, the executor acts as a legal conveyor who designates where the [[donation]]s will be sent using the information left in ''bequests, ''whether they be sent to [[Charitable organization|charity]] or other organizations. In most circumstances, the executor is the representative of the [[estate (law)|estate]] for all purposes, and has the ability to sue or be sued on behalf of the estate. The executor holds legal [[title (property)|title]] to the estate property, but may not use the title or property for their own benefit, unless permitted by the terms of the will.

A person who deals with a deceased person's property without proper authority is known as an executor ''[[de son tort]]''.  Such a person's actions may subsequently be ratified by the lawful executors or [[administrator of an estate|administrators]] if the actions do not contradict the substantive provisions of the deceased's will or the rights of heirs at law.

When there is no will, a person is said to have died [[intestate]]—"without testimony." As a result, there is no tangible "testimony" to follow, and hence there can be no executor. If there is no will or the executors named in a will do not wish to act, an [[administrator of an estate|administrator]] of the deceased's estate may instead be appointed.  The generic term for executors or administrators is [[personal representative]]. In [[England and Wales]], when a person dies intestate in a [[nursing home]], and has no family members who can be traced, those responsible for their care automatically become their executors.
Under [[Scots law|Scottish law]], a personal representative of any kind is referred to as an executor, using ''executor nominate'' to refer to an executor and ''executor dative'' to an administrator.

==Executor pay==
In some countries, such as the United States, an executor is automatically entitled to compensation for his or her services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.estateexec.com/Docs/Compensation|title=EstateExec - Executor's Guide|work=estateexec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this amount varies dramatically by jurisdiction.  Unless specifically set by the will, this compensation is often determined by what is considered ″reasonable″ for the effort involved, although in a number of jurisdictions, the amount is instead set as a percentage of the overall estate.  For example, in California the executor is entitled to 4% of the first $100K of estate value, 3% of the next $100K, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.estateexec.com/Docs/Compensation?state_abbrev=CA|title=EstateExec - Executor's Guide|work=estateexec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the executor is ''not'' automatically entitled to compensation, although compensation can be directed within the will or on application to a court.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/ElderLawWillsTrustsEstates/LawArticle-1211/Executor-Pay-Fees-for-the-Executor-or-Administrator-of-an-Estate.aspx Executor Pay: Fees for the Executor or Administrator of an Estate], duhaime.org retrieved 19 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance policies==
In recent years, custom "executors' insurance" policies have entered the marketplace. These are currently available in countries including Canada, England, and Wales. They are often taken up by non-professional executors&amp;mdash;typically friends or family of the deceased&amp;mdash;who may be worried about potentially making an error during the probate process and/or uncomfortable about exposing themselves to unlimited personal financial and legal liability. Many find such cover an attractive proposition as the vast majority of wills allow reasonable expenses, such as the cost of the policy, to be reclaimed from the deceased's estate.

'''Fflur Dafydd''' is an award-winning novelist, singer/songwriter and musician. Although predominantly publishing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], she also writes in English. She records in Welsh and her work is regularly played on the Welsh-language [[Radio Cymru]].

==Early life==
Born in 1978, she is the daughter of Welsh poet [[Menna Elfyn]]. Dafydd grew up in [[Llandysul]], a Welsh-speaking community, and although she received the majority of her education in Welsh, she chose to study English in higher education. She graduated in English from [[Aberystwyth University]], and it was while she was here that she first came to prominence as a student in 1999, when she won the Literature Medal at the [[Urdd]] [[National Eisteddfod]] at [[Lampeter]]. This success led to the publication of ''Y Gwir Am Gelwydd'' (''The Truth About Lies''), a collection of 12 poems and five short stories.

After graduating from Aberystwyth she gained an MA in Creative Writing from the [[University of East Anglia]] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/creativewriting/alumni/d-f|title=Alumni D - F|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a PhD on the poetry of [[R. S. Thomas]] from [[Bangor University]] in 2001.

Today Dafydd is successful in the different fields of literature and contemporary music, such that some people have failed to realise that this is one and the same person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/interview/with/author/fflur-dafydd|title=Book Depository: Millions of books with free delivery worldwide|author=Book Depository|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in [[Carmarthen]], but travels widely with her work.

==Writer==
Dafydd has written for stage, screen and radio, and her wide repertoire includes short fiction, journalism, lecturing, songwriting, screenwriting, poetry, novels, plays and short films.

She was nominated for a D. M. Davies award at the Cardiff International Film Festival for her short film "Bathtime" (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swan.ac.uk/staff/academic/Arts/dafyddf/ Swansea University staff page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 her first novel ''Lliwiau Liw Nos'' (''Colours by Night'') was published and short-listed for the Prose Medal. It was followed in 2006 by her second novel ''Atyniad'' (''Attraction''), which won the Prose Medal at the [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[Swansea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_5250000/newsid_5253500/5253502.stm|title=BBC Arlein - Newyddion – Medal ryddiaith i Fflur|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 she was selected for the [[Scritture Giovani]] project for emerging European writers. She has also undertaken literary residencies in Helsinki (2006) and on [[Bardsey Island]] (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amheath.com/pages/authors/view.asp?id=403 AM Heath, Authors' Agents site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 she published her first English novel, ''Twenty Thousand Saints'', inspired by her six-week experience as a writer-in-residence on Bardsey in 2002. Regarding her choice of language, she said, "It started out as a translation of a Welsh-language novel, and after about a year or so, I decided that it really wasn't working – so I decided to start from scratch with a completely different story."  This work won for her the Oxfam Hay Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookwag.com/2009/05/25/oxfam-hay-prize-for-fflur-dafydd/ Hay Award website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8066051.stm|title=Singer-songwriter wins book prize|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 she won the Daniel Owen Memorial Prize for her novel ''Y Llyfrgell'' (The Library).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_8180000/newsid_8183100/8183107.stm|title=BBC Arlein – Newyddion – 'Dewin llenyddol' yn ennill medal|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she was a participant in the [[International Writing Program]] at the University of Iowa.

She regularly publishes in a wide variety of publications: ''New Welsh Review'', ''Welsh Writing in English Yearbook'', ''Barn'', ''Golwg'' and ''Planet''. For some years has been Editor of the periodical "Tu Chwith".

Fflur has taught film theory and scriptwriting at the [[University of Aberystwyth]] and Trinity College Carmarthen, and her scriptwriting has included work for the popular S4C series "[[Pobol y Cwm]]".

She currently lectures in creative writing at Swansea University, and is finishing her latest novel, 
Fflur is also a television columnist for the [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]], and features weekly in the weekender magazine.

A '''fraternal party''' is a [[political party]] officially affiliated with another, often larger or international, political party or [[governmental]] party, or several of them, notably when these share a political [[ideology]].

They may express this 'fraternity' by exchanging [[fraternal delegates]] to each-other's party congresses.

In 1960s, [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] in charge of [[communist state|states]] often had fraternal parties in other countries than the one(s) in which they were organized. A major example was the [[Communist Party of China]], which exercised enormous influence over the [[New Left]] and [[New Communist Movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s. In [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html The Modern History Sourcebook], there is a 1964 statement by the [[Romanian Workers' Party]] in which they caution, "In discussing and confronting different points of view on problems concerning the revolutionary struggle or socialist construction, no party must label as anti-Marxist, anti-Leninist the fraternal party whose opinions it does not share." [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1964romania-china.html]

[[Trench warfare]] protected the bodies but left the heads exposed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zxw42hv How do you fix a face that’s been blown off by shrapnel?], bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 9 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the steel helmet in 1915 made head shots more 'survivable', but this reduction of mortality meant a mutilated life for thousands.&lt;ref name="MUSE" /&gt;

At the start of the war those wounded to the head were generally not considered able to survive and they would not usually be 'helped first'.&lt;ref name="SSB"&gt;Smith, L. V., Stephane, A-R. and Becker, A. (2003); ''France and the Great War'', Cambridge University Press, p. 94. Retrieved on-line through [https://books.google.com/books?id=8rbSnt4bgNIC&amp;pg=PA94 Google Books], 9 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This changed in the course of the war, as progress was made in medical practices like [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] and most notably in the new field of [[plastic surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;The work done on this group of war wounded would now be classed as [[reconstructive surgery]], rather than plastic surgery.&lt;/ref&gt; Surgeons conducted experiments with bone, cartilage and tissue transplants and the likes of [[Hippolyte Morestin]], [[Harold Gillies]] and [[Léon Dufourmentel]] made enormous advances.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Because of the experimental character of this surgery some chose to remain as they were and others could just not be helped yet.&lt;ref name="SSB" /&gt; Some of the latter were helped by all kinds of new prosthetics to make them look more or less 'normal'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-27592604 World War One: Soldiers helped at Wandsworth 'Tin Noses Shop'], bbc.com, 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gueules cassées ==
An estimated 4.2 million French were wounded, 300,000 of whom were classified as 'mutilated'. Of those some 15,000 can be called ''gueules cassées''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Bourdon, M. (2011); ''Bilan des pertes humaines de la Première Guerre mondiale'', published on-line through [https://scribium.com/maurice-bourdon/a/bilan-des-pertes-humaines-de-la-premiere-guerre-mondiale/ scribium.com]. Retrieved 9 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Right after the war those facially disfigured were not considered war veterans and exempt from support and veteran's benefits, but that changed later. In 1921 the ''Union des Blessés de la Face et de la tête'' (association of the wounded to the face and the head) was formed. The Colonel Picot mentioned above was one of its founders and a later president of the association.&lt;ref name="MUSE" /&gt; It still exists, currently under the name ''Gueules Cassées'' with, considering the mutilations, the somewhat sour slogan ''sourire quand même'' (smiling nonetheless).

The '''Hértevin language''' is a modern Eastern [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] or [[Syriac language]]. It was originally spoken in a cluster of villages in [[Siirt Province]] in southeastern [[Turkey]]. Speakers of Hértevin Aramaic have emigrated mostly to the West, and are now scattered and isolated from one another. A few speakers remain in Turkey. 

==Origins==
Hértevin was 'discovered' by linguist Otto Jastrow in 1970, and first described in publication by him two years later. His recordings of the language are available on [http://www.semarch.uni-hd.de/tondokumente.php43?LD_ID=4&amp;RG_ID=20&amp;ORT_ID=27&amp;lang=en Heidelberg University's Semitic Sound Archive].

The speakers of the Hértevin dialect of Neo-Aramaic are traditionally [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]]. Their area of habitation in and around the village of Hertevin (called Hertevinler in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and Härtəvən in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), near the town of [[Pervari]] in [[Siirt Province]] is at the very northeastern extreme of the area where Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages were traditionally spoken. Thus, Hértevin is a peripheral dialect that has developed quite differently from related languages.

All Hértevin speakers are bilingual in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and many also speak other languages. The [[Syriac alphabet]] is used for writing, but almost no literature in the Hértevin dialect exists. Church liturgy is in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].

==Phonology==
Its major phonetic feature is the loss of the [[voiceless velar fricative]] ''x'', which has become a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], ''ħ''. The original voiceless pharyngeal fricative has retained that pronunciation. In all the other dialects of eastern Neo-Aramaic the opposite is true: the voiceless pharyngeal fricative has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative.

Another feature of Hértevin Neo-Aramaic is its set of demonstratives. As with other languages of the eastern group, Hértevin makes no distinction between 'this' and 'that', and uses a single set of [[pronoun]]s to cover both meanings: āwa (m. sg.), āya (f. sg.) and āni (pl.). However, unlike the other languages, Hértevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns that indicates 'this one right here': ōhā, ēhā and anhī.

Although belonging to the eastern, or northeastern, group of Neo-Aramaic dialects, Hértevin shares some features with the [[Turoyo language]], of the central group, originating from nearby [[Mardin Province]].

'''Independent Conservative''' is a description which has been used in the [[United Kingdom]], Canada, and elsewhere, to denote a political [[conservatism|Conservative]] who lacks a formal affiliation to the party of that name.

==In the United Kingdom==
As a description for use on the [[ballot paper]], until 1999 anyone could stand at any [[United Kingdom|British]] election as an Independent Conservative, but since the [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] came into force, a candidate who is not officially certified by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] must either stand for another registered [[political party]] or as an [[Independent politician|Independent]]. However, the term is still used to designate a [[politician]] who either has left the Conservative Party or never joined it, so is independent of it, but who nevertheless identifies as a Conservative.

[[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] was an Independent Conservative in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] between 1911 and 1923, after he won the 1911 [[by-election]] for [[Hitchin (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], [[John Mackie (Scottish Unionist politician)|John Mackie]] and [[Daniel Lipson]] were both elected to the Commons as Independent Conservatives.

Hunter sat as an Independent Conservative MP until joining the DUP Westminster parliamentary party in 2004.

[[David Stevens, Baron Stevens of Ludgate|Lord Stevens of Ludgate]] sat in the [[House of Lords]] as an Independent Conservative between 2004 and 2012.&lt;ref name = "ukip"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19627027 |title=Former Conservative peer Lord Stevens to join UK Independence Party |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2016, [[Zac Goldsmith]] [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned from the House of Commons]] over the planned expansion of [[Heathrow Airport]], triggering a [[Richmond Park by-election, 2016|by-election]], which Goldsmith contested as an Independent, but without opposition from the Conservative Party. He was described as an Independent Conservative.

==In Canada==
Independent Conservative members of parliament have also sat in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], with a similar designation. In the 19th century, prior to the solidification of the party system, it was common in Canada for Independent Conservative and Independent Liberal members to be elected, sometimes defeating official Conservative or Liberal candidates.

[[Joseph Sasseville Roy]] was elected as an Independent Conservative at the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]].  He had declined to run as an official Conservative, due to his disagreement with the party's policy on [[conscription]], which was unpopular in Quebec. [[Henri Courtemanche]] was elected as an "Independent Progressive Conservative" in [[Labelle (electoral district)|Labelle]] in [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957]] and subsequently rejoined the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]].  [[Maurice Allard]] was elected to the Commons as an "Independent Progressive Conservative" in [[Sherbrooke (electoral district)|Sherbrooke]] at the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 federal election]], defeating the official Progressive Conservative candidate.  A former Progressive Conservative politician, Allard had quit the party in 1963 due to his opposition to its leader, [[John George Diefenbaker]].

Since then, it has been more usual for Independent Conservatives at the national level to be Conservatives who have voluntarily resigned the party whip or who have been expelled from the party.  [[Bill Casey]] sat in the House of Commons as an "Independent Progressive Conservative" after he was expelled from the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] caucus for stating that the Conservative government's 2007 budget had violated the [[Atlantic Accord]]. Casey was re-elected at the federal election of 2008 with almost 70 per cent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://greenparty.ca/media-release/2009-05-01/green-party-canada-salutes-bill-casey-and-wishes-him-well-his-new-role The Green Party of Canada Salutes Bill Casey and Wishes Him Well in His New Role], dated 1 May 2009 at greenparty.ca, accessed 2 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Brazeau]] is a current Independent Conservative Senator, but he has been expelled from sitting in the Senate due his arrest for assault. [[Pamela Wallin]] is a current Independent Conservative Senator, who was removed from caucus due to spending scandal.  In 2013, [[Brent Rathgeber]] became an Independent Conservative MP for St. Albert - Edmonton after leaving the Conservative Party caucus, citing that the Prime Minister's Office had authoritarian-type power of the government. He was the member of Parliament up until the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]], which he lost to Conservative candidate [[Michael Cooper (politician)|Michael Cooper]].

The '''Institute of the Peoples of the North''' ({{lang-ru|Институт Народов Севера}}) is a research and later educationary institute based in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Its objective is to examine topics related to the northern minorities in the [[Soviet Union]], and to prepare teachers for the northern boarding schools. One of the central figures involved in the research institute was [[Vladimir Bogoraz]].

The institute was founded in 1930, as four years previously it had become possible to study the languages of the northern peoples in their own right at the Institute for Eastern Studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. By the end of 1929, the institute's teachers had joined forces to create the Unified Northern Alphabet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization |last= Grenoble |first= Lenore A. |authorlink= |author2=Lindsay J. Whaley |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-81621-1|pages=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Единый северный алфавит}}) for use by the linguistic minorities living in the north of the Soviet Union. The alphabet consisted of 32 Latin-based letters, some of which were equipped with [[diacritic]]s. For practical reasons, i.e., typographical reasons, a move to rid the alphabet of graphemes using diacritics was made and one year later a new version was ready. On December 13, 1930, the [[Presidium]] of the Scientific Investigation Association at the institute presented a version of the Unified Northern Alphabet to the Scientific Council of the USSR’s Central Committee on Alphabet Adaptation ({{lang-ru|Всесоюзного центрального комитета нового алфавита}}). The same body discussed the draft again on December 18 and it was approved on February 23, 1931. The scientific section of [[Narkompros]] approved the draft in May the same year. 

The alphabet consisted of 39 letters: 29 consonants and 10 vowels. In addition, some letters were marked with diacritics to show [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], [[Length (phonetics)|length]] and [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].

An intensive and systematic publishing campaign was launched immediately after the alphabet had been formally approved. From 1939 to 1949, approximately 300 experts were employed by the institute.

''The finalisation of principles for creation of a literary public institution for the peoples of the north'' came at the first pan-Russian conference. Delegates to the conference (which was held at the INS ni Leningrad) were representatives for Narkompros, Komitet Severa v/Presidium VCIK, CK Novogo Alfavita SSSR i RSFSR, and the publisher Učpedgiz. In the work conducted at the conference, there were participants from the national northern okrugs, for the local Northern Committees, for CK VLKSM, for the soviet Academy of Sciences, for the Historical-linguistic institute in Leningrad, and for the Northern department at the [[Herzen University|Leningrad Herzen Pedagogical Institute]]. The preparation work was done at INS.

The conference decided to create orthographies for a total of 16 languages and to have books available for the 15th anniversary of the revolution:

* the [[Uralic languages]]: ''[[Nenets languages|Nenets]], [[Selkup language|Selkup]], [[Khanty language|Khanty]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Kildin Sami]]''
* the [[Tungusic languages]]: ''[[Evenki language|Evenki]], [[Even language|Even]], [[Nanai language|Nanai]] and [[Udege language|Udege]]''
* the [[Paleosiberian languages]]: ''[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], [[Koryak language|Koryak]], [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]], [[Siberian Yupik]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] and [[Ket language|Ket]]''

Various books, including primers and math textbooks, were published using this alphabet. The first work published using the new orthography was a book on terminology specific to these areas.

==After World War II==

The institute was run in its original form from 1930 until 1941. Between 1942 and 1945, the institute was located in [[Omsk]], after which it moved back to Leningrad as a part of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. Since 1948, the institute has been a part of the [[Herzen University]], to which it still belongs today.

The '''Kaure–Kosare languages''' are a small [[language family|family]] in West Papua, near the northern border with Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=ngw/&gt;

==Classification==
Kaure and Kosare (Kosadle) are clearly related. There is a history of classifying them with [[Kapori language|Kapori]] and [[Sause language|Sause]] at a more distant level. However, Kapori and Sause show no particular connection to the Kaure languages, and may be closer to [[Kwerba languages|Kwerba]].&lt;ref name=ngw&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/nawa-river New Guinea World, Nawa River]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Khengkha language''' (Dzongkha ྨཕགལཔམཕ) , or '''Kheng''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  is an [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish language]] spoken by ~40,000 native speakers worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Did you know Khengkha is vulnerable?|url = http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/xkf|website = Endangered Languages|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Zhemgang]], [[Trongsa]], and [[Mongar]] districts of south–central [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Khengkha is a dialect found in the small Himalayan kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. Khengkha is part of the larger branch of Sino-Tibetan language family but falls into the subcategories of: Tibetio-Burman, Western Tubeto-Burman, Bodish, East Bodish, Bumthang, and Khengkha.

===Language codes===
'''ISO 639-3'''  xkf

'''Glotolog'''   khen1241&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glottolog 2.6 -             Khengkha|url = http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/khen1241|website = glottolog.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
Khengkha is an East Bodish language spoken in the south-central districts of [[Bhutan]]. Khengkha is mainly found in the [[Sarpang District|Sarpang]] district but can also be found in southwest [[Mongar District|Mongar]] district, rural areas in southeast [[Trongsa District|Trongsa]] district and in [[Zhemgang District|Zhemgang]] district.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bhutan|url = https://www.ethnologue.com/map/BT|website = Ethnologue|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
The three main dialects in [[Bumthang district]] are Bumthap (Lower Kheng), Khempa (Middle Kheng), and
Kurtop (Upper Kheng). Comprehension between the three dialects differs as Bumthap is the most similarly
related language, however conversation with Kurthop is difficult.

==Grammar==
In most Khengkha sentences, it only marks grammatical relations through word order. The subject constituent precedes the object and the verb constituents follow it. Khengkha follows the same typology as [[Dzongkha]].The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

My name Dorji is.

Ngai meng Dorji wenn.

S      O      V

When nouns are addressed in Khengkha there are two ways it can be written, depending on the other.

1.     Relatives before noun heads or articles.

2.     Adjectives after noun heads.

Khengkha is an oral language without a writing system, making tones and nuances important during communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Language Use ===
Khengkha is a vigorous language in limited areas. Khengkha is not allowed to be taught in schools around [[Bhutan]], making it only spoken at home, for commerce, local politics, and traditional religion. Due to the increasing modernization of [[Bhutan]], there are negative attitudes towards those who speak Kheng instead of [[Dzongkha]] or the [[English language|English]]. Lower Kheng is considered to be spoken backward, while Middle Kheng is seen as more prestigious.  Middle Kheng region is the strongest and most developed economically, while lower Kheng is least developed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Language Development ===
Since Khengkha is an oral language there is a low [[literacy]] rate for native Khengkha speakers in [[Dzongkha]]. There is literacy rate of 20% in [[Dzongkha]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Common Phrases==

As there is no official English romanization of Dzongkha script, many words are spelled out phonetically. Therefore, there may be multiple spellings of the same word.

Khengkha is an oral language without its own written system. But it unofficially borrows from the Tibetan
script and Uchen style of writing. Khengkha and Dzongkha numerical script are written the same.

==Related languages==
Historically, Kheng and its speakers have had close contact with speakers of the [[Kurtöp language|Kurtöp]], [[Nupbi language|Nupbi]] and [[Bumthang language]]s, nearby languages of central and eastern Bhutan, to the extent that they may be considered part of a wider collection of "Bumthang languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan: Mountain Fortress of the Gods |first=Christian |last=Schicklgruber |editor=Françoise Pommaret-Imaeda |publisher=Shambhala |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q1uAAAAMAAJ |pages=50, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EEL&gt;{{cite book|first=George |last=van Driem |authorlink=George van Driem |editor-last=Moseley |editor-first=Christopher |contribution=Endangered Languages of Bhutan and Sikkim: East Bodish Languages |title=Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages |year=2007 |page=295 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-7007-1197-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LoNl7ZRO70C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDriem2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Language diversity endangered |volume=181 |series=Trends in linguistics: Studies and monographs, Mouton Reader |authorlink=George van Driem |last=van Driem |first=George |page=312 |editor=Matthias Brenzinger |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2007 |isbn=3-11-017050-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p6b5GQ4Q4YC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|300px|L-system trees form realistic models of natural patterns]]

An '''L-system''' or '''Lindenmayer system''' is a parallel [[rewriting system]] and a type of [[formal grammar]]. An L-system consists of an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be used to make [[string (computer science)|string]]s, a collection of [[Production (computer science)|production rules]] that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "[[axiom]]" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by [[Aristid Lindenmayer]], a Hungarian theoretical [[biologist]] and [[botanist]] at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]]. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of [[plant development]]. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Rozenberg and Arto Salomaa. The mathematical theory of L systems (Academic Press, New York, 1980). {{ISBN|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to generate self-similar [[fractal]]s.

==Origins==
[[File:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|300px|'Weeds', generated using an L-system in 3D.]]
As a biologist, Lindenmayer worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of [[bacteria]], such as the cyanobacteria ''[[Anabaena|Anabaena catenula]]''. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.

==L-system structure==
The [[recursion|recursive]] nature of the L-system rules leads to [[self-similarity]] and thereby, [[fractal]]-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system.   Plant models and natural-looking organic forms are easy to define, as by increasing the recursion level the form slowly 'grows' and becomes more complex. Lindenmayer systems are also popular in the generation of [[artificial life]].

L-system grammars are very similar to the [[semi-Thue grammar]] (see [[Chomsky hierarchy]]).  L-systems are now commonly known as ''parametric'' L systems, defined as a [[tuple]]

:'''G''' = (''V'', ω, ''P''),

where

* '''V''' (the ''alphabet'') is a set of symbols containing both elements that can be replaced (''variables'') and those which cannot be replaced ("constants" or "terminals")
* '''ω''' (''start'', ''axiom'' or ''initiator'') is a string of symbols from '''V''' defining the initial state of the system
* '''P''' is a set of ''[[Production (computer science)|production rules]]'' or ''productions'' defining the way variables can be replaced with combinations of constants and other variables. A production consists of two strings, the ''predecessor'' and the ''successor''. For any symbol A which is a member of the set V which does not appear on the left hand side of a production in P, the identity production A → A is assumed; these symbols are called ''constants'' or ''terminals''. (See [[Law of identity]]).

The rules of the L-system grammar are applied iteratively starting from the initial state. As many rules as possible are applied simultaneously, per iteration. The fact that each iteration employs as many rules as possible differentiates an L-system from a [[formal language]] generated by a [[formal grammar]], which applies only one rule per iteration. If the production rules were to be applied only one at a time, one would quite simply generate a language, rather than an L-system. {{clarify|reason=I would like to see some more clarification among the terms "L-system," "formal language," and "formal grammar." I understand that the logical difference between L-systems and a formal grammar is whether they use as many rules as possible per iteration or not, but I'm not exactly sure what the ramifications are from this statement. This is not my field to be able to explain. |date=December 2015}}Thus, L-systems are strict subsets of languages.{{clarify|reason=Are L-system languages or not? The last sentence state that they are, while the sentence just before seems to differentiate between languages and L-systems.|date=January 2014}}

An L-system is ''context-free'' if each production rule refers only to an individual symbol and not to its neighbours. Context-free L-systems are thus specified by a [[context-free grammar]]. If a rule depends not only on a single symbol but also on its neighbours, it is termed a ''context-sensitive'' L-system.

If there is exactly one production for each symbol, then the L-system is said to be ''deterministic'' (a deterministic context-free L-system is popularly called a ''[[D0L system]]''). If there are several, and each is chosen with a certain probability during each iteration, then it is a ''stochastic'' L-system.

Using L-systems for generating graphical images requires that the symbols in the model refer to elements of a drawing on the computer screen. For example, the program ''[[Fractint]]'' uses [[turtle graphics]] (similar to those in the [[Logo programming language]]) to produce screen images. It interprets each constant in an L-system model as a turtle command.

==Examples of L-systems==

===Example 1: Algae===
Lindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of algae.

:'''variables''' :   A B
:'''constants''' :   none
:'''axiom'''     :   A
:'''rules'''     :   (A → AB), (B → A)

which produces:

:     ''n'' = 0 : A
:     ''n'' = 1 : AB
:     ''n'' = 2 : ABA
:     ''n'' = 3 : ABAAB
:     ''n'' = 4 : ABAABABA
:     ''n'' = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB
:     ''n'' = 6 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABA
:     ''n'' = 7 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABAABAABABAABAAB

==== Example 1: Algae, explained ====
 n=0:         A           start (axiom/initiator)
             / \
 n=1:       A   B         the initial single A spawned into AB by rule (A → AB), rule (B → A) couldn't be applied
           /|    \
 n=2:     A B     A       former string AB with all rules applied, A spawned into AB again, former B turned into A
         /| |     |\
 n=3:   A B A     A B     note all A's producing a copy of themselves in the first place, then a B, which turns ...
       /| | |\    |\ \
 n=4: A B A A B   A B A   ... into an A one generation later, starting to spawn/repeat/recurse then

The result is the sequence of [[Fibonacci word#The_Fibonacci_words|Fibonacci words]]. If we count the length of each string, we obtain the famous [[Fibonacci sequence]] of numbers (skipping the first 1, due to our choice of axiom):

:    1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55 89 ...

For each string, if we count the ''k''-th position from the left end of the string, the value is determined by whether a multiple of the [[golden ratio]] falls within the interval &lt;math&gt;(k-1, k)&lt;/math&gt;.  The ratio of A to B likewise converges to the golden mean.

This example yields the same result (in terms of the length of each string, not the sequence of ''A''s and ''B''s) if the rule (''A'' → ''AB'') is replaced with (''A'' → ''BA''), except that the strings are mirrored.

This sequence is a [[locally catenative sequence]] because &lt;math&gt;G(n)=G(n-1)G(n-2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th generation.

===Example 2: Fractal (binary) tree===
* '''variables''' : 0, 1
* '''constants''': [, ]
* '''axiom'''  : 0
* '''rules'''  : (1 → 11), (0 → 1[0]0)

The shape is built by [[recursion|recursively]] feeding the axiom through the production rules. Each character of the input string is checked against the rule list to determine which character or string to replace it with in the output string. In this example, a '1' in the input string becomes '11' in the output string, while '&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;' remains the same. Applying this to the axiom of '0', we get:

{|
|-
| axiom: || 0
|-
| 1st recursion: || 1&lt;nowiki&gt;[0]&lt;/nowiki&gt;0
|-
| 2nd recursion: || &lt;nowiki&gt;11[1[0]0]1[0]0&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| 3rd recursion: || &lt;nowiki&gt;1111[11[1[0]0]1[0]0]11[1[0]0]1[0]0&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| …
|}

We can see that this string quickly grows in size and complexity. This string can be drawn as an image by using [[turtle graphics]], where each symbol is assigned a graphical operation for the turtle to perform. For example, in the sample above, the turtle may be given the following instructions:

* 0: draw a [[line segment]] ending in a leaf
* 1: draw a line segment
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;: push position and angle, turn left 45 degrees
* &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: pop position and angle, turn right 45 degrees

The push and pop refer to a [[LIFO (computing)|LIFO]] stack (more technical grammar would have separate symbols for "push position" and "turn left"). When the turtle interpretation encounters a '&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;', the current position and angle are saved, and are then restored when the interpretation encounters a '&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'. If multiple values have been "pushed," then a "pop" restores the most recently saved values. Applying the graphical rules listed above to the earlier recursion, we get:

===Example 3: Cantor set===
[[File:Cantor set in seven iterations.svg|450px|right]]
:     '''variables''' :   A B
:     '''constants''' :   none
:     '''start'''     :   A   {starting character string}
:     '''rules'''     :   (A → ABA), (B → BBB)

Let ''A'' mean "draw forward" and ''B'' mean "move forward".

This produces the famous [[Cantor set|Cantor's fractal set]] on a real straight line '''R'''.

===Example 4: Koch curve===
A variant of the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]] which uses only right angles.

: '''constants''' :   + &amp;minus;
: '''start'''     :   F
: '''rules'''     :   (F → F+F&amp;minus;F&amp;minus;F+F)

Here, F means "draw forward", + means "turn left 90°", and &amp;minus; means "turn right 90°" (see [[turtle graphics]]).

===Example 5: Sierpinski triangle===
The [[Sierpinski triangle]] drawn using an L-system.

:     '''variables''' :   F G
:     '''constants''' :   + &amp;minus;
:     '''start'''     :   F&amp;minus;G&amp;minus;G
:     '''rules'''     :   (F → F&amp;minus;G+F+G&amp;minus;F), (G → GG)
:     '''angle'''     :   120°

Here, F and G both mean "draw forward", + means "turn left by angle", and &amp;minus; means "turn right by angle".

File:Sierpinski Triangle (from L-System, 4 iterations).png|n = 4
File:Sierpinski Triangle (from L-System, 6 iterations).png|n = 6
&lt;/gallery&gt;

It is also possible to approximate the [[Sierpinski triangle]] using a [[Sierpiński arrowhead curve]] L-system.

:     '''variables''' :   A B
:     '''constants''' :   + &amp;minus;
:     '''start'''     :   A
:     '''rules'''     :   (A → B&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B), (B → A+B+A)
:     '''angle'''     :   60°

Here, A and B both mean "draw forward", + means "turn left by angle", and &amp;minus; means "turn right by angle" (see [[turtle graphics]]).

===Example 6: Dragon curve ===
The [[dragon curve]] drawn using an L-system.

:     '''variables''' :   X Y
:     '''constants''' :   F + −
:     '''start'''     :   FX
:     '''rules'''     :   (X → X+YF+), (Y → −FX−Y)
:     '''angle'''     :   90°

Here, F means "draw forward", − means "turn left 90°", and + means "turn right 90°". X and Y do not correspond to any drawing action and are only used to control the evolution of the curve.

===Example 7: Fractal plant ===
{{see also|Barnsley fern}}

:     '''variables''' :   X F
:     '''constants''' :   + &amp;minus; [ ]
:     '''start'''     :   X
:     '''rules'''     :   (X → F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X), (F → FF)
:     '''angle'''     :   25°

Here, F means "draw forward", − means "turn left 25°", and + means "turn right 25°". X does not correspond to any drawing action and is used to control the evolution of the curve. The square bracket "[" corresponds to saving the current values for position and angle, which are restored when the corresponding "]" is executed.

==Variations==
A number of elaborations on this basic L-system technique have been developed which can be used in conjunction with each other. Among these are [[stochastic grammar]]s, [[context sensitive grammar]]s, and parametric grammars.

===Stochastic grammars===
The grammar model we have discussed thus far has been deterministic—that is, given any symbol in the grammar's alphabet, there has been exactly one production rule, which is always chosen, and always performs the same conversion. One alternative is to specify more than one production rule for a symbol, giving each a [[probability]] of occurring. For example, in the grammar of Example 2, we could change the rule for rewriting "0" from:

:0 → 1[0]0

to a probabilistic rule:

:0 (0.5) → 1[0]0
:0 (0.5) → 0

Under this production, whenever a "0" is encountered during string rewriting, there would be a 50% chance it would behave as previously described, and a 50% chance it would not change during production. When a stochastic grammar is used in an [[evolution]]ary context, it is advisable to incorporate a [[random]] seed into the [[genotype]], so that the stochastic properties of the image remain constant between generations.

===Context sensitive grammars===
A context sensitive production rule looks not only at the symbol it is modifying, but the symbols on the string appearing before and after it. For instance, the production rule:

:b &lt; a &gt; c → aa

transforms "a" to "aa", but only If the "a" occurs between a "b" and a "c" in the input string:

:…bac…

As with stochastic productions, there are multiple productions to handle symbols in different contexts. If no production rule can be found for a given context, the identity production is assumed, and the symbol does not change on transformation. If context-sensitive and context-free productions both exist within the same grammar, the context-sensitive production is assumed to take precedence when it is applicable.

===Parametric grammars===
In a parametric grammar, each symbol in the alphabet has a parameter list associated with it. A symbol coupled with its parameter list is called a module, and a string in a parametric grammar is a series of modules. An example string might be:

:a(0,1)[b(0,0)]a(1,2)

The parameters can be used by the drawing functions, and also by the production rules. The production rules can use the parameters in two ways: first, in a conditional statement determining whether the rule will apply, and second, the production rule can modify the actual parameters. For example, look at:

:a(x,y) : x == 0 → a(1, y+1)b(2,3)

The module a(x,y) undergoes transformation under this production rule if the conditional x=0 is met. For example, a(0,2) would undergo transformation, and a(1,2) would not.

In the transformation portion of the production rule, the parameters as well as entire modules can be affected. In the above example, the module b(x,y) is added to the string, with initial parameters (2,3). Also, the parameters of the already existing module are transformed. Under the above production rule,

:a(0,2)

Becomes

:a(1,3)b(2,3)

as the "x" parameter of a(x,y) is explicitly transformed to a "1" and the "y" parameter of a is incremented by one.

Parametric grammars allow line lengths and branching angles to be determined by the grammar, rather than the turtle interpretation methods. Also, if age is given as a parameter for a module, rules can change depending on the age of a plant segment, allowing animations of the entire life-cycle of the tree to be created.

===Bi-directional grammars===
The bi-directional model explicitly separates the symbolic rewriting system from the shape assignment. For example, the string rewriting process in the Example 2 (Fractal tree) is independent on how graphical operations are assigned to the symbols. In other words, an infinite number of draw methods are applicable to a given rewriting system.

The bi-directional model consists of 1) a forward process constructs the derivation tree with production rules, and 2) a backward process realizes the tree with shapes in a stepwise manner (from leaves to the root). Each inverse-derivation step involves essential geometric-topological reasoning. With this bi-directional framework, design constraints and objectives are encoded in the grammar-shape translation. In architectural design applications, the bi-directional grammar features consistent interior connectivity and a rich spatial hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Hua, H., 2017, December. A Bi‐Directional Procedural Model for Architectural Design. In Computer Graphics Forum (Vol. 36, No. 8, pp. 219-231).&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:The Bangui City.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Signs in French in Bangui]]
The '''[[official language]]s''' of the '''[[Central African Republic]]''' are [[French language|French]]  and [[Sangho]]. In total there are about 72 languages in the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CF&lt;/ref&gt;

In the CAR, French is the language of writing and formal situations. In 2005 it was estimated that 22.5% of the population could speak French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://20mars.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/FICHE_03_Nombre_de_francophones.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120012438/http://20mars.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/FICHE_03_Nombre_de_francophones.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sangho has about 350,000 native speakers. It has become the lingua franca of the country. It became a national language in 1963 and an official language (alongside French) in 1991. It is estimated that 92% of the CAR's population is able to speak Sangho. The language has become the mother tongue of almost all children in Bangui.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Nearly all of the native languages of the CAR belong to the [[Ubangian languages]]. There are a few [[Bantu languages]] in the extreme south, along the border with [[Congo-Brazzaville]], and several [[Bongo–Bagirmi languages]] in the north, near the border with [[Chad]]. In addition, there is a [[Luo languages|Luo language]], [[Runga language|Runga]]. 

Education for the deaf in CAR uses [[American Sign Language]], introduced by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]].

'''Marcan priority''', the hypothesis that the [[Gospel of Mark]] was the first-written of the three [[Synoptic Gospels]] and was used as a source by the other two ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) is a central element in discussion of the [[synoptic problem]] &amp;ndash; the question of the documentary relationship among these three Gospels.

Most scholars since the late nineteenth century have accepted the concept of Marcan priority. It forms the foundation for the widely accepted [[two-source theory]], although a number of scholars support different forms of Marcan priority or reject it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~rege0695/tuckett.pdf |title=The current state of the Synoptic Problem |year=2008 |conference=Oxford Conference on the Synoptic Problem |last=Tuckett |first=Christopher M. |authorlink=Christopher M.

==History==

[[File:H Leibnitz - Theophil (Gottlob) Christian Storr (1844).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gottlob Christian Storr.]]

The tradition handed down by the [[Church Fathers]] regarded Matthew as the first Gospel written.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=16–17}} This view of Gospel origins, however, began to be challenged in the late 18th century, when [[Gottlob Christian Storr]] proposed in 1786 that Mark was the first to be written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4dAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 | title=Über den Zweck der evangelischen Geschichte und der Briefe Johannis | last=Storr | first=Gottlob Christian | authorlink=Gottlob Christian Storr | year=1786 | pages=274 ff. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History and Critique of the Origin of the Marcan Hypothesis, 1835–1866 | last=Meyboom | first=Hajo Uden | authorlink=:nl:Hajo Uden Meyboom | year=1993 | page=xviii | isbn=0865544077 | editor-last=Kiwiet | editor-first=John J. | series=New Gospel Studies | volume=8 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storr's idea met with little acceptance at first, with most scholars favoring either [[Matthaean priority (disambiguation)|Matthaean priority]], under the traditional [[Augustinian hypothesis]] or the [[Griesbach hypothesis]], or a fragmentary theory (according to which, stories about Jesus were recorded in several smaller documents and notebooks and combined by the evangelists to create the Synoptic Gospels). Working within the fragmentary theory, [[Karl Lachmann]] in 1835 compared the Synoptic Gospels in pairs and noted that, while Matthew frequently agreed with Mark against Luke in the order of passages and Luke agreed frequently with Mark against Matthew, Matthew and Luke rarely agreed with each other against Mark. Lachmann inferred from this that Mark best preserved a relatively fixed order of episodes in Jesus's ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzENAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA570 | title=De ordine narrationum in evangeliis synopticis | authorlink=Karl Lachmann | year=1835 | pages=570–590 | work=Theologische Studien und Kritiken | volume=8 | last=Lachmann | first=Karl | ref=harv}} English translation, {{cite journal | title=Lachmann's Argument | journal=New Testament Studies | year=1967 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=368–378 | doi=10.1017/S0028688500018373 | last=Palmer | first=N.

Humphrey | chapter=Lachmann's Argument | chapter-url=http://www.tonyburke.ca/wp-content/uploads/Lachmann.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, two theologians, [[Christian Gottlob Wilke]] and [[Christian Hermann Weisse]], independently extended Lachmann's reasoning to conclude that Mark not only best represented Matthew and Luke's source but also that Mark was Matthew and Luke's source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVssAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Der Urevangelist oder exegetisch kritische Untersuchung über das Verwandtschaftsverhältniß der drei ersten Evangelien | authorlink=Christian Gottlob Wilke | year=1838 | last=Wilke | first=Christian Gottlob | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e8hPAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Die evangelische Geschichte kritisch und philosophisch bearbeitet | authorlink=Christian Hermann Weisse | year=1838 | last=Weisse | first=Christian Hermann | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideas were not immediately accepted, but [[Heinrich Julius Holtzmann|Heinrich Julius Holtzmann's]] endorsement in 1863 of a qualified form of Marcan priority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9-7DKdxrKgC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Die synoptischen Evangelien, ihr Ursprung und geschichtlicher Charakter | authorlink=Heinrich Julius Holtzmann | year=1863 | last=Holtzmann | first=Heinrich Julius | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; won general favor.

There was much debate at the time over whether Matthew and Luke used Mark itself or some Proto-Mark (Ur-Mark).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/09/two-source-hypothesis.html#Storr%201786 | title=Synoptic Problem Website: Two-Source Hypothesis | year=2004 | accessdate=2013-12-21 | last=Carlson | first=Stephen C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 J. C. Hawkins took up the question with a careful statistical analysis and argued for Marcan priority without Proto-Mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFMsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Horae Synopticae: Contributions to the Study of the Synoptic Problem | year=1899 | last=Hawkins | first=John Caesar | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other British scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029338484 | title=The Gospel History and Its Transmission | authorlink=Francis Crawford Burkitt | year=1907 | last=Burkitt | first=Francis Crawford | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins, Treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, &amp; Dates | authorlink=Burnett Hillman Streeter | year=1924 | last=Streeter | first=Burnett Hillman | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon followed to strengthen the argument, which then received wide acceptance.

Many scholars in the twentieth century regarded Marcan priority as no longer just a hypothesis, but an established fact.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|p=10}} Still, fresh challenges from [[Basil Christopher Butler|B. C. Butler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSAXv-ffK9wC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Originality of St Matthew: A Critique of the Two-Document Hypothesis | authorlink=Basil Christopher Butler | year=1951 | isbn=0521233038 | last=Butler | first=Basil Christopher | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:William R. Farmer|William R. Farmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdQqF-9hZ00C&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Synoptic Problem: A Critical Review of the Problem of Literary Relationships Between Matthew, Mark and Luke | year=1964 | last=Farmer | first=William Reuben | ref=harv| isbn=9780915948024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proved influential in reviving the rival hypothesis of Matthaean priority, and recent decades have seen scholars less certain about Marcan priority and more eager to explore all the alternatives.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|p=10}}

==Dependent theories==

[[File:Synoptic Theory Mk-Q en.svg|203px|frame|right|The '''[[two-source theory]]''', one of several built upon Marcan priority, holds that a hypothetical document [[Q source|Q]] was also used as a source by Matthew and Luke independently.]]

If Marcan priority is accepted, the next logical question is how to explain the extensive material, some two hundred verses, shared between Matthew and Luke but not found at all in Mark—the ''[[Synoptic Gospels#The double tradition|double tradition]]''. Furthermore, there are hundreds of instances where Matthew and Luke parallel Mark's account but agree against Mark in minor differences—the ''minor agreements''. Different answers to this question give rise to different synoptic theories.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=107–108}}

* The most widely accepted theory is the [[two-source theory]], that Matthew and Luke each independently drew from both Mark and another hypothetical source, which scholars have termed ''[[Q source|Q]]''. This Q, then, was the origin of the double tradition material, and many of the minor agreements are instances where both Matthew and Luke followed Q's version of a passage rather than Mark's.
* The foremost alternative theory under Marcan priority is the [[Farrer theory]], in which Luke has drawn directly from not only Mark but also Matthew. The double tradition is then simply portions of Matthew that Luke chose to repeat, so there is no need for Q.
* A hybrid of these two theories is the [[three-source theory]], which posits three sources for Luke: Mark, Q, and Matthew.
* The [[Wilke theory]] is similar to the Farrer theory but has Matthew using Luke as a source (thus, Matthaean posteriority), rather than vice versa. It has attracted just a few modern proponents.
* A final theory holds that Matthew and Luke have no literary relationship beyond their dependence on Mark, but rather each supplemented the triple tradition with oral sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Words of Jesus and the Future of the ‘Q’ Hypothesis | last=Rosché | first=Theodore R. | journal=Journal of Biblical Literature | year=1960 | volume=79 | issue=3 | pages=210–220 | jstor=3263927 | doi=10.2307/3263927 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite journal | url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/q_linnemann.pdf | title=The Lost Gospel Of Q—Fact Or Fantasy? | last=Linnemann | first=Eta | journal=Trinity Journal | year=1996 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=3–18 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these oral sources overlapped with each other, the double tradition arose, and where they overlapped also with Mark, minor agreements arose. This theory, with few supporters, is usually viewed as a variation on the two-source theory, where Q is not a document but a body of oral material, and thus called the [[Q source|oral Q theory]].

==Alternatives==

[[File:Synoptic Theory Mt-Lk en.svg|203px|right|frame|The [[Griesbach theory|Two-Gospel (Griesbach) theory]], a prominent alternative to Marcan priority, holds that Mark used Matthew and Luke as sources.]]

The most prominent challenger to Marcan priority is [[Marcan posteriority]],{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|p=15}} which holds that Mark used both Matthew and Luke as a source. This hypothesis is most associated with the [[Griesbach theory|Two-Gospel (Griesbach) theory]], which further posits [[Matthaean priority (dismabiguation)|Matthaean priority]] (thus, in order, Matthew—Luke—Mark). This view envisions a Mark who mostly collected the common material shared between Matthew and Luke.

Matthaean priority is also a feature of the [[Augustinian theory]], which differs by placing Mark in the middle (thus, the order Matthew—Mark—Luke).

[[Lucan priority]] has been revived in recent decades in the complex form of the [[Jerusalem school theory]], which also places Mark in the middle. Here, Mark uses Luke, then Matthew uses Mark but not Luke, while all three Synoptics draw from a hypothetical Greek translation of an earlier Hebrew work.

Some theories deny literary priority to any one of the Synoptic Gospels, asserting that, whatever their chronological order of composition, none of them draws from any of the others. The [[multi-source theory]] has each synoptic gospel combining a distinct mix of earlier documents, while the [[independence theory]] denies any documentary relationship and regards each gospel as an original composition utilizing oral sources only.

Some variations on Marcan priority propose an additional revision of Mark—a ''Proto-Mark'' (''Ur-Mark'') if earlier than the canonical Gospel, or a ''Deutero-Mark'' if later—serving as a source for Matthew and/or Luke.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=23–26}}

==Evidence==

Arguments for Marcan priority are usually made in contrast to its main rival, Matthaean priority, bringing into focus the question of whether Matthew was a source for Mark or vice versa. The evidence supporting Marcan priority is entirely internal.

Many lines of evidence point to Mark having some sort of special place in the relationship among the Synoptics, as the "middle term" between Matthew and Luke.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=54–55}} But this could mean that Mark is the common source of the other two (''priority''), or that it derives from both (''posteriority''), or even that it is an intermediary in transmission from one to the other—in other words, many such arguments can support both Marcan priority and its rivals.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=10–11}} Famously, the so-called "Lachmann fallacy", concerning the order of pericopae in Mark, was once used to argue for Marcan priority but is now seen as a largely neutral observation.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=10–11}}

Modern arguments for or against Marcan priority tend to center on redactional plausibility, asking, for example, whether it is more reasonable that Matthew and Luke could have written as they did with Mark in hand, or that Mark could have written as he did with Matthew and Luke in hand, and whether any coherent rationale can be discerned underlying the redactional activity of the later evangelists.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=11–12}}

It should also be remembered, where matters of detailed wording are concerned, that there is some uncertainty in the Gospel texts themselves, as [[textual criticism]] of the gospels is still an active field, which cannot even decide, for example, on [[Mark 16|Mark's original ending]]. Such issues often intersect with the synoptic problem; for example, Streeter famously dismissed many of the "minor agreements" so troublesome for the [[two-source theory]] by appealing to textual corruption driven typically by harmonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=New Studies in the Synoptic Problem: Oxford Conference, April 2008 | year=2011 | editor1-last=Foster | editor1-first=Paul | editor2-last=Gregory | editor2-first=Andrew | editor3-last=Kloppenborg | editor3-first=John S. | editor4-last=Verheyden | editor4-first=Joseph | display-editors=1 | pages=115–156 | series=Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium | volume=239 | isbn=9042924012 | chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/3633524/ | chapter=Textual Criticism and the Synoptic Problem | last=Head | first=Peter M. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcan style===

Mark's style of Greek is unique among the Gospels. Some scholars have argued that Mark's style is unsophisticated and unrefined or awkward. But others find Mark's Greek very dense and detailed. Mark is full of Latinisms, in idioms and vocabulary. Mark tends to conjoin verbs and sentences with ''{{lang|grc|καὶ}}'' (''and''); in fact, more than half the verses in Mark begin with ''{{lang|grc|καὶ}}''. Mark is notably fond of ''{{lang|grc|εὐθὺς}}'' (''immediately'') and ''{{lang|grc|πάλιν}}'' (''again''), frequently uses dual expressions, and often prefers the [[historical present]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmP5-Jp8VzsC&amp;pg=PA23 | title=Mark: A Commentary | year=2006 | pages=23–24 | isbn=0664221076 | last=Boring | first=M. Eugene | series=New Testament Library: Commentary Series | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, then, Mark's style is not so much literary as thoroughly colloquial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZzxrFs02qEC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Progressive Publication of Matthew: An Explanation of the Writing of the Synoptic Gospels | year=2010 | pages=90–93 | isbn=0805448489 | last=Powers | first=B. Ward | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|p=62}}

The parallel passages in Matthew and especially in Luke tend to be in a more polished and eloquent style of literary Greek. Where Mark uses an unusual word or expression, Matthew and Luke often substitute something more natural. Though they often add material of substance, they tend to trim down Mark's redundancies and verbosity and express his meaning more concisely.

Supporters of Marcan priority see this as Matthew and Luke improving the style of the material they incorporate from Mark. Supporters of Marcan posteriority, however, see Mark as recasting material from Matthew and Luke in his own peculiar style, less like lofty literature and more in a vivid, fast-moving style befitting oral preaching.

===Content not present in Mark===

Mark's gospel is by far the shortest, just over half the length of Luke, and omits much found in Matthew and Luke. In fact, while the majority of Mark is included in the other two Synoptics, the additional material shared between Matthew and Luke only is quite extensive.

While Marcan priority easily sees Matthew and Luke building upon Mark by adding new material, Marcan posteriority must explain some surprising omissions. Mark has no [[Nativity of Jesus#Canonical gospels|infancy narrative]] nor any version of the [[Lord's Prayer]], for example.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=57–58}}

Nor does Mark have more than a handful of unique [[pericopes]]. This is expected under Marcan priority, where Matthew has reused nearly everything he found in Mark, but if Mark wrote last, it is harder to explain why he adds so little new material.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=61–62}}

But Mark's selection of material must be explained in either case, unless we are to believe that Mark knew nothing more about Jesus than what he wrote. Bauckham argues that Mark's content is limited to what Peter himself had witnessed, or at least learned from trusted associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony | last=Bauckham | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Bauckham | year=2006 | pages=114–116 | isbn=0802831621 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powers argues that Mark's purpose is fundamentally [[kerygma]]tic, needing to hold the attention of outsiders hearing the Gospel preached for the first time, so he focused on who Jesus was and what he did, eschewing the sort of lengthy teachings that dominate the [[Synoptic Gospels#The double tradition|double tradition]] and most of [[Synoptic Gospels#Special Matthew and Special Luke|Special Matthew]].{{sfnp|Powers|2010|pp=55–93}} So, with Mark's selection process better understood, his omissions per se are no longer viewed as such compelling evidence for Marcan priority.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=57–58}}

===Content found only in Mark===

There are very few passages in Mark with no parallel in either Matthew or Luke, which makes them all the more significant:{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=59–61}}
* [[Parable of the Growing Seed|The parable of the growing seed]]{{bibleref2c|Mk|4:26–29|!}}
* [[healing the deaf mute of Decapolis|The healing of the deaf mute of Decapolis]]{{bibleref2c|Mk|7:31–37|!}}
* [[healing the blind man of Bethsaida|The healing of the blind man of Bethsaida]]{{bibleref2c|Mk|8:22–26|!}}
* [[naked fugitive|The naked fugitive]]{{bibleref2c|Mk|14:51–52|!}}

If Mark is drawn from Matthew and Luke, it is hard to see why he would add so little material, if he were going to add anything at all, and the choice of additions is also rather strange. On the other hand, if Mark wrote first, it is easier to see why Matthew and Luke would omit these passages. These two healings are the only ones in the Synoptics involving the use of saliva (but cf. the [[healing of the man born blind]] in {{bibleref2|John|9|!}}), and the naked runaway is an obscure incident with no obvious meaning or purpose.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=59–61}}

But this does not tell the whole story, for altogether Mark has (depending on the method of counting) about 155 verses included in neither Matthew nor Luke—nearly a quarter of his entire Gospel.{{sfnp|Powers|2010|pp=102–111}} Most of these are details omitted in the parallel passages, rather than distinct [[pericopes]]. In fact, apart from sayings material, nearly every pericope in Mark is longer than its parallels in Matthew and Luke.{{sfnp|Powers|2010|pp=135–138}} An illustrative example is the [[calming the storm|calming of the storm]]:&lt;ref&gt;For color-coded synopsis in Greek and English, see {{cite web | url=http://www.textexcavation.com/syncalmingsea.html | title=The calming of the sea (or lake) | work=TextExcavation | accessdate=2013-12-29 | year=2009 | last=Smith | first=Ben C. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Mark's unique details tend to be, by necessity, non-essential ones. Marcan priority sees Matthew and Luke trimming away trivial narrative details in favor of the extensive material they wished to add elsewhere. But under Marcan posteriority, Mark must have added these many details to make his stories more vivid and clear. In either case, Mark must have had an independent source (traditionally, Peter) spanning nearly his entire Gospel; but if so, Marcan posteriority requires a complex and skillful weaving together of this source with both Matthew and Luke, even within individual sentences, which would have been a challenging task.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=20–21}}

===Hard readings===

Often the differences in Mark from the parallels in Matthew and Luke are "hard readings", which seem to portray Jesus or the apostles in a negative light or in ways that a later redactor would likely find uncongenial. Marcan priority argues that these hard readings were more likely original to Mark and then smoothed out or omitted when Matthew and Luke encountered them, rather than added by Mark to accounts lacking them.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=65–67, 89–90}}

Notable hard readings unique to Mark include:
* "He was ''not able'' to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. And he ''was amazed'' because of their unbelief." ({{bibleref2|Mk 6:5–6||!}}), vs. "He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief." ({{bibleref2|Mt 13:58||!}}).
* Jesus "healed ''many'' who were sick" ({{bibleref2|Mk 1:34||!}}), vs. "''all'' who were sick" ({{bibleref2|Mt 8:16; Lk 4:40||!}}).
* "When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, ‘He is out of his mind.’" ({{bibleref2|Mk 3:21||!}} uniquely).
* In the storm at sea, the disciples ask, "''Don't you care'' that we are about to die?" ({{bibleref2|Mk 4:38||!}}), vs. "We are about to die!" ({{bibleref2|Mt 8:25; Lk 8:24||!}}). Jesus replies, "Do you still ''have no faith''?" ({{bibleref2|Mk 4:40||!}}), vs. "ye of little faith" ({{bibleref2|Mt 8:26||!}}) or "Where is your faith?" ({{bibleref2|Lk 8:25||!}}).
* The disciples' "hearts were hardened" ({{bibleref2|Mk 6:52, 8:17–18||!}} uniquely).
* James and John ask to sit beside Jesus in his kingdom ({{bibleref2|Mk 10:35||!}}), vs. their mother making the request ({{bibleref2|Mt 20:20||!}}).
*A hungry Jesus curses a fig tree for lacking fruit ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A12-14&amp;version=NIV Mk 11:12-14]). One scholar notes this not only appears self-serving, but also irrational, as Mark adds that "it was not the season for figs." In contrast, Matthew ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A18-22&amp;version=NIV Mt 21:18-22]) interprets the incident as a miracle that shows the power of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~rltroxel/gospels/lect4.pdf|title=Early Christian Gospels, Lecture 4: Markan Priority|last=Troxel|first=Ronald L.|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcan posteriority faces the harder task of accounting for these as Marcan changes, but does so by appealing to Mark's fondness for vivid detail and for starkly contrasting Jesus' teachings with the attitudes of those around him.

===Order===

Comparing the sequential order of parallel pericopes among the three Synoptics, the arrangement often varies, but some general patterns emerge. Mark nearly always follows Matthew and Luke where they agree in order and one or the other when they disagree. On the other hand, the [[Synoptic Gospels#The double tradition|double tradition]] pericopae shared between Matthew and Luke show little agreement in order.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=37–42}}

Such observations have been studied in detail for centuries, but the difficulty has been in how to interpret them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMg7LRMd4LsC&amp;pg=PA223 | title=Arguments from Order in Synoptic Source Criticism: A History and Critique | series=New Gospel Studies | volume=7 | year=1994 | pages=223–238 | isbn=0865543992 | last=Neville | first=David J. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcan priority views this order as support for Matthew and Luke each building upon Mark; Marcan posteriority, however, sees this order as proof that Mark drew alternately from Matthew and Luke. Even the [[Augustinian hypothesis]] can see Mark adapting Matthew's order, then Luke adapting Mark's order.

===Dualisms===

Mark displays a special fondness for "dualisms" of various kinds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Neirynck | first=Frans | title=Duality in Mark: Contributions to the Study of the Marcan Redaction | year=1988 | isbn=9061862795 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which is repeating essentially the same thing in two adjacent phrases. In a majority of cases, the parallel passages in Matthew and Luke, if any, echo only one of the two, and it often happens that Matthew chooses one and Luke chooses the other.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Riley | first=Harold | title=The Making of Mark: An Exploration | year=1989 | isbn=0865543593 | pages=219–227 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSkupTd-J-IC&amp;pg=PA219 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite journal | title=Marc, première harmonie évangélique? | journal=Revue Biblique Jérusalem | year=1983 | volume=90 | issue=1 | pages=23–79 | last=Rolland | first=Philippe | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent examples:

* "When it was evening, after sunset"{{bibleref2c|Mk|1:32|NET}}
: "When it was evening"{{bibleref2c|Mt|8:16|NET}} + "As the sun was setting"{{bibleref2c|Lk|4:40|NET}}

: "As Jesus approached Jericho"{{bibleref2c|Lk|18:35|NET}} + "As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed them"{{bibleref2c|Mt|20:29|NET}}

* "were seeking how to seize him by stealth and kill him"{{bibleref2c|Mk|14:1|NASB}}
: "were seeking how they might put him to death"{{bibleref2c|Lk|22:2|NASB}} + "conspired to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him"{{bibleref2c|Mt|26:4|NASB}}
* "Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed"{{bibleref2c|Mk|14:12|NET}}
: "Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread"{{bibleref2c|Mt|26:17|NET}} + "Then came the day for the feast of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed"{{bibleref2c|Lk|22:7|NET}}
* "today, on this night"{{bibleref2c|Mk|14:30|NASB}}
: "today"{{bibleref2c|Lk|22:34|NASB}} + "this very night"{{bibleref2c|Mt|26:34|NASB}}
* "Now when evening had already come, since it was the day of preparation" (that is, the day before the Sabbath){{bibleref2c|Mk|15:42|NET}}
: "Now when it was evening"{{bibleref2c|Mt|27:57|NET}} + "It was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was beginning"{{bibleref2c|Lk|23:54|NET}}

Supporters of Marcan posteriority advance these as clear cases of Mark conflating the parallel accounts from Matthew and Luke. Supporters of Marcan priority, on the other hand, point to a larger number of instances where both Matthew and Luke have chosen the same half of a Marcan dualism and argue that, when each gospel trimmed down these redundant expressions, sometimes by chance Matthew and Luke made opposite choices. It is hard to judge, though, as the choice can seldom be seen as an arbitrary one.

Riley observes when Matthew has one or both halves of a Marcan dualism, it usually occurs where Matthew and Mark are following the same sequence; when Luke has one or both halves of a Marcan dualism, it ''always'' occurs where Luke and Mark are following the same sequence. This is expected under Marcan posteriority, assuming the Marcan account can more easily refer to Matthew from memory, but more difficult to explain under Marcan priority.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

===Editorial fatigue===

Goodacre lists a number of occasions where it appears that Matthew or Luke begin by altering Mark, but become fatigued and lapse into copying Mark directly, even when doing so is inconsistent with the changes they have already made.&lt;ref name="fatigue"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0028688500016349 |title=Fatigue in the Synoptics |year=1998 |last1=Goodacre |first1=Mark |journal=New Testament Studies |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |url=http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/fatigue.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=71–76}}

For example, Matthew is more precise than Mark in the titles he gives to rulers, and initially gives [[Herod Antipas]] the correct title of "tetrarch"{{bibleref2c|Mt|14:1|!}}, yet he lapses into calling him "king"{{bibleref2c|Mt|14:9|!}} at a later verse, apparently because he was copying Mark{{bibleref2c|Mk|6:26|!}} at that point.

Another example is Luke's version of the [[Parable of the Sower]], regarding the seed sown on rocky ground{{bibleref2c|Mk 4:5–6, 16–17; Lk 8:6, 13||!}}, where Luke omits several elements of the parable, but then follows Mark in the parable's interpretation. Luke says merely that the seed withered for lack of moisture and does not mention the seed springing up quickly, nor the lack of roots, nor being scorched by the sun; yet these omissions remain in the interpretation as, respectively, receiving the word with joy, having no firm root, and the time of temptation.

This phenomenon, along with the lack of counterexamples of fatigue occurring in the opposite direction, supports Marcan priority.

===Naming of eyewitnesses===

Where Mark mentions someone by name, someone not well-known originally who could have been left anonymous, Bauckham argues that it is because his audience at the time could refer to them as living eyewitnesses.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|p=42}} Several persons are named only in Mark:

* Bartimaeus ({{bibleref2|Mk 10:46; Mt 20:30; Lk 18:35||!}})
* Alexander and Rufus ({{bibleref2|Mk 15:21; Mt 27:32; Lk 23:26||!}})
* Salome ({{bibleref2|Mk 15:40, 16:1; Mt 27:55–56, 28:1; Lk 23:49, 24:10||!}})

The reverse situation of Matthew or Luke naming those unnamed in Mark never occurs. If, as Bauckham reasons, the reason for the omission of these names in Matthew and Luke is that these persons have since died, this phenomenon lends support to Mark being composed earliest.

===External evidence===

[[File:Pasquale Ottino San Marcos escribe sus Evangelios al dictado de San Pedro Musée des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux.jpg|right|thumb|Pasqualotto, ''St. Mark writes his Gospel at the dictation of St. Peter'', 17th century.]]

The early patristic evidence records a few traditions on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels. It never indicates that one gospel used another as a source and shows little concern even for their chronological order; the focus was rather on who composed them and on their apostolic authority. What evidence there is as to the order of composition or publication is seen as virtually unanimous agreement on placing Matthew first.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=16–17}}

The earliest relevant source is [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] (c. 105), whose surviving fragments report two notable facts, echoed by most later sources. The evangelist [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], he says, was [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s interpreter and compiled his Gospel from the preaching of Peter in Rome, which Peter then sanctioned for use in the churches. [[Matthew the Apostle]], on the other hand, wrote his account himself in the "Hebrew dialect".{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=12–38, 202–239}}&lt;ref&gt;These quotations are preserved in Eusebius, [http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias ''Hist. Eccl.'' 3.39.15–16, 2.15.1–2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910155741/http://www.chronicon.net/index.php/papias |date=2014-09-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This account of the origin of Mark is seen as likely genuine by many scholars, though hardly all.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2006|pp=124–263}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Studies in the Gospel of Mark | authorlink=Martin Hengel | year=1985 | at=passim | isbn=0334023432 | last=Hengel | first=Martin | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, Mark's source is not the other two Synoptics but Peter—unless Peter himself drew from them, as some propose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Four Gospels?: The Historical Origins of the Gospels | authorlink=David Alan Black | year=2001 | isbn=0825420709 | last=Black | first=David Alan | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curious statement that Matthew's ''[[logia]]'' (as Papias calls it) was written in the "Hebrew dialect"—the ordinary way of referring to either the Hebrew or the Aramaic language—has been much discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtE1orv4Xg0C&amp;pg=PA39 | title=The Jesus Crisis: The Inroads of Historical Criticism Into Evangelical Scholarship | chapter=The Synoptic Gospels in the Ancient Church | last=Thomas | first=Robert L. | last2=Farnell | first2=F.

[[Ephrem]] (c. 350) is more explicit about the Gospels' languages: "Matthew the Hebrew wrote this, and behold it was turned into Greek….

Tatiani'' App. I, 1].&lt;/ref&gt; and this is echoed in many later sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/58108415/ | title=Extracts from believers that Mark's Gospel was written in Latin | year=2011 | accessdate=2013-12-12 | last=Gain | first=David Bruce | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark writing in Latin may have arisen merely by inference, but it is true that canonical Mark exhibits numerous Latinisms, and some have argued that indeed canonical Mark was translated from a Latin original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.radikalkritik.de/COUCHOUDEvMarc.pdf | title=Was the Gospel of Mark written in Latin? | journal=Crozer Quarterly | year=1928 | volume=5 | pages=35–79 | last=Couchoud | first=Paul-Louis | others=Translated by Morton S.

[[Irenaeus]] (c. 185), who knew the work of Papias, gives the first extant account of the origins of Luke (to which later sources add little) and of all four Gospels together: {{quotation|So [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], among the Hebrews in their own dialect, brought forth a writing of the Gospel, while [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in Rome were evangelizing and founding the church. But after their departure [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], the disciple and interpreter of Peter, himself handed what was preached by Peter down to us in writing. And [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], the follower of Paul, set forth in a book the Gospel that was preached by him. Then [[John the Evangelist|John]], the disciple of the Lord and also the one who leaned against his chest, also published the Gospel when residing in Ephesus of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/11/external-evidence-irenaeus.html ''Adv. Haer.'' 3.1.1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is doubtful whether Irenaeus intends a chronological order in this passage; "while" need not be understood temporally, and "after their departure" need not indicate the time of composition, but simply that the apostles' testimony survived in writing even after they themselves were gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem | year=1992 | pages=239–242 | isbn=0830817603 | last=Wenham | first=John William | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Irenaeus often prefers the order Matthew—Luke—Mark—John when addressing the Gospels together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Irenaeus' Use of Matthew's Gospel in ''Adversus Haereses'' | year=1998 | pages=89–94 | isbn=9068319647 | last=Bingham | first=Dwight Jeffrey | series=Traditio exegetica Graeca | volume=7 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this order thereafter recurs commonly in a wide variety of ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNb2fm5D0-gC&amp;pg=PA17 | chapter=A Further Reexamination of Evidence from the Early Tradition | title=New Synoptic Studies: The Cambridge Gospel Conference and Beyond | year=1983 | pages=17–35 | isbn=086554087X | last=Gamba | first=Giuseppe G. | editor-last=Farmer | editor-first=William Reuben | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, early Bibles and canons arranged the four Gospels in many different sequences, though most placed Matthew first among the Synoptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance | last=Metzger | first=Bruce M. | year=1987 | pages=295–300 | isbn=0198261802 | url=http://ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/134.pdf | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601181717/http://www.ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/134.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] (c. 195), who probably also knew the work of Papias, comes a unique and much-discussed statement that the gospels with genealogies (i.e., Matthew and Luke) were "written before" (''progegraphthai''), in contrast to Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Hypotyposeis'', apud Eusebius, [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2006/09/external-evidence-clement-of.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 6.14.5–7].&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer touted this as support for Marcan posteriority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNb2fm5D0-gC&amp;pg=PA3 | chapter=The Patristic Evidence Reexamined: A Response to George Kennedy | title=New Synoptic Studies: The Cambridge Gospel Conference and Beyond | year=1983 | pages=3–15 | isbn=086554087X | last=Farmer | first=William Reuben | editor-last=Farmer | editor-first=William Reuben | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Carlson argued that the word was better interpreted as "openly published", in contrast to Mark's initially private circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Clement of Alexandria on the 'Order' of the Gospels | last=Carlson | first=Stephen C. | journal=New Testament Studies | volume=47 | year=2001 | pages=118–125 | doi=10.1017/S0028688501000091 | url=https://www.academia.edu/968395/Clement_of_Alexandria_on_the_Order_of_the_Gospels | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Origen]] (c. 250), a pupil of Clement who also knew the work of Irenaeus well, enumerates the Gospels as follows: "As learned by tradition… the first written was Matthew… the second, Mark… the third, Luke… after all of them, John."&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''Comm. In Matth.'' I, apud Eusebius, [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2006/09/external-evidence-origen.html ''Hist. Eccl.'' 6.25.3–6].&lt;/ref&gt; Most readers then and now have seen this as a clear statement of chronology,{{sfnp|Carlson|2001}} though some have doubted that was Origen's intent.{{sfnp|Farmer|1983}}{{sfnp|Tuckett|2008|pp=16–17}} In any case, this canonical order was increasingly well established by this time, and subsequent sources accepted this temporal sequence.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (c. 400) recites this traditional chronological order and adds his own influential inferences. Denying that each evangelist wrote in ignorance of his predecessors, he describes Mark as "seemingly an attendant and epitomizer" of Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/10/external-evidence-augustine.html ''De Consensu Evangelistarum'' I.3–4].&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same work, Augustine revises his opinion and sees Mark as following not only Matthew but also Luke; Mark "walks with both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNb2fm5D0-gC&amp;pg=PA37 | chapter=Augustine and the Augustinian Hypothesis: A Reexamination of Augustine's Thought in ''De consensu evangelistarum'' | title=New Synoptic Studies: The Cambridge Gospel Conference and Beyond | year=1983 | pages=37–64 | isbn=086554087X | last=Peabody | first=David B. | editor-last=Farmer | editor-first=William Reuben | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes seen as the first suggestion that one Gospel used another as a source, but it is not at all clear whether Augustine had literary dependence in mind.{{sfnp|Thomas|1998|pp=62–63, 71–72}}{{Citation not found|date=February 2018}}

In summary, the external evidence stands against Matthew using Mark, inasmuch as Matthew was written first, and against Mark directly using Matthew, unless perhaps either of these canonical Gospels is a translation into Greek influenced by the other. The patristic consensus, rather, was literary [[independence hypothesis|independence]].{{sfnp|Thomas|1998|pp=57–75}}{{Citation not found|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. especially Chrysostom, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf110.iii.iv.html Hom. in Matt. 1]'' 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; But the value of this external evidence is uncertain; most synoptic scholars regard it as being of little help and focus almost entirely on the internal evidence instead.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=76–81}}

Past "suicide attempts" include:
*[[Methane poisoning]], 3.5 billion years ago
*The [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygen catastrophe]], 2.45 billion years ago
*[[Snowball earth]], twice, [[Huronian glaciation|2.4-2.1 billion years ago]] and 790–630 million years ago
*At least five putative [[hydrogen sulfide]]-induced mass extinctions, such as the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]], {{Ma|252.28}}

The list does not include the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], since this was, at least partially, externally induced by a [[meteor impact]].

'''Memsource''', headquartered in [[Prague]], the [[Czech Republic]], provides a [[cloud-based]] translation environment and is a type of [[CAT tool]]. Memsource Cloud includes [[translation memory]], terminology management, quality assurance, integrated [[machine translation]] and a web-based as well as desktop translator’s workbench.

== Milestones ==
Memsource was founded by David Canek, its current CEO, in 2010. Memsource Cloud was launched to the public in early 2011.

==Business model==
Memsource Cloud is provided as [[software as a service]] and uses a [[freemium]] business model. It offers the Personal, Academic and Developer editions for free, while it charges a monthly subscription fee for its more feature-rich offerings. These are the Freelancer edition (aimed at freelance translators) and the Team Start, Team, and Ultimate editions (aimed at translation companies).

==File support==
Memsource Cloud supports over 50 file formats for translation. These are Microsoft Office files, XML, HTML, software localization files, bilingual file formats, such as XLIFF, TTX, desktop publishing formats, such as Adobe InDesign and FrameMaker, and others. This is the full list:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supported File Formats|url=http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Supported_File_Formats|website=Memsource|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translator’s workbench==
Memsource provides both a desktop and web-based translator’s workbench. The latter gets launched directly from the Memsource Cloud environment. The desktop version, Memsource Editor, installs on [[Windows]], [[Macintosh|Mac]], and [[Linux]] and is available as a free download. The actual file for translation is stored on a user’s PC, while for all other translation resources (translation memory, terminology…) the Editor connects to Memsource Cloud. It works in a similar way as other, more traditional desktop-only CAT tools.&lt;ref name="memsource_studio_comp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://signsandsymptomsoftranslation.com/2012/11/09/memsource/ | title=Memsource and Studio 2011: a side-by-side comparison | publisher=Emma Goldsmith | work=Signs and Symptoms of Translation | date=2012-11-09 | accessdate=2012-12-27 | quote=I was up and running in no time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==APIs==
Memsource provides a lot of its functionality through its public [[API]]. These include translation memory API, terminology API, file conversion API, quality assurance API, and others. The API is provided via [[HTTP]]/[[JSON]] and there is a free Developer edition available for development/testing purposes.

==Biography==

===Early life and education in Russian Empire===
{{Chabad (Rebbes and Chasidim)|Rebbes of Chabad}}
Menachem Mendel Schneerson was born on April 18, 1902 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|OS]]) (11 Nissan, 5662) in the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now Mykolaiv in [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref name="Telushkin455"&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 455&lt;/ref&gt; His father was rabbi [[Levi Yitzchak Schneerson]], a renowned Talmudic scholar and authority on [[Kabbalah]] and [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Likkutei Levi Yitzchak'', Kehot Publications 1970&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was [[Rebbetzin]] [[Chana Schneerson]] (''nee'' Yanovski). He was named after the third [[Chabad]] rebbe, the [[Tzemach Tzedek]], from whom he was a direct patrilineal descendent.

In 1907, when Schneerson was six years old, the family moved to [[Dnipro|Yekatrinislav]] (today, [[Dnipro]]), where Levi Yitzchak was appointed Chief Rabbi of the city. He served until 1939, when he was exiled by the [[Soviets]] to [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Marcus, [http://www.chabad.org/133640 Rebbetzin Chana Schneerson - A brief biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson had two younger brothers: Dov Ber, who was murdered in 1944 by [[Nazi]] collaborators, and Yisrael Aryeh Leib, who died in 1952 while completing doctoral studies at [[Liverpool University]].&lt;ref name="Telushkin455"/&gt;

During his youth, he received a private education and was tutored by Zalman Vilenkin from 1909 through 1913. When Schneerson was eleven years old, Vilenkin informed his father that he had nothing more to teach his son.&lt;ref&gt;Chana Vilenkin, Zalman's daughter on "The Early Years Vol I". Jewish Educational Media 2006, segment Nikolaev, Russia 1902. (UPC 874780 000525)&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, Levi Yitzchak began teaching his son [[Talmud]] and [[rabbinic literature]], as well as [[Kabbalah]]. Schneerson proved gifted in both Talmudic and Kabalistic study and also took exams as an external student of the local Soviet school.&lt;ref name="Adin Steinsaltz page 24"&gt;Adin Steinsaltz, ''My Rebbe''. Maggid Books, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered an ''[[Illui]]'' and genius, and by the time he was seventeen, he had mastered the entire [[Talmud]], some 5,894 pages, as well as all its [[Rishonim|early commentaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Elinor, "Great Jewish Men", {{ISBN|0-8246-0381-8}}, page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his childhood Schneerson was involved in the affairs of his father's office. He was also said to have acted as an interpreter between the Jewish community and the Russian authorities on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Schneerson, Chana, ''A Mother in Israel'' Kehot Publications, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8266-0099-9}}, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Levi Yitzchak's courage and principles were a guide to his son for the rest of his life. Many years later, when he once reminisced about his youth, Schneerson said "I have the education of the first-born son of the rabbi of Yekatrinoselav. When it comes to saving lives, I speak up whatever others may say."&lt;ref&gt;Adin Steinsaltz, ''My Rebbe''. Maggid Books, 2014. Page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson went on to receive separate [[Semikhah|rabbinical ordination]]s from the [[Rogatchover Gaon]], Yosef Rosen,&lt;ref&gt;Selegson, Michoel A. Introduction to ''From Day to Day'', English translation of the [[Hayom Yom]], {{ISBN|0-8266-0669-5}}, p.

===Marriage and family life===
In 1923, Schneerson for the first time visited the sixth Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]], where he met the rabbi's middle daughter [[Chaya Mushka Schneerson|Chaya Mushka (Mousia)]]. Sometime later they became engaged, but were not married until 1928 in [[Warsaw, Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrlich |first=Avrum M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZR6ZOS0-KsC&amp;pg=PA35#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Chaya%20Mousia%22&amp;f=false |title=The Messiah of Brooklyn: understanding Lubavitch Hasidism past and present |publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year=2004 |isbn=9780881257809 |page=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking great pride in his son-in-law's outstanding knowledge, Yosef Yitzchak asked him to engage in learned conversation with the great Torah scholars that were present at the wedding, such as [[Meir Shapiro]] and [[Menachem Ziemba]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Rapoport ''The Afterlife of Scholarship: A Critical Review of 'The Rebbe' by Samuel Heilman and Menachem Friedman'', Oporto Press, 2011, {{ISBN|9780615538976}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Menachem Mendel and Chaya Mushka were married for 60 years, but were childless.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"&gt;Dara Horn, June 13, 2014 [https://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-rebbe-by-joseph-telushkin-and-my-rebbe-by-adin-steinsaltz-1402696458 "Rebbe of Rebbe's"]. ''Book Review 'Rebbe' by Joseph Telushkin and 'My Rebbe' by Adin Steinsaltz'', The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 2014-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Menachem Mendel Schneerson and Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn were both descendants of Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, known as the [[Tzemach Tzedek]], the third Rebbe of [[Chabad Lubavitch]].&lt;ref&gt;Chana Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1881290/jewish/Memoirs-of-Rebbetzin-Chana-Part-34.htm "Memoirs of Rebbetzin Chana - Part 34"] Kehot, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson later commented that the day of his marriage bound the community to him and him to the community.&lt;ref name="chabad.org"&gt;Eli Rubin, [http://www.chabad.org/2619803 "High Holidays in Riga: Self and Community"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 Schneerson traveled to [[Paris]], to take his mother, [[Chana Schneerson]], back to [[New York City|New York]] with him.&lt;ref name="Rebbe 2014. Page 475"&gt;''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 475&lt;/ref&gt;  Schneerson would visit her every day and twice each Friday and prepare her a [[tea]].&lt;ref&gt;Chana Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/1881290 My Son Visits Every Day].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Chana Schneerson died.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1988, Schneerson's wife, [[Chaya Mushka Schneerson]] died.&lt;ref name="Chaya Schneerson"&gt;''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/11/obituaries/chaya-schneerson-wife-of-the-leader-of-the-lubavitchers.html "Chaya Schneerson"], February 11, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the death of his wife, when the traditional year of Jewish mourning had passed, Schneerson moved into his study above the central Lubavitch synagogue on Eastern Parkway.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Feuer, January 14, 2009 [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/nyregion/15rooms.html?_r=1&amp; "No One There, but This Place Is Far From Empty"] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin===
[[File:Scheerson-Berlin.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A monument for Schneerson in [[Berlin]].]]
After his wedding to Chaya Mushka in 1928, Schneerson and his wife moved to Berlin, where he was assigned specific communal tasks by his father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, who also requested that he write scholarly annotations to the responsa and various hasidic discourses of the earlier Rebbes of Chabad-Lubavitch. Schneerson studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Volume II 1938 PC"&gt;"The Early Years Volume II (1931–1938)" Jewish Educational Media, 2006 (UPC 74780 00058)&lt;/ref&gt; He would later recall that he enjoyed [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rubin, [http://www.chabad.org/2619782 "Studies in Berlin: Science, Torah &amp; Quantum Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt; His father-in-law took great pride in his erudite son-in-law's scholarly attainments and paid for all the tuition expenses and helped facilitate his studies throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heilman |first1=Samuel |last2=Friedman |first2=Menachem |title=The Rebbe: The Life and Afterlife of Menachem Mendel Schneerson |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |pages=94, 106 |isbn=978-0-691-13888-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in Berlin, his father-in-law encouraged him to become more of a public figure, yet Schneerson described himself as an introvert,&lt;ref name="chabad.org"/&gt; and was known to plead with acquaintances not to make a fuss over the fact that he was the son-in-law of Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Berlin, Schneerson met [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]] and the two formed a friendship that remained between them years later when they both emigrated to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uchicagohillel.org/news/blog.aspx?id=428514&amp;blogid=13574 |title=Of God and Man: Some thoughts on the Rebbe |date=25 June 2014 |publisher=JUF News |accessdate=2014-12-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013842/http://www.uchicagohillel.org/news/blog.aspx?id=428514&amp;blogid=13574 |archivedate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rebbe-Rav"&gt;

He wrote hundreds of pages of his own original Torah discourses,&lt;ref&gt;Menachem. M. Schneerson, ''Reshimot''. Kehot Publication Society, 1994–2003&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted a serious interchange of halachic correspondence with many of Eastern Europe's leading rabbinic figures, including the talmudic genius known as the [[Rogachover Gaon]].&lt;ref&gt;Likkutei Levi Yitzchak Igrot Kodesh, Kehot Publication Society, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he also met with [[Chaim Elazar Shapiro]], as well as with talmudist [[Shimon Shkop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Educational Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson |author=Aryeh Solomon |page=310 |date=May 2000 |isbn=0-7657-6092-4 |publisher=Jason Aronson Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he would keep a diary in which he would carefully document his private conversations with his father-in-law, as well as his kabbalistic correspondence with his father, Levi Yitzchak Schneerson.&lt;ref&gt;The Rebbe's Early Years Ch. 5, Pg. 326 (Oberlander, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris===
In 1933, after the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, Schneerson left Berlin and moved to [[Paris]], [[France]] where he continued his religious and communal activities on behalf of his father-in-law, Yosef Yitzchak. He continued studying [[mechanics]] and [[electrical engineering]] at the [[École spéciale des travaux publics|ESTP]], a [[Grande école]] in the [[Montparnasse]] district and graduated in July 1937 with a degree. In November 1937, he enrolled at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he studied [[mathematics]] until [[World War II]] broke out in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"The Early Years Volume III (1938–1940)", ''Jewish Educational Media'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}

During that time, Yosef Yitzchak recommended that Professor [[Alexander Barchenko|Alexander Vasilyevitch Barchenko]] consult with Schneerson regarding various religious and mystical matters,&lt;ref&gt;''The Afterlife of Scholarship'' Pg. 76, Fn. 196&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent rabbis, such as Yerachmiel Binyaminson and [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] turned to Schneerson with their rabbinic and kabbalistic queries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Afterlife of Scholarship''. Page 143. {{ISBN|978-0-615-53897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneerson, Menachem M. ''Igrot Kodesh'', vol 1, p 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 1940, three days before [[German occupation of France during World War II|Paris fell to the Nazis]], the Schneersons fled to [[Vichy]], and later to [[Nice]], where they stayed until their final escape from Europe in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Years Volume IV, JEM 2008 (ASIN: B001M1Z62I)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}

===New York===
In 1941, Schneerson escaped from Europe via Lisbon, Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Sea Route From Lisbon to U.S. Stops Ticket Sale to Refugees'', ''New York Times'', March 15, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of his departure, Schneerson penned a treatise where he revealed his vision for the future of world Jewry and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rubin, [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2236391/jewish/Lisbon-1941-The-Messiah-the-Invalid-and-the-Fish.htm Lisbon, 1941: The Messiah the Invalid and the Fish], Caption: An article that appeared in The Argus (Melbourne, Australia), Tuesday, May 6, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Chaya Mushka arrived in New York on June 23, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Educational Media, [http://www.chabad.org/1558408 The Rebbe and Rebbetzin Arrive in America] ''The Early Years'', vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his arrival, his father-in-law appointed him director and chairman of the three Chabad central organizations, [[Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch]], [[Machneh Israel (Chabad)|Machneh Israel]] and [[Kehot Publication Society]], placing him at the helm of the movement's Jewish educational, social services, and publishing networks. Over the next decade, Yosef Yitzchak referred many of the scholarly questions that had been inquired of him to Schneerson and he became increasingly known as a personal representative of Yosef Yitzchak.&lt;ref name=rapaport&gt;Rapoport, Chaim. ''The Afterlife of Scholarship.'' Page 144. {{ISBN|978-0-615-53897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, Schneerson became a naturalized US citizen and, seeking to contribute to the war effort, he volunteered at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], using his electrical engineering background to draw wiring diagrams for the battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)]],&lt;ref name="army"&gt;Fishkoff, Sue. ''The Rebbe's Army'', Schoken, 2003 (08052 11381). Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milton Fechtor, [http://www.chabad.org/141185 Wiring the Missouri] ''Jewish Educational Media.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Hardof, [http://www.chabad.org/724789 Rabbi Engineer] ''Jewish Educational Media''&lt;/ref&gt; and other classified military work.&lt;ref name=farfromempty/&gt;

In 1942 Schneerson launched the [[Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch#Roving Rabbis|Merkos Shlichus]] program where he would send pairs of yeshiva students to remote locations across the country during their summer vacations to teach Jews in isolated communities about their heritage and offer education to their children.

As chairman and editor in chief of [[Kehot Publication Society|Kehot]], Schneerson published the works of the earlier Rebbes of Chabad. He also published his own works including the [[Hayom Yom]] in 1943 and Hagadda in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a visit to Paris in 1947 he established a school for girls and worked with local organisations to assist with housing for refugees and displaced persons.&lt;ref name="Rebbe 2014. Page 475"/&gt;

Schneerson often explained that his goal was to "make the world a better place," and to do what he could to eliminate all suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Schneerson, Rabbi Menachem Mendel, ''Sefer Hama'amorim Melukot Al Seder Chodshei Hashana Volume 2'' Kehot Publications, 2002. {{ISBN|978-1-56211-602-6}}. page 271.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Israeli President [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi|Yitzchak Ben Tzvi]], Schneerson wrote that when he was a child the vision of the future redemption began to take form in his imagination "a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees and annihilation of exile will be understood..."&lt;ref&gt;Menachem M. Schneerson, ''Igrot Kodesh''. Kehot Publications, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8266-5812-1}}. Volume 12, page 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a car accompanying Schneerson's motorcade accidentally struck two [[Guyanese Americans|Guyanese-American]] children while attempting to catch up to Schneerson's vehicle. One of the children was killed, and the incident triggered the [[Crown Heights riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFDF1E3AF930A25755C0A962958260&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=schneerson&amp;st=nyt|work=The New York Times|title=Rabbi Schneerson Led A Small Hasidic Sect To World Prominence|first=Ari L.|last=Goldman|date=June 13, 1994|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- these sentences added as a result of an RfC over the question of where to mention the Crown Heights riot in the article. please do not move this content or turn it into a subsection without discussion on the Talk page --&gt;

===Seventh Chabad Rebbe===
After the death of Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn in 1950, Chabad followers began persuading Schneerson to succeed his father-in-law as Rebbe on the basis of his scholarship, piety, and dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Adin Steinsaltz, ''My Rebbe''. Maggid Books, 2014. Page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;Shenker, Israel. The New York Times, Monday, March 27, 1972, reprinted on [http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/1170653/jewish/Lubavitch-Rabbi-Marks-His-70th-Year-With-Call-for-Kindness.htm Chabad.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson was reluctant, and actively refused to accept leadership of the movement. He continued, however, all the communal activities he had previously headed. It would take a full year until he was persuaded by the elders of the movement to accept the post.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 161&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first anniversary of his father-in-law's passing, 10 [[Shevat]] 1951, in a ceremony attended by several hundred rabbis and Jewish leaders from all parts of the United States and Canada, Schneerson delivered a Hasidic discourse, ''(Ma'amar)'', the equivalent to a President-elect taking the oath of office, and formally became the Rebbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=108303 |title=Shevat 10: A Day of Two Rebbes |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of his acceptance, members of the Israeli Cabinet and Israel's Chief [[Yitzhak Herzog]] sent him congratulatory messages.&lt;ref&gt;JTA, [http://www.jta.org/1951/01/23/archive/new-lubavitcher-rebbe-installed-rabbis-and-orthodox-leaders-attend-ceremony "New Rebbe Installed"]. January 23, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating a longstanding core [[Chabad]] principle at his inaugural talk, he demanded that each individual exert themselves in advancing spiritually, and ''not'' rely on the Rebbe to do it for them, saying:&lt;ref&gt;Toras Menachem, Hisva'aduyos vol.2 p.212-213&lt;/ref&gt;
"Now listen, Jews. Generally, in Chabad it has been demanded that each individual work on themselves, and not rely on the Rebbes. One must, ''on their own'', transform the folly of materialism and the passion of the 'animal soul' to holiness. I do not, God Forbid, recuse myself from assisting as much as possible, however; If one does not work on ''themselves'', what good will submitting notes, singing songs, and saying lechayim do?" At the same talk, Schneerson said "one must go to a place where nothing is known of godliness, nothing is known of Judaism, nothing is even known of the Hebrew alphabet, and while there to put oneself aside and ensure that the other calls out to God."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; When he spoke to Forward journalist Asher Penn that year, he said, "we must stop insisting that Judaism is in danger, an assertion that does little but place Jewry on the defensive. We need to go on the offensive."&lt;ref&gt;Kranzler, Gershon, ''Jewish Life'', Sept.–Oct. 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rebbe, Schneerson would receive visitors for private meetings, known as ''yechidus'', on Sunday and Thursday evenings. Those meetings would begin at 8pm and often continue until five or six in the morning and were open to everyone.&lt;ref name="chabad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner, Herbert page 158"&gt;Weiner, Herbert. Nine and 1/2 Mystics, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson, who spoke several languages including English, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, Russian, German and Italian, would converse with people on all issues and offer his advice on both spiritual and mundane matters.&lt;ref name=worldof237&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of Hasidism |author=H. Rabinowicz |page=237 |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-85303-035-5 |publisher=Hartmore House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians and leaders from across the globe came to meet him, but Schneerson showed no preference to one person over another. His secretary once even declined to admit [[John F. Kennedy]] because Schneerson was already meeting 'ordinary' people who had requested appointments months previously.&lt;ref name="observer.com"/&gt; Those meetings were discontinued in 1982 when it became impossible to facilitate the large number of people. Meetings were then held only for those who had a special occasion, such as a bride and groom for their wedding or a boy and his family on the occasion of a bar mitzvah.&lt;ref name=worldof237/&gt;

During his four decades as Rebbe, Schneerson would deliver regular addresses, centered on the weekly Torah portion and on various tractates of the Talmud. These talks, delivered without text or notes, would last for several hours,&lt;ref name="The Depth p.201"&gt;"Out of The Depth's", [[Israel Meir Lau]], p.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Despite All Odds: The Story of Lubavitch |author=Edward Hoffman |page=32 |date=May 1991 |isbn=0-671-67703-9 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes went for eight or nine hours straight. During the talks, Schneerson demonstrated a unique approach in explaining seemingly different concepts by analysis of the fundamental principle common to the entire tractate,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sacks, [http://www.chabad.org/110249 Introduction]. ''Torah Studies''. Kehot Publication Society, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hamodia" newspaper Vol.12944, June 13, 1994,&lt;/ref&gt; and referenced both classic and esoteric sources from all periods, citing entire sections by heart.&lt;ref name="The Depth p.201"/&gt;

===Outreach, spiritual and political campaigns===

====Women and girls====

In 1951 Schneerson established a Chabad women's and girl's organization and a youth organisation in Israel. Their mission was to engage in outreach directed to women and teens respectively. In 1953 he opened branches in New York, London and Toronto. In a marked departure from an entrenched tendency to limit high-level Torah education to men and boys, Schneerson addressed his teachings equally to both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heilman |first1=Samuel |last2=Friedman |first2=Menachem |title=The Rebbe: The Life and Afterlife of Menachem Mendel Schneerson |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |page=176 |isbn=978-0-691-13888-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed meetings of the organisations, and led gatherings exclusively for women. Schneerson would describe the increase in Torah study by women as one of the "positive innovations of the later generations."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Susan Handelman, [http://www.chabad.org/161694 The Rebbe's Views on Women Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

====International outreach====

That same year Schneerson sent his first emissary to Morocco, and established schools and a synagogue for the Moroccan Jewish community. In 1958 Schneerson established Schools and synagogues in Detroit, Michigan, in Milan, Italy and in London, England. Beginning in the 1960s, Schneerson instituted a system of [[Chabad mitzvah campaigns|"mitzvah campaigns"]] to encourage the observance of ten basic Jewish practices, such as [[Tefillin]] for men, [[Shabbat candles]] for women and loving your fellow for all people.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"&gt;{{Citation |author=Ruth R. Wisse |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-rebbe-twenty-years-after/ |title=The Rebbe, Twenty Years After |journal=Commentary Magazine |date=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneersohn's campaign brought the concept of tefillin to Jewish men everywhere, and he has been referred to as "the great modern popularizer of tefillin." Until his campaign, tefillin was largely the domain of the meticulously observant.&lt;ref&gt;Liel Leibovitz, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/196231/tefillin-the-love Tefillin The Love.] Tablet Magazine. December 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his mother in 1964, [[Chana Schneerson]], Schneerson began to offer an additional weekly sermon in her memory. These sermons, consisted of original insights and unprecedented analysis of Rashi's Torah commentary, which were delivered at the regular public gatherings. Schneerson gave these sermons each week until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Miller, [http://www.chabad.org/476620 Rashi's Method of Biblical Commentary].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chanukah campaign====

In 1973, Schneerson started a [[Chanukah]] campaign to encourage all Jews worldwide to light their own menorah. After all tin menorahs were given out that year, a military manufacturer was commissioned to make tens of thousands of additional menorahs for distribution. In 1974, a public lighting of a Chanukah menorah was held by the [[Liberty Bell]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in years following menorah lightings on public grounds were conducted in cities worldwide. Legal challenges to the lightings on public grounds reached the Supreme Court and it was ruled that public lightings did not violate the Constitution. Public lightings continue in thousands of cities today.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 498&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran youth immigration====
In 1979, during the Islamic Revolution and Iranian hostage crisis, Schneerson directed arrangements to rescue Jewish youth and teenagers from Iran and bring them to safety in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabadnews.us/Old%20Aricles/AT%2000009.htm |title="Exodus" from Iran |publisher=Lubavitch Archives |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militant Islamist hostilities towards the United States were seen by Schneerson as behavior that could threaten the country's status as an "untouchable" superpower, and that would cause it to try to appease Arab countries, thus "endanger[ing] the security of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Shamir, August 24, 2013 [http://www.chabad.org/2320574 "The Israeli Journalist, Iran and the Rebbes Vision"]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Schneerson's efforts, several thousand Iranian children were flown from Iran to the safety of New York.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Pages 289–290&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious, human rights and political activism====
In 1983 Schneerson launched a global campaign to promote awareness of the Supreme Being and observance of the [[Noahide Laws]] among all people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/62221 Universal Morality - The Seven Noahide Laws], chabad.org, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that this was the basis for human rights for all civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/62180 1983: Mankind - Life &amp; Times], chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; Several times each year his addresses were broadcast on national television. On these occasions Schneerson would address the public on general communal affairs and issues relating to world peace such as a [[moment of silence]] in U.S. public schools, increased government funding for solar energy research, U.S. foreign aid to developing countries and nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuley Boteach, April 13, 2014. [http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/rebbe-to-the-non-jews/#ixzz3CkwnCcyu Rebbe to the non-Jews], ''Times of Israel''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Schneerson initiated a campaign for the [[Daily Rambam Study|daily study]] of [[Maimonides]]'s [[Mishneh Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Torat Menachem Hitvaduyot 5744 [http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16056&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=160 vol.3 pg. 1544]&lt;/ref&gt; Each year at the completion of the learning cycle there is Siyum celebration marking the end of the cycle and beginning of the new one. These events have been attended by many Jewish leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Tekufat Limud HaRambam, Merkos L'Inyonei Chunuch, Brooklyn, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many thousands follow the daily study cycle.

====Sunday office hours for charity====
In 1986, Schneerson began a custom where each Sunday he would stand outside his office, greet people briefly, give them a dollar bill and encourage them to donate to the charity of their choice.&lt;ref name="Hoff47"&gt;Hoffman 1991, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining his reason for encouraging charitable giving among all people, Schneerson quoted his father-in-law who said that "when two people meet, it should bring benefit to a third."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Pages 506–507.&lt;/ref&gt; People on line would often take this opportunity to ask Schneerson for advice or request a blessing. Thousands of people attended this event each week, which lasted up to six hours, and is often referred to as "Sunday Dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Eliezer Zalmanov, [http://www.chabad.org/1714766 What Does A Dollar from the Rebbe Represent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson's wife, Chaya Mushka Schneerson died in 1988.&lt;ref name="Chaya Schneerson"/&gt; During the week of [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] Schneerson wrote a will in which he bequeathed his entire estate to [[Agudas Chasidei Chabad]], the Chabad umbrella organisation.&lt;ref&gt;The Baltimore Sun, June 15, 1994 [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-06-15/news/1994166194_1_rabbi-schneerson-menachem-mendel-schneerson-lubavitch "Rabbi Schneerson names no successor in will"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a talk in 1991, Schneerson spoke passionately about Moshiach (the [[Messiah]]) and told his followers that he had done all that he could to bring world peace and redemption, but that it was now up to them to continue this task: "I have done my part, from now on you do all that you can." A few months later, when a reporter from [[CNN]] came to meet him at dollars, he said, "Moshiach is ready to come now, it is only on our part to do something additional in the realm of goodness and kindness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/132931 "CNN with the Rebbe."] (20 October 1991) ''Eye to Eye: Acts of Goodness and Kindness''. Jewish Educational Media (JEM). Retrieved 28 December 2014 ([http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/MediaPlayer/play.asp?id=1245197 Media Player w/captions]) [[Gary Tuchman]] and his CNN crew were also given dollars.&lt;/ref&gt;

====His message: become righteous====
On Sunday, March 1, 1992, Gabriel Erem, the editor of ''Lifestyles Magazine'' told Schneerson that on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday they would be publishing a special issue and wanted to know what his message to the world was. Schneerson replied that "'Ninety', in [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], is '[[tzaddik]]'; which means 'righteous.' And that is a direct indication for every person to become a real tzaddik - a righteous person, and to do so for many years, until 120. This message", Schneerson added, "applies equally to Jews and non-Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rubin [http://www.chabad.org/2619824 "Everyone A Tzaddik: Miracles, Transmission and Ascent"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work habits===
During his decades of leadership, Schneerson worked over 18 hours a day and never took a day of vacation.&lt;ref&gt;Shmully Hecht, 2014/06/29. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/opinion/sunday/remembering-rabbi-menachem-mendel-schneerson.html?_r=0 "Remembering Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson"]. The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; He rarely left Brooklyn except for visits to his father-in-law's gravesite in Queens, New York. Schneerson was opposed to retirement, seeing it as a waste of precious years.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuley Boteach, ''Judaism for Everyone''. Page 209. {{ISBN|0-465-00794-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, on the occasion of his 70th birthday, instead of announcing a retirement plan, Schneerson proposed the establishment of 71 new institutions to mark the beginning of the 71st year of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/372585/ 70 Years, 71 New Institutions], The Living Archive, March 26, 1972. Jewish Educational Media (JEM).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
In 1977, during the ''[[hakafot]]'' ceremony on [[Shemini Atzeret]], Schneerson suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. At his request, rather than transporting him to a hospital, the doctors set up a mini-hospital at his office where he was treated for the next four weeks by Dr. [[Bernard Lown]], Dr. Ira Weiss and Dr. Larry Resnick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/default.asp?searchword=weiss&amp;LocalSearchImg.x=0&amp;LocalSearchImg.y=0 |title=Living Torah Archive - Living Torah |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fifteen years later Schneerson suffered a serious [[stroke]] while praying at the [[Ohel (Chabad)|grave of his father-in-law]]. The stroke left him unable to speak and paralyzed on the right side of his body. During this time, the hope that Schneerson could be revealed as the Messiah (Moshiach) became more widespread.&lt;ref name="wp06201999"&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 20, 1999. 5 Years After Death, Messiah Question Divides Lubavitchers.

On the morning of June 12, 1994 ([[3 Tammuz]] 5754), Schneerson died at the [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] and was buried at the [[Ohel (Chabad)|Ohel]] next to his father-in-law, Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, at [[Montefiore Cemetery]] in [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Hasidism, by Tzvi Rabinowicz p. 432 {{ISBN|1-56821-123-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', June 13, 1994, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Schneerson's death, the executors of his will discovered several notebooks in a drawer in his office, in which Schneerson had written his scholarly thoughts and religious musings from his earliest years.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, David. 1994-11-08 [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/08/nyregion/lubavitchers-learn-to-sustain-themselves-without-the-rebbe.html "Lubavitchers Learn to Sustain Themselves Without the Rebbe"] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of entries in these journals date between the years 1928 and 1950 and were subsequently published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/1210901/jewish/The-Rebbes-Notebook.htm The Rebbe's Notebook - The Reshimot], chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Following age-old Jewish tradition that the resting place of a [[tzadik]] is holy, Schneerson's gravesite is viewed by many as a holy site and has been described by the [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] as "the American Western Wall", where thousands of people, Jews and non-Jews,&lt;ref name="observer.com"/&gt; go to pray each week.&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=David M.

==Global leadership==

===United States===

Schneerson spoke of the position of the United States as a world superpower, and would praise its foundational values of '"E pluribus unum'—from many one", and "In God we trust".&lt;ref&gt;Menachem M. Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/1180692 The Difference Between Faith and Trust]. January 15, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; He called on the government to develop independent energy, and not need to rely on totalitarian regimes whose countries national interests greatly differed from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Abramowitz, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Better-Energy-The-Rebbes-energy-361147 "Better Energy, The Rebbe's Energy"]. ''The Jerusalem Post'', 07/01/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menachem M. Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/394468 Americas Mandate: Energy Independence]. April 15, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson also called for the U.S. Government to use its influence on countries who were receiving its foreign aid to do more for the educational and cultural needs of their deprived citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/816546 The Start of "Education Day USA"], compiled by Dovid Zaklikowski.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson placed a strong emphasis on education and often spoke of the need of a moral educational system for all people. He was an advocate of a [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] as a separate cabinet position from the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Sue Fishkoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4R7zbndjTRgC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=schneerson+department+of+education&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Upmu-wCxln&amp;sig=svs07t2g9vvhAA14ua8VaLBRvx4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KxVDVMXVLOmIsQS2zIGICA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=schneerson%20department%20of%20education&amp;f=false ''The Rebbe's Army]. Random House, 2003. Pages 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson proclaimed 1977 as a "Year of Education" and urged Congress to do the same. He stated that education "must think in terms of a 'better living' not only for the individual, but also for the society as a whole. The educational system must, therefore, pay more attention to the building of character, with emphasis on moral and ethical values. Education must put greater emphasis on the promotion of fundamental human rights and obligations of justice and morality, which are the basis of any human society".&lt;ref&gt;Menachem M. Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/1167634 "Education is the Cornerstone of Humanity"]. April 18, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninety-Fifth Congress of the United States issued a Joint Resolution proclaiming 1978 as a Year of Education and designating April 18, 1978, as "Education Day, U.S.A.".&lt;ref&gt;95th Congress, [[s:Page:United States Statutes at Large Volume 92 Part 1.djvu/254|Public Law 95-262]]. Apr. 17. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year since, the President of the United States has proclaimed Schneerson's birthday as "Education Day, U.S.A." in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Kampeas, [http://www.jta.org/2009/04/05/news-opinion/united-states/obama-marks-schneersons-education-day Obama: Schneerson’s legacy is ‘brighter future’]. April 15, 2011, ''JTA''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life, Schneerson had great influence on numerous political leaders from across the aisle, many of whom would seek his advice. He was visited by Presidents, Prime Ministers, Governors, Senators, Congressmen and Mayors. Notable among them are John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Jacob Javits, Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani, David Dinkins and Joe Lieberman.&lt;ref name=farfromempty&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/nyregion/15rooms.html?_r=1&amp; |title=No One There, But This Place Is Far From Empty |work=New York Times |date=14 January 2009 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, M. Avrum, The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present, (KTAV Publishing, January 2005) p. 109. {{ISBN|0-88125-836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

Schneerson took great interest in the affairs of the state of [[Israel]], and did whatever was in his power to support the infrastructure of the state and advance its success.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present, M. Avrum Ehrlich, p. 105. KTAV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-88125-836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned with the agricultural,&lt;ref&gt;The Letter and the Spirit, pages 251-252&lt;/ref&gt; industrial and overall economic welfare of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;The Letter and the Spirit, page 324&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to promote its scientific achievements, and enhance Israel's standing in the international community.&lt;ref&gt;Letters from the Lubavitcher Rebbe vol. 5, page 234&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson consistently expressed enormous recognition of the role of the Israel Defense Forces and stated that those who serve in the Israeli army perform a great Mitzva.&lt;ref&gt;The Afterlife of Scholarship Page 106 (Oporto Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Schneerson encouraged the establishment of Israel's first automobile company. By 1956, the company was responsible for 28% of Israel's exports. Schneerson established a network of trade schools in Israel to provide Israeli youth, new immigrants and Holocaust survivors with vocational training and livelihood. In 1954 Schneerson established a school for carpentry and woodwork. In 1955 he established a school for agriculture. In 1956 he established a school for printing and publishing and in 1957 a school for textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he never visited Israel, many of Israel's top leadership made it a point to visit him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/1038748 |title= Faithful and Fortified |publisher=Jewish Educational Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli President [[Zalman Shazar]] would visit Schneerson and corresponded extensively with him as would Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] who came to visit him before going to Washington to meet President Carter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/132942 Begin with the Rebbe] ''Jewish Educational Media''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariel Sharon]] who had a close relationship with Schneerson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/2451287 Sharon and the Rebbe]. ''Jewish Educational Media''&lt;/ref&gt; often quoted his views on military matters and sought his advice when he considered retiring from the military. Schneerson advised the general to remain at his post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/2458367 The Rebbe to Sharon: Don't Leave the IDF], letter to Ariel Sharon, translated from the original Hebrew.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yitzhak Rabin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/2684113 Rabin with the Rebbe]. ''Jewish Educational Media''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/1001699 Dont Be Intimidated] ''Jewish Educational Media''&lt;/ref&gt; also visited and sought Schneerson's advice. Israeli politicians and military experts who came to consult with him were surprised by his detailed knowledge of their country's local affairs and international situation on strategic and diplomatic fronts.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com" /&gt; Despite his advisory meetings with American and Israeli political notables, Schneerson stated his nonpartisan policy many times, warning of his non-involvement in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menacehm M. Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/498519 "I don't interfere in politics"]. April 1, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson publicly expressed his view that the safety and stability of Israel were in the best interests of the United States, calling Israel the front line against those who want the anti-Western nations to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB_khjit9ns |title=The Lubavitcher Rebbe On Syria and Iran |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was opposed to land for peace, which he called an "illusion of peace", saying that it would not save lives, but harm lives. Schneerson stated that this position was not based on nationalistic or other religious reasons, but purely out of concern for human life.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Pages 271-290.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said that while serving as Israel's ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in 1984, Schneerson told him: "you will be serving in a house of darkness, but remember, that even in the darkest place; the light of a single candle can be seen far and wide..." Netanyahu later retold this episode in a speech at the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], on Sept 23, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/1632210 The Light of Truth at the UN], (video) Excerpt: Prime Minister Netanyahu at the General Assembly, Sept 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the outbreak of the [[Six-Day War]], Schneerson called for a global Teffilin campaign, to see that Jews observe the Mitzva of Tefillin as a means of ensuring divine protection against Israel's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Challenge, page 144, Jerrold &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to a crowd of thousands of people on May 28, 1967, only a few days before the outbreak of the war, he assured the world that Israel would be victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem M. Schneerson, [http://www.chabad.org/1515871 G-d is Guarding His Children; You Can Help], ''Jewish Educational Media''&lt;/ref&gt;  He said Israel had no need to fear as God was with them, quoting the verse, "the Guardian of Israel neither sleeps nor slumbers".&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Bernard L. (May 27, 1968). "Hassidic Jews Confront Hippies to Press a Joyous Occasion". New York: New York Times. pp. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Operation Entebbe]] rescue, in a public talk on 16 August 1976, Schneerson applauded the courage and selflessness of the IDF, "who flew thousands of miles, putting their lives in danger for the sole purpose of possibly saving the lives of tens of Jews". He said: "their portion in the Hereafter is guaranteed".&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, Chaim. ''The Afterlife of Scholarship''. p. 88 {{ISBN|9780615538976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sichot Kodesh 5736, vol. 2, page 625&lt;/ref&gt; He was later vilified by ultra-[[haredi]] rabbis for publicly praising the courage of the IDF and suggesting that God chose them as a medium through which he would send deliverance to the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Jerome. Hasidic People: A Place in the New World, page 52. Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson protested vehemently against those elements within the ultra-haredi society who sought to undermine the motivations and actions of the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ben. ''"Chassidic Sects Battle Each Other"'', Canadian Jewish News, April 1, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sichot Kodesh 5736, vol. 2, pages 626-627&lt;/ref&gt;

He corresponded with [[David Ben-Gurion]] on the issue of Judaism in the State of Israel, asking the Prime Minister to ensure that Israel "remains Jewish". He lobbied Israeli politicians to pass legislation in accordance with Jewish law on the question "[[Who is a Jew?]]" and asked that they add the words "according to [[Halakha]]" to the declaration so that it state that "only one who is born of a Jewish mother or converted according to Halakha is Jewish". This caused a furor in the United States. Some American Jewish philanthropies stopped financially supporting Chabad-Lubavitch since most of their members were connected to [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]]. Other controversial issues such as his opposition to territorial com

===Soviet Jewry===
Schneerson greatly encouraged the Jews who lived in Communist states. He sent many emissaries on covert missions to sustain Judaism under Communist regimes and to provide them with their religious and material needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hyam Maccoby |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rabbi-menachem-schneerson-1422311.html |title=Obituary: Rabbi Menachem Schneerson - People - News |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1994-06-13 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jews from behind the iron curtain would correspond with Schneerson, sending their letters to him via secret messenger and addressing Schneerson in code name.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson, who had an intimate knowledge of the Soviet government and their tactics,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=How did the Rebbe gain intimate knowledge of these things?}} opposed demonstrations on behalf of Soviet Jews, stating that he had evidence that they were harming Russia's Jews.

On one known occasion he instructed Senator [[Chic Hecht]] to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chabad.org/523711 |date=2006-05-15 |title=Obituary: Senator Jacob ("Chic") Hecht (1929-2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, Schneerson called for efforts to rescue Ukrainian Jewish children from Chernobyl and founded a special organization for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccoc.net/who-we-are/our-story |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130703053727/http://www.ccoc.net/who-we-are/our-story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-03 |title=Our Story - Who We Are |publisher=Chabad's Children of Chernobyl |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rescue flight occurred on August 3, 1990, when 196 Jewish children were flown to Israel and brought to a shelter campus. Since then, thousands of children have been rescued and brought to Israel, where they receive housing, education and medical care in a supportive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eglash |first=Ruth |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Chabads-Children-of-Chernobyl-project-as-vital-as-ever |title=Chabad's Children of Chernobyl project 'as vital as ever' |publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

===Impact===
Schneerson initiated Jewish outreach in the post-[[Holocaust]] era and believed that world Jewry was seeking to learn more about its heritage. He sought to bring Judaism to Jews wherever they were and was the first person in all of history to try reach every Jewish community and every Jew in the world.&lt;ref name="jewishfederations.org"/&gt; [[British Chief Rabbi]] [[Jonathan Sacks]] said of Schneerson "that if the Nazis searched out every Jew in hate, the Rebbe wished to search out every Jew in love".&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Week, [http://www.thejewishweek.com/free-book-excerpt-rebbe "Free Book Excerpt From "Rebbe""] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903140845/http://www.thejewishweek.com/free-book-excerpt-rebbe |date=2014-09-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw the building of schools, community centers, and youth camps and created a global network of emissaries, known as Shluchim.

Today there are ''shluchim'' in all of the 50 US states, in over 100 countries and 1,000 cities around the world, totaling more than 3,600 institutions including some 300 in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Literacy", Telushkin, William Morrow 2001, p.470&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/centers/default_cdo/country/Israel/jewish/Chabad-Lubavitch.htm List of Chabad Centers in Israel], chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; Chabad is very often the only Jewish presence in a given town or city and it has become the face of Jewish Orthodoxy for the Jewish and general world.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, Sue. The Rebbe's Army, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson's model of Jewish outreach has been imitated by all Jewish movements including the Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and Haredi.&lt;ref name="jns.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Yoffie, [http://urj.org/about/union/leadership/yoffie/biennialsermon03/ The Chabad Challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010220335/http://urj.org/about/union/leadership/yoffie/biennialsermon03/ |date=2014-10-10 }}. Union for Reform Judaism, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; His published works fill more than 200 volumes and are often used as source text for sermons of both Chabad and non-Chabad rabbis.&lt;ref name="ou.org"/&gt; Beyond the Jewish world, [[Peggy Noonan]] has written that moral issues would be better addressed by leaders such as Schneerson than by politicians,&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Noonan, ''What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era''. Random House, 1990. Page 346.&lt;/ref&gt; and since his death, Schneerson has been referred to as the Rebbe for all people.&lt;ref name="observer.com"/&gt;

===Recognition===
Schneerson's contributions to education and the betterment of mankind have been recognized by every president since [[Richard Nixon]]. In 1978, Schneerson became the first – and only – rabbi to have a U.S. national day proclaimed in his honor, when the U.S. congress and President [[Jimmy Carter]] designated Schneersons birthdate as "[[Education and Sharing Day|Education Day USA]]." Each year since, the President has called on all Americans to focus on education in honor of Schneerson. In 1982 [[Ronald Reagan]] also proclaimed Schneerson's birthday as a "National Day of Reflection", and presented the "National Scroll of Honor" that was signed by the President, Vice-President and every member of Congress.&lt;ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=42362 |title=Ronald Reagan: Proclamation 4921 - National Day of Reflection |publisher=[[American Presidency Project]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous public officials attended Schneerson's funeral, including New York Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and the entire staff of the Israeli consulate in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1994/06/13/2880621/tens-of-thousands-mourn-the-death-of-rabbi-menachem-mendel-schneerson |title=Tens of Thousands Mourn the Death of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=1994-06-13 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Bill Clinton]] penned a condolence letter "to the Chabad-Lubavitch community and to world Jewry" and spoke of Schneerson as "a monumental man who as much as any other individual, was responsible over the last half a century for advancing the instruction of ethics and morality to our young people." Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzchak Rabin]], cited Schneerson's great scholarship and contribution to the entire Jewish people and proclaimed "The Rebbe's loss is a loss for all the Jewish people." Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] cited words from the prophet [[Malachi]] as applying with particular force to Schneerson: "He brought back many from iniquity. For a priest's lips shall guard knowledge, and teaching should be sought from his mouth. For he is a messenger of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his death, Schneerson was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], honoring Schneerson for his "outstanding and enduring contributions toward world education, morality, and acts of charity".&lt;ref name="Public Law 103-457"/&gt; President [[Bill Clinton]] spoke these words at the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony:

{{quote|The late Rebbe's eminence as a moral leader for our country was recognized by every president since [[Richard Nixon]]. For over two decades, the Rabbi's movement now has some 2000 institutions; educational, social, medical, all across the globe. We (the United States Government) recognize the profound role that Rabbi Schneerson had in the expansion of those institutions.}}

In 2009, the National Museum of American Jewish History selected Schneerson as one of eighteen [[American Jews]] to be included in their [[National Museum of American Jewish History|"Only in America" Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmajh.org/ |title=nmajh.org |publisher=nmajh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship and works==

Schneerson is recognized for his scholarship and contributions to Talmudic, Halachic, Kabalistic and Chasidic teachings.&lt;ref name="ou.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yehiel Poupko, [http://www.uchicagohillel.org/news/blog.aspx?id=428514&amp;blogid=13574 Of God and Man: Some thoughts on the Rebbe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013842/http://www.uchicagohillel.org/news/blog.aspx?id=428514&amp;blogid=13574 |date=2014-10-18 }}. 6/25/2014, ''JUF News''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], who knew Schneerson from their days in Berlin, and remained in contact once the two men came to America, told his students after visiting Schneerson "the Rebbe has a 'gewaldiger' (awesome) comprehension of the Torah,"&lt;ref&gt;Kowalsky, S.B. ''From My Zaidy's House'', page 274-275&lt;/ref&gt; and "He is a gaon, he is a great one, he is a leader of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0uF44xLM-k&amp;feature=relmfu |title=Excerpt: The Rebbe and the Rav |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mordechai Eliyahu]], former [[chief Rabbi of Israel]], his meeting with Schneerson "covered all sections of the Torah" Eliyahu said "The Rebbe jumped effortlessly from one Talmudic tractate to another, and from there to Kabbalah and then to Jewish law... It was as if he had just finished studying these very topics from the holy books. The whole Torah was an open book in front of him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mordechai |first=Rabbi |url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/694406/jewish/Teacher-and-Leader-for-All-Jews.htm |title=Teacher and Leader for All Jews - Life |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Following his attendance at one such talk, Yitzchak Yedidya Frankel said "I have witnessed the magnificence of Polish Jewry...and I have known most of the great scholars of recent generations. But I have never seen such command of the material. That is genius." ''Out of the Depths'' [[Israel Meir Lau]], Sterling Publishing, 2011 p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson's teachings have been published in more than two hundred volumes. Schneerson also penned tens of thousands of letters in reply to requests for blessings and advice. These detailed and personal letters offer advice and explanation on a wide variety of subjects, including spiritual matters as well as all aspects of life.&lt;ref name="Hamodia Vol 1994, pg.2"&gt;"Hamodia" Vol.12944, June 13, 1994, pg.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===1960s: Tefillin campaign===
During 1967, shortly before the [[Six-Day War]], Schneerson launched a "Tefilin campaign" which encouraged the Jewish commandment ([[mitzvah]]) of the donning of [[Tefilin]] especially by non-affiliated Jews. Within the [[Haredi]] community, criticism of the campaign was voiced at the [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudat Israel]] convention of 1968. However, following the incident, [[Yitzchok Hutner]], a prominent Orthodox rabbi who had corresponded with Schneersohn in the past,&lt;ref&gt;Igros Kodesh, M.M. Schneerson, Kehot 1998 Vol. 7, pp. 2,49,192,215; Vol. 12, pp. 28,193; Vol. 14, pp. 167,266; Vol. 18, p. 251; Vol. 25, pp. 18-20; and Vol. 26, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to Schneerson privately, distancing himself from the convention. Hutner wrote that he had not been at the convention and asked forgiveness for any pain his earlier letters (discussing halachic issues regarding the tefillin campaign) may have caused.&lt;ref&gt;Mibeis Hagenozim, B. Levin, Kehot 2009, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Wills ===
There is considerable controversy within Chabad about Schneerson's will, as he named no successor as leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty. He did however write one legal will, which was signed before witnesses, whereby he transferred stewardship of all the major Chabad institutions as well as all his possessions to Agudas Chassidei Chabad.&lt;ref name="willis" /&gt;

Another will, no executed copies of which are known to be in existence, named three senior Chabad rabbis as directors of Agudas Chassidei Chabad.&lt;ref name="willis"&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 20, KTAV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-88125-836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Messianism ===
{{Main|Chabad messianism}}
Schneerson was criticized for his passion and desire to raise awareness of the coming of the Messiah. Detractors criticized a children's song with the words "We want ''moshiach'' (the messiah) now / We don't want to wait," that Schneerson commended.&lt;ref name="JTMessiah"&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Page 431&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life, his admirers hoped that he would be revealed as the Messiah.&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"/&gt; Admirers pointed to traditional Jewish theology which teaches that in every generation there is one person who is worthy of being the Messiah, and if God deems the times right, he will be revealed by God as such.&lt;ref&gt;J. Immanuel Schochet, [http://www.chabad.org/101679 The Personality of Mashiach]. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Chabad followers also pointed to a tradition that in every generation there is one person who is considered the Messiah of the generation.&lt;ref name="JTMessiah"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Lichtenstein, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/111005773/Rav-Aharon-Lichtenstein-s-Hesped-for-the-Lubavitcher-Rebbe-English Eulogy for the Rebbe]. June 16, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneerson's supporters have claimed that many Jews felt that if there was indeed a person worthy of such stature, it was Schneerson.&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rebbe's Army. Page 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schneerson constantly objected to any talk that he could be the Messiah, this notion sparked controversy, particularly among those who were unfamiliar with these traditional teachings.&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adin Steinsaltz page 24"/&gt;
Since Schneerson's passing, the Messianic movement has largely shrunk, although many followers still believe him to be the Messiah.&lt;ref name="JTMessiah"/&gt; The Chabad umbrella organization, [[Agudas Chasidei Chabad]], has condemned Messianic behavior, stating that it defies the express wishes of Schneerson.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, Statement From Agudas Chasidei Chabad, Feb 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://snl.no/Olav_Dalgard |title=Olav Dalgard|publisher = Store norske leksikon|author= Lillian Bikset|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Dalgard was born '''Olaf Hanssen''' in [[Folldal]], in [[Hedmark]], Norway. From the age of three, he raised at [[Oppdal]]  in [[Trøndelag]]. He earned an M.A. degree in literature and art history at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1929. He was an  advocate of the use of [[Nynorsk]] and served as the chairman of the student Nynorsk association. He was also  in the [[Mot Dag]] movement.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://nbl.snl.no/Olav_Dalgard  |title=Olav Dalgard|publisher =  Norsk biografisk leksikon|author= Kari Gaarder Losnedahl
|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.leksikon.org/art.php?n=1784|title=Mot Dag|publisher = leksikon.org 
|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalgard worked as a literary critic for the newspapers ''[[Dagbladet]]'' and ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]''. 
Dalgard took over as dramatic advisor and instructor for  [[Det Norske Teateret]] in 1931 and was attached to the theater for 48 years.

He studied film in the [[Soviet Union]] and in the 1930s produced several films with a [[socialist]] message. Dalgard was also active in the [[Norwegian Labour Party]]'s cultural operations.
During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], Dalgard was arrested in 1942,  held as a political prisoner by  German authorities and sent to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.allkunne.no/framside/biografiar/d/olav-dalgard/87/5592/|title= Olav Dalgard
|publisher = Allkunne |accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalgard was involved in the establishment of the [[Norwegian Film Institute]] and was  a member of the state film board. Among his most famous works was ''[[Gryr i Norden]]'' (1939).  Dalgard both wrote the script and directed the film which was a dramatization of the [[Kristiania Match Workers Strike of 1889]] (''fyrstikkarbeiderstreiken'').  He also wrote a number of books about theater and film as well as biographies including  ''Teateret frå Aiskylos til Ibsen'' (1948),  ''Filmskuespillet – sakprosa'' (1951), ''Teateret i det 20. hundreåret – sakprosa'' (1955), ''Lars Tvinde – biografi over [[Lars Tvinde]]'' (1966) and ''Inge Krokann – biografi over [[Inge Krokann]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://snl.no/fyrstikkarbeiderstreiken |title= fyrstikkarbeiderstreiken

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58918">Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the [[phonology]] of [[Old Chinese]] from documentary evidence.  Although the writing system does not describe sounds directly, shared [[phono-semantic|phonetic components]] of the most ancient [[Chinese characters]] are believed to link words that were pronounced similarly at that time.  The oldest surviving Chinese verse, in the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (''Shijing''), shows which words rhymed in that period.  Scholars have compared these bodies of contemporary evidence with the much later [[Middle Chinese]] reading pronunciations listed in the ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rime dictionary]] published in 601 AD, though this falls short of a phonemic analysis.  Supplementary evidence has been drawn from cognates in other [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] and in [[Min Chinese]], which split off before the Middle Chinese period, Chinese transcriptions of foreign names, and early borrowings from and by neighbouring languages such as [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]], [[Tai languages|Tai]] and [[Tocharian languages]].

Although many details are disputed, most recent reconstructions agree on the basic structure.  It is generally agreed that Old Chinese differed from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal [[obstruent]]s but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless [[sonorant]]s.  Most recent reconstructions also posit consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] distinctions in Middle Chinese.

Most scholars reconstruct clusters of {{IPA|*s-}} with other consonants, and possibly other clusters as well, but this area remains unsettled.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=222–232}}

In recent reconstructions, such as the widely accepted system of {{harvp|Baxter|1992}}, the rest of the Old Chinese syllable consists of
* an optional medial {{IPA|*-r-}},
* an optional medial {{IPA|*-j-}} or (in some reconstructions) some other representation of a distinction between [[#Type A and B syllables|"type-A" and "type-B" syllables]],
* one of six [[vowel]]s:

* an optional coda, which could be a glide {{IPA|*-j}} or {{IPA|*-w}}, a nasal {{IPA|*-m}}, {{IPA|*-n}} or {{IPA|*-ŋ}}, or a stop {{IPA|*-p}}, {{IPA|*-t}}, {{IPA|*-k}} or {{IPA|*-kʷ}},
* an optional post-coda {{IPA|*-ʔ}} or {{IPA|*-s}}.
In such systems, Old Chinese has no [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s; the rising and departing tones of [[Middle Chinese]] are treated as [[reflex (linguistics)|reflexes]] of the Old Chinese post-codas.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=178–185}}

== Initials ==
The primary sources of evidence for the reconstruction of the Old Chinese initials are medieval rhyme dictionaries and phonetic clues in the Chinese script.

=== Middle Chinese initials ===
The reconstruction of Old Chinese often starts from "Early Middle Chinese", the phonological system of the ''[[Qieyun]]'', a [[rhyme dictionary]] published in 601, with many revisions and expansions over the following centuries.
According to its preface, the ''Qieyun'' did not record a single contemporary dialect, but set out to codify the pronunciations of characters to be used when reading the [[Chinese classics|classics]], incorporating distinctions made in different parts of China at the time (a [[diasystem]]).
These dictionaries indicated pronunciation using the ''[[fanqie]]'' method, dividing a [[syllable]] into an initial consonant and the rest, called the final.
[[Rhyme table]]s from the [[Song dynasty]] contain a sophisticated [[distinctive feature|feature]] analysis of the ''Qieyun'' initials and finals, though not a full [[phonemic]] analysis.
Moreover, they were influenced by the different pronunciations of that later period.
Scholars have attempted to determine the phonetic content of the various distinctions by examining pronunciations in modern varieties and loans in Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese (the [[Sinoxenic]] materials), but many details regarding the finals are still disputed.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=32–44}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–42}}

The ''Qieyun'' distinguishes the following initials, each traditionally named with an exemplary word and classified according to the rhyme table analysis:{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=45–59}}{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=12–13}}

By studying sound glosses given by [[Eastern Han]] authors, the Qing philologist [[Qian Daxin]] discovered that the Middle Chinese dental and retroflex stop series were not distinguished at that time.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=44}}{{sfnp|Dong|2014|pp=33–35}}
The resulting inventory of 32 initials (omitting the rare initial {{IPA|/ʐ/}}) is still used by some scholars within China, such as [[He Jiuying]].{{sfnp|He|1991|pp=69–75}}
Early in the 20th century, [[Huang Kan]] identified 19 Middle Chinese initials that occurred with a wide range of finals, calling them the "original ancient initials", from which the other initials were secondary developments:{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=837}}{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=12–13}}

=== Evidence from phonetic series ===
[[File:Shuowen-Shuo.png|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=page of a Chinese dictionary, with headings in seal script and entries in conventional script|Page from a copy of a [[Song dynasty]] edition of the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', an early source on the structure of characters, showing characters with the {{lang|zh-Hant|言}} element]]
Although the Chinese writing system is not alphabetic, comparison of words whose characters share a phonetic element (a phonetic series) yields much information about pronunciation.
Often the characters in a phonetic series are still pronounced alike, as in the character {{lang|zh-Hant|中}} (''zhōng'', 'middle'), which was adapted to write the words ''chōng'' ('pour', {{lang|zh-Hant|沖}}) and ''zhōng'' ('loyal', {{lang|zh-Hant|忠}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1007a,p,k.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other cases the words in a phonetic series have very different sounds in any known variety of Chinese, but are assumed to have been similar at the time the characters were chosen.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=43–44}}

A key principle, first proposed by the Swedish sinologist [[Bernhard Karlgren]], holds that the initials of words written with the same phonetic component had a common [[point of articulation]] in Old Chinese.
For example, since Middle Chinese dentals and retroflex stops occur together in phonetic series, they are traced to a single Old Chinese dental series, with the retroflex stops conditioned by an Old Chinese medial {{IPA|*-r-}}.
The Middle Chinese dental sibilants and retroflex sibilants also occur interchangeably in phonetic series, and are similarly traced to a single Old Chinese sibilant series, with the retroflex sibilants conditioned by the Old Chinese medial {{IPA|*-r-}}.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=228–232}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=191–196, 203–206}}{{efn|In 1940, Karlgren published the first complete reconstruction of Old Chinese in a dictionary called the ''Grammata Serica'', in which characters are arranged by phonetic series within rhyme groups.
The 1957 revision ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' (GSR) remains a standard reference, even though Karlgren's reconstructions have been superseded by the work of later scholars such as [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]], [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|E. G. Pulleyblank]], [[Li Fang-Kuei]] and [[William H. Baxter|William Baxter]].{{sfnp|Schuessler|2009|p=ix}}}}

However, there are several cases where quite different Middle Chinese initials appear together in a phonetic series.
Karlgren and subsequent workers have proposed either additional Old Chinese consonants or initial consonant clusters in such cases.
For example, the Middle Chinese palatal sibilants appear in two distinct kinds of series, with dentals and with velars:{{efn|Middle Chinese forms are given in [[Karlgren–Li reconstruction of Middle Chinese|Li Fang-Kuei's revision of Karlgren's notation]],{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=224–227}} with minor simplifications suggested by {{harvp|Coblin|1986|p=9}}.}}
* {{lang|zh-Hant|周}} ''tśjəu'' (&lt; {{IPA|*tj-}}) 'cycle; Zhou dynasty', {{lang|zh-Hant|彫}} ''tieu'' (&lt; {{IPA|*t-}}) 'carve' and {{lang|zh-Hant|調}} ''dieu'' (&lt; {{IPA|*d-}}) 'adjust'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1083a,p,x.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=192–193}}
* {{lang|zh-Hant|制}} ''tśjäi-'' (&lt; {{IPA|*kj-}}) 'cut out' and {{lang|zh-Hant|猘}} ''kjäi-'' (&lt; {{IPA|*krj-}}) 'mad dog'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 335a,5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=211}}
It is believed that the palatals arose from dentals and velars followed by an Old Chinese medial {{IPA|*-j-}}, unless the medial {{IPA|*-r-}} was also present.
While all such dentals were palatalized, the conditions for palatalization of velars are only partly understood (see [[#Medials|Medials]] below).{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=193–194, 210–214, 569–570}}

Similarly, it is proposed that the {{IPA|*-r-}} medial could occur after labials and velars, complementing the instances proposed as sources of Middle Chinese retroflex dentals and sibilants, to account for such connections as:{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=240–241}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=199–202}}{{efn|Karlgren originally postulated Old Chinese consonant clusters with {{IPA|*-l-}} in such cases.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=110–111}}}}

* {{lang|zh-Hant|監}} ''kam'' (&lt; {{IPA|*kr-}}) 'look at' and {{lang|zh-Hant|藍}} ''lâm'' (&lt; {{IPA|*ɡr-}}) 'indigo'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 609a,k.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=201}}
Thus the Middle Chinese lateral ''l-'' is believed to reflect Old Chinese {{IPA|*-r-}}.
Old Chinese voiced and voiceless laterals {{IPA|*l-}} and {{IPA|*l̥-}} are proposed to account for a different group of series such as
* {{lang|zh-Hant|脫}} ''dwât'' (&lt; {{IPA|*l-}}) and ''thwât'' (&lt; {{IPA|*l̥-}}) 'peel off', {{lang|zh-Hant|悅}} ''jwät'' (&lt; {{IPA|*lj-}}) 'pleased' and {{lang|zh-Hant|說}} ''śjwät'' (&lt; OC {{IPA|*l̥j-}}) 'speak'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 324a,o,m,q.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=197}}{{efn|Originally proposed as voiced and voiceless fricative initials in {{harvp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=114–119}}.}}
This treatment of the Old Chinese liquids is further supported by Tibeto-Burman cognates and by transcription evidence.
For example, the name of the city [[Alexandria Eschate|Alexandria]] was transcribed in the ''[[Book of Han]]'' as ⟨{{lang|zh-Hant|烏弋山離}}⟩, which is reconstructed as {{IPA|*ʔa-ljək-srjan-rjaj}}.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|p=15}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=795, 802, 785, 773}}
Traces of the earlier liquids are also found in the divergent [[Waxiang dialect]] of western [[Hunan]].{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=109–110}}

Voiceless nasal initials {{IPA|*m̥-}}, {{IPA|*n̥-}} and {{IPA|*ŋ̊-}} are proposed (following [[Dong Tonghe]] and [[Edwin Pulleyblank]]) in series such as:{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|p=92}}
* {{lang|zh-Hant|墨}} ''mək'' 'ink' and {{lang|zh-Hant|黑}} ''xək'' (&lt; {{IPA|*m̥-}}) 'black'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 904c,a.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=189}}
* {{lang|zh-Hant|難}} ''nân'' 'difficult' and {{lang|zh-Hant|灘}} ''thân'' (&lt; {{IPA|*n̥-}}) 'foreshore'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 152d,m.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=193}}
* {{lang|zh-Hant|虐}} ''ngjak'' 'cruel' and {{lang|zh-Hant|謔}} ''xjak'' (&lt; {{IPA|*ŋ̊-}}) 'to ridicule'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1118a,d.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=208}}

Clusters {{IPA|*sn-}} and so on are proposed (following Karlgren) for alternations of Middle Chinese nasals and ''s-'' such as
* {{lang|zh-Hant|如}} ''ńźjwo'' (&lt; {{IPA|*nj-}}) 'resemble' and {{lang|zh-Hant|絮}} ''sjwo-'' (&lt; {{IPA|*snj-}}) 'raw silk'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 94g,u.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=222}}
Other cluster initials, including {{IPA|*s}} with stops or stops with {{IPA|*l}}, have been suggested but their existence and nature remains an open question.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=241–243}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=227–234}}

=== Back initials ===
The [[Song dynasty]] rhyme tables classified ''Qieyun'' syllables as either "open" ({{lang|zh-Hant|開}} ''kāi'') or "closed" ({{lang|zh-Hant|合}} ''hé''), with the latter believed to indicate a medial ''-w-'' or lip rounding.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=32}}
This medial was unevenly distributed, being distinctive only after velar and laryngeal initials or before ''-ai'', ''-an'' or ''-at''.
This is taken (following [[André-Georges Haudricourt]] and [[Sergei Yakhontov]]) to indicate that Old Chinese had [[labialised velar|labiovelar]] and labiolaryngeal initials but no labiovelar medial.{{sfnp|Haudricourt|1954b|p=359}}
The remaining occurrences of Middle Chinese ''-w-'' are believed to result from [[vowel breaking|breaking]] of a back vowel before these codas (see [[#Vowels|Vowels]] below).{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=233–234}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=180}}

As Middle Chinese ''g-'' occurs only in palatal environments, Li attempted to derive both ''g-'' and ''ɣ-'' from Old Chinese {{IPA|*ɡ-}}, but had to assume irregular developments in some cases.  [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] showed that several words with Middle Chinese initial ''ɣ-'' were distinguished in modern [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects.  For example, {{lang|zh-Hant|厚}} 'thick' and {{lang|zh-Hant|後}} 'after' were both ''ɣəu:'' in Middle Chinese, but have velar and zero initials respectively in several Min dialects.  Most authors now assume both {{IPA|*ɡ-}} and {{IPA|*ɦ-}}, with subsequent lenition of {{IPA|*ɡ-}} in non-palatal environments.  Similarly {{IPA|*w-}} is assumed as the labialized counterpart of {{IPA|*ɦ-}}.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=209–210}}{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=13–14}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 114a, 115a.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pan Wuyun]] has proposed a revision of the above scheme to account for the fact that Middle Chinese glottal stop and laryngeal fricatives occurred together in phonetic series, unlike dental stops and fricatives, which were usually separated.
Instead of the glottal stop initial {{IPA|*ʔ-}} and fricatives {{IPA|*h-}} and {{IPA|*ɦ-}}, he proposed [[uvular stop]]s {{IPA|*q-}}, {{IPA|*qʰ-}} and {{IPA|*ɢ-}}, and similarly labio-uvular stops {{IPA|*qʷ-}}, {{IPA|*qʷʰ-}} and {{IPA|*ɢʷ-}} in place of {{IPA|*ʔʷ-}}, {{IPA|*hʷ-}} and {{IPA|*w-}}.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=14–15}}{{sfnp|Sagart|2007}}

=== Evidence from Min Chinese ===
Modern [[Min dialects]], particularly those of northwest [[Fujian]], show reflexes of distinctions not reflected in Middle Chinese.
For example, the following dental initials have been identified in reconstructed [[proto-Min language|proto-Min]]:{{sfnp|Norman|1973|pp=227, 230, 233, 235}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=228–229}}

Other points of articulation show similar distinctions within stops and nasals.
Proto-Min voicing is inferred from the development of Min tones, but the phonetic values of the initials are otherwise uncertain.
The sounds indicated as *''-t'', *''-d'', etc. are known as "softened stops" due to their reflexes in [[Jianyang dialect|Jianyang]] and nearby Min varieties in northwestern [[Fujian]], where they appear as fricatives or approximants (e.g. {{IPA|[v l h]}} &lt; ''*-p *-t *-k'' in Jianyang) or are missing entirely, while the non-softened variants appear as stops.  Evidence from early loans into [[Yao languages]] suggests that the softened stops were [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]].{{sfnp|Norman|1986|p=381}}

These distinctions are assumed by most workers to date from the Old Chinese period, but they are not reflected in the widely accepted inventory of Old Chinese initials given above.
For example, although Old Chinese is believed to have had both voiced and voiceless nasals, only the voiced ones yield Middle Chinese nasals, corresponding to both sorts of proto-Min nasal.
The Old Chinese antecedents of these distinctions are not yet agreed, with researchers proposing a variety of consonant clusters.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=187, 219–220}}{{efn|Baxter and Sagart derive the additional aspirated initials from consonant clusters and the softened stops from [[minor syllable]]s.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=91–93}}}}

== Medials ==

The most contentious aspect of the rhyme tables is their classification of the ''Qieyun'' finals into four divisions ({{lang|zh-Hant|等}} ''děng'').{{efn|Finals of divisions I, II and IV occurred only in rows 1, 2 and 4 of the rhyme tables respectively, while division III finals occurred in rows 2, 3 or 4 depending on the initial.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=64, 66, 67, 69}}}}
Most scholars believe that finals of divisions I and IV contained back and front vowels respectively.
Division II is believed to represent retroflexion, and is traced back to the Old Chinese {{IPA|*-r-}} medial discussed above, while division III is usually taken as indicating a ''-j-'' medial.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=32, 36–38}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=64–81}}
Since Karlgren, many scholars have projected this medial (but not ''-w-'') back onto Old Chinese.
The following table shows Baxter's account of the Old Chinese initials and medials leading to the combinations of initial and final types found in Early Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=555}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=235–290}}

Here {{IPA|*P}}, {{IPA|*T}}, {{IPA|*TS}}, {{IPA|*K}} and {{IPA|*Kʷ}} stand for consonant classes in Old Chinese.
Columns III-3 and III-4 represent the ''[[chóngniǔ]]'' distinction among some syllables with division-III finals, which are placed in rows 3 or 4 of the Song dynasty [[rhyme table]]s.
The two are generally identical in modern Chinese varieties, but [[Sinoxenic]] forms often have a palatal element for III-4 but not III-3.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=63, 75–79, 282–287}}{{efn|The precise nature of the ''chóngniǔ'' distinction in Middle Chinese is disputed.  In their Middle Chinese reconstructions, Li and Baxter distinguish them by using ''-ji-'' as a purely notational device for III-4.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|p=224}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=63}}}}

Baxter's account departs from the earlier reconstruction of Li Fang-Kuei in its treatment of {{IPA|*-j-}} and {{IPA|*-rj-}} after labial and guttural initials.
Li proposed {{IPA|*Krj-}} as the source of palatal initials occurring in phonetic series with velars or laryngeals, found no evidence for {{IPA|*Prj-}}, and attributed the ''chongniu'' distinction to the vowel.
Following proposals by Pulleyblank, Baxter explains ''chongniu'' using {{IPA|*-rj-}} and postulates that plain velars and laryngeals were palatalized when followed by both {{IPA|*-j-}} (but not {{IPA|*-rj-}}) and a front vowel.
However a significant number of palatalizations are not explained by this rule.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=555}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=98–107}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=210–214, 280}}

=== Type A and B syllables ===
A fundamental distinction within Middle Chinese is between syllables with division-III finals and the rest, labelled types B and A respectively by Pulleyblank.
Most scholars believe that type B syllables were characterized by a palatal medial ''-j-'' in Middle Chinese.
Although many authors have projected this medial back to a medial {{IPA|*-j-}} in Old Chinese, others have suggested that the Middle Chinese medial was a secondary development not present in Old Chinese.
Evidence includes the use of type B syllables to transcribe foreign words lacking any such medial, the lack of the medial in Tibeto-Burman cognates and modern Min reflexes, and the fact that it is ignored in phonetic series.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=287–290}}{{sfnp|Norman|1994|pp=400–402}}
Nonetheless, scholars agree that the difference reflects a real phonological distinction of some sort, often described noncommittally as a distinction between type A and B syllables using a variety of notations.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1977–1978|pp=183–185}}{{sfnp|Norman|1994|p=400}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=95}}
The distinction has been variously ascribed to:
* the presence or absence of a prefix.  Jakhontov held that type B reflected a prefix {{IPA|*d-}},{{sfnp|Norman|1994|p=400}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=288}} while Ferlus suggested that type A arose from an unstressed prefix {{IPA|*Cə-}} (a [[minor syllable]]), which conditioned syllabic [[tenseness]] contrasting with laxness in type B syllables.{{sfnp|Ferlus|2001|pp=305–307}}
* a length distinction of the main vowel. Pulleyblank initially proposed that type B syllables had longer vowels,{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1992|p=379}} but Starostin and Zhengzhang later proposed long vowels for type A and short vowels for type B.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=550}}{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|1991|pp=160–161}}{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=48–57}}
* a [[prosodic]] distinction, as later proposed by Pulleyblank.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1992|p=379}}
* [[pharyngealization]] of the initial consonant.  [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Norman]] suggested that type B syllables (his class C), which comprised over half of the syllables of the ''Qieyun'', were in fact [[markedness|unmarked]] in Old Chinese.  Instead, he proposed that the remaining syllables were marked by retroflexion (the {{IPA|*-r-}} medial) or pharyngealization, either of which prevented palatalization in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|1994}}  Baxter and [[Laurent Sagart|Sagart]] have adopted a variant of this proposal, reconstructing pharyngealized initials in all type A syllables.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=43, 68–76}}

== Vowels ==

[[File:Gu yanwu.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A Qing dynasty scholar in traditional dress|[[Gu Yanwu]], who began the systematic study of ''[[Shijing]]'' rhymes]]
A reconstruction of Old Chinese finals must explain the rhyming practice of the ''[[Shijing]]'', a collection of songs and poetry from the 10th to 7th centuries BC.
Again some of these songs still rhyme in modern varieties of Chinese, but many do not.
This was attributed to lax rhyming practice until the late-[[Ming dynasty]] scholar [[Chen Di]] argued that a former consistency had been obscured by [[sound change]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=150–155}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=42}}
The systematic study of Old Chinese rhymes began in the 17th century, when [[Gu Yanwu]] divided the rhyming words of the ''Shijing'' into ten rhyme groups (''yùnbù'' {{lang|zh-Hant|韻部}}).{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=155–157}}
These groups were subsequently refined by other scholars, culminating in a standard set of 31 in the 1930s.
One of these scholars, [[Duan Yucai]], stated the important principle that characters in the same phonetic series would be in the same rhyme group,{{efn|{{lang|zh-Hant|同聲必同部}} ''Tóng shēng bì tóng bù''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=831}}}} making it possible to assign almost all words to rhyme groups.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=157–170}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=43–44}}

Assuming that rhyming syllables had the same main vowel, Li Fang-Kuei proposed a system of four vowels {{IPA|*i}}, {{IPA|*u}}, {{IPA|*ə}} and {{IPA|*a}}.
He also included three diphthongs {{IPA|*iə}}, {{IPA|*ia}} and {{IPA|*ua}} to account for syllables that were placed in rhyme groups reconstructed with {{IPA|*ə}} or {{IPA|*a}} but were distinguished in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=243–247}}
In the late 1980s, [[Zhengzhang Shangfang]], [[Sergei Starostin]] and William Baxter (following [[Nicholas Bodman]]) independently argued that these rhyme groups should be split, refining the 31 traditional rhyme groups into more than 50 groups corresponding to a six-vowel system.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=42–43}}{{sfnp|Starostin|1989|pp=343–429}}{{sfnp|Bodman|1980|p=47}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=180, 253–254, 813}}{{sfnp|Baxter|2006}}
Baxter supported this thesis with a statistical analysis of the rhymes of the ''Shijing'', though there were too few rhymes with codas {{IPA|*-p}}, {{IPA|*-m}} and {{IPA|*-kʷ}} to produce statistically significant results.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=560–562}}

The following table illustrates these analyses, listing the names of the 31 traditional rhyme groups with their Middle Chinese reflexes and their postulated Old Chinese vowels in the systems of Li and Baxter.
Following the traditional analysis, the rhyme groups are organized into three parallel sets, depending on the corresponding type of coda in Middle Chinese.
For simplicity, only Middle Chinese finals of divisions I and IV are listed, as the complex vocalism of divisions II and III is believed to reflect the influence of Old Chinese medials {{IPA|*-r-}} and {{IPA|*-j-}} (see previous section).&lt;ref&gt;Tabulation of rhyme groups from {{harvp|Pulleyblank|1977–1978|p=181}} and {{harvp|Norman|1988|p=48}}.

|}

== Tones and final consonants ==
There has been much controversy over the relationship between final consonants and tones, and indeed whether Old Chinese lacked the tones characteristic of later periods, as first suggested by the [[Ming dynasty]] scholar [[Chen Di]].{{efn|{{zh|c=“四聲之辯，古人未有。”}} in Chen Di (1541–1617), ''Máo Shī Gǔ Yīn Kǎo'' {{lang|zh-Hant|《毛詩古音考》}}, quoted in {{harvp|Wang|1985|p=72}}.}}

The [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of Middle Chinese were first described by [[Shen Yue]] around AD 500.
They were the "level" ({{lang|zh-Hant|平}} ''píng''), "rising" ({{lang|zh-Hant|上}} ''shǎng''), "departing" ({{lang|zh-Hant|去}} ''qù''), and "[[checked tone|entering]]" ({{lang|zh-Hant|入}} ''rù'') tones, with the last category consisting of the syllables ending in stops (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k'').{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=303}}
Although rhymes in the ''Shijing'' usually respect these tone categories, there are many cases of characters that are now pronounced with different tones rhyming together in the songs, mostly between the departing and entering tones.
This led [[Duan Yucai]] to suggest that Old Chinese lacked the departing tone.
[[Wang Niansun]] (1744 - 1832) and  [[Jiang Yougao]] (d.1851) decided that the language had the same tones as Middle Chinese, but some words had later shifted between tones, a view that is still widely held among linguists in China.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=304–305}}{{sfnp|Wang|1985|pp=72–77}}

Karlgren also noted many cases where words in the departing and entering tones shared a phonetic element, e.g.
* {{lang|zh-Hant|賴}} ''lâi-'' 'depend on' and {{lang|zh-Hant|剌}} ''lât'' 'wicked'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 272e,a.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|zh-Hant|欬}} ''khəi-'' 'cough' and {{lang|zh-Hant|刻}} ''khək'' 'cut; engrave'&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 937s,v.&lt;/ref&gt;
He suggested that the departing tone words in such pairs had ended with a final voiced stop ({{IPA|*-d}} or {{IPA|*-ɡ}}) in Old Chinese.{{sfnp|Karlgren|1923|pp=27–30}}
Being unwilling to split rhyme groups, Dong Tonghe and Li Fang-Kuei extended these final voiced stops to whole rhyme groups.
The only exceptions were the {{lang|zh-Hant|歌}} and {{lang|zh-Hant|祭}} groups (Li's {{IPA|*-ar}} and {{IPA|*-ad}}), in which the traditional analysis already distinguished the syllables with entering tone contacts.
The resulting scarcity of open syllables has been criticized on [[Linguistic typology|typological]] grounds.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=331–333}}
Wang Li preferred to reallocate words with connections to the entering tone to the corresponding entering tone group, proposing that the final stop was lost after a long vowel.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=340–342}}

Another perspective is provided by [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]]'s demonstration that the tones of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which have a very similar structure to those of Middle Chinese, were derived from earlier final consonants.
The Vietnamese counterparts of the rising and departing tones derived from a final glottal stop and {{IPA|*-s}} respectively, the latter developing to a glottal fricative {{IPA|*-h}}.
These glottal post-codas respectively conditioned rising and falling pitch contours, which became distinctive when the post-codas were lost.{{sfnp|Haudricourt|1954a}}
Haudricourt also suggested that the Chinese departing tone was reflected an Old Chinese derivational suffix {{IPA|*-s}}.
The connection with stop finals would then be explained as syllables ending with {{IPA|*-ts}} or {{IPA|*-ks}}, with the stops later disappearing, allowing rhymes with open syllables.{{sfnp|Haudricourt|1954b|pp=363–364}}
The absence of a corresponding labial final could be attributed to early [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of {{IPA|*-ps}} to {{IPA|*-ts}}.
Pulleyblank supported the theory with several examples of syllables in the departing tone being used to transcribe foreign words ending in ''-s'' into Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=308–317}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=54–57}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962b|pp=216–225}}

Pulleyblank took Haudricourt's suggestion to its logical conclusion, proposing that the Chinese rising tone had also arisen from a final glottal stop.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962b|pp=225–227}}
Mei Tsu-lin supported this theory with evidence from early transcriptions of Sanskrit words, and pointed out that rising tone words end in a glottal stop in some modern Chinese dialects, e.g. [[Wenzhounese]] and some Min dialects.{{sfnp|Mei|1970}}
In addition, most of the entering tone words that rhyme with rising tone words in the ''Shijing'' end in ''-k''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=322}}

Together, these hypotheses lead to the following set of Old Chinese syllable codas:{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=181–183}}

|}
Baxter also speculated on the possibility of a glottal stop occurring after oral stop finals.
The evidence is limited, and consists mainly of contacts between rising tone syllables and ''-k'' finals, which could alternatively be explained as phonetic similarity.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=323–324}}

To account for phonetic series and rhymes in which MC ''-j'' alternates with ''-n'', [[Sergei Starostin]] proposed that MC ''-n'' in such cases derived from Old Chinese {{IPA|*-r}}.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=843}}
Other scholars have suggested that such contacts are due to dialectal mixture, citing evidence that {{IPA|*-n}} had disappeared from eastern dialects by the [[Eastern Han]] period.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=294–297}}

'''Quine's paradox''' is a [[paradox]] concerning [[truth value]]s, attributed to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. It is related to the [[liar paradox]] as a problem, and it purports to show that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use [[demonstrative]]s or [[indexicality|indexicals]] (i.e. it does not explicitly refer to itself). The paradox can be expressed as follows:

:"yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.

If the paradox is not clear, consider each part of the above description of the paradox incrementally:

:it = ''yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation''
:its quotation = ''"yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation"''
:it preceded by its quotation = ''"yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.''

With these tools, the description of the paradox may now be reconsidered; it can be seen to assert the following:
:The statement "''{{'}}yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation{{'}}'' yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" is false.

In other words, the sentence implies that it is false, which is paradoxical—for if it is false, what it states is in fact true.

== Motivation ==
The [[liar paradox]] ("This sentence is false", or "The next sentence is true. The previous sentence is false") demonstrates essential difficulties in assigning a truth value even to simple sentences. Many philosophers, attempting to explain the liar paradox, concluded that the problem was with the use of [[demonstrative]] word "this" or its replacements.  Once we properly analyze this sort of [[self-reference]], according to said philosophers, the paradox no longer arises.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Quine's construction demonstrates that paradox of this kind arises independently of such direct self-reference, for, no [[lexeme]] of the sentence refers to the ''sentence,'' though Quine's sentence does contain a lexeme which refers to one of its ''parts''. Namely, "its" near the end of the sentence is a [[possessive pronoun]] whose antecedent is the very predicate in which it occurs. Thus, although Quine's sentence ''per se'' is not self-referring, it does contain a self-referring predicate.

== Application ==
Quine suggested an unnatural linguistic resolution to such logical [[antinomy|antinomies]], inspired by [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Type theory]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s work. His system would attach levels to a line of problematic expressions such as ''falsehood'' and ''denote''. Entire sentences would stand higher in the hierarchy than their parts. The form {{"'}}Clause about falsehood&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;' yields falsehood&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" will be grammatically correct, and {{"'}}Denoting&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phrase' denotes&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; itself" – wrong.

[[George Boolos]], inspired by his student Michael Ernst, has written that the sentence might be syntactically ambiguous, in using multiple [[quotation marks]] whose exact mate marks cannot be determined. He revised traditional quotation into a system where the length of outer pairs of so-called ''q-marks'' of an expression is determined by the q-marks that appear inside the expression. This accounts not only for ordered quotes-within-quotes but also to, say, strings with an odd number of quotation marks.

In [[Gödel, Escher, Bach|''Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid'']], author [[Douglas Hofstadter]] suggests that the Quine sentence in fact uses an [[Indirect self-reference|indirect type of self-reference]]. He then shows that indirect self-reference is crucial in many of the proofs of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

{{Wiktionary|rapport}}
'''Rapport''' is a close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned are “in sync” with each other, understand each other's feelings or ideas, and communicate smoothly.

The word stems from the old French verb ''rapporter'' which means literally to carry something back;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manser |first1=Martin |last2=Turton |first2=Nigel |title=Advanced Learners Dictionary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |year=1998 |isbn=1-85326-763-5 |page=574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapport |title= Rapport – Definition |publisher= Merriam Webster |accessdate= 22 Mar 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the sense of how people relate to each other means that what one person sends out the other sends back. For example, they may realize that they share similar values, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors around politics, music or sports.&lt;ref name="KatzSweedler2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Neil H. Katz |author2=Marcia Koppelman Sweedler |author3=John W.

There are a number of techniques that are supposed to be beneficial in building rapport such as: matching your [[body language]] (i.e., [[Human position|posture]], [[gesture]], etc.);&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; indicating attentiveness through maintaining [[eye contact]];&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhao |first1=Ran |last2=Papangelis |first2=Alexandros |last3=Cassell |first3=Justine |chapter=Towards a Dyadic Computational Model of Rapport Management for Human-Virtual Agent Interaction |chapter-url=http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/publications/Zhao,%20Papangelis,%20Cassell%20IVA2014.pdf |title=Intelligent Virtual Agents |date=2014 |pages=514–527 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-09767-1_62 |isbn=978-3-319-09767-1 |editor1-last=Bickmore |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Marsella |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Sidner |editor3-first=C. |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=8637 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and matching [[breath]]ing [[rhythm]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. In conversation, some verbal behaviors associated with increased rapport are the use of positivity (or, positive "face management"), sharing personal information of gradually increasing intimacy (or, "[[self-disclosure]]"), and by referring to shared interests or experiences.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

Rapport has been shown to have benefits for psychotherapy and medicine,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Falkenström |first1=F |last2=Hatcher |first2=R |last3=Skjulsvik |first3=T |last4=Larsson |first4=M |last5=Holmqvist |first5=R |title=Development and Validation of a 6-item Working Alliance Psychotherapy |url=http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:802104/FULLTEXT01.pdf |journal=Psychological Assessment |date=2014 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.1037/pas0000038 |pmid=25346997}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drolet |first1=Aimee |last2=Morris |first2=Michael |title=Rapport in Conflict Resolution: Accounting for How Face-to-Face Contact Fosters Mutual Cooperation in Mixed-Motive Conflict |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/336e/291572583c58c0209c3dd7d374ee0927dcad.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2000 |volume=36 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.1006/jesp.1999.1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and education,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frisby |first1=Brandi |last2=Martin |first2=Matthew |title=Instructor–Student and Student–Student Rapport in the Classroom |journal=Communication Education |date=2010 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=146 |doi=10.1080/03634520903564362}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In each of these cases, the rapport between members of a dyad (e.g. a teacher and student or doctor and patient) allows the participants to coordinate their actions and establish a mutually beneficial working relationship, or what is often called a “working alliance”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Building ==
To achieve the benefits of interpersonal rapport in domains like education, medicine, or even sales, several methods have been shown to build rapport between people. These methods include coordination, showing your attentiveness to the other, building commonality, and managing the other's self-perception (also called "face" management).&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

=== Methods ===

==== Coordination ====
Coordination, also called "mirroring"&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; means getting into rhythm with another person, or coordinating one's verbal or nonverbal behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building Rapport |last=Graham |first=Colly |url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/3151/Building-Rapport--Customer-Relationships.html |accessdate=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Emotional mirroring''' – Empathizing with someone's emotional state by being on 'their side'. You must apply the skill of being a good listener in this situation so as you can listen for key words and problems that arise when speaking with the person. This is so you can talk about these issues and question them to better your understanding of what they are saying and show your empathy towards them (Arnold, E and Boggs, josh. 2007).
* '''Posture mirroring''' – Matching the tone of a person's body language not through direct imitation, as this can appear as mockery, but through mirroring the general message of their posture and energy.
* '''Tone and tempo mirroring''' – Matching the tone, tempo, inflection, and volume of a person's voice.

==== Mutual attentiveness ====
Another way of building rapport is by each partner indicating their attentiveness to the other.&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; This attentiveness may take the form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person,&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt; nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers' "immediacy" behaviors in the classroom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, similar to the coordination&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; or in the reciprocal sharing of personal details about the other person that signal one's knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

==== Commonality ====
Commonality is the technique of deliberately finding something in common with a person or a customer in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust.
This is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Establish trust and rapport |last=DeGroot |first=Bob |url=http://www.saleshelp.com/guestservices/destinations/newsletter/step7trustrapport.htm|accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sharing personal details or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality, and thus increase rapport.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

==== Face management ====
Another way of building rapport is through what is often referred to as "positive face management",&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer-Oatey|first1=Helen|title=(Im)Politeness, Face and Perceptions of Rapport: Unpackaging their Bases and Interrelationships|journal=Politeness Research|date=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=95–119|doi=10.1515/jplr.2005.1.1.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also simply be called positivity. According to some psychologists,&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"/&gt; we have a need to be seen in a positive light, known as our "face". By managing each other's "face", boosting it when necessary, or reducing negative impacts to it, we are able to build rapport with others.&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"/&gt;

==Benefits==
There have been a number of proposed benefits from building interpersonal rapport, which all revolve around smoother interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; though the specifics differ by the domain.

In the medical domain, doctor-patient rapport is often called the "Working Alliance", and is a measure of the collaboration quality between doctor (or therapist) and patient, often used as a predictor of therapy outcomes or patients' prescription adherence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In education, teacher-student rapport is predictive of students' participation in the course, their course retention, likelihood to take a course in that domain again, and has sometimes been used to predict course outcomes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Some have argued that teacher-student rapport is an essential element of what makes an effective teacher, or the ability to manage interpersonal relationships and build a positive, pro-social, atmosphere of trust and reduced anxiety.&lt;ref name="Teaching of Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Daniel|title=Further Validation of the Learning Alliance Inventory: The Roles of Working Alliance, Rapport, and Immediacy in Student Learning|journal=Teaching of Psychology|date=2015|volume=42|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1177/0098628314562673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student-student rapport, on the other hand, while largely out of the teacher's ability to control, is also predictive of reduced anxiety in the course, feelings of a supportive class culture, and improved participation in class discussions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In negotiation, rapport is beneficial for reaching mutually beneficial outcomes,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as partners are more likely to trust each other and be willing to cooperate and reach a positive outcome. However, others have found that interpersonal rapport in negotiation can lead to unethical behavior, particularly in impasse situations, where the interpersonal rapport may influence the negotiators to behave unethically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jap|first1=Sandy|last2=Robertson|first2=Diana|last3=Hamilton|first3=Ryan|title=The Dark Side of Rapport: Agent Misbehavior Face-to-Face and Online|journal=Management Science|date=2011|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1610–1622|doi=10.1287/mnsc.1110.1359|ssrn=1789782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying==
To better study how rapport can lead to the above benefits, researchers generally adopt one of three main approaches: self-report surveys given to the participants,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; third-party observations from a naive observer,&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; and some form of automated computational detection, using computer vision and machine learning.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

Self-report surveys typically consist of a set of questions given at the end of the interaction, asking the participants to reflect on their relationship with another person and rate various aspects of that relationship, typically on a Likert scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Though this is the most common approach, it suffers from unreliability of self-report data, such as the issue of separating participants' reflection on a single interaction with their relationship with the other person more broadly.&lt;ref name="Teaching of Psychology"/&gt;

To address these issues, others have used a third-party observer to give a rating of the rapport to a particular segment of the interaction, often called a "slice".&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt; Other recent work uses techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to computationally detect the level of rapport between members of a dyad.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

'''Samuel Chandanappally''' (13 May 1940 – 3 July 2000), who was born C.D. Samuel, was an Indian writer, college professor and orator.

In his lifetime, he wrote around 30 books in [[Malayalam]].  His book titled ''Malankara Sabha Pithakkanmar'', contains the study about the writings of the holy fathers of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] community and is considered a reference text.

Dr. Samuel Chandanappally collected most of the writings of [[Geevarghese Mar Gregorios|Saint Gregorios]] of [[Parumala]] after a long period of research and published them with the title ''Holy writings (Pavithra Rachanakal)'' in 1980.

==Biography==
Shaaban was born in the sleepy village of Vibamba, south of [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga City]] in Tanzania (then [[German East Africa]]). The surname Robert is a name of a British colonial officer who requested his parent to name him after him. Thus in real sense, Robert was his second name (not his surname or last name), his first name being Shaaban. Shaaban himself for a time wrote it 'Roberts' rather than 'Robert'. From 1922 to 1926 he was educated in [[Dar es Salaam]], coming in second in a class of 11 to receive the School Leaving Certificate under the then British colonial educational system in Tanganyika.&lt;ref name=shaaban/&gt;

===Career===
After receiving the school certificate, Shaaban worked at various posts as a colonial government civil servant. From 1926 to 1944 he was a customs official at different locations throughout the territory. From 1944 to 1946 he worked for the Game Department. From 1946 to 1952 he worked in the Tanga District Office, and from 1952 to 1960 he was in the Survey Office there. He worked very closely with the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) and [[Julius Nyerere]]. Many of his civil service experiences are woven into his writings. During his lifetime he received the Margaret Wrong Prize and Medal for African Literature and was honored by the British government as a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (M.B.E.).&lt;ref name=shaaban/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiana.edu/~libsalc/africa/scripts/awards1.php?award=115 |title=Margaret Wrong Prize and Medal for African Literature |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual work==
Robert contributed to the promotion of the [[Swahili language]] and the struggle for the dignity of mankind. He was a celebrated [[humanism|humanist]]. He worked for freedom and gender equality, and was against racial and religious discrimination in Tanzania. Tanzania's first president, Julius Nyerere, had complete admiration for the late Shaaban Robert, and greatly valued and promoted his intellectual work. His was also equally respectful of both Muslims and Christians. That is reflected in his two unusual names (Shaaban—Muslim name and Robert, a Christian name).[The name Robert was in fact one of his father's several names, the others being Selemani and Ufukwe]

Sheikh Shaaban Robert succeeded in writing essays, books, prose and poems and some of his literature is part of school curricula and higher education reading. Some of his books included ''Maisha Yangu na Baada ya Miaka Hamsini'', ''Kusadikika'', and ''Wasifu wa Siti binti Saad''. His works are still being discovered and published. To date he has 24 known works.

'''Slut''' is generally a term for a woman or girl who is considered to have loose [[sexual morals]] or who is sexually [[promiscuous]].&lt;ref name="Slut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slut|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/slut}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slut 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slut|publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/slut}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used as an [[insult]], [[sexual slur]] or offensive term of disparagement ([[slut-shaming]]).&lt;ref name="Slut 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathanson"&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/slutwalk_rally.php SlutWalk Rally Against Sexual Violence Draws Huge Crowd of Feminists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504171729/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/slutwalk_rally.php |date=2012-05-04 }}, Rebecca Nathanson, ''[[The Village Voice]]'', October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It originally meant "a dirty, slovenly woman",&lt;ref name="Slut 2"/&gt; and is rarely used to refer to men, generally requiring clarification by use of the terms ''male slut'' or ''[[man whore]]''.&lt;ref name="Paludi"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michele A. |last1=Paludi |first2=Jennifer L. |last2=Martin |first3=James E. |last3=Gruber |first4=Susan |last4=Fineran|title=Sexual Harassment in Education and Work Settings: Current Research and Best Practices for Prevention|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=1440832943|year=2015|page=15|accessdate=December 4, 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovpPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Wood|title=Gendered Lives|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=1285075935|year=2014|page=108|accessdate=December 4, 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMoTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the word was a reference to a man, in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', in which he is referring to the man's untidy appearance. 

''[[Slut-shaming]]'' is a related term, referring to the act of drawing attention to a person's promiscuous behavior for the purpose of [[shaming]] them socially. From the late 20th century, there have been attempts to [[Reappropriation|reclaim]] the word, exemplified by various [[SlutWalk]] parades, and some individuals embrace the title as a source of pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/women_shealth/8510743/These-slut-walk-women-are-simply-fighting-for-their-right-to-be-dirty.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Germaine | last=Greer | title=These 'slut walk' women are simply fighting for their right to be dirty | date=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13333013 | work=BBC News | title=Why is the word 'slut' so powerful? | date=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology, common usages and synonyms==
The common [[denotative meaning]]s are a sexually promiscuous woman,&lt;ref name="Slut"/&gt; or "an immoral or dissolute woman; prostitute."&lt;ref name="Slut 2"/&gt; These definitions identify a slut as a woman of low character—a person who lacks the ability or chooses not to exercise a power of discernment to order her affairs. Similar terms used for men are ''cad'', ''[[rake (character)|rake]]'', ''male slut'', ''man whore'', [[himbo]], ''womanizer'', ''stud'', and ''player''.&lt;ref name="Paludi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; The adjective ''slutty'' carries a similar connotation, but can be applied both to people and to clothing and accessories, such as [[Halloween costume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Carroll | first = Caitlin | title = What's the deal with slutty Halloween costumes? | url = http://www.gwhatchet.com/2005/10/31/whats-the-deal-with-slutty-halloween-costumes/ | work = [[The GW Hatchet]] (student newspaper) | publisher = [[George Washington University]] | date = 31 October 2005 | access-date = 27 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ultimate origin of the word ''slut'' is unknown, it first appeared in [[Middle English]] in 1402 as ''slutte'' ([[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|AHD]]), with the meaning "a dirty, untidy, or slovenly woman".&lt;ref name="etymonline-slut"&gt;{{OEtymD|slut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used the word ''sluttish'' (c. 1386) to describe a slovenly man; however, later uses appear almost exclusively associated with women.&lt;ref name="etymonline-slut"/&gt; The modern sense of "a sexually promiscuous woman" dates to at least 1450.&lt;ref name="etymonline-slut"/&gt;  The word was originally used around 1450 in the late Middle English language.  It was used to describe a woman as dirty, or refer to her as a prostitute, harlot, or immoral woman.  The word slut also took a similar form around the same era in the Norwegian language as "slutr" sleet, also known as an impure liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/slut|title=the definition of slut|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early meaning was "kitchen maid or drudge" (c. 1450), a meaning retained as late as the 18th century, when hard knots of dough found in bread were referred to as "slut's pennies".&lt;ref name="etymonline-slut"/&gt; A notable example of this use is [[Samuel Pepys]]'s diary description of his servant girl as "an admirable slut" who "pleases us mightily, doing more service than both the others and deserves wages better" (February 1664).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepys.info/1664/1664feb.html |title=Samuel Pepys Diary February 1664 complete |publisher=Pepys.info |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Slut" and "slutishness" occur in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', written in 1599 or 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''[[As You Like It]]'' (III, iii, 1531–1537). "[Audrey:] Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me / honest. / [Touchstone:] Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were / to put good meat into an unclean dish. / [Audrey:] I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. / [Touchstone:] Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; / sluttishness may come hereafter.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, the word was used as a [[euphemism]] in place of "bitch" in the sense of a female dog.&lt;ref name="etymonline-slut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google books"&gt;{{cite book | last = Soule | first = Richar | title = A dictionary of English synonymes and synonymous or parallel expressions designed as a practical guide to aptness and variety of phraseology | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | year = 1891 | oclc = 7437533 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=gGRZb19bG5gC&amp;pg=PA49 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term ''slut'' has a pervasive presence in popular culture and [[pornography]], but is almost exclusively used to describe women. An exact male equivalent of the term does not exist. The lack of a comparably popular term for men highlights the [[double standard]] in societal expectations ([[gender role]]s) between males and females, as negative terms for sexually promiscuous males are rare.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sigal | first1 = Janet A. | last2 = Denmark | first2 = Florence L. | author-link2 = Florence Denmark | title = Violence against girls and women: international perspectives | publisher = Praeger, An Imprint of ABC-CLIO, LLC | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781440803352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 220 terms ascribed to females and 20 terms ascribed to males,&lt;ref name="Paludi"/&gt; all female terms are disapproving while some male terms signal approval or praise; these include ''stud'', ''player'', and ''man whore''.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; While colloquial terms such as ''male slut'' or ''man whore'' are used in popular culture, it is usually used in a joking manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are, however, other terms that can be used to criticize men for their sexuality. For example, a man's masculinity can be undermined by using terms such as ''weak'', ''[[sissy]]'', ''[[pussy]],'' or ''whipped.'' They also dismiss female-on-male abuse, and are just as powerful and representative of modern societal prejudices. Hence, women may find it difficult to hold high positions at their workplace, whereas men may be mocked for choosing to be stay-at-home fathers. Although a sexually active and professionally successful woman might be seen as a threat, a man without those qualities is often regarded with suspicion and questions about his sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11159850/Is-there-a-male-equivalent-to-calling-a-woman-a-slut.html|title=Is there a male equivalent to calling a woman a 'slut'?|last=Devon|first=Natasha|date=15 Oct 2014|work=|access-date=2 December 2016|via=Telegraph UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''slut'' is commonly interchanged with the words ''[[Tramp#Tramp as promiscuous woman|tramp]]'', ''whore'', ''hoe'', ''[[nympho]]'', and ''hooker.'' All of these words have a very negative connotation. Additional meanings and connotations of the term are negative and identify a slut as being a slovenly and ugly person, for example, as in these quotations from [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED2]]:
:Hearne, 1715: "Nor was she a Woman of any Beauty, but was a nasty Slut."
:[[William Shenstone|Shenstone]], 1765: "She's ugly, she's old, ...&amp;nbsp;And a slut, and a scold."
The attack on the character of the person is perhaps best brought together by the highly suggestive and related compound word, ''slut's-hole'', meaning a place or receptacle for rubbish;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | term = slut's-hole | id = 22331849 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the associated quote provides a sense of this original meaning:
:''[[Saturday Review (London)]]'', 1862: "There are a good many slut-holes in London to rake out."

"Slut" can also be used as verb to denote behavior characterized as that of a slut. For example, in the 1972 play, ''[[That Championship Season]]'', by [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]], contained the exchange:

{{quote|
:COACH: I don't care what that hot pantsed bitch said. Go home and kick her ass all over the kitchen. All that slutting around... 
:GEORGE. She's not a slut... 
:COACH. She was punished for slutting, wasn't she? She was punished and so were you!&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]], ''[[That Championship Season]]'' (1972), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''All Women's Talk'' posted an article titled ''10 Signs You Might Be a Slut...'' Some of the noted signs included "you don't go on real dates", "you dress provocatively", and "you have an STD." These are the common misconceptions and stereotypes that are attached to this word.&lt;ref&gt;''All Women's Talk'' "10 Signs You Might Be a Slut" http://love.allwomenstalk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:I Am A.jpg|thumb|On June 4, 2011, hundreds gathered at the [[Alberta Legislature]] grounds in Edmonton, Canada, to protest against what they perceived as prevalent [[victim blaming|blaming-the-victim]] attitudes.]]

The word ''slut'' is used as a slang term in the [[BDSM]], [[polyamory|polyamorous]], and [[LGBT|gay and bisexual]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Catherine A. Liszt. 1997. The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities.Greenery Press. {{ISBN|1-890159-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel exists between the female term ''slut'' and the term ''[[gay]]'' for males. Unlike women, who are usually policed for being sexually promiscuous, men are often criticized for not being masculine or dominant enough, thus questioning their [[heterosexuality]]. Unlike women, who are expected to be sexually chaste, men are expected to be sexually active, thus having more sexual freedom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flood|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Male and Female Sluts.|url=https://works.bepress.com/michael_flood/25/download/ |dead-url=no |journal=Australian Feminist Studies|volume=28|pages=95–107|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''slut'' is rarely used to describe heterosexual men, it is commonly used among gay males. When discussing sexual activity, ''slut'' is used to shame gay men for taking sexual risks, such as [[unprotected sex]] or having multiple partners. However, if used in a humorous way, ''slut'' may also favor sexual freedom and mark the shift from traditional gender roles in gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDavitt|first1=Bryce|last2=Mutchler|first2=Matt G|title='Dude, you’re such a slut!' Barriers and facilitators of sexual communication among young gay men and their best friends.|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|date=2014|volume=29 |issue=4|pages=464–498|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[BDSM]], polyamorous, and [[non-monogamy|non-monogamous]] people, in usage taken from the book ''[[The Ethical Slut]]'', the term has been used as an expression of choice to openly have multiple [[Domestic partnership|partner]]s, and revel in that choice: "a slut is a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that ''sex is nice and pleasure is good for you''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Ethical Slut]] |last=Easton |first=Dossie |authorlink= |author2=Catherine A. Liszt  |year=1997 |publisher=Greenery Press |location=San Francisco |isbn=1-890159-01-8 |page=4 |quote=emphasis in original }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''slut'' is a person who has taken control of their sexuality and has sex with whomever they choose, regardless of religious or social pressures or conventions to conform to a straight-laced monogamous lifestyle committed to one partner for life. 

The term has been [[reappropriated]] to express the rejection of the concept that government, society, or religion may judge or control one's personal liberties, and the right to control one's own sexuality. In April 2013, Emily Lindin, founder of the UnSlut Project, created a blog to share her stories on sexual bullying to “provide some perspective to girls who currently feel trapped and ashamed". The blog now consists of entries from members of all ages, ethnicities, and genders. The film, ''UnSlut: A Documentary Film'', coincides with the project and is screened across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unslutproject.com/about.html|title = The UnSlut Project|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Lindin|first = Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slut shaming in college is related to "class, gender, culture, media, feminism, ethnicity, religion and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Almazan|first1=Vanessa A.|last2=Steve F|first2=Bain|title=College Students' Perceptions of Slut-Shaming Discourse on Campus.|journal=Research in Higher Education Journal|date=30 April 2015|volume=28|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1062095|accessdate=4 April 2018|language=en|issn=1941-3432}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually related to "slut-labeling"; the word is used to define one individual's sexuality and his or her attitude towards sexuality. The word "dress code" is being viewed as slut shaming because it creates a double standard for people, especially women.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

The double standard associated with "slut-labeling" is part of the modern day [[rape culture]].  Rape culture is "the casual debasement [of women] ... that has become such a part of our lives that it is often invisible."&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Breger |first1=Melissa L. |title=Transforming cultural norms of sexual violence against women. |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Transforming+cultural+norms+of+sexual+violence+against+women.-a0397454239 |publisher=Journal of Research in Gender Studies |accessdate=10 August 2018 |date=1 July 2014|via=Free Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though people in society are vocally anti-rape, there is an insinuation that certain types of rape are acceptable or that women are voluntarily taking actions that justify sexual advances. "For example, women continue to be blamed if they are raped because of how they are dressed, the assumption that women purportedly lie about being raped remains popular, and certain women, such as married women or women of colour, are still considered 'unrapeable'”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.rdsinc.com/texis/rds/suite/+_tOeXBniwFqo15nGW_68TFqnh1ccewx1qmMwwwewhanme_9rQeiyowww/showdoc.html?thisTbl=CWI|title=Login Required|website=search.rdsinc.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''slut'' and the double standard it contains reflects the gender norms and gender biases&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; that are prevalent in a culture in which rape is constantly justified.  People from all sects of society contribute to this justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/sexual-assault-survivor-reaction.html|title=For Many Women, Trump’s ‘Locker Room Talk’ Brings Memories of Abuse|date=11 October 2016|publisher=|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many movements or "[[SlutWalk]]s" taking place around the world to regain a sense of pride in women. Many slut walks or movements protest against the idea that a woman's appearance, often considered promiscuous, is a justification of sexual assault and rape. The participants in these walks protest against individuals that excuse rape due to the woman's appearance, including victim blaming and slut shaming; slut walks have now become a worldwide movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalkdc.com/|title=SlutWalk DC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women of color===

The word ''slut'' means different things to white women and [[people of color]], especially black women. ''Slut'' has different associations for black women. [[Anna North]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' covered Leora Tanenbaum who stated, "As Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves 'slut' without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is."&lt;ref name="Should 'Slut' Be Retired"&gt;{{cite web|last1=North|first1=Anna|title=Should 'Slut' Be Retired?|url=http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/should-slut-be-retired/?_r=1|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that, for black women, the word ''slut'' does not mean anything very harmful due to the history of being treated as slaves in the past. Black women's "relationship to the term ''slut''" is informed by a history of racism and slavery, of "having been seen as objects of property, not just for the sexual gratification of those in power but also for reproduction of whole generations of slaves, which involved rape most of the time."&lt;ref name="Should 'Slut' Be Retired"/&gt;

Most of the SlutWalks were coordinated by white women, and black women felt uncomfortable when joining the slut walk. Scholar Jo Reger stated, "Women of color ... argued that the white women organizers and participants had not considered the ways in which the sexuality of women of color had been constructed through a history of oppression, rape, and sexual exploitation."&lt;ref name="jce.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reger|first1=Jo|title=The Story of a Slut Walk1: Sexuality, Race, and Generational Divisions in Contemporary Feminist Activism|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|date=February 2015|volume=44|issue=SAGE|page=88|url=http://jce.sagepub.com/content/44/1/84.full.pdf+html|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of color, especially black people, had been avoiding words like ''slut'', ''jezebel'', ''hottentot'', ''mammy'', ''mule'', ''sapphire'', or ''welfare queens''.&lt;ref name="jce.sagepub.com"/&gt; Starting the SlutWalk meant black people had to face all these words that used to be used against them.

Model and actress [[Amber Rose]] was one of the first people to conduct and take a lead for a SlutWalk for people of color. "The Amber Rose SlutWalk Festival is a completely inclusive space. This event is a zero tolerance event and we do not condone hateful language, racism, sexism, ableism, fat-shaming, transphobia or any other kind of bigotry. Further, we recognize that shaming, oppression, assault and violence have disproportionately impacted marginalized groups, including women of color, transgender people and sex workers, and thus we are actively working to center these groups at our events."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Amber|title=The Amber Rose Slutwalk|url=http://amberroseslutwalk.com/general-information/|website=About the Walk|publisher=Amber Rose|accessdate=1 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060548/http://amberroseslutwalk.com/general-information/|archivedate=3 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">'''Spocanian''' ({{lang-nl|Spokaans}}) is a [[constructed languages|constructed language]], created by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist [[Rolandt Tweehuysen]]. Unlike such invented languages as [[Esperanto]], Spocanian was never intended to be used for international communication; instead, it serves as the language of [[Spocania]], a fictional island group in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], southwest of [[Ireland]].

Spocania and Spocanian are typical examples of early [[geofiction]], predating the [[Internet]]. Tweehuysen started working on them when he was still a boy, in 1962. Over the years, they have attracted much press, radio and television attention in the Netherlands. Two travel books about the country have been published. To date, Spocania is one of the most elaborated fictional cultures ever published.

In its fictional setting, Spocanian is a member of the ''Atlantic language'' family. As a constructed language, it can be classified as a highly naturalistic [[a priori (languages)|a priori language]]: apart from loan words from European languages, the basic vocabulary and the grammar are unique. Grammar itself is full of "bizarre characteristics":

{{quote|''"Spocanian has not only many rules but also many exceptions to the rules. These exceptions can sometimes be made sense of only by those who know the centuries' old history of the language."'' &lt;ref&gt;

'''Taíno''' is a poorly-[[Attested language|attested]] [[Arawakan language]] that was spoken by the [[Taíno]] people of the [[Caribbean]]. At the time of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish contact]], it was the principal language throughout the Caribbean. Classic Taíno (Taíno proper) was the native language of the northern [[Leeward Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and most of [[Hispaniola]], and it was expanding into Cuba. Ciboney is essentially unattested, but colonial sources suggest that it was a [[dialect]] of Taíno and was spoken in westernmost Hispaniola, the [[Bahamas]], [[Jamaica]], and most of [[Cuba]].

By the late 15th century, Taíno had displaced earlier languages except in western Cuba and pockets in Hispaniola. As the Taíno culture declined during Spanish colonization, the language was replaced by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and other European languages. It is believed to have been extinct within 100 years of contact&lt;ref name=Aikhenvald/&gt; but possibly continued to be spoken in isolated pockets in the Caribbean until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reyes |first=David |date=2004 |title=The Origin and Survival of the Taíno Language |url=https://indigenouscaribbean.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/davidcampos.pdf |journal=Issues in Caribbean Amerindian Studies |volume=5 |issue=2 |doi= |access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first indigenous [[language]] encountered by Europeans in the [[New World]], it was a major source of new words borrowed into [[European languages]].

==Dialects==
Granberry &amp; Vescelius (2004) distinguish two dialects, one on Hispaniola and further east, and the other on Hispaniola and further west.

*Classic (Eastern) Taíno, spoken in Classic Taíno and Eastern Taíno cultural areas. These were the [[Leeward Islands]] north of Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, central Hispaniola, and the Turks &amp; Caicos (from an expansion in ca. 1200). Classic Taíno was expanding into eastern and even central Cuba at the time of the Spanish Conquest, perhaps from people fleeing the Spanish in Hispaniola.
*Ciboney (Western) Taíno, spoken in [[Ciboney]] and [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]] cultural areas. These were most of Cuba, Jamaica, western Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.

Columbus says that from Bahama to Cuba, Boriquen to Jamaica, the same language was spoken in various slight dialects, but understood by all.&lt;ref name="raf"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] | chapter=The Haytian or Taino language | title=The American Nations | volume=1 | year=1836 | pages=215-253 | url=https://archive.org/details/nationsamerica01rafirich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

The Taíno language was not written. The Taínos used [[petroglyph]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tainoage.com/meaning.html&lt;/ref&gt; but there has been little research in the area. The following phonemes are reconstructed from Spanish records:&lt;ref name=granberry&gt;Granberry, Julian &amp; Vescelius, Gary. Languagues of the Pre-Columbian Antilles. The University of Alabama Press 2004. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a flap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, which appears to have been an allophone of {{IPA|/d/}}.

|

| 
|}

A distinction between {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} is suggested by Spanish transcriptions of ''e'' vs ''ei/ey'', as in ''ceiba'' "ceiba". The {{IPA|/e/}} is written ''ei'' or final ''é'' in modern reconstructions. There was also a high back vowel {{IPA|[u]}}, which was often interchangeable with {{IPA|/o/}} and may have been an allophone.

There was a parallel set of [[nasal vowel]]s. The only consonant at the end of a syllable or of a word was {{IPA|/s/}}.

==Grammar==
Taíno is very poorly attested.&lt;ref name=Aikhenvald/&gt; 
Nouns appear to have had noun-class suffixes, as in other Arawakan languages. Attested Taíno possessive prefixes are ''da-'' 'my', ''wa-'' 'our', ''li-'' 'his' (sometimes with a different vowel), and ''to-, tu-'' 'her'.&lt;ref name=granberry/&gt;

Verb-designating affixes are ''a-, ka-, -a, -ka, -nV'' in which "V" is an unknown or changeable vowel. This suggests that, like many other Arawakan languages, verbal conjugation for a subject resembled the possessive prefixes on nouns. 

The Taíno language had an SVO word order which might be hard to see when copulas are being used. Often, however, words can be placed around quite freely. For example, ''Dawaria Boriken'' ("I-from [Puerto Rico]") can also be arranged as ''Boriken dawaria'' ("I-[Puerto Rico]-from"). What is of most concern in word order for the Taíno language nowadays is the most practical way to speak it; This tends to favor the least agglutinative approach.

The negation prefix is ''ma-'' meanwhile the attributive prefix is ''ka-'' as in ''makabuka'' "it is not important or not important". But literally means "Negation-attributive-past" or "Without past"

Some conjugated verbs include ''Daka'' (I am), ''Weiba'' (We go), ''Warike'' (We see)
Attested object suffix includes ''-wo'' (we, us) as in ''Ahiyawoka'' (Speak to us)

==Vocabulary==
English words derived from Taino are: canoe, cassava, cay, hammock, hurricane, iguana, macana, maize, and potato, as well as possibly mangrove, tobacco, and savanna.&lt;ref name="raf"/&gt;{{rp|229}}

Taino loanwords in Spanish are: aguti, aji, cacique, maguey, nigua, tiburon, tuna.

*Bimini: ''bimini'' 'twins'
*Inagua: ''i-na-wa'' 'small eastern land'
*North Caicos: ''ka-i-ko'' 'near-northern-outlier'
*Boriken (confederated kingdom of Puerto Rico): boriken, boriquen, bori (native) -ke ''(land) "native land"''
