'''2,5-Dimethylfuran''' is a [[heterocyclic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  Although often abbreviated '''DMF''', it should not be confused with [[dimethylformamide]]. A derivative of [[furan]], this simple compound is a potential [[biofuel]], being derivable from cellulose.

==Production==
[[Fructose]] can be converted into 2,5-dimethylfuran in a [[Catalysis|catalytic]] [[biomass-to-liquid]] process.Production of DMF from 5-HMF is gaining lot of interest.  The conversion of fructose to DMF proceeds via [[hydroxymethylfurfural]].&lt;ref name="nature05923"&gt;{{cite journal

==Potential as a biofuel==
DMF has a number of attractions as a [[biofuel]]. It has an [[energy density]] 40% greater than that of [[ethanol]], making it comparable to [[gasoline]] (petrol). It is also chemically stable and, being [[soluble|insoluble]] in water, does not absorb moisture from the atmosphere. [[evaporation|Evaporating]] dimethylfuran during the production process also requires around one third less energy than the evaporation of ethanol,&lt;ref name="nature05923" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ability to efficiently and rapidly produce dimethylfuran from fructose, found in [[fruit]] and some [[root vegetable]]s, or from glucose, which can be derived from [[starch]] and [[cellulose]] - all widely available in nature - adds to the attraction of dimethylfuran, although safety issues must be examined. Bioethanol and [[biodiesel]] are currently the leading liquid biofuels.

The [[Stoichiometric air ratio|stoichiometric air/fuel ratio]] of dimethylfuran is 10.72, compared to ethanol at 8.95 and gasoline at 14.56.&lt;ref name="directinjection" /&gt;  This means that burning dimethylfuran requires approximately 33% less air than the same quantity of gasoline, but approximately 20% more air than the same quantity of ethanol.

The [[Heat of combustion#Heating value|calorific value]] of liquid dimethylfuran is 33.7 MJ/kg, compared to 26.9 MJ/kg for ethanol and 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline.&lt;ref name="directinjection" /&gt;  The [[research octane number]] (RON) of dimethylfuran is 119.&lt;ref name="directinjection" /&gt;  The [[latent heat of vaporization]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is 31.91 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name="directinjection" /&gt; Recent tests in a single-cylinder gasoline engine found that the thermal efficiency of burning dimethylfuran is similar to that of gasoline.&lt;ref name="greencarcongress1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/05/directinjection-engine-study-finds-that-dmf-is-a-promising-biofuel-with-combustion-performance-and-r.html |title=Green Car Congress: Direct-Injection Engine Study Finds That DMF Is a Promising Biofuel, With Combustion Performance and Regulated Emissions Comparable to Gasoline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
2,5-Dimethylfuran serves as a [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenger]] for [[singlet oxygen]], a property which has been exploited for the determination of singlet oxygen in natural waters. The mechanism involves a [[Diels-Alder reaction]] followed by [[hydrolysis]], ultimately leading to [[diacetylethylene]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as products. More recently, [[furfuryl alcohol]] has been used for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick L. Brezonik. ''Chemical Kinetics and Process Dynamics in Aquatic Systems''. CRC Press, 1994, p. 671. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fzOHIweIZCsC&amp;pg=RA4-PA671&amp;dq=2,5-dimethylfuran&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=A0mQS0nmveWTmRiRbzeBbaNayu0#PRA4-PA671,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:dimethylfuran reaction with singlet oxygen.png|750px]]

This compound has also been proposed as an [[internal standard]] for [[NMR spectroscopy]].  2,5-Dimethylfuran has singlets in its &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum at δ 2.2 and 5.8; the singlets give reliable integrations, while the positions of the peaks do not interfere with many analytes. The compound also has an appropriate boiling point of 92&amp;nbsp;°C which prevents evaporative losses, yet is easily removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. W. Gerritz  |author2=A. M.

Chem.]] | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–41 | doi = 10.1021/cc990041v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in food chemistry==
2,5-Dimethylfuran forms upon thermal degradation of some sugars and has been identified in trace amounts as a component of [[caramelization|caramelized]] sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3430317 |author1=W.D.

==Toxicology==
2,5-Dimethylfuran plays a role in the mechanism for the [[neurotoxicity]] of hexane in humans.  Together with [[hexane-2,5-dione]] and 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hexanone, it is one of the main [[metabolite]]s of [[hexane]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Arlien-Søborg. ''Solvent Neurotoxicity''. CRC Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8493-6234-2}}.

2,5-Dimethylfuran has been identified as one of the components of [[cigar]] [[smoke]] with low cilatoxicity (ability to adversely affect the [[cilia]] in the [[respiratory tract]] that are responsible for removing foreign particles).&lt;ref&gt;Donald Shopland. ''Cigars: Health Effects and Trends''. DIANE Publishing, 1998.

The '''20-pair colour code''' is a [[colour code]] used in Australia to identify individual conductors in a kind of electrical [[telecommunication]] [[wiring]] for indoor use, known as [[twisted pair]] cables. The colours are applied to the insulation that covers each conductor. The first colour is chosen from one group of five colours.

The combinations are also shown in the table below showing the colour for each wire ("1" and "2") and the pair number.

'''5-Tiles''' is a [[virtual keyboard]] for [[mobile device]]s with [[touchscreen]] that run the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It is characterized by needing a small amount of space leaving as much space as possible to the software that needs the keyboard. As the name indicates there are exactly five keys on the keyboard on one line of keys. [[Character (computing)|Characters]] are typed by [[Multi-touch|tap and swipe gestures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=190926|title=5-TILES Keyboard Goes Free With Beta Launch for Android|author=Lisa Devaney|date=23 September 2014|work=WebWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five keys of this keyboard all have different colors to be easily distinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/long-live-the-nav-key/|title=5-Tiles, The Software Keyboard Targeting Wearables, Picks Up Nokia’s ‘Nav Key’ Inventor As Investor|author=Steve O'Hear|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; You have the following options to type a character:
* Tap on one of the five buttons
* Swipe up or down, beginning on one of the buttons
* Swipe a path on the x-axis beginning on one of the buttons changing direction at different buttons and a different number of times—according to the character—until you finally end up on one of the buttons
* Making a [[cheat sheet]] visible with a simple swipe gesture and then tapping one of the symbols listed

The concept of this keyboard was invented in 2004. The co-founder of the company creating this keyboard, [[Michal Kubacki]], first didn't have skills in [[Computer programming|programming]]. He learned some skills that allowed him to write basic software for testing purposes and to further develop the keyboard. He got in touch with people who helped him creating the product as a virtual keyboard for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. An early version was downloaded thousands of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearables.com/5-tiles-speeds-up-rollout-and-moves-to-free-model/|title=5-Tiles Speeds Up Rollout and Moves to Free Model|work=Wearables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2013 [[Droidcon]] Demo Camp the company won the second place. It was also awarded in other competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/5-tiles-keyboard/|title=5-Tiles Keyboard Targets Wearables To Hunt The Post-Qwerty Holy Grail|author=Natasha Lomas|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21889">An '''air data inertial reference unit''' (ADIRU) is a key component of the integrated '''air data inertial reference system''' (ADIRS), which supplies air data ([[airspeed]], [[angle of attack]] and [[altitude]]) and [[Inertial navigation system|inertial reference]] (position and attitude) information to the pilots' [[electronic flight instrument system]] displays as well as other systems on the aircraft such as the engines, [[autopilot]], [[aircraft flight control system]] and landing gear systems.&lt;ref name="art5"&gt;

==Description==
An ADIRS consists of up to three [[fault-tolerant design|fault tolerant]] ADIRUs located in the aircraft electronic rack, an associated control and display unit (CDU) in the cockpit and remotely mounted [[air data module]]s (ADMs).&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;

 |publisher=[[ARINC]]
 |accessdate=14 July 2008
 |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The No 3 ADIRU is a [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] unit that may be selected to supply data to either the commander's or the co-pilot's displays in the event of a partial or complete failure of either the No 1 or No 2 ADIRU. There is no cross-channel redundancy between the Nos 1 and 2 ADIRUs, as No 3 ADIRU is the only alternate source of air and inertial reference data. An inertial reference (IR) fault in ADIRU No 1 or 2 will cause a loss of [[Angle of attack|attitude]] and navigation information on their associated [[EFIS#Primary flight display (PFD)|primary flight display]] (PFD) and navigation display (ND) screens. An air data reference (ADR) fault will cause the loss of airspeed and altitude information on the affected display. In either case the information can only be restored by selecting the No 3 ADIRU.&lt;ref name="art5" /&gt;

Each ADIRU comprises an ADR and an inertial reference (IR) component.&lt;ref name="urlA330 - Navigation"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=smartcockpit.com |url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/pdf/plane/airbus/A330/systems/0019/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070115043457/http://www.smartcockpit.com/pdf/plane/airbus/A330/systems/0019/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 January 2007 |title=Airline training guides, Aviation, Operations, Safety -Navigation A330 |work= |accessdate=12 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air data reference===
{{See also|Pitot-static system}}
The air data reference (ADR) component of an ADIRU provides airspeed, [[Mach number]], angle of attack, temperature and barometric altitude data.&lt;ref name="aero-08"&gt;

ADMs transmit their pressures to the ADIRUs through [[ARINC 429]] data buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/Air_Data_Module.pdf |publisher=Honeywell |title=Air Data Module |accessdate=25 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inertial reference===
The [[Inertial reference unit|IR]] component of an ADIRU gives attitude, flight path vector, ground speed and positional data.&lt;ref name="art5" /&gt; The [[ring laser gyroscope]] is a core enabling technology in the system, and is used together with [[accelerometer]]s, [[GPS]] and other sensors to provide raw data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ShYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pgis=1|title=International Aerospace Abstracts|publisher=Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Inc, [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]|year=1985|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary benefits of a ring laser over older mechanical [[gyroscope]]s are that there are no moving parts, it is rugged and lightweight, frictionless and does not resist a change in [[precession]].

==Complexity in redundancy==
Analysis of complex systems is itself so difficult as to be subject to errors in the certification process. Complex interactions between flight computers and ADIRU's can lead to counter-intuitive behaviour for the crew in the event of a failure. In the case of [[Qantas Flight 72]], the captain switched the source of IR data from ADIRU1 to ADIRU3 following a failure of ADIRU1; however ADIRU1 continued to supply ADR data to the captain's primary flight display. In addition, the master flight control computer (PRIM1) was switched from PRIM1 to PRIM2, then PRIM2 back to PRIM1, thereby creating a situation of uncertainty for the crew who did not know which redundant systems they were relying upon.&lt;ref name="harmful"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/papers/ISSC09/ADIRU_Accident_Submission.pdf |title=The Dangers of Interaction with Modular and Self-Healing Avionics Applications: Redundancy Considered Harmful |author1=C.W. Johnson |author2=C. Michael Holloway |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliance on redundancy of aircraft systems and can also lead to delays in executing needed repairs as airline operators rely on the redundancy to keep the aircraft system working without having to repair faults immediately.&lt;ref name="art5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="art2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gremlins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harmful"/&gt;

==Failures and directives==

===FAA Airworthiness directive 2000-07-27===
On May 3, 2000, the FAA issued airworthiness directive 2000-07-27, addressing dual critical failures during flight, attributed to power supply issues affecting early [[Honeywell]] HG2030 and HG2050 ADIRU [[ring laser gyro]]s used on several Boeing 737, 757, Airbus A319, A320, A321, A330, and A340 models.&lt;ref name="art2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Airworthiness directive 2003-26-03===
On 27 January 2004 the FAA issued airworthiness directive 2003-26-03 (later superseded by AD 2008-17-12) which called for modification to the mounting of ADIRU3 in Airbus A320 family aircraft to prevent failure and loss of critical attitude and airspeed data.&lt;ref name="art2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On 25 June 2005, an [[Alitalia]]&lt;!-- see http://www.baaa-acro.com/Photos-27/I-BIKE.jpg --&gt; [[Airbus A320-200]] registered as I-BIKE departed [[Milan]] with a defective ADIRU as permitted by the [[Minimum Equipment List]]. While approaching [[London Heathrow Airport]] during deteriorating weather another ADIRU failed, leaving only one operable. In the subsequent confusion the third was inadvertently reset, losing its reference heading and disabling several automatic functions. The crew was able to effect a safe landing after declaring a [[Pan-pan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Malaysia Airlines Flight 124===
On 1 August 2005 a serious incident involving [[Malaysia Airlines]] Flight 124, occurred when a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-2H6ER]] (9M-MRG) flying from [[Perth Airport|Perth]] to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur–International]] also involved an ADIRU fault resulting in uncommanded manoeuvres by the aircraft acting on false indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident | id = 20050801-1 | title = Malaysia Airlines Flight 124 | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that incident the incorrect data impacted all [[flight dynamics|planes of movement]] while the aircraft was climbing through {{convert|38000|ft|m|-2}}. The aircraft pitched up and climbed to around {{convert|41000|ft|m|-2}}, with the stall warning activated. The pilots recovered the aircraft with the autopilot disengaged and requested a return to Perth. During the return to Perth, both the left and right autopilots were briefly activated by the crew, but in both instances the aircraft pitched down and banked to the right. The aircraft was flown manually for the remainder of the flight and landed safely in Perth. There were no injuries and no damage to the aircraft. The ATSB found that the main probable cause of this incident was a latent software error which allowed the ADIRU to use data from a failed [[accelerometer]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Qantas Flight 68===
On 12 September 2006, [[Qantas]] Flight 68, [[Airbus A330]] registration VH-QPA, from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] exhibited ADIRU problems but without causing any disruption to the flight. At {{convert|41000|ft|m}} and estimated position {{convert|530|NM|km}} north of [[Learmonth, Western Australia]],&lt;ref name="ATSB_InterimReport" /&gt; ''NAV IR1 FAULT'' then, 30 minutes later, ''NAV ADR 1 FAULT'' notifications were received on the [[Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor|ECAM]] identifying navigation system faults in [[Inertial Reference Unit]] 1, then in ADR 1 respectively. The crew reported to the later Qantas Flight 72 investigation involving the same airframe and ADIRU that they had received numerous warning and caution messages which changed too quickly to be dealt with. While investigating the problem, the crew noticed a weak and intermittent ''ADR 1 FAULT'' light and elected to switch off ADR 1, after which they experienced no further problems. There was no impact on the flight controls throughout the event. The ADIRU manufacturer's recommended maintenance procedures were carried out after the flight and system testing found no further fault.&lt;ref name="ATSB_InterimReport" /&gt;

===Jetstar Flight 7===
On 7 February 2008, a similar aircraft (VH-EBC) operated by Qantas subsidiary [[Jetstar Airways]] was involved in a similar occurrence while conducting the JQ7 service from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In this event - which occurred {{convert|1760|NM|km}} east of Learmonth - many of the same errors occurred in the ADIRU unit. The crew followed the relevant procedure applicable at the time and the flight continued without problems.&lt;ref name="ATSB_InterimReport"&gt;{{cite web

===Airworthiness directive 2008-17-12===
On 6 August 2008, the FAA issued airworthiness directive 2008-17-12 expanding on the requirements of the earlier AD 2003-26-03 which had been determined to be an insufficient remedy. In some cases it called for replacement of ADIRUs with newer models, but allowed 46 months from October 2008 to implement the directive.&lt;ref&gt;

The ATSB has yet to confirm if this event is related to the other Airbus A330 ADIRU occurrences.&lt;ref name="ATSB_InterimReport" /&gt;

===Qantas Flight 72===
On 7 October 2008, [[Qantas Flight 72]], using the same aircraft involved in the Flight 68 incident, departed Singapore for Perth. Some time into the flight, while cruising at 37,000&amp;nbsp;ft, a failure in the No.1 ADIRU led to the autopilot automatically disengaging followed by two sudden uncommanded [[flight dynamics|pitch]] down manoeuvres, according to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). The accident injured up to 74 passengers and crew, ranging from minor to serious injuries. The aircraft was able to make an emergency landing without further injuries. The aircraft was equipped with a [[Northrop Grumman]] made ADIRS, which investigators sent to the manufacturer for further testing.&lt;ref&gt;

===Emergency Airworthiness Directive No 2009-0012-E===
On 15 January 2009, the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] issued [http://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/2009-0012-E Emergency Airworthiness Directive No 2009-0012-E] to address the above A330 and A340 Northrop-Grumman ADIRU problem of incorrectly responding to a defective inertial reference. In the event of a NAV IR fault the directed crew response is now to "select OFF the relevant IR, select OFF the relevant ADR, and then turn the IR rotary mode selector to the OFF position." The effect is to ensure that the faulted IR is powered off so that it no longer can send erroneous data to other systems.&lt;ref name="ATSB_InterimReport" /&gt;

An '''anti-hijack system''' is an [[electronic system]] fitted to [[motor vehicles]] to deter criminals from [[Carjacking|hijacking]] them. Although these types of systems are becoming more common on newer cars, they have not caused a decrease in insurance premiums as they are not as widely known as other more common anti-theft systems such as alarms or steering locks. It can also be a part of an [[alarm system|alarm]] or [[immobiliser]] system. An approved anti-hijacking system will achieve a safe, quick shutdown of the vehicle it is attached to. There are also mechanical anti-hijack devices. 

== Technology ==
There are three basic principles on which the systems work.

=== Lockout ===
A lockout system is armed when the driver turns the [[ignition key]] to the ''on'' position and carries out a specified action, usually flicking a hidden switch or depressing the [[brake pedal]] twice. It is activated when the vehicle drops below a certain speed or becomes stationary, and will cause all of the vehicles doors to automatically lock, to prevent against thieves stealing the vehicle when it is stopped, for example at a [[traffic light]] or [[pedestrian crossing]].

=== Transponder ===
A [[transponder]] system is a system which is always armed until a device, usually a small [[RFID]] transponder, enters the vehicle's transmitter radius. Since the device is carried by the driver, usually in their wallet or pocket, if the driver leaves the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, so will the transponder, causing the system to assume the vehicle has been hijacked and disable it. 

As the transponder itself is concealed, the thief would not be aware that such a system is active on a vehicle until they had ejected the driver and moved the vehicle out of range of the driver (usually only a couple of meters). This is probably the most common anti-hijack system, and a [[central locking]] system that uses the same concept was demonstrated by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] on an old episode of the [[BBC]] [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] program where he teased a butler by asking him to put his bags in a [[Mercedes-Benz W220|Mercedes-Benz S600]] but didn't give him the RFID transponder. The butler was confused when the S600 doors wouldn't open when he tried, but when Jeremy approached with the transponder in his pocket, the system acknowledged this and unlocked the car, allowing Jeremy to simply pull the door handle to gain entry to the vehicle.

=== Microswitch ===
A [[microswitch]] system is always armed and is usually activated if one of the vehicle doors is opened and closed again while the vehicle's engine is running. Once the system has been activated, the driver will have a set time limit to disarm it by entering a code before the vehicle takes measures. 

If the system is not disarmed in the time window, it will warn the driver by sounding the vehicle's horn once every 10 seconds for 30 seconds, at which point the system will start sounding the horn at much shorter intervals and will usually activate the vehicle's [[hazard lights]]. 

At this point the immobiliser circuit will also start rapidly pulsing for 40 seconds, completely disabling the engine and eventually bringing the vehicle to a stop. If the thief switches the ignition to the ''off'' position and back to the ''on'' position again, the horn will restart and operate constantly and the hazard lights will flash for 60 seconds. 

The immobiliser circuit will close for 15 seconds and will rapidly pulse for 15 seconds before re-opening the circuit, allowing the vehicle to be driven to a safe location before once again being immobilised. The hazard lights will continue to flash, and on every subsequent attempt to start the vehicle will cause the horn to operate for 30 seconds, but the immobilizer circuit will not open, so the vehicle will not start and the hazard lights will keep flashing until the vehicle's battery is drained or the system is disarmed.

=== Mechanical anti-hijack devices ===
Blocks steering shaft rotation and prevent rotation of the steering wheel. When set mechanical anti-hijack device the wheels do not turn and the car can travel only straight forward and backward. Or in the side back and forth, before installing the mechanical anti-hijack device lock if the wheels turn. To go by car to the established mechanical anti-hijack device is not possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR)''' is the direct injection of surface water supplies such as [[potable water]], reclaimed water, or river water into an [[aquifer]] for later recovery and use. ASR has been done for municipal, industry and [[irrigation|agriculture use]].

==ASR use in the United States==

=== Colorado ===
The first ASR well with a downhole control valve was installed in [[Highlands Ranch, CO]] in 1992 for Centennial Water and Sanitation District.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Baski Flow Control Valves, ASR Valves|url = http://www.baski.com/FlowControlValves.aspx|website = www.baski.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, over 40 ASR wells have been installed for many different municipalities.  These wells range in depths from {{convert|1,000|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3,000|ft|abbr=on}} below ground surface, with injection rates commonly between {{convert|100|USgal|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|USgal|abbr=on}} per minute (gpm) per well.

===Florida===
The use of ASR in Florida has been examined to determine potential benefits for the [[Everglades]] and other Florida water systems under the [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] (CERP). An estimate of 333 ASR wells would be implemented as part of CERP and used to store, treat and supply excess surface water to the Everglades and other systems of water during dry periods. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquifer Storage and Recovery|url=http://my.sfwmd.gov/portal/page/portal/xweb%20-%20release%203%20water%20supply/aquifer%20storage%20and%20recovery|website=South Florida Water Management District}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquifer Storage and Recovery Regional Study|url=http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Portals/44/docs/FactSheets/ASR_FS_June2015_web.pdf|website=U.S. Army Corp of Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====

Doubts remain about the benefit of introducing ASR in such large capacity to Florida due to a predominantly [[karst geography]]. Current or potential problems include: (1) poor recovery due to mixing of the injected fresh water with the existing brackish to saline water in the aquifer; (2) pre-existing quality of water introduced to ASR; and (3) potential risk of resulting water quality due to mixing of injected freshwater and existing aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Aquifer Storage and Recovery in the Floridan Aquifer System of Southern Florida|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2004/3128/|website=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon===

The first agriculture ASR wells were put into service in [[Oregon]] in the autumn of 2006 and have injected well over {{convert|3000|acre.ft|m3}} of water during the winter and spring flood flow times using artificial recharge (AR) of flood water as their water source. This shallow recharged water is then recovered as potable water and injected into the deep basalt aquifer.

During the injection process, electrical energy can be generated by the [[head pressure]] of the water flowing back into the aquifer. This stored water is recovered during late summer and early autumn for irrigation needs.

Both of these well types use a down-hole control valve. ASR can also be used to re-inject water used by [[HVAC]] systems to maintain the ground water levels and store the thermal differences from summertime cooling for winter time heating. Industry can also capture cold winter waters and store it for summertime use and avoid the need for cooling water in the summer for industrial processes. This may also free up short supplies of summer time water for other beneficial uses. This reinjection process  may also avoid the cost of surface disposal and avoid the increased thermal load to the rivers and streams during the summer air conditioning season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3rvalve.com/|title=Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR)|author=Kent Madison|year=2008|publisher=3R Valve|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===

The Texas cities of [[El Paso]], [[Kerrville]] and [[San Antonio]] use ASR, providing water resources to these water-vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;[http://www.trcc.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt; A University of Florida report ranked daily per-capita water availability for 225 large urban areas across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/hydrology/cities/ Water availability ranking for 225 urban areas in the United States]. Environmental Hydrology Laboratory at the University of Florida. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study weighed fresh water available to cities from naturally occurring and constructed sources such as reservoirs, aquifers and imports. Of the cities reviewed, San Antonio ranked last, or most vulnerable, and El Paso ranked as 10th-worst, though other Texas cities made the list.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;

San Antonio stores drinking water in its Carrizo ASR facility, which contains more than 91,000 acre-feet of water and has a maximum capacity of 120,000 acre-feet.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;

A 2010 [[Texas Water Development Board]] (TWDB) survey of Texas water utilities found four primary objections to ASR in other parts of Texas: legal and physical limitations, the quality of the recovered water, cost-effectiveness and the potential for other pumpers to capture the utility’s stored water.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;

==ASR use in Australia==
[[File:Cooke Reserve wetland.JPG|thumb|Newly constructed wetland for final stage treatment of urban [[stormwater]] runoff for an ASR scheme in western [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlessturt.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=609 City of Charles Sturt &gt; Major Projects &gt; Water Proofing the West] Accessed 23 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In South Australia, the [[City of Salisbury]] in northern [[Adelaide]] has since 1994 played a pioneering role in establishing the viability of the capture and treatment of urban stormwater runoff within artificial wetlands, and injecting the treated water into Tertiary aquifers in winter, for later use by industry, and for irrigation of city parks and school playing fields in summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisbury.sa.gov.au/Our_City/Environment/Wetlands_and_Water City of Salisbury &gt; Environment &gt; Wetlands and Water] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325191534/http://www.salisbury.sa.gov.au/Our_City/Environment/Wetlands_and_Water |date=March 25, 2014 }} Accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the capacity of the Salisbury ASR schemes was around 5 gigalitres per annum (expected to rise to 14 GL by 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Haines, S. (2009): [http://www.salisbury.sa.gov.au/files/1c9524b4-f17b-4650-ad4f-9e850103891b/watersensitivecities-paper.pdf Towards Water Sensitive Cities] City of Salisbury. Accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and this success has led to other local government areas across Adelaide undertaking similar ASR projects.

'''Arduino''' is an [[open-source hardware]] and [[open-source software|software]] company, project and user community that designs and manufactures [[single-board microcontroller]]s and [[microcontroller]] kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world. Its products are licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL) or the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction|title= Getting Started: FOUNDATION &gt; Introduction |work=arduino.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) kits.

Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog [[input/output]] (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards or [[breadboards]] (''shields'') and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers are typically programmed using a dialect of features from the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]. In addition to using traditional [[compiler]] [[toolchains]], the Arduino project provides an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) based on the [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] language project.

The Arduino project started in 2003 as a program for students at the [[Interaction Design Institute Ivrea]] in [[Ivrea]], Italy,&lt;ref name="kushner"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[IEEE Spectrum]] |url= http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-making-of-arduino |title=The Making of Arduino |author=David Kushner |date=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple [[robot]]s, [[thermostat]]s and [[motion detector]]s.

The name ''Arduino'' comes from a bar in [[Ivrea]], Italy, where some of the founders of the project used to meet. The bar was named after [[Arduin of Ivrea]], who was the [[margrave]] of the [[March of Ivrea]] and [[King of Italy]] from 1002 to 1014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Justin Lahart |date=27 November 2009 |title= Taking an Open-Source Approach to Hardware |journal= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703499404574559960271468066 |access-date=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Arduino project started at the [[Interaction Design Institute Ivrea]] (IDII) in [[Ivrea]], Italy.&lt;ref name="kushner" /&gt; At that time, the students used a [[BASIC Stamp]] microcontroller at a cost of $50, a considerable expense for many students. In 2003 Hernando Barragán created the development platform ''[[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]]'' as a Master's thesis project at IDII, under the supervision of Massimo Banzi and [[Casey Reas]]. Casey Reas is known for co-creating, with Ben Fry, the [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] development platform. The project goal was to create simple, low cost tools for creating digital projects by non-engineers. The Wiring platform consisted of a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) with an [[ATmega]]168 microcontroller, an IDE based on Processing and library functions to easily program the microcontroller.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arduinohistory.github.io|author=Hernando Barragán|title=The Untold History of Arduino|date=2016-01-01|website=arduinohistory.github.io|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis, another IDII student, and David Cuartielles, added support for the cheaper ATmega8 microcontroller to Wiring. But instead of continuing the work on Wiring, they [[Fork (software development)|forked]] the project and renamed it ''Arduino''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The initial Arduino core team consisted of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis,&lt;ref name="kushner" /&gt; but Barragán was not invited to participate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following the completion of the Wiring platform, lighter and less expensive versions were distributed in the open-source community.

It was estimated in mid-2011 that over 300,000 official Arduinos had been commercially produced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2011/05/15/how-many-arduinos-are-in-the-wild-about-300000/ |title=How many Arduinos are "in the wild?" About 300,000 |publisher=[[Adafruit Industries]] |date=May 15, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 that 700,000 official boards were in users' hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medea.mah.se/2013/04/arduino-faq// |title=Arduino FAQ – With David Cuartielles |publisher=[[Malmö University]] |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Federico Musto, Arduino's former CEO, secured a 50% ownership of the company. In April 2017, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] reported that Musto had "fabricated his academic record.... On his company's website, personal LinkedIn accounts, and even on Italian business documents, Musto was until recently listed as holding a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In some cases, his biography also claimed an MBA from New York University." Wired reported that neither University had any record of Musto's attendance, and Musto later admitted in an interview with Wired that he had never earned those degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/04/arduinos-new-ceo-federico-musto-may-fabricated-academic-record/|title=Arduino’s New CEO, Federico Musto, May Have Fabricated His Academic Record|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that same time, Massimo Banzi announced that the [[Arduino Foundation]] would be "a new beginning for Arduino."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://makezine.com/2017/06/09/free-arduino/|title=Free Arduino {{!}} Make:|date=2017-06-09|work=Make: DIY Projects and Ideas for Makers|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; But a year later, the Foundation still hasn't been established, and the state of the project remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hackaday.com/2017/06/19/the-arduino-foundation-whats-up/|title=The Arduino Foundation: What’s Up?|date=2017-06-19|work=Hackaday|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy surrounding Musto continued when, in July 2017, he reportedly pulled many [[Open source model|Open source]] licenses, schematics, and code from the Arduino website, prompting scrutiny and outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/ceo-controversy-mars-arduinos-open-future/|title=CEO controversy mars Arduino’s open future|last=Biggs|first=John|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Arduino announced its partnership with [[ARM Holdings]] (ARM). The announcement said, in part, "ARM recognized independence as a core value of Arduino ... without any lock-in with the [[ARM architecture]].” Arduino intends to continue to work with all technology vendors and architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/distribution-world/arduino-reborn-partners-arm-2017-10/|title=Arduino reborn partners with ARM|date=2017-10-06|work=Electronics Weekly|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trademark dispute===
In early 2008, the five cofounders of the Arduino project created a company, Arduino LLC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Entity Summary for Arduino LLC|url=http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSummary.aspx?FEIN=262323943&amp;SEARCH_TYPE=1|website=Mass.gov|publisher=State of Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hold the trademarks associated with Arduino. The manufacture and sale of the boards was to be done by external companies, and Arduino LLC would get a royalty from them. The founding bylaws of Arduino LLC specified that each of the five founders transfer ownership of the Arduino brand to the newly formed company.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At the end of 2008, Gianluca Martino's company, Smart Projects, registered the Arduino trademark in Italy and kept this a secret from the other cofounders for about two years. This was revealed when the Arduino company tried to register the trademark in other areas of the world (they originally registered only in the US), and discovered that it was already registered in Italy. Negotiations with Gianluca and his firm to bring the trademark under control of the original Arduino company failed. In 2014, Smart Projects began refusing to pay royalties. They then appointed a new CEO, Federico Musto, who renamed the company ''Arduino SRL'' and created the website ''arduino.org'', copying the graphics and layout of the original ''arduino.cc''. This resulted in a rift in the Arduino development team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allan|first1=Alasdair|title=Arduino Wars: Group Splits, Competing Products Revealed?|url=http://makezine.com/2015/03/06/arduino-vs-arduino/|website=makezine.com|publisher=Maker Media, Inc.|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banzi|first1=Massimo|title=Massimo Banzi: Fighting for Arduino|url=http://makezine.com/2015/03/19/massimo-banzi-fighting-for-arduino/|website=makezine.com|publisher=Maker Media, Inc.|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Elliot|title=Arduino SRL to Distributors: "We’re the Real Arduino"|url=http://hackaday.com/2015/03/28/arduino-srl-to-distributors-were-the-real-arduino/|website=Hackaday.com|publisher=Hackaday.com|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Arduino LLC filed a lawsuit against Arduino SRL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/mad/167131/|title=Arduino LLC vs Arduino SRL lawsuit; United States Courts Archive.|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Arduino LLC created the worldwide trademark '''Genuino''', used as brand name outside the United States.&lt;ref name=genuino&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2015/05/16/arduino-adafruit-manufacturing-genuino/|title=Arduino Announces New Brand, Genuino, Manufacturing Partnership with Adafruit|work=Make:|date=16 May 2015|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the World [[Maker Faire]] in New York on October 1, 2016, Arduino LLC co-founder and CEO Massimo Banzi and Arduino SRL CEO Federico Musto announced the merger of the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/10/01/two-arduinos-become-one-2/|title=Arduino Blog – Two Arduinos become one|last=|first=|date=|website=Arduino Blog|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017 Arduino AG owned many Arduino trademarks. In July 2017 BCMI, founded by Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, David Mellis and Tom Igoe, acquired Arduino AG and all the Arduino trademarks. Fabio Violante is the new CEO replacing Federico Musto, who no longer works for Arduino AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.arduino.cc/2017/07/28/a-new-era-for-arduino-begins-today/|title=Arduino Blog – A new era for Arduino begins today|last=|first=|date=|website=Arduino Blog|publisher=|access-date=19 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://techwombat.com/bcmi-acquires-arduino-ag-makers-breathe-sigh-relief/ Tom Davis: BCMI Acquires Arduino AG and Makers Breathe a Sigh of Relief 31 July 2017] ''techwombat.com'', accessed 29 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Arduino is [[open-source hardware]]. The hardware reference designs are distributed under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and are available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.

Although the hardware and software designs are freely available under [[copyleft]] licenses, the developers have requested the name ''Arduino'' to be [[generic trademark|exclusive to the official product]] and not be used for derived works without permission. The official policy document on use of the Arduino name emphasizes that the project is open to incorporating work by others into the official product.&lt;ref name="AutoF7-44"/&gt; Several Arduino-compatible products commercially released have avoided the project name by using various names ending in ''-duino''.&lt;ref name="freeduino"/&gt;

Most Arduino boards consist of an [[Atmel]] 8-bit AVR [[microcontroller]] (ATmega8,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/chip-hall-of-fame-atmel-atmega8|title=Chip Hall of Fame: Atmel ATmega8|work=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATmega168, [[ATmega328]], ATmega1280, ATmega2560) with varying amounts of flash memory, pins, and features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products|title=Arduino - Products|website=www.arduino.cc|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 32-bit Arduino Due, based on the Atmel [[Atmel ARM-based processors#SAM_3|SAM3X8E]] was introduced in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/arduino-due/|title=Microcontroller Maniacs Rejoice: Arduino Finally Releases the 32-Bit Due|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boards use single or double-row pins or female headers that facilitate connections for programming and incorporation into other circuits. These may connect with add-on modules termed ''shields''. Multiple and possibly stacked shields may be individually addressable via an [[I²C]] [[serial bus]]. Most boards include a 5 V [[linear regulator]] and a 16&amp;nbsp;MHz [[crystal oscillator]] or [[ceramic resonator]]. Some designs, such as the LilyPad, run at 8&amp;nbsp;MHz and dispense with the onboard voltage regulator due to specific form-factor restrictions.

Arduino microcontrollers are pre-programmed with a [[boot loader]] that simplifies uploading of programs to the on-chip [[flash memory]]. The default bootloader of the Arduino UNO is the optiboot bootloader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot|title=Optiboot Bootloader for Arduino and Atmel AVR| accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boards are loaded with program code via a serial connection to another computer. Some serial Arduino boards contain a level shifter circuit to convert between [[RS-232]] logic levels and [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) level signals. Current Arduino boards are programmed via [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB), implemented using USB-to-serial adapter chips such as the [[FTDI]] FT232. Some boards, such as later-model Uno boards, substitute the [[FTDI]] chip with a separate AVR chip containing USB-to-serial firmware, which is reprogrammable via its own [[In-system programming|ICSP]] header. Other variants, such as the Arduino Mini and the unofficial Boarduino, use a detachable USB-to-serial adapter board or cable, [[Bluetooth]] or other methods. When used with traditional microcontroller tools, instead of the Arduino IDE, standard AVR [[in-system programming]] (ISP) programming is used.

[[File:UnoConnections.jpg|thumb|An official Arduino Uno R2 with descriptions of the I/O locations]]

The Arduino board exposes most of the microcontroller's I/O pins for use by other circuits. The ''Diecimila'',{{Efn|name="N10000"|''Diecimila'' means "ten thousand" in Italian}} ''Duemilanove'',{{Efn|name="N2009"|''Duemilanove'' means "two thousand and nine" in Italian}} and current ''Uno''{{Efn|name="N1"|''Uno'' means "one" in Italian}} provide 14 digital I/O pins, six of which can produce [[pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] signals, and six analog inputs, which can also be used as six digital I/O pins. These pins are on the top of the board, via female 0.1-inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;mm) headers. Several plug-in application shields are also commercially available. The Arduino Nano, and Arduino-compatible Bare Bones Board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moderndevice.com/product/bare-bones-board-bbb-kit/ |website=moderndevice.com |title= Bare Bones Board (BBB) Kit |access-date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boarduino&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adafruit.com/products/72 |title= DC Boarduino (Arduino compatible) Kit (w/ATmega328) - v1.0|website=adafruit.com|access-date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; boards may provide male header pins on the underside of the board that can plug into solderless [[breadboard]]s.

Many Arduino-compatible and Arduino-derived boards exist. Some are functionally equivalent to an Arduino and can be used interchangeably. Many enhance the basic Arduino by adding output drivers, often for use in school-level education, to simplify making buggies and small robots. Others are electrically equivalent but change the form factor, sometimes retaining compatibility with shields, sometimes not. Some variants use different processors, of varying compatibility.

A program for Arduino hardware may be written in any [[programming language]] with compilers that produce binary machine code for the target processor. Atmel provides a development environment for their 8-bit [[Atmel AVR|AVR]] and 32-bit [[ARM Cortex-M]] based microcontrollers: AVR Studio (older) and Atmel Studio (newer).&lt;ref name="AutoF7-38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoF7-39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoF7-46"/&gt;

===IDE===
The Arduino [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) is a [[cross-platform]] application (for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]]) that is written in the programming language [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It originated from the IDE for the languages ''[[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]'' and ''[[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]]''. It includes a code editor with features such as text cutting and pasting, searching and replacing text, automatic indenting, [[brace matching]], and [[syntax highlighting]], and provides simple ''one-click'' mechanisms to compile and upload programs to an Arduino board. It also contains a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a hierarchy of operation menus. The source code for the IDE is released under the [[GNU General Public License]], version 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The arduino source code|url=https://github.com/arduino/Arduino|work=The Arduino source code}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arduino IDE supports the languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a [[software library]] from the [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] project, which provides many common input and output procedures. User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, that are compiled and linked with a program stub ''main()'' into an executable [[cyclic executive]] program with the [[GNU toolchain]], also included with the IDE distribution. The Arduino IDE employs the program ''avrdude'' to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.

===Sketch===

A program written with the Arduino IDE is called a ''sketch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Arduino-Getting-Started-Sketches/dp/0071784225/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364494138&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=arduino+sketches |title= Programming Arduino Getting Started with Sketches |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |date=Nov 8, 2011 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sketches are saved on the development computer as text files with the file extension '''.ino'''. Arduino Software (IDE) pre-1.0 saved sketches with the extension '''.pde'''.

A minimal Arduino C/C++ program consist of only two functions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BareMinimum|title=Arduino - BareMinimum|website=www.arduino.cc|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{code|setup()}}: This function is called once when a sketch starts after power-up or reset. It is used to initialize variables, input and output pin modes, and other libraries needed in the sketch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/setup/ Documentation for function ''setup'' (arduino.cc)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{code|loop()}}: After {{code|setup()}} function exits (ends), the {{code|loop()}} function is executed repeatedly in the main program. It controls the board until the board is powered off or is reset.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/loop/ Documentation for function ''loop'' (arduino.cc)]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Blink example
[[File:Power and Pin13 LED on Arduino Compatible Board.jpg|alt=Power LED and Integrated LED on Arduino Compatible Board|thumb|Power LED (red) and User LED (green) attached to pin 13 on an Arduino compatible board]]
Most Arduino boards contain a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) and a current limiting resistor connected between pin 13 and ground, which is a convenient feature for many tests and program functions.&lt;ref name="Blink Tutorial" /&gt; A typical program used by beginners, akin to [[Hello, World!]], is "blink", which repeatedly blinks the on-board LED integrated into the Arduino board. This program uses the functions {{code|pinMode()}}, {{code|digitalWrite()}}, and {{code|delay()}}, which are provided by the internal libraries included in the IDE environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/ Documentation for function ''pinMode'' (arduino.cc)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/ Documentation for function ''digitalWrite'' (arduino.cc)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/delay/ Documentation for function ''delay'' (arduino.cc)]&lt;/ref&gt; This program is usually loaded into a new Arduino board by the manufacturer.

&lt;source lang="arduino" style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;
#define LED_PIN 13                  // Pin number attached to LED.

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);       // Configure pin 13 to be a digital output.
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);    // Turn on the LED.
    delay(1000);                    // Wait 1 second (1000 milliseconds).
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);     // Turn off the LED.
    delay(1000);                    // Wait 1 second.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:braininvat.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A brain in a vat that believes it is walking]]
In [[philosophy]], the '''brain in a vat''' ('''BIV'''; alternately known as '''brain in a jar''') is a scenario used in a variety of [[thought experiment]]s intended to draw out certain features of human conceptions of [[knowledge]], [[reality]], [[truth]], [[mind]], [[consciousness]], and [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. It is an updated version of [[René Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]] thought experiment originated by [[Gilbert Harman]].&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Gilbert 1973: Thought, Princeton/NJ, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Common to many science fiction stories, it outlines a scenario in which a [[mad scientist]], machine, or other entity might remove a person's brain from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and [[brain-computer interface|connect its neurons by wires]] to a [[supercomputer]] which would provide it with [[action potential|electrical impulses]] identical to those the brain normally receives.&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putnam|first1=Hilary|authorlink=Hilary Putnam|title=Brains in a Vat|url=https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/Brains%20in%20a%20Vat%20-%20Hilary%20Putnam.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to such stories, the computer would then be [[simulated reality|simulating reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the "disembodied" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences, such as those of a person with an embodied brain, without these being related to objects or events in the real world.

==Uses==
The simplest use of brain-in-a-vat scenarios is as an [[argument]] for [[philosophical skepticism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Klein |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter D. Klein |title=Skepticism |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/ |date=2 June 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[solipsism]]. A simple version of this runs as follows: Since the brain in a vat gives and receives exactly the same impulses as it would if it were in a skull, and since these are its only way of interacting with its environment, then it is not possible to tell, ''from the perspective of that brain'', whether it is in a skull or a vat. Yet in the first case most of the person's beliefs may be true (if they believe, say, that they are walking down the street, or eating ice-cream); in the latter case their beliefs are false. Since the argument says one cannot know whether one is a brain in a vat, then one cannot know whether most of one's beliefs might be completely false. Since, in principle, it is impossible to rule out oneself being a brain in a vat, there cannot be good grounds for believing any of the things one believes; a skeptical argument would contend that one certainly cannot ''know'' them, raising issues with the [[epistemology|definition of knowledge]].

The brain in a vat is a contemporary version of the argument given in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Maya (illusion)|Maya illusion]], [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi (book)#"The Butterfly Dream"|Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", and the [[evil demon]] in [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

Brain-in-a-vat scenarios—or closely related scenarios in which the protagonist is in a [[virtual reality]] simulation and unaware of this fact—have also been used for purposes other than skeptical arguments.  For example, Vincent Conitzer uses such a scenario to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.)  That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine his [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in a VR simulation that he has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation he is watching.  Could he not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

== Philosophical debates ==
While the disembodied brain (the brain in a vat) can be seen as a helpful thought experiment, there are several philosophical debates surrounding the plausibility of the thought experiment. If these debates conclude that the thought experiment is implausible, a possible consequence would be that we are no closer to knowledge, truth, consciousness, representation, etc. than we were prior to the experiment.

=== Argument from biology ===
One argument against the BIV thought experiment derives from the idea that the BIV is not  and cannot be biologically similar to that of an embodied brain (that is, a brain found in a person). Since the BIV is ''dis''embodied, it follows that it does not have a similar biology to that of an embodied brain. That is, the BIV lacks the connections from the body to the brain, which renders the BIV neither [[Neuroanatomy|neuroanatomically]] nor [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologically]] similar to that of an embodied brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/HEYABI |title=A Brain in a Vat Cannot Break Out:  Why the Singularity Must be Extended, Embedded, and Embodied |last=Heylighen |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Heylighen |date=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]] |volume=19 |issue=1–2 |pages=126-142 |doi = |pmid = |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/521450 |title=Brain in a Vat or Body in a World? Brainbound versus Enactive Views of Experience|last=Thompson |first=Evan |authorlink=Evan Thompson |last2=Cosmelli |first2=Diego |date=Spring 2011 |journal=[[Philosophical Topics]] |publisher=[[University of Arkansas]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=163-180}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, we cannot say that it is even possible for the BIV to have similar experiences to the embodied brain, since the brains are not equal.

=== Argument from externalism ===
A second argument deals directly with the stimuli coming into the brain. This is often referred to as the account from [[externalism]] or ultra-externalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Consciousness, Information and External Relations|last = Kirk|first = Robert|date = 1997|journal = Communication and Cognition |volume=30 |issue=3–4|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the BIV, the brain receives stimuli from a machine. In an embodied brain, however, the brain receives the stimuli from the sensors found in the body (via touching, tasting, smelling, etc.) which receive their input from the external environment. This argument oftentimes leads to the conclusion that there is a difference between what the BIV is representing and what the embodied brain is representing. This debate has been hashed out, but remains unresolved, by several philosophers including Uriah Kriegel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 180–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin McGinn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Consciousness and Content|last = McGinn|first = Colin|date = 1988|journal = Proceedings of the British Academy |volume=76|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 219–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Rupert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sufficiency of Objective Representation|last = Rupert|first = Robert|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 180–95|work = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate has ramifications for [[philosophy of mind]] discussions on (but not limited to) [[Mental representation|representation]], [[consciousness]], content, [[cognition]], and [[embodied cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When Is Cognition Embodied|last = Shapiro|first = Lawrence|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 73–90|work = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon nanotubes''' ('''CNTs''') are [[allotropes of carbon]] with a [[cylindrical]] [[nanostructure]]. These cylindrical [[carbon]] [[molecule]]s have unusual properties, which are valuable for [[nanotechnology]], [[electronics]], [[optics]] and other fields of [[materials science]] and technology. Owing to the material's exceptional strength and stiffness, nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up to 132,000,000:1,&lt;ref name="Longest"&gt;

In addition, owing to their extraordinary [[thermal conductivity]], mechanical, and [[electricity|electrical]] properties, carbon nanotubes find applications as additives to various structural materials. For instance, nanotubes form a tiny portion of the material(s) in some (primarily [[carbon fiber]]) baseball bats, golf clubs, car parts or [[damascus steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/11/061116-nanotech-swords.html|title=Legendary Swords' Sharpness, Strength From Nanotubes, Study Says|website=news.nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Nanotubes are members of the [[fullerene]] structural family. Their name is derived from their long, hollow structure with the walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of carbon, called [[graphene]]. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("[[chirality|chiral]]") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides the nanotube properties; for example, whether the individual nanotube shell is a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]]. Nanotubes are categorized as [[#Single-walled|single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[#Multi-walled|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs). Individual nanotubes naturally align themselves into "ropes" held together by [[van der Waals force]]s, more specifically, [[pi-stacking]].

Applied [[quantum chemistry]], specifically, [[orbital hybridization]] best describes chemical bonding in nanotubes. The [[chemical bonding]] of nanotubes involves entirely [[Sp2 bond|''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]-hybrid carbon atoms. These bonds, which are similar to those of [[graphite]] and stronger than those found in [[alkane]]s and [[diamond]] (which employ [[Sp3 bond|''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]-hybrid carbon atoms), provide nanotubes with their unique strength.

== Types of carbon nanotubes and related structures ==
There is no consensus on some terms describing carbon nanotubes in scientific literature: both "-wall" and "-walled" are being used in combination with "single", "double", "triple" or "multi", and the letter C is often omitted in the abbreviation; for example, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT).

=== Single-walled ===

where ''a'' = 0.246&amp;nbsp;nm.

SWNTs are an important variety of carbon nanotube because most of their properties change significantly with the (''n'',''m'') values, and this dependence is non-monotonic (see [[Optical properties of carbon nanotubes#Kataura plot|Kataura plot]]). In particular, their [[band gap]] can vary from zero to about 2 eV and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior. Single-walled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturizing electronics. The most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire, and SWNTs with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors.&lt;ref&gt;

Because SWNTs are p-FETs when exposed to oxygen and n-FETs otherwise, it is possible to expose half of an SWNT to oxygen and protect the other half from it. The resulting SWNT acts as a ''not'' logic gate with both p and n-type FETs in the same molecule.

Prices for single-walled nanotubes declined from around $1500 per gram as of 2000 to retail prices of around $50 per gram of as-produced 40–60% by weight SWNTs as of March 2010. As of 2016 the retail price of as-produced 75% by weight SWNTs were $2 per gram, cheap enough for widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocsial.com/en/product/tuball/ Single wall carbon nanotubes] at OCSiAl web site&lt;/ref&gt; SWNTs are forecast to make a large impact in electronics applications by 2020 according to ''The Global Market for Carbon Nanotubes'' report.

=== Multi-walled ===
[[Image:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]
[[Image:Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube.png|thumb|upright|Triple-walled armchair carbon nanotube]]

Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) consist of multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphene. There are two models that can be used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the ''[[Matryoshka doll|Russian Doll]]'' model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the ''[[Scroll (parchment)|Parchment]]'' model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or semiconducting. Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.&lt;ref&gt;

Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) form a special class of nanotubes because their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and properties are similar to those of SWNTs but they are more resistant to chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is especially important when it is necessary to graft chemical functions to the surface of the nanotubes ([[Surface functionalization|functionalization]]) to add properties to the CNT. Covalent functionalization of SWNTs will break some C=C [[double bond]]s, leaving "holes" in the structure on the nanotube, and thus modifying both its mechanical and electrical properties. In the case of DWNTs, only the outer wall is modified. DWNT synthesis on the gram-scale was first proposed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;

The foliate density can vary as a function of deposition conditions (e.g. temperature and time) with their structure ranging from few layers of [[graphene]] (&lt; 10) to thicker, more [[graphite]]-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Charles B.|author2=Akshay S.

Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of [[tensile strength]] and [[elastic modulus]] respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms. In 2000, a multi-walled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of {{convert|63|GPa}}.&lt;ref name="Strength and Breaking"&gt;{{cite journal

Although the strength of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa.&lt;ref name="T.

On the other hand, there was evidence that in the radial direction they are rather soft. The first [[Transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscope]] observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the [[van der Waals force]]s can deform two adjacent nanotubes. Later, [[nanoindentation]]s with [[atomic force microscope]] were performed by several groups to quantitatively measure radial elasticity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and tapping/contact mode [[atomic force microscopy]] was also performed on single-walled carbon nanotubes. Young's modulus of on the order of several GPa showed that CNTs are in fact very soft in the radial direction.

[[Image:Carbon nanotube bands.gif|thumb|Band structures computed using tight binding approximation for (6,0) CNT (zigzag, metallic), (10,2) CNT (semiconducting) and (10,10) CNT (armchair, metallic).]]
Unlike graphene, which is a two-dimensional semimetal, carbon nanotubes are either metallic or semiconducting along the tubular axis.  For a given (''n'',''m'') nanotube, if ''n'' = ''m'', the nanotube is metallic; if ''n'' − ''m'' is a multiple of 3 and n ≠ m and nm ≠ 0, then the nanotube is quasi-metallic with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate [[semiconductor]].&lt;ref name="QuantumTransport"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Edward A.|last=Laird|first2=Ferdinand|last2=Kuemmeth|first3=Gary A.|last3=Steele|first4=Kasper|last4=Grove-Rasmussen|first5=Jesper|last5=Nygård|first6=Karsten|last6=Flensberg|first7=Leo P.|last7=Kouwenhoven|title=Quantum Transport in Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume=87|issue=3|pages=703–764|year=2015|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.87.703|arxiv = 1403.6113 |bibcode = 2015RvMP...87..703L |url=https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A6a686f0b-1314-42ad-b6c1-7f3cc5edddb8/datastream/OBJ/download}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus all armchair (''n'' = ''m'') nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.&lt;ref name="Curvature"&gt;{{cite journal|first=X.|last=Lu|first2=Z.|title=Curved Pi-Conjugation, Aromaticity, and the Related Chemistry of Small Fullerenes (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) and Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Chemical Reviews]]|volume=105|pages=3643–3696|year=2005|doi=10.1021/cr030093d|issue=10|last2=Chen|pmid=16218563}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon nanotubes are not semimetallic because the degenerate point (that point where the π [bonding] band meets the π* [anti-bonding] band, at which the energy goes to zero) is slightly shifted away from the ''K'' point in the Brillouin zone due to the curvature of the tube surface, causing hybridization between the σ* and π* anti-bonding bands, modifying the band dispersion.

The rule regarding metallic versus semiconductor behavior has exceptions, because curvature effects in small diameter tubes can strongly influence electrical properties. Thus, a (5,0) SWCNT that should be semiconducting in fact is metallic according to the calculations. Likewise, zigzag and chiral SWCNTs with small diameters that should be metallic have a finite gap (armchair nanotubes remain metallic).&lt;ref name="Curvature"/&gt; In theory, metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is more than 1,000 times greater than those of metals such as [[copper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Seunghun|last=Hong|year=2007|title=Nanotube Electronics: A flexible approach to mobility|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=2|pages=207–208|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.89|pmid=18654263|last2=Myung|first2=S|issue=4|bibcode = 2007NatNa...2..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt; where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by [[electromigration]].  Carbon nanotubes are thus being explored as [[Carbon nanotubes in interconnects|interconnects]], conductivity enhancing components in composite materials and many groups are attempting to commercialize highly conducting electrical wire assembled from individual carbon nanotubes.

Because of its nanoscale cross-section, electrons propagate only along the tube's axis. As a result, carbon nanotubes are frequently referred to as one-dimensional conductors. The maximum [[electrical conductance]] of a single-walled carbon nanotube is 2''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''h'' is the [[Conductance quantum|conductance of a single ballistic quantum channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.79.677| title = Electronic and transport properties of nanotubes| journal = Reviews of Modern Physics| volume = 79| issue = 2| pages = 677–732| year = 2007| last1 = Charlier | first1 = J.

Due to the role of the π-electron system in determining the [[Graphene#Electronic|electronic properties of graphene]], [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] in carbon nanotubes differs from that of bulk crystalline semiconductors from the same group of the periodic table (e.g. silicon).  Graphitic substitution of carbon atoms in the nanotube wall by boron or nitrogen dopants leads to p-type and n-type behavior, respectively, as would be expected in silicon.  However, some non-substitutional (intercalated or adsorbed) dopants introduced into a carbon nanotube, such as alkali metals as well as electron-rich metallocenes, result in n-type conduction because they donate electrons to the π-electron system of the nanotube.  By contrast, π-electron acceptors such as FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or electron-deficient metallocenes function as p-type dopants since they draw π-electrons away from the top of the valence band.

=== Optical ===
{{Main|Optical properties of carbon nanotubes}}Carbon nanotubes have useful [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption]], [[photoluminescence]] ([[fluorescence]]), and [[Raman spectroscopy]] properties. Spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and non-destructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes. There is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view: numerous parameters of the [[Carbon nanotube#Synthesis|nanotube synthesis]] can be changed, intentionally or unintentionally, to alter the nanotube quality. As shown below, optical absorption, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopies allow quick and reliable characterization of this "nanotube quality" in terms of non-tubular carbon content, structure (chirality) of the produced nanotubes, and structural defects. Those features determine nearly any other properties such as optical, mechanical, and electrical properties.

[[Carbon nanotubes]] are unique "one-dimensional systems" which can be envisioned as rolled single sheets of [[graphite]] (or more precisely [[graphene]]). This rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties. The diameter typically varies in the range 0.4–40&amp;nbsp;nm (i.e. "only" ~100 times), but the length can vary ~100,000,000,000 times, from 0.14&amp;nbsp;nm to 55.5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Zhang|first2=Y.|last3=Zhang|first3=Q.|last4=Xie|first4=H.|last5=Qian|first5=W.|last6=Wei|first6=F.|year=2013|title=Growth of Half-Meter Long Carbon Nanotubes Based on Schulz–Flory Distribution|journal=ACS Nano|volume=7|issue=7|pages=6156–6161|doi=10.1021/nn401995z|pmid=23806050|last1=Zhang|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nanotube [[aspect ratio]], or the length-to-diameter ratio, can be as high as 132,000,000:1,&lt;ref name="Longest2"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Fabrication of Ultralong and Electrically Uniform Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Clean Substrates|journal=Nano Letters|volume=9|issue=9|pages=3137–3141|bibcode=2009NanoL...9.3137W|doi=10.1021/nl901260b|pmid=19650638|author=Xueshen Wang|display-authors=etal|url=http://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/page/liy/labhomepage/publications/2009/2009NL.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.2744|access-date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808164154/http://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/page/liy/labhomepage/publications/2009/2009NL.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is unequalled by any other material. Consequently, all the properties of the carbon nanotubes relative to those of typical semiconductors are extremely [[anisotropic]] (directionally dependent) and tunable.

Whereas mechanical, electrical and electrochemical ([[supercapacitor]]) properties of the carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate [[Carbon nanotube#Potential and current applications|applications]], the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear.

Crystallographic defects also affect the tube's electrical properties. A common result is lowered conductivity through the defective region of the tube. A defect in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting, and single monatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;''Carbon-Based Magnetism: An Overview of the Magnetism of Metal Free Carbon-based Compounds and Materials'', Tatiana Makarova and Fernando Palacio (eds.), Elsevier, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

All nanotubes are expected to be very good [[thermal conductor]]s along the tube, exhibiting a property known as "[[ballistic conduction]]", but good insulators lateral to the tube axis. Measurements show that an individual SWNT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity along its axis of about 3500 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;ref name="Pop"&gt;

Crystallographic defects strongly affect the tube's thermal properties. Such defects lead to [[phonon]] scattering, which in turn increases the relaxation rate of the phonons. This reduces the [[mean free path]] and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures. Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons. However, larger-scale defects such as [[Stone Wales defect]]s cause phonon scattering over a wide range of frequencies, leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=N.|last=Mingo|year=2008|title=Phonon transmission through defects in carbon nanotubes from first principles|journal=Phys.

== Synthesis ==
{{Main|Synthesis of carbon nanotubes}}

Techniques have been developed to produce nanotubes in sizable quantities, including arc discharge, laser ablation, [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) and high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation (HiPCO). Among these arc discharge, laser ablation, [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) are batch by batch process and HiPCO is gas phase continuous process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaev|first=Pavel|date=April 2004|title=Gas-phase production of single-walled carbon nanotubes from carbon monoxide: a review of the hipco process|journal=Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology|volume=4|issue=4|pages=307–316|issn=1533-4880|pmid=15296221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these processes take place in a vacuum or with process gases. The CVD growth method is popular, as it yields high quantity and has a degree of control over diameter, length and morphology. Using particulate catalysts, large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods, but achieving the repeatability becomes a major problem with CVD growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_zVa647-80C&amp;pg=PA476&amp;lpg=PA476|title=Nanomedicine Design of Particles, Sensors, Motors, Implants, Robots, and Devices|last=Schulz|first=Mark J.|last2=Shanov|first2=Vesselin N.|last3=Yun|first3=Yeoheung|date=2009|publisher=Artech House|isbn=9781596932807|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HiPCO process advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi, K.; Hayashi, T.; Kim, Y.

Volume 5, Issue 1, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The HiPCO process helps in producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes in higher quantity. The HiPCO reactor operates at high [[temperature]] 900-1100&amp;nbsp;°C and high [[pressure]] ~30-50 bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bronikowski|first=Michael J.|last2=Willis|first2=Peter A.|last3=Colbert|first3=Daniel T.|last4=Smith|first4=K.

These catalyst acts as the [[nucleation]] site for the nanotubes to grow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] are also grown by thermal chemical vapor deposition.  A substrate (quartz, silicon, stainless steel, etc.) is coated with a catalytic metal (Fe, Co, Ni) layer.  Typically that layer is iron, and is deposited via sputtering to a thickness of 1–5&amp;nbsp;nm.  A 10–50&amp;nbsp;nm underlayer of alumina is often also put down on the substrate first. This imparts controllable wetting and good interfacial properties.
When the substrate is heated to the growth temperature (~700&amp;nbsp;°C), the continuous iron film breaks up into small islands… each island then nucleates a carbon nanotube.  The sputtered thickness controls the island size, and this in turn determines the nanotube diameter. Thinner iron layers drive down the diameter of the islands, and they drive down the diameter of the nanotubes grown.  The amount of time that the metal island can sit at the growth temperature is limited, as they are mobile, and can merge into larger (but fewer) islands.  Annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density (number of CNT/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) while increasing the catalyst diameter.

The as-prepared carbon nanotubes always have impurities such as other forms of carbon (amorphous carbon, fullerene, etc.) and non-carbonaceous impurities (metal pes used for catalyst).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Itkis|first=M.

{{Main|Carbon nanotube chemistry|Selective chemistry of single-walled nanotubes}}
Carbon nanotubes can be functionalized to attain desired properties that can be used in a wide variety of applications. The two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their apparent hydrophobic nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stando|first=Grzegorz|last2=Łukawski|first2=Damian|last3=Lisiecki|first3=Filip|last4=Janas|first4=Dawid|date=2019-01|title=Intrinsic hydrophilic character of carbon nanotube networks|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169433218323468|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=463|pages=227–233|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.08.206|issn=0169-4332}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbon nanotubes]] tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite.

== Applications ==

=== Current ===
Current use and application of nanotubes has mostly been limited to the use of bulk nanotubes, which is a mass of rather unorganized fragments of nanotubes. Bulk nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes, but such composites may, nevertheless, yield strengths sufficient for many applications. Bulk carbon nanotubes have already been used as composite fibers in [[polymers]] to improve the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the bulk product.

The strength and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests they will have an important role in [[nanotechnology]] engineering.

CNTs are potential candidates for future via and wire material in nano-scale VLSI circuits.

{{Main|Health and safety hazards of nanomaterials|Health impact of fullerenes}}

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) is the leading United States federal agency conducting research and providing guidance on the occupational safety and health implications and applications of nanotechnology. Early scientific studies have indicated that some of these nanoscale particles may pose a greater health risk than the larger bulk form of these materials. In 2013, NIOSH published a Current Intelligence Bulletin detailing the potential hazards and  recommended exposure limit for carbon nanotubes and fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/default.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers (2013–145)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, single wall carbon nanotubes have been registered through the European Union's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) regulations, based on evaluation of the potentially hazardous properties of SWCNT. Based on this registration, SWCNT commercialization is allowed in the EU up to 10 metric tons. Currently, the type of SWCNT registered through REACH is limited to the specific type of single wall carbon nanotubes manufactured by [[OCSiAl]], which submitted the application.&lt;ref name="reach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcimag.com/articles/102634-reach-registration-completed-for-single-wall-carbon-nanotubes|title=REACH Registration Completed for Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes|date=16 October 2016|website=pcimag.com|publisher=PCI Mag|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry of excitement and could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes. Though Iijima has been given much of the credit for discovering carbon nanotubes, it turns out that the timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991.&lt;ref name="carbon1" /&gt;

In 1952, L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''.&lt;ref name="CVD"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Радушкевич|first=Л.

Monthioux and Kuznetsov mentioned in their ''Carbon'' editorial:&lt;ref name="carbon" /&gt; {{quote|text=The fact is, Radushkevich and Lukyanovich [..] should be credited for the discovery that carbon filaments could be hollow and have a nanometer- size diameter, that is to say for the discovery of carbon nanotubes.}}

In 1976, [[Morinobu Endo]] of [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] observed hollow tubes of rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Filamentous growth of carbon through benzene decomposition|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(76)90115-9|first=A.|last=Oberlin|year=1976 |volume=32|pages=335–349|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|issue=3|last2=Endo|first2=M.|last3=Koyama|first3=T.|bibcode = 1976JCrGr..32..335O|url=http://www.kroto.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1.M.ENdoJCrystalGrowth1976.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first specimens observed would later come to be known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).&lt;ref name="carbon2"&gt;{{Cite report|title=WTEC Panel Report on 'International Assessment of Research and Development of Carbon Nanotube Manufacturing and Applications' Final Report|author=Eklund, Peter C. |publisher=World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC)|year=2007|url=http://www.wtec.org/cnm/CNM_final_report.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Endo, M.|title=Grow carbon fibers in the vapor phase|journal=Chemtec|url=http://nanotube.msu.edu/nt05/abstracts/NT05_MEndo.pdf|volume=18|issue=9|pages=568–576|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber.&lt;ref name="carbon2" /&gt; The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo.&lt;ref name="carbon2" /&gt; In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.&lt;ref name="carbon2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koyama, T. and Endo, M.T. (1983) "Method for Manufacturing Carbon Fibers by a Vapor Phase Process," Japanese Patent, 1982-58, 966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, John Abrahamson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the 14th Biennial Conference of Carbon at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers that were produced on carbon anodes during arc discharge. A characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Structure of Carbon Fibers Found on Carbon Arc Anodes|journal=Carbon|volume=37|year=1999|pages=1873–1874|last=Abrahamson|first=John|last2=Wiles|first2=Peter G.|last3=Rhoades|first3=Brian L.|doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(99)00199-2|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a group of Soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and [[X-ray scattering techniques|XRD]] patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).&lt;ref&gt;Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Metals. 1982, #3, pp. 12–17 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Howard G. Tennent of Hyperion Catalysis was issued a U.S. patent for the production of "cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils" with a "constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70&amp;nbsp;nanometers..., length 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times the diameter, and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent|country=US|number=4663230|title=Carbon fibrils, method for producing same and compositions containing same|gdate=1987-05-05|fdate=1984-12-06|invent1=Tennent, Howard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue. Many believe that Iijima's report in 1991 is of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness of the scientific community as a whole.&lt;ref name="carbon1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carbon2" /&gt;

'''Codex Digital''' creates digital production workflow tools for motion pictures, commercials, independent films, and TV productions.  

Codex products include recorders and media processing systems that transfer digital files and images from the camera to post-production, and tools for colour dynamics, dailies creation, archiving, review, and digital asset management.

Codex is based out of London, UK, with offices in Los Angeles, CA, and Wellington, NZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://codex.online/contact|title=Contact|website=codex.online|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past Products==
Codex recorders are high-resolution media recording systems, designed to capture pictures and sound from [[digital cinematography]] cameras. The first cameras Codex supported were the [[Arri Alexa|ARRI Alexa]], the Sony [[CineAlta]] series, the [[Genesis (Panavision)|Panavision Genesis]] and the [[Arriflex D-21]]. They recorded twin [[Chroma subsampling|4:4:4]] dual-link [[HD-SDI]] inputs for A &amp; B camera or [[3-D film|stereoscopic 3D]] work at up to 16-bits colour depth.

Codex products used a touchscreen interface and removable "data packs" containing up to 10TB of [[RAID|raid array]] disk storage. Interfaces for digital cinematography cameras include single and dual-link [[HD-SDI]] and [[Infiniband]]. Codex uses what they call a "Virtual File System" or in technical terms, it acts as a [[file server]]. When accessed via a conventional [[Ethernet]] network, the captured material can be viewed in a number of resolutions and formats, such as [[QuickTime]], [[MXF]], [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[WAV]] and [[JPEG]].

The  Codex Studio recorder was introduced in 2005 and was used as the capture device for [[Dalsa]] cameras.

 [[Image:Codex_portable1.jpg|thumb|right|The Codex portable recorder]]
2007 saw the introduction of the Codex portable recording system. With a design based on the larger Codex studio recorder, this unit was a compact, battery-powered variant which claims "visually lossless" recording.

2010 saw the introduction of the Codex onboard recording system. Based on the larger Codex portable recorder, this is another compact, battery-powered variant which offers uncompressed and wavelet-based recording. The recorder mounts directly on the camera and weighs in at 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg.

The Codex recording systems have been used on past projects, such as Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland," Michael Apted's "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", Joseph Kosinski's "Tron Legacy" and Roland Emmerich's "Anonymous."

A '''cubicle curtain''' or '''hospital curtain''' is a dividing cloth used in a medical treatment facility that provides a private enclosure for one or more patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|4377195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curtain is usually made from inherently [[flame retardant]] (IFR) fabric, and is suspended from a supporting structure or ceiling track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=N4J7AAAAEBAJ&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=cubicle%20curtains&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Andrews, CE. “Cubicle curtain and IV track support and mounting clip.” United States Patent. 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

Healthcare cubicle curtains are constructed from different woven fabrics stitched together with the top portion of open mesh of the curtain as required by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA-701 large &amp; small scale).  The suggested fire prevention and regulatory codes are followed by local, state and Federal fire marshals with Healthcare patient safety in mind. The suggestion for mesh is seventy-percent (70%) open allowing for ceiling sprinkler head water penetration in event of fire.  The vertical length requirement for mesh size is determined by the number of horizontal inches of the curtain ceiling track from the sprinkler head.  Example:  If ceiling track is six (6") inches from ceiling sprinkler head, the required vertical length of the mesh is approximately six (6") inches.  The maximum vertical mesh length required is eighteen inches (18") regardless of additional distance from the ceiling sprinkler head.  The code for the vertical mesh requirement is found under National Fire Protection Agency code NFPA-701/large and small scale (NFPA-701). The lower portion of the cubicle curtain is opaque to ensure patient privacy. Cubicle curtain fabrics with an antimicrobial finish are not required by code but are becoming more common in medical treatment facilities to reduce the spread of germs within a facility. All cubicle curtains are required to be fire-retardant by NFPA code.  The fire-retardant properties can be topically applied and/or inherent to a wide range of synthetic fibers used for cubicle curtains.

==Design==

Cubicle curtain design underwent a period of rapid growth in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Zelinsky, Marilyn. "Clients talk about... cubicle curtains." ''Interiors'' 156.9 (Sept 1997): 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of traditional solids and tone-on-tones, a broader range of subtle colors, muted tones, and soft hues became available along with different textures and more elaborate patterns. Nature themed cubicle curtains&lt;ref&gt;Motoko, Rich. "Healthy Hospital Designs." ''The Wall Street Journal'', Marketplace, 27 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; are popular as well as customizable options.

==Problems==

Cubicle curtains have been known to cause HAI’s ([[Hospital Acquired Infections]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://accordcurtains.com/v1/antimicrobial/ Donskey, Curtis &amp; Floyd Trillis, III, BS; Elizabeth C. Eckstein, RN; Rachel Budavich, BS; Michael J. Pultz, BS, Contamination of Hospital Curtains With Healthcare‐Associated Pathogens, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 29.11(November 2008): 1074-1076.]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) on cubicle curtains in hospitals. Since the exposure of this phenomenon, some medical treatment facilities have begun to use anti-microbial curtains in an effort to impede the spread of HAI's.

==Examples ==
Cubicle curtains can be used in hospital curtains and must be complaint to National Health Standard in the United Kingdom for infection control and flame retardant to British Standard BS5867 for drapery material.

Fitting room cubicle curtains are used for privacy whilst in retail premises for whilst customers are dressing into clothes. In the United Kingdom these need to be certified to BS5867 for use in commercial environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Curb  weight''' ([[American English]]) or '''kerb weight''' ([[British English]]) is the total [[Mass|weight]] of a [[vehicle]] with standard equipment and [[hardpoint]]s, all necessary operating [[consumables]] such as [[motor oil]], transmission oil, [[coolant]], [[air conditioning]] refrigerant, and sometimes a full tank of [[fuel]], while not loaded with either [[passenger]]s, [[cargo]], or weaponry.

This definition may differ from definitions used by [[government]]al [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] or other organizations. For example, many [[European Union]] manufacturers include the weight of a {{convert|75|kg|lb|adj=on}} driver to follow European Directive 95/48/EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0048:EN:HTML | title= EU Commission Directive 95/48/EC | publisher = [[European Commission]] | accessdate=2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations may also define curb weight with fixed levels of fuel and other variables to equalize the value for the comparison of different vehicles.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations &lt;ref&gt;40CFR§86.1803–01 Definitions&lt;/ref&gt; define curb weight as follows:  Curb weight means the actual or the manufacturer’s estimated weight of the vehicle in operational status with all standard equipment, and weight of fuel at nominal tank capacity, and the weight of optional equipment computed  in accordance with §86.1832–01; incomplete light-duty trucks shall have the curb weight specified by the manufacturer.

'''Unladen mass''' depends on the manufacturer and can be the same as curb weight, however, it is often the total mass of the car without a driver, fluid or any additional equipment.

'''Direct Digital control ''' ('''DDC''') is the automated control of a condition or process by a digital device (computer).&lt;ref name=sugarman&gt;{{cite book | title = HVAC Fundamentals | author = Samuel C. Sugarman | publisher = The Fairmont Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-88173-489-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N23gDS3wrDUC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22direct+digital+control%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=5ro8SdjCHpOIkASioeD9Cg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Applied Control Theory | author = James R.

All instrumentation is gathered by various analog and digital converters which use the network to transport these signals to the central controller. The centralized computer then follows all of its production rules (which may incorporate sense points anywhere in the structure) and causes actions to be sent via the same network to valves, actuators, and other HVAC components that can be adjusted.

==Overview==
Central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the direct digital control program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, [[setpoint (control system)|setpoints]], controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms.

The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs, that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and [[analog signal|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] outputs for control of the medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices. Usually abbreviated as "DDC".

==History==
A very early example of a DDC system meeting the above requirements was completed by the Australian business [[Midac]] in 1981-1982 using R-Tec Australian designed hardware. The system installed at the [[University of Melbourne]] used a serial communications network, connecting campus buildings back to a control room "front end" system in the basement of the Old Geology building. Each remote or Satellite Intelligence Unit (SIU) ran 2 Z80 microprocessors whilst the front end ran eleven Z80's in a [[Parallel computing|Parallel Processing]] configuration with paged common memory. The z80 microprocessors shared the load by passing tasks to each other via the common memory and the communications network. This was possibly the first successful implementation of a distributed processing direct digital control.

==Data communication==
When DDC controllers are networked together they can share information through a data bus. The control system may speak 'proprietary' or 'open protocol' language to communicate on the data bus. Examples of open protocol language are [[BACnet]] (Building Automation Control Network), [[LonWorks]](Echelon), [[Modbus|Modbus TCP]] and [[KNX (standard)|KNX]].

==Integration==
When different DDC data networks are linked together they can be controlled from a shared platform. This platform can then share information from one language to another. For example, a LON controller could share a temperature value with a BACnet controller. The integration platform can not only make information shareable, but can interact with all the devices.

Most of the integration platforms are either a PC or a network applliance. In many cases, the [[Human–machine interface|HMI]] (human machine interface) or [[SCADA]] (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) are part of it. Integration platform examples, to name only a few, are the Tridium Niagara AX, Trend Controls,TAC Vista, CAN2GO and the Unified Architecture i.e. OPC (Open Connectivity) server technology used when direct connectivity is not possible.

==In HVAC==
DDC is often used to control the [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices such as valves via microprocessors using software to perform the control logic. Such systems receive analog and digital inputs from the sensors and devices installed in the HVAC system and, according to the control logic, provide analog or digital outputs to control the HVAC system devices.&lt;ref name=sugarman/&gt;

These systems may be mated with a software package that graphically allows operators to monitor, control, alarm and diagnose building equipment remotely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5371">{{unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
In engineering, a '''dog''' is a [[tool]] or part of a tool that prevents movement or imparts movement by offering physical obstruction or engagement of some kind. It may hold another object in place by blocking it, clamping it, or otherwise obstructing its movement. Or it may couple various parts together so that they move in unison – the primary example of this being a [[flexible drive]] to mate two shafts in order to transmit [[torque]]. Some devices use [[dog clutch]]es to lock together two spinning components. In a [[manual transmission]], the dog clutches, or "dogs" lock the selected gear to the shaft it rotates on. Unless the dog is engaged, the gear will simply freewheel on the shaft.

This word usage is a [[metaphor]] derived from the idea of a [[dog]] (animal) biting and holding on, the "dog" name derived from the basic idea of how a dog jaw locks on, by the movement of the jaw, or by the presence of many teeth. In engineering the "dog" device has some special engineering work when making it – it is not a simple part to make as it is not a simple bar or pipe, and the metal used in its construction is likely to be special rather than regular steel.

There is potential for confusion as "dog tensioners" are levers that are named due to the shape of the lever appearing as a dog leg, as the lever is in a [[pantograph]] arrangement, or "dog trailers", which are named due to the use of multiple trailers for transporting animal cages.

==Subtypes and examples of applications==

===Chainsaw dog===
Although not seen on all [[chainsaw]]s, when present chainsaw dogs are mounted where the bar meets the power head. Chainsaw dogs provide stability and serve as a sort of fulcrum for swinging the bar through the item being cut.
[[File:2מוזיאון העיר חיפה.JPG|thumb|Shutter dog|150x150px]]

===Shutter dog===
Functional [[Window shutter#Exterior shutters|exterior window shutters]] (which can be swung shut whenever storms approach in order to protect the window glass from impact by wind-blown debris) are held open during pleasant weather by wrought-iron or cast-iron dogs, which are called ''shutter dogs''.

===Bench dog===
A [[bench dog]] is an accessory used on a [[Workbench (woodworking)|woodworking workbench]] to allow clamping of wooden items whilst being worked.

===Ladder dog===
Ladder dogs are the parts of a ladder that hold the ladder at a certain height, and articulate against [[pawl]]s to allow adjustment.

=== {{Visible anchor|Hatch dog}} ===
[[File:US Navy 080815-N-8546L-014 Sailors assigned to the engineering repair division aboard the amphibious command ship USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19) raise an external hatch to perform maintenance on the watertight gasket and moving parts.jpg|thumb|300px|A hatch on [[USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19)|USS Blue Ridge]] with the hatch dogs clearly visible.]]
The doors that allow passage through [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] between compartments inside a ship can be closed during emergencies to seal off one compartment from another, thus sequestering water leaks, fires, or waves of air pressure and preventing them from compromising the rest of the ship's interior. The objects that are wedged against the door to hold it closed against the water or air pressure are an example of dogs. To ''dog the hatches'' means to close the hatches and dog them down (fasten them closed).

===Firedog (alias dog iron, andiron)===
[[Andiron]]s, which hold up the firewood in a fireplace, are sometimes called ''dogs'', ''firedogs'', or ''dog irons''.

===Clutch dog===
The [[clutch]] that mates the engine to the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] in a modern manual-shift automobile is a ''friction clutch'' whose disc and pressure plate are smooth; they lock up simply through friction. However, some kinds of clutches (including those inside an [[automatic transmission]]) may lock up via the engagement of dogs, rather than only through friction. These clutches are called ''[[dog clutch]]es'' and the dogs used within them are called ''clutch dogs''.

===Lathe dog===
The ''[[lathe dog]]'' (or ''lathe carrier'') is essentially analogous to a clutch dog. It is used to provide positive drive to a workpiece turning between centers on a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]]. Without the dog, the cutting tool would tend to "catch", e.g., stop the workpiece from turning while the headstock center continued to rotate, possibly causing damage to the workpiece, or the lathe.

===Feed dog===
The [[feed dogs]] of a sewing machine feed the fabric in a linear stepping motion past the needle.

===Log dog or timber dog===
In carpentry log dogs were used to repair [[Timber framing|timber frame]] joints. In [[hewing]] (shaping with an axe) timbers or sawing with some types of water powered sawmills log dogs are used to hold the timber in place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4514">[[File:Fachada ventilada lana de roca.JPG|thumb|Vertical, metal ''furring'' is applied to the wall to create a channel and receive the siding material]]
In [[construction]], '''furring''' (furring strips) are thin strips of wood or other material to level or raise surfaces of another material to prevent dampness, to make space for insulation, or to level and resurface ceilings or walls.&lt;ref&gt;"furring" def. 2.b and 2.c. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furring refers to the process of installing the strips and to the strips themselves. ''Firring'' is a U.K. term for wood strips which are usually 50&amp;nbsp;mm wide, tapered and fixed above wood roof joists to provide drainage falls below roof boarding. Furring strips themselves are typically referred to as ''[[batten]]s'' in the U.K. and sometimes the material is called ''strapping'' in the U.S.

==In buildings==
Wood furring strips typically measure 1 x 2 or 1 x 3 inches. They can be laid out perpendicular to studs or joists and nailed to them, or set vertically against an existing wall surface.  The spacing between the strips depends on the type of finishing material.  Wider spacing is typically used behind the heavy boards that support ceramic tiles.  Closely spaced strips are needed for thin panelling or plaster.  The use of strips with plaster, however, is called either [[lath and plaster]] or [[wattle and daub]].

Metal furring strips are used for commercial projects, or in towns where fire-proof supporting elements are required by the local building code. Often called "hat channels" to describe the profile (cross section), they consist of two flanges on each side of a trapezoid shape, 7/8 in thick.

Furring is also used to support roof materials and may be seen under barn and shed roofs but is now used less often, replaced by labor-saving [[plywood]].  [[Drywall]] has become the most common interior wall finishing material and does not need furring due to its strength.  Furring is still used in remodeling work to fill out uneven sections for resurfacing, or to add room for insulation.

== Ship repair ==
[[File:Frame Furring.png|thumb|alt=A Furring "is performed by ripping off the planks, and putting second timbers upon the first timbers, and upon them again other planks. And all this is done to make a ship to bear a better sail" (Perrin 1929, 92).]]

Furring is a type of ship rebuilding method indicative of the late 16th century and early 17th century England. It was adopted as a remedial process to solve [[crank ships]] that were built too narrow. When a ship could not bear sail, was too narrow or her bearing laid too low, a second layer of frames was attached to the first to make her broader and lay her bearing higher. This was done by ripping the planks off and applying the second frames on top of the original frames, and then adding the planks back on. "They commonly fur some two or three strakes under water and as much above, according as the ship requires, more or less." (Mainwaring, 153)

Although this appeared to have fixed the problems with "makeshift corrections" due to miscalculation, it was seen as a poor remedy and at times was used as a black listing method among shipwrights during the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th century England (ex. [[Phineas Pett]] and the ''Prince Royal'').

Because it was seen as such an incompetent occurrence to miscalculate while building, even the writers of the time had plenty to say about its uncertainties: "I think in all the world there are not so many ships furred as are in England, and it is a pity that there is no order taken either for the punishing of those who build such ships or the preventing of it, for it is an infinite loss to the owners and an utter spoiling and disgrace to all ships that are so handled (Mainwaring, 153)".

The only archaeological evidence of furring found to date is on the [[Princes Channel Wreck]].

'''Geocoder''' (Ruby) is a [[geocoding]] library for [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Geocoding helps to enhance webpages by presenting location relevant information to the user. When used with [[Rails framework|Rails]], Geocoder adds geocoding functionality such as finding coordinates with street addresses or vice versa in addition to distance calculations for [[Active record pattern|ActiveRecord]] objects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = File: README — Documentation for rails-geocoder (0.9.11)|url = http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rails-geocoder/0.9.11|website = www.rubydoc.info|access-date = 2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the functionality does not rely on proprietary database functions, finding different geocoded objects in an area works out-of-the-box for databases like [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]] and [[SQLite]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Compatibility ==
Geocoder has been fully tested with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, and [[JRuby]] 1.5.3.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Geocoder is compatible with Rails 3, but there is only limited functionality with Rails 2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Installation ==
'''The Prerequisites to installing Geocoder are [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[RubyGems]].'''

Geocoder gem can be installed with the following command:
 gem install geocoder
Or, if you're using [http://bundler.io/ Bundler] for Rails, you may add this to your [[Gemfile]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 gem 'geocoder'
and run at the [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|command prompt]]:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = alexreisner/geocoder:Complete ruby geocoding solution|url = https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder|website = www.github.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 bundle install
It can be used as a plugin with rails too:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
&lt;div class="plainlinks"&gt;
 rails plugin install git://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder.git
&lt;/div&gt;

== Configuration ==
In order to use Geocoder with objects, the project must be set up as follows:

=== Required Attributes ===

==== ActiveRecord ====
In order to use Geocoding with [[ActiveRecord (Castle)|ActiveRecord]] objects, they must have two additional attributes, [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] coordinates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When stored in the table they should be called ''latitude'' and ''longitude'' but they may be changed as explained below. When using reverse geocoding (translating a user's location coordinates into a physical address), the model must implement a method that returns an address.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The address may be a single attribute; however, it can also be a method which returns a string assembled from different attributes such as city, state, and country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Mongoid ====
When using [https://github.com/mongoid  Mongoid], the model only needs to add the address, latitude and longitudes as fields. The model must also include ''Geocoder::Model::Mongoid'' before making any calls to the ''geocoded_by:'' method''.'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Model Behavior ===
In the rails [[Model–view–controller|model]], Geocoder must be told which method returns the object's full address:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
 geocoded_by :full_street_address     #can also be an IP address
 
 after_validation :geocode       # auto-fetch coordinates
&lt;/source&gt;
For reverse geocoding, Geocoder must know which method returns latitude and longitude coordinates. If :address option is not provided, it fetches the address automatically in the address attribute. Else, it fetches the address into the location attribute like the example given below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
 reverse_geocoded_by :latitude, :longitude, 
    :address =&gt; :location
 
 after_validation: reverse_geocode     #auto-fetch address
&lt;/source&gt;
Forward and Reverse Geocoding on the same model is possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 geocoded_by :address
 reverse_geocoded_by :latitude, :longitude
 after_validation :geocode, :reverse_geocode

In order to use different names for latitude and longitude in the model, the following change may be done when implementing ''geocoded_by:''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
 geocoded_by :address, :latitude =&gt; :lat, :longitude =&gt; :lon
&lt;/source&gt;
Additionally, the address method may return any string that would be used to search [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any of the following examples will work:
* "123 Sample St, New York, NY"
* "[[Eiffel Tower]], Paris, FR"
* "[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], NC, US"

=== Services ===
By default, Geocoder makes use of [[Google]]'s geocoding [[Application programming interface|API]] to retrieve addresses and coordinates. Currently, these address geocoding services are supported:
* Google: {{code|:google}}&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Google Maps Geocoding API|url = https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro|website = Google Developers|access-date = 2016-02-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]]: {{code|:yahoo}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yahoo BOSS Geo Services|url = https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/|website = developer.yahoo.com|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geocoder.ca: {{code|:geocoder_ca}} (US &amp; Canada only)

== Examples ==
Here are some examples&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ruby Geocoder|url = http://www.rubygeocoder.com/|website = www.rubygeocoder.com|access-date = 2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate Geocoder functionality:

 Hotel.near("Raleigh, North Carolina")
Finds hotels near Raleigh.

 @restaurant.distance_to("Empire State Building")
Finds the distance from ''@restaurant'' to the Empire State Building.

== Applications ==
* Developers may also use Geocoder to convert a user's [[IP address|IP Address]] to their city location. By making such a conversion you may be able to offer user's content relevant to their current location without requiring to ask for it beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Search by location with Geocoder|url = http://www.synbioz.com/blog/search_by_location_with_geocoder|website = synbioz.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may be used for [[geo-spatial analysis]] in order to recognize patterns within the information. This is very useful in data mining applications.
* Web based [[GIS]] tools such as Google Maps, Yahoo Maps etc. include geocoding functionality.

{{Redirect|Handoff}}

{{No footnotes|date=February 2008}}

In [[cellular network|cellular]] [[telecommunications]], the terms  '''handover''' or '''handoff''' refer to the process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one channel connected to the [[core network]] to another channel. In [[satellite communications]] it is the process of transferring satellite control responsibility from one [[Earth station (communications)|earth station]] to another without loss or interruption of service.

==Terminology==
[[American English]]  uses the term ''handoff'', and this is most commonly used within some American organizations such as [[3GPP2]] and in American originated technologies such as [[CDMA2000]]. In [[British English]] the term ''handover'' is more common, and is used within international and European organisations such as [[ITU-T]], [[IETF]], [[ETSI]] and [[3GPP]], and standardised within European originated standards such as [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]]. The term handover is more common than handoff in academic research publications and literature, while handoff is slightly more common within the [[IEEE]] and [[ANSI]] organisations.{{or|date=November 2012}}

==Purpose==
In telecommunications there may be different reasons why a handover might be conducted:&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* when the phone is moving away from the area covered by one cell and entering the area covered by another cell the call is transferred to the second cell in order to avoid call termination when the phone gets outside the range of the first cell;
* when the capacity for connecting new calls of a given cell is used up and an existing or new call from a phone, which is located in an area overlapped by another cell, is transferred to that cell in order to free-up some capacity in the first cell for other users, who can only be connected to that cell;
* in non-[[CDMA]] networks when the channel used by the phone becomes interfered by another phone using the same channel in a different cell, the call is transferred to a different channel in the same cell or to a different channel in another cell in order to avoid the interference;
* again in non-CDMA networks when the user behaviour changes, e.g. when a fast-travelling user, connected to a large, umbrella-type of cell, stops then the call may be transferred to a smaller macro cell or even to a micro cell in order to free capacity on the umbrella cell for other fast-traveling users and to reduce the potential interference to other cells or users (this works in reverse too, when a user is detected to be moving faster than a certain threshold, the call can be transferred to a larger umbrella-type of cell in order to minimize the frequency of the handovers due to this movement);
* in CDMA networks a handover (see further down) may be induced in order to reduce the interference to a smaller neighboring cell due to the "[[Near-far problem|near-far]]" effect even when the phone still has an excellent connection to its current cell;
* etc.

The most basic form of handover is when a [[cell phone|phone]] [[telephone call|call]] in progress is redirected from its current [[cell site|cell]] (called ''source'') to a new cell (called ''target'').&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In terrestrial networks the source and the target cells may be served from two different cell sites or from one and the same cell site (in the latter case the two cells are usually referred to as two ''sectors'' on that cell site). Such a handover, in which the source and the target are different cells (even if they are on the same cell site) is called ''inter-cell'' handover. The purpose of inter-cell handover is to maintain the call as the subscriber is moving out of the area covered by the source cell and entering the area of the target cell.

A special case is possible, in which the source and the target are one and the same cell and only the used channel is changed during the handover. Such a handover, in which the cell is not changed, is called ''intra-cell'' handover. The purpose of intra-cell handover is to change one channel, which may be interfered or fading with a new clearer or less fading channel.

==Types==
In addition to the above classification of ''inter-cell'' and ''intra-cell'' classification of handovers, they also can be divided into hard and soft handovers:&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Hard handover: Is one in which the channel in the source cell is released and only then the channel in the target cell is engaged. Thus the connection to the source is broken before or 'as' the connection to the target is made—for this reason such handovers are also known as ''break-before-make''. Hard handovers are intended to be instantaneous in order to minimize the disruption to the call. A hard handover is perceived by network engineers as an event during the call. It requires the least processing by the network providing service. When the mobile is between base stations, then the mobile can switch with any of the base stations, so the base stations bounce the link with the mobile back and forth. This is called 'ping-ponging'.
;[[Soft handover]]: Is one in which the channel in the source cell is retained and used for a while in parallel with the channel in the target cell. In this case the connection to the target is established before the connection to the source is broken, hence this handover is called ''make-before-break''. The interval, during which the two connections are used in parallel, may be brief or substantial. For this reason the soft handover is perceived by network engineers as a state of the call, rather than a brief event. Soft handovers may involve using connections to more than two cells:  connections to three, four or more cells can be maintained by one phone at the same time. When a call is in a state of soft handover, the signal of the best of all used channels can be used for the call at a given moment or all the signals can be combined to produce a clearer copy of the signal. The latter is more advantageous, and when such combining is performed both in the [[downlink]] ([[forward link]]) and the [[uplink]] ([[reverse link]]) the handover is termed as ''softer''. Softer handovers are possible when the cells involved in the handovers have a single cell site.
Handover can also be classified on the basis of handover techniques used. Broadly they can be classified into three types:
#Network controlled handover
#Mobile phone assisted handover
#Mobile controlled handover

==Comparison==
An advantage of the hard handover is that at any moment in time one call uses only one channel. The hard handover event is indeed very short and usually is not perceptible by the user. In the old [[analog transmission|analog]] systems it could be heard as a click or a very short beep; in digital systems it is unnoticeable. Another advantage of the hard handover is that the phone's hardware does not need to be capable of receiving two or more channels in parallel, which makes it cheaper and simpler. A disadvantage is that if a handover fails the call may be temporarily disrupted or even terminated abnormally. Technologies which use hard handovers, usually have procedures which can re-establish the connection to the source cell if the connection to the target cell cannot be made. However re-establishing this connection may not always be possible (in which case the call will be terminated) and even when possible the procedure may cause a temporary interruption to the call.

One advantage of the soft handovers is that the connection to the source cell is broken only when a reliable connection to the target cell has been established and therefore the chances that the call will be terminated abnormally due to failed handovers are lower. However, by far a bigger advantage comes from the mere fact that simultaneously channels in multiple cells are maintained and the call could only fail if all of the channels are interfered or fade at the same time. Fading and interference in different channels are unrelated and therefore the probability of them taking place at the same moment in all channels is very low. Thus the reliability of the connection becomes higher when the call is in a soft handover. Because in a cellular network the majority of the handovers occur in places of poor coverage, where calls would frequently become unreliable when their channel is interfered or fading, soft handovers bring a significant improvement to the reliability of the calls in these places by making the interference or the fading in a single channel not critical. This advantage comes at the cost of more complex hardware in the phone, which must be capable of processing several channels in parallel. Another price to pay for soft handovers is use of several channels in the network to support just a single call. This reduces the number of remaining free channels and thus reduces the capacity of the network. By adjusting the duration of soft handovers and the size of the areas in which they occur, the network engineers can balance the benefit of extra call reliability against the price of reduced capacity.

==Possibility==
While theoretically speaking soft handovers are possible in any technology, analog or digital, the cost of implementing them for analog technologies is prohibitively high and none of the technologies that were commercially successful in the past (e.g. [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]], [[TACS]], [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]], etc.) had this feature. Of the digital technologies, those based on [[FDMA]] also face a higher cost for the phones (due to the need to have multiple parallel radio-frequency modules) and those based on [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] or a combination of TDMA/FDMA, in principle, allow not so expensive implementation of soft handovers. However, none of the [[2G]] (second-generation) technologies have this feature (e.g. GSM, [[D-AMPS]]/[[IS-136]], etc.). On the other hand, all CDMA based technologies, 2G and [[3G]] (third-generation), have soft handovers. On one hand, this is facilitated by the possibility to design not so expensive phone hardware supporting soft handovers for CDMA and on the other hand, this is necessitated by the fact that without soft handovers CDMA networks may suffer from substantial interference arising due to the so-called ''[[Near-far problem|near-far]]'' effect..

In all current commercial technologies based on FDMA or on a combination of TDMA/FDMA (e.g. GSM, AMPS, IS-136/DAMPS, etc.) changing the channel during a hard handover is realised by changing the pair of used transmit/receive [[frequency|frequencies]].

==Implementations==
For the practical realisation of handovers in a cellular network each cell is assigned a list of potential target cells, which can be used for handing over calls from this source cell to them. These potential target cells are called ''neighbors'' and the list is called ''neighbor list''. Creating such a list for a given cell is not trivial and specialized computer tools are used. They implement different algorithms and may use for input data from field measurements or computer predictions of radio wave propagation in the areas covered by the cells.

During a call one or more parameters of the signal in the channel in the source cell are monitored and assessed in order to decide when a handover may be necessary. The downlink (forward link) and/or uplink (reverse link) directions may be monitored. The handover may be requested by the phone or by the [[Base transceiver station|base station]] (BTS) of its source cell and, in some systems, by a BTS of a neighboring cell. The phone and the BTSes of the neighboring cells monitor each other's signals and the best target candidates are selected among the neighboring cells. In some systems, mainly based on CDMA, a target candidate may be selected among the cells which are not in the neighbor list. This is done in an effort to reduce the probability of interference due to the aforementioned near-far effect.

In analog systems the parameters used as criteria for requesting a hard handover are usually the ''received [[signal power]]'' and the ''received [[signal-to-noise ratio]]'' (the latter may be estimated in an analog system by inserting additional tones, with frequencies just outside the captured voice-frequency band at the transmitter and assessing the form of these tones at the receiver). In non-CDMA 2G digital systems the criteria for requesting hard handover may be based on estimates of the received signal power, [[bit error rate]] (BER) and [[Block Error Rate|block error/erasure rate]] (BLER), received quality of speech ([[RxQual]]), distance between the phone and the BTS (estimated from the radio signal propagation delay) and others. In CDMA systems, 2G and 3G, the most common criterion for requesting a handover is [[Ec/Io]] ratio measured in the [[pilot channel]] ([[CPICH]]) and/or [[RSCP]].

In CDMA systems, when the phone in soft or softer handover is connected to several cells simultaneously, it processes the received in parallel signals using a [[rake receiver]]. Each signal is processed by a module called ''rake finger''. A usual design of a rake receiver in mobile phones includes three or more rake fingers used in soft handover state for processing signals from as many cells and one additional finger used to search for signals from other cells. The set of cells, whose signals are used during a soft handover, is referred to as the ''active set''. If the search finger finds a sufficiently-strong signal (in terms of high Ec/Io or RSCP) from a new cell this cell is added to the active set. The cells in the neighbour list (called in CDMA ''neighbouring set'') are checked more frequently than the rest and thus a handover with a neighbouring cell is more likely, however a handover with others cells outside the neighbor list is also allowed (unlike in GSM, IS-136/DAMPS, AMPS, NMT, etc.).

== Reasons for failure ==
There are occurrences where a handoff is unsuccessful. Much research has been dedicated to this problem.{{such as|date=June 2018}} The source of the problem was discovered in the late 1980s.  Because frequencies cannot be reused in adjacent cells, when a user moves from one cell to another, a new frequency must be allocated for the call. If a user moves into a cell when all available channels are in use, the user’s call must be terminated. Also, there is the problem of signal interference where adjacent cells overpower each other resulting in receiver desensitization.

==Vertical handover==
{{Main|Vertical handover}}

There are also inter-technology handovers where a call's connection is transferred from one access technology to another, e.g. a call being transferred from GSM to UMTS or from CDMA [[IS-95]] to [[cdma2000]].

The 3GPP [[Generic access network|UMA/GAN]] standard enables GSM/UMTS handoff to Wi-Fi and vice versa.

==Handoff Prioritization==
Different systems have different methods for handling and managing handoff request. Some systems handle handoff in same way as they handle new originating call. In such system the probability that the handoff will not be served is equal to blocking probability of new originating call. But if the call is terminated abruptly in the middle of conversation then it is more annoying than the new originating call being blocked. So in order to avoid this abrupt termination of ongoing call handoff request should be given priority to new call this is called as handoff prioritization.

There are two techniques for this:
;Guard Channel Concept: In this technique, a fraction of the total available channels in a cell is reserved exclusively for handoff request from ongoing calls which may be handed off into the cell.
;Queuing: Queuing of handoffs is possible because there is a finite time interval between the time the received signal level drops below handoff threshold and the time the call is terminated due to insufficient signal level. The delay size is determined from the traffic pattern of a particular service area.

==Inter and Intra System Handoff==
;Inter System Handoff:
*If during ongoing call mobile unit moves from one cellular system to a different cellular system which is controlled by different MTSO, a handoff procedure which is used to avoid dropping of call is referred as Inter System Handoff.
*An MTSO engages in this handoff system. When a mobile signal becomes weak in a given cell and MTSO can not find other cell within its system to which it can transfer the call then it uses Inter system handoff.
*Before implementation of Inter System Handoff MTSO compatibility must be checked and in Inter System Handoff local call may become long distance call.

;Intra System Handoff:
*If during ongoing call mobile unit moves from one cellular system to adjacent cellular system which is controlled by same  MTSO, a handoff procedure which is used to avoid dropping of call is referred as Intra System Handoff.
*An MTSO engages in this handoff system. When a mobile signal becomes weak in a given cell and MTSO finds other cell within its system to which it can transfer the call then it uses Intra system handoff.
*In Intra System Handoff local calls always remain local call only since after handoff also the call is handled by same MTSO.

[[Image:LW high5.jpg|thumb|right|Elements of the Land Warrior system, as showcased by a U.S. Army soldier in 2006.]]

'''Land Warrior''' was a [[United States Army]] program, cancelled in 2007,&lt;ref name="USCUT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asafm.army.mil/budget/fybm/fy08-09/rforms/vol2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624213834/http://www.asafm.army.mil/budget/fybm/fy08-09/rforms/vol2.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }} U.S. Army Budget Request Documents FY2008 (page 4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SBNCUT"&gt;[http://www.strykernews.com/archives/2007/02/07/land_warrior_fu.html Stryker Brigade News&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Land Warrior funds cut]&lt;/ref&gt; but restarted in 2008,&lt;ref name="USDDRESTART"&gt;http://www.army-technology.com/projects/land_warrior/ Land Warrior at Army-Technology.com{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that used a combination of commercial, off-the-shelf technology ([[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]]) and current-issue military gear and equipment designed to:
* integrate [[small arms]] with high-tech equipment;
* provide [[communication]]s and [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] at the [[infantry]] soldier level;
* look at the individual infantry soldier as a complete unit rather than as a segment of a larger force.

While technology had long been a primary focus of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]], very little of it had actually been adopted by the U.S. Army infantry soldier. With growing concerns of [[urban warfare]] and dismounted infantry actions, the U.S. Army recognized the need to upgrade an individual infantryman. The Land Warrior program drew upon many [[wearable computer]] concepts, and maximized existing technologies to correct most infantry soldier limitations in the short term.

The SI ([[Stryker]] Interoperable) version of the system completed U.S. Army testing as of November 2004. Due to limited resources, and issues with the overall weight of the system, Land Warrior was cancelled by the Army in February 2007, but restarted in July 2007. Despite the initial system's cancellation the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) was deployed to Iraq as part of the spring 2007 "[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]]" of U.S. forces, and used the Land Warrior, on which they had trained for the previous few years.&lt;ref name="FCWCUT"&gt;[http://www.fcw.com/article97586-02-06-07-Web FCW.com News&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Army budget would kill Land Warrior]&lt;/ref&gt;

The systems and technology of the Land Warrior program were to be rolled into the [[Future Force Warrior]] program, and the Army has developed the [[Nett Warrior]] system to supersede Land Warrior as its next soldier network program.

Internationally, there are several similar development programs, these include [[IdZ]] ([[Germany]]), [[Future Integrated Soldier Technology|FIST]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]), [[Félin]] ([[France]]), [[Land 125]] ([[Australia]]), [[MARKUS]] ([[Sweden]]), [[Soldato Futuro]] ([[Italy]]), [[IMESS]] ([[Switzerland]]), [[Projekt TYTAN]] ([[Poland]]), [[FINSAS]] ([[India]]) and [[Advanced Combat Man System|ACMS]] ([[Singapore]]), [[Ratnik (equipment)|Ratnik]] ([[Russia]]), [[SARV]] ([[Iran]]).

== History ==
[[File:Land Warrior 2001.JPEG|right|thumb|A U.S. Army soldier displays the 21st Century, Land Warrior, Integrated Fighting System at [[Fort McPherson]], Georgia in June 2001. The system consists of a global positioning system, within a computer/radio subsystem.]]
The original Land Warrior program, by other name, was undertaken by [[General Electric]] in [[Moorestown, New Jersey]] approximately 1989, as a prototype having intent to eventually reduce size and weight in future phases. Then in the mid-1990s, the name Land Warrior was initially handled by a division of [[Hughes Aerospace]], which was subsequently acquired by [[Raytheon]]. (The soldier radio component of Land Warrior was to be supplied by the Integrated Information Systems division of [[Motorola]].&lt;ref name="sradio"&gt;  Initial tests with soldiers were conducted in 1995-96 in Fort Lewis with 1st Bn, 9th Infantry Regiment (light) using both squad-level information systems and Humvee mounted systems.  Early iterations (prototypes) of TWS (Thermal Weapons Sights) and integrated GPS systems were also in use with some initial, albeit limited, success.  In 2001, Motorola's Integrated Information Systems division, headquartered in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]], was acquired by [[General Dynamics]] and was renamed General Dynamics Decision Systems (GDDS) [http://www.gdc4s.com/news/newsprint.cfm?prid=112]. This division, now part of GDC4S, is the holder of the current Land Warrior&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Stryker Interoperable contract.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Early demonstration versions of the LW system used software written in the [[Ada programming language]] running on a [[Unix]] platform. In January 1999, in an attempt to reduce development costs and accelerate the program, the development work was transitioned to a multi-company team that had been organized by Exponent ([[NASDAQ]]: EXPO), an engineering firm with headquarters in [[Silicon Valley]].

An intensive redesign of the system ensued, and both the embedded [[firmware]] and the application software were rewritten from scratch. Many of the [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] hardware components were purchased (literally "off the shelf") at [[Fry's Electronics]], the Silicon Valley retail chain. Approximately 100 proof-of-concept Land Warrior units were built and successfully demonstrated in September 2000 by a U.S. Army platoon that was air-dropped into a large war-fighting exercise at [[Fort Polk]], [[Louisiana]].

These initial prototype units, designated Land Warrior v0.6, were built around a [[PC/104]] computer platform running [[Microsoft Windows]]. The system used the [[CAN-bus]] protocol on the wired PAN ([[personal area network]]). The communications subsystem was built using [[Windows CE]] running on a [[StrongARM]] platform, and the wireless network protocol was [[IEEE 802.11]]. During the Fort Polk exercise, preliminary interoperability with traditional military radio networks was also demonstrated for LW v0.6, using a two-way, [[SINCGARS]]-compatible gateway radio.

The success of the Fort Polk exercise reinvigorated the program, and further funding was allocated for the next phase of LW development. A "Land Warrior Consortium" was formed by several of the contracting firms, with the goal of designing and building the first field-able LW system, designated LW v1.0, later LW-IC (Land Warrior&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Initial Capability). The basic Windows and WinCE platforms were retained, and a new hybrid PAN was designed, which drew upon both [[USB]] and [[FireWire]] protocols. A modified version of the IEEE 802.11 protocol was adopted, which added various enhancements for [[COMSEC]] and [[information security]], [[mobile ad hoc network]] (MANET) capabilities, and support for multi-hop packet [[routing]].

In 2003, a variant of the LW-IC system was developed to incorporate features of the CombatID System (CIDS)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a form of IFF ([[identification friend or foe]]) that is designed to reduce the potential for [[friendly fire]] incidents. This version, designated LW-CIDS, was successfully demonstrated in interoperational tests with several other CIDS-equipped units at [[Moffett Field, California]].
[[Image:Land Warrior Iraq 071307.jpg|thumb|right|Land Warrior in use by a U.S. Army soldier from [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Battalion, 9th Infantry]] in Iraq in July 2007.]]
As the Land Warrior program matured, it became clear that its successful deployment would hinge significantly upon the key factor of batteries. The need to continuously resupply (or recharge) LW batteries was proving to be a major logistical challenge. This was one of the driving factors behind the decision to move away from an earlier plan to initially equip airborne Army units, as in the Fort Polk exercise, and to focus instead upon those using [[Stryker]] ground vehicle systems. This latter approach would enable more LW batteries to be distributed and/or recharged as needed.

The contract for development of the Land Warrior&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Stryker Interoperable (LW-SI) version of the system was awarded in 2003 to an industry team that was led by [[General Dynamics]]&lt;ref name="sradio"/&gt; and included most of the existing Land Warrior Consortium companies. At about the same time, further development of the existing LW-IC system was halted and the manufacturing plans for it were shelved indefinitely. The Land Warrior Consortium was formally disbanded and work got under way on the newly focused LW-SI program.

In September 2006, the 4th Battalion, [[U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment|9th Infantry Regiment]] trained with and evaluated the LW-SI system.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin, Sandra. [http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2006/May/LandWarrior.htm "'Land Warriors' Link Up With Stryker Vehicles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622085735/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2006/May/LandWarrior.htm |date=22 June 2006 }}, ''National Defense Magazine'', May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=9203 "Army assess new Land Warrior System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724124140/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=9203 |date=24 July 2006 }}, ''Army News Service'', 22 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The system successfully completed the assessment, which was based on [[Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System]] (JCIDS) guidance, and received testimonials from the unit. However, funding for further system development under the Land Warrior program was suspended in February 2007, although the 4-9 Infantry was deployed to Iraq and used the LW-SI system extensively. The Land Warrior program was then re-instated.&lt;ref name="USDDRESTART" /&gt; This was the final trial phase before the key decision is made on the overall future of wearable soldier systems, including [[Future Force Warrior]]. The decision was made in 2011 to continue the program.&lt;ref name="USCUT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SBNCUT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FCWCUT" /&gt;

==Description==
Land Warrior has three priority objectives:
* Improving the lethality of an individual soldier
* Increasing the [[survivability]] of a soldier
* Providing full command, communications, and control to a soldier

Land Warrior has seven main subsystems:
* ''Weapon''
* ''Integrated helmet assembly''
* ''Protective clothing and equipment''
* ''Computer''
* ''Navigation''
* ''Radio''
* ''Software system''

Later features of the Land Warrior system included:
* providing dismounted soldier combat identification for en route situational awareness and power recharge to reduce 'friendly fire' incidents
* Commander's Digital Assistant leader planning tool
* weight and power reduction
* scalability and tailorability for operational missions

=== Weapon ===
[[Image:Land Warrior 060707.jpg|right|thumb|A U.S. Army soldier showcases Land Warrior at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. in June 2007.]]
The original system was built around the [[M16 rifle]] or [[M4 carbine]], both with modular rail mounts to allow customization as needed for each mission. It included the weapon itself, plus components such as a daylight video sight, thermal weapons sight and MFL (Multi-Function Laser). The MFL provided range and direction information, as well as IR, visible, and MILES lasers, while the cameras provided a video feed and thermographic capabilities, plus allowing a soldier to shoot around corners or behind cover without actually exposing himself to enemy fire. This is highly effective for confirming kills without exposing one's position.

=== Helmet ===
The Helmet Subsystem (HSS) combined a lightweight advanced helmet with a computer and [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]] display that provided various information from digital maps and troop locations down to his weapon-mounted video camera. This is what would have allowed the soldier to see (and fire) around corners. The HSS also incorporated a microphone as well as a headset.

=== Armor and protection ===
The [[Interceptor Body Armor]] system and Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment ([[MOLLE (military)|MOLLE]]) load-bearing system currently in service with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] today are partially a result of the Land Warrior program.

=== Computer ===
The Computer Subsystem (CSS) provided the processing power and storage capacity for the system. The CSS is based around an [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[XScale]] processor. The CSS connects to each one of the [[Line-replaceable unit|LRU]]s as well as to the batteries.

=== Navigation ===
The Navigation Subsystem (NSS) provided positional information, it integrates a [[GPS]] receiver and a Dead Reckoning Module (DRM) that maintains accurate location when GPS signal becomes unavailable.

=== Radio ===
The Communication Network Radio Subsystem (CNRS) provided communications capabilities for the Land Warrior. The CNRS is based on [[EPLRS]].

=== Software ===
Land Warrior's software system was powered by a variant of the [[Linux]] operating system and has a modular, open architecture for further improvement. Reliability in recent testing at [[Fort Benning]] has been extremely high. The Land Warrior software suite contains six main software packages for weapon sights and for data.&lt;ref name="USDDRESTART"/&gt;

== Stryker Interoperable Vehicle Kit ==
A key capability of the Land Warrior development effort was the interoperability with the Stryker family of combat vehicles, attained through a Stryker Vehicle Integration Kit or VIK.

Land Warriors mounted in the Stryker vehicle were to be provided voice, data and power connectivity through an umbilical connection, as an extension of the individual soldier's Personal Area Network. The mounted Land Warriors were to have the capability of communicating voice and data with each other, the vehicle crew, Land Warriors external to the vehicle and other Land Warrior units mounted in other Stryker vehicles. Communications with the vehicle crew were to be achieved by interfacing to the Vehicle Intercom System.

Dismounted Land Warriors, when within communications range of their Stryker vehicle, were to have the same voice connectivity and Army Battle Command System interoperability as the mounted Land Warrior.

The Vehicle Integration Kit (VIK) was being developed in a spiral fashion to help manage development risk. The first spiral produced early VIK prototypes used to validate physical integration approaches in the various vehicle configurations. It also demonstrated Land Warrior soldier voice connectivity with the Stryker crew-members in and around the vehicle through the Vehicle Intercom System.

There were plans to integrate the [[Boomerang (mobile shooter detection system)|Boomerang Mobile Shooter Detection System]] onto the Stryker vehicle as part of the Land Warrior system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/news/Boomerang-Sniper-Detection-System-to-Be-Integrated-into-US-Army-Land-Warrior_n000002839.aspx http://www.deagel.com/news/Boomerang-Sniper-Detection-System-to-Be-Integrated-into-US-Army-Land-Warrior_n000002839.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program outcome==
Land Warrior was the first U.S. Army soldier network system to be used in combat since the networked soldier concept began in 1989.  229 Land Warrior ensembles were deployed by the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment]] to Iraq from May 2007 to June 2008.  A Stryker Brigade later deployed with the system to Afghanistan, and Land Warrior remained in use until spring 2012.  The Army built upon Land Warrior with the Ground Soldier System (GSS) as its successor, an advanced dismounted soldier integrated situational awareness system that entered technology development in February 2009.  GSS Increment 1 was renamed [[Nett Warrior]] in June 2010 after [[Medal of Honor]] recipient Robert B. Nett (although the term "Nett" has frequently been misinterpreted as a reflection of its tactical networking features).  Nett Warrior was first demonstrated in spring 2011, which then was essentially the 10-pound Land Warrior ensemble with some enhanced additional software.  Later iterations focused on a hand-held solution that integrated a commercial hand-held screen device with the Rifleman radio, simplifying the system and decreasing weight to {{convert|3|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.  Nett Warrior utilizes enhanced [[smartphone]]s, using different models over the course of its development including the [[Motorola Atrix 2|Motorola Atrix]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note I]], and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-rise-of-the-soldier-system/ The Rise of the Soldier System] - Defensemedianetwork.com, 25 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The probe is the spherical part,  50 mm in [[diameter]] and made from [[titanium]] with a surface coating of [[titanium nitride]].]]
A '''Langmuir probe''' is a device used to determine the electron temperature, electron density, and electric potential of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. It works by inserting one or more electrodes into a plasma, with a constant or time-varying electric potential between the various electrodes or between them and the surrounding vessel. The measured currents and potentials in this system allow the determination of the physical properties of the plasma.

==''I-V'' characteristic of the Debye sheath==

The beginning of Langmuir probe theory is the [[current-voltage characteristic|''I-V'' characteristic]] of the [[Debye sheath]], that is, the current density flowing to a surface in a plasma as a function of the voltage drop across the sheath. The analysis presented here indicates how the electron temperature, electron density, and plasma potential can be derived from the ''I-V'' characteristic. In some situations a more detailed analysis can yield information on the ion density (&lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;), the ion temperature &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt;, or the electron energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] (EEDF) or &lt;math&gt;f_e(v)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Ion saturation current density===

Consider first a surface biased to a large negative voltage. If the voltage is large enough, essentially all electrons (and any negative ions) will be repelled. The ion velocity will satisfy the [[Bohm sheath criterion]], which is, strictly speaking, an inequality, but which is usually marginally fulfilled. The Bohm criterion in its marginal form says that the ion velocity at the sheath edge is simply the sound speed given by

&lt;math&gt; c_s = \sqrt{k_B(ZT_e+\gamma_iT_i)/m_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ion temperature term is often neglected, which is justified if the ions are cold. Even if the ions are known to be warm, the ion temperature is usually not known, so it is usually assumed to be simply equal to the electron temperature. In that case, consideration of finite ion temperature only results in a small numerical factor. ''Z'' is the (average) charge state of the ions, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the adiabatic coefficient for the ions. The proper choice of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is a matter of some contention. Most analyses use &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i=1&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to isothermal ions, but some kinetic theory suggests that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i=3&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to one degree of freedom is more appropriate. For &lt;math&gt;Z=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_i=T_e&lt;/math&gt;, using the larger value results in the conclusion that the density is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times smaller. Uncertainties of this magnitude arise several places in the analysis of Langmuir probe data and are very difficult to resolve.

The charge density of the ions depends on the charge state ''Z'', but [[Plasma (physics)#Potentials|quasineutrality]] allows one to write it simply in terms of the electron density as &lt;math&gt;en_e&lt;/math&gt;.

Using these results we have the current density to the surface due to the ions. The current density at large negative voltages is due solely to the ions and, except for possible sheath expansion effects, does not depend on the bias voltage, so it is
referred to as the '''ion saturation current density''' and is given by

&lt;math&gt;j_i^{max} = q_{e}n_ec_s&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;q_e&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of an electron, &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of electrons, and &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is as defined above.

The plasma parameters, in particular, the density, are those at the sheath edge.

===Exponential electron current===

As the voltage of the Debye sheath is reduced, the more energetic electrons are able to overcome the potential barrier of the electrostatic sheath. We can model the electrons at the sheath edge with a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], i.e.,

&lt;math&gt;f(v_x)\,dv_x \propto e^{-\frac{1}{2}m_ev_x^2/k_BT_e}&lt;/math&gt;,

except that the high energy tail moving away from the surface is missing, because only the lower energy electrons moving toward the surface are reflected. The higher energy electrons overcome the sheath potential and are absorbed. The mean velocity of the electrons which are able to overcome the voltage of the sheath is

&lt;math&gt;
\langle v_e \rangle = \frac
{\int_{v_{e0}}^\infty f(v_x)\,v_x\,dv_x}
{\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(v_x)\,dv_x}
&lt;/math&gt;,

where the cut-off velocity for the upper integral is

&lt;math&gt;v_{e0} = \sqrt{2q_{e}\Delta V/m_e}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[voltage]] across the Debye sheath, that is, the potential at the sheath edge minus the potential of the surface. For a large voltage compared to the electron temperature, the result is

&lt;math&gt;
\langle v_e \rangle = 
\sqrt{\frac{k_BT_e}{2\pi m_e}}\,
e^{-q_{e}\Delta V/k_BT_e}
&lt;/math&gt;.

With this expression, we can write the electron contribution to the current to the probe in terms of the ion saturation current as

&lt;math&gt;
j_e = 
j_i^{max}\sqrt{m_i/2\pi m_e}\,
e^{-q_{e}\Delta V/k_BT_e}
&lt;/math&gt;,

valid as long as the electron current is not more than two or three times the ion current.

===Floating potential===

The total current, of course, is the sum of the ion and electron currents:

&lt;math&gt;
j = j_i^{max} 
\left( -1 + \sqrt{m_i/2\pi m_e}\,e^{-q_{e}\Delta V/k_BT_e} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;.

We are using the convention that current ''from'' the surface into the plasma is positive. An interesting and practical question is the potential of a surface to which no net current flows. It is easily seen from the above equation that

&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = (k_BT_e/e)\,(1/2)\ln(m_i/2\pi m_e)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we introduce the ion [[reduced mass]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_i=m_i/m_e&lt;/math&gt;, we can write

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta V = (k_BT_e/e)\, ( 2.8 + 0.5\ln \mu_i )
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the floating potential is the experimentally accessible quantity, the current (below electron saturation) is usually written as	

&lt;math&gt; 
j = j_i^{max} 
\left( -1 + \,e^{q_{e}(V_{0}-\Delta V)/k_BT_e} \right) 
&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Electron saturation current ===

When the electrode potential is equal to or greater than the plasma potential, then there is no longer a sheath to reflect electrons, and the electron current saturates. Using the Boltzmann expression for the mean electron velocity given above with &lt;math&gt;v_{e0} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and setting the ion current to zero, the '''electron saturation current density''' would be

&lt;math&gt;
j_e^{max} 
= j_i^{max}\sqrt{m_i/\pi m_e} 
= j_i^{max} \left( 24.2 \, \sqrt{\mu_i} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Although this is the expression usually given in theoretical discussions of Langmuir probes, the derivation is not rigorous and the experimental basis is weak. The theory of [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Block, L. P. |date=May 1978 |title=A Double Layer Review |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=59–83 |bibcode=  1978Ap&amp;SS..55...59B|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/Ap+SS/0055//0000065.000.html |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |doi=10.1007/bf00642580}} (Harvard.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; typically employs an expression analogous to the [[Debye sheath#The Bohm sheath criterion|Bohm criterion]], but with the roles of electrons and ions reversed, namely

&lt;math&gt;
j_e^{max} 
= q_en_e \sqrt{k_B(\gamma_eT_e+T_i)/m_e}
= j_i^{max}\sqrt{m_i/m_e} 
= j_i^{max} \left( 42.8 \,  \sqrt{\mu_i} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the numerical value was found by taking ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;=''T''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;=γ&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In practice, it is often difficult and usually considered uninformative to measure the electron saturation current experimentally. When it is measured, it is found to be highly variable and generally much lower (a factor of three or more) than the value given above. Often a clear saturation is not seen at all. Understanding electron saturation is one of the most important outstanding problems of Langmuir probe theory.

==Effects of the bulk plasma==

The Debye sheath theory explains the basic behavior of Langmuir probes, but is not complete. Merely inserting an object like a probe into a plasma changes the density, temperature, and potential at the sheath edge and perhaps everywhere. Changing the voltage on the probe will also, in general, change various plasma parameters. Such effects are less well understood than sheath physics, but they can at least in some cases be roughly accounted.

===Pre-sheath===

The Bohm criterion requires the ions to enter the Debye sheath at the sound speed. The potential drop that accelerates them to this speed is called the '''pre-sheath'''. It has a spatial scale that depends on the physics of the ion source but which is large compared to the Debye length and often of the order of the plasma dimensions. The magnitude of the potential drop is equal to (at least)

&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_{pre} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m_ic_s^2}{Ze} = k_B(T_e+Z\gamma_iT_i)/(2Ze)
&lt;/math&gt;

The acceleration of the ions also entails a decrease in the density, usually by a factor of about 2 depending on the details.

===Resistivity===

Collisions between ions and electrons will also affect the ''I-V'' characteristic of a Langmuir probe. When an electrode is biased to any voltage other than the floating potential, the current it draws must pass through the plasma, which has a finite resistivity. The resistivity and current path can be calculated with relative ease in an unmagnetized plasma. In a magnetized plasma, the problem is much more difficult. In either case, the effect is to add a voltage drop proportional to the current drawn, which [[shear mapping|shears]] the characteristic. The deviation from an exponential function is usually not possible to observe directly, so that the flattening of the characteristic is usually misinterpreted as a larger plasma temperature. Looking at it from the other side, any measured ''I-V'' characteristic can be interpreted as a hot plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the Debye sheath, or as a cold plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the bulk plasma. Without quantitative modeling of the bulk resistivity, Langmuir probes can only give an upper limit on the electron temperature.

===Sheath expansion===

It is not enough to know the current ''density'' as a function of bias voltage since it is the ''absolute'' current which is measured. In an unmagnetized plasma, the current-collecting area is usually taken to be the exposed surface area of the electrode. In a magnetized plasma, the '''projected''' area is taken, that is, the area of the electrode as viewed along the magnetic field. If the electrode is not shadowed by a wall or other nearby object, then the area must be doubled to account for current coming along the field from both sides. If the electrode dimensions are not small in comparison to the Debye length, then the size of the electrode is effectively increased in all directions by the sheath thickness. In a magnetized plasma, the electrode is sometimes assumed to be increased in a similar way by the ion [[Larmor radius]].

The finite Larmor radius allows some ions to reach the electrode that would have otherwise gone past it. The details of the effect have not been calculated in a fully self-consistent way.

If we refer to the probe area including these effects as &lt;math&gt;A_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be a function of the bias voltage) and make the assumptions
*&lt;math&gt;T_i=T_e&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;Z=1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma_i=3&lt;/math&gt;, and
*&lt;math&gt;n_{e,sh}=0.5\,n_e&lt;/math&gt;,
and ignore the effects of
*bulk resistivity, and
*electron saturation,
then the ''I-V'' characteristic becomes

&lt;math&gt; I = I_i^{max}(-1+e^{q_e(V_{pr}-V_{fl})/(k_BT_e)} )&lt;/math&gt;,

where

&lt;math&gt; I_i^{max} = q_en_e\sqrt{k_BT_e/m_i}\,A_{eff} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Magnetized plasmas===

The theory of Langmuir probes is much more complex when the plasma is magnetized. The simplest extension of the unmagnetized case is simply to use the projected area rather than the surface area of the electrode. For a long cylinder far from other surfaces, this reduces the effective area by a factor of π/2 = 1.57. As mentioned before, it might be necessary to increase the radius by about the thermal ion Larmor radius, but not above the effective area for the unmagnetized case.

The use of the projected area seems to be closely tied with the existence of a '''magnetic sheath'''. Its scale is the ion Larmor radius at the sound speed, which is normally between the scales of the Debye sheath and the pre-sheath. The Bohm criterion for ions entering the magnetic sheath applies to the motion along the field, while at the entrance to the Debye sheath it applies to the motion normal to the surface. This results in a reduction of the density by the sine of the angle between the field and the surface. The associated increase in the Debye length must be taken into account when considering ion non-saturation due to sheath effects.

Especially interesting and difficult to understand is the role of cross-field currents. Naively, one would expect the current to be parallel to the magnetic field along a [[flux tube]]. In many geometries, this flux tube will end at a surface in a distant part of the device, and this spot should itself exhibit an ''I-V'' characteristic. The net result would be the measurement of a double-probe characteristic; in other words, electron saturation current equal to the ion saturation current.

When this picture is considered in detail, it is seen that the flux tube must charge up and the surrounding plasma must spin around it. The current into or out of the flux tube must be associated with a force that slows down this spinning. Candidate forces are viscosity, friction with neutrals, and inertial forces associated with plasma flows, either steady or fluctuating. It is not known which force is strongest in practice, and in fact it is generally difficult to find any force that is powerful enough to explain the characteristics actually measured.

It is also likely that the magnetic field plays a decisive role in determining the level of electron saturation, but no quantitative theory is as yet available.

==Electrode configurations==

Once one has a theory of the ''I-V'' characteristic of an electrode, one can proceed to measure it and then fit the data with the theoretical curve to extract the plasma parameters. The straightforward way to do this is to sweep the voltage on a single electrode, but, for a number of reasons, configurations using multiple electrodes or exploring only a part of the characteristic are used in practice.

===Single probe===

The most straightforward way to measure the ''I-V'' characteristic of a plasma is with a '''single probe''', consisting of one electrode biased with a voltage ramp relative to the vessel. The advantages are simplicity of the electrode and redundancy of information, i.e. one can check whether the ''I-V'' characteristic has the expected form. Potentially additional information can be extracted from details of the characteristic. The disadvantages are more complex biasing and measurement electronics and a poor time resolution. If fluctuations are present (as they always are) and the sweep is slower than the fluctuation frequency (as it usually is), then the ''I-V'' is the ''average'' current as a function of voltage, which may result in systematic errors if it is analyzed as though it were an instantaneous ''I-V''. The ideal situation is to sweep the voltage at a frequency above the fluctuation frequency but still below the ion cyclotron frequency. This, however, requires sophisticated electronics and a great deal of care.

===Double probe===

An electrode can be biased relative to a second electrode, rather than to the ground. The theory is similar to that of a single probe, except that the current is limited to the ion saturation current for both positive and negative voltages. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;V_{bias}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage applied between two identical electrodes, the current is given by;

&lt;math&gt;
I 
= I_i^{max} \left( -1 + \,e^{q_e(V_2-V_{fl})/k_BT_e} \right)
= -I_i^{max} \left( -1 + \,e^{q_e(V_1-V_{fl})/k_BT_e} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;,

which can be rewritten using &lt;math&gt;V_{bias}=V_2-V_1&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic tangent]]:

&lt;math&gt;
I = I_i^{max} \tanh\left( \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{q_eV_{bias}}{k_BT_e} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;.

One advantage of the double probe is that neither electrode is ever very far above floating, so the theoretical uncertainties at large electron currents are avoided. If it is desired to sample more of the exponential electron portion of the characteristic, an '''asymmetric double probe''' may be used, with one electrode larger than the other. If the ratio of the collection areas is larger than the square root of the ion to electron mass ratio, then this arrangement is equivalent to the single tip probe. If the ratio of collection areas is not that big, then the characteristic will be in-between the symmetric double tip configuration and the single-tip configuration. If &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the larger tip then:

&lt;math&gt;
I = A_1 J_i^{max} \left[ \coth\left(\frac{q_eV_{bias}}{2k_BT_e}\right) + \frac{\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2}-1\right)\,e^{-q_eV_{bias}/2k_BT_e}}{2\sinh\left(\frac{q_eV_{bias}}{2k_BT_e}\right)} \right]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Another advantage is that there is no reference to the vessel, so it is to some extent immune to the disturbances in a [[radio frequency]] plasma. On the other hand, it shares the limitations of a single probe concerning complicated electronics and poor time resolution. In addition, the second electrode not only complicates the system, but it makes it susceptible to disturbance by gradients in the plasma.

===Triple probe===

An elegant electrode configuration is the triple probe,&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sin-Li Chen |author2=T. Sekiguchi |date=1965 |title= Instantaneous Direct-Display System of Plasma Parameters by Means of Triple Probe|journal=J. Applied Phys. |volume=36 |issue= 8|pages=2363 |url= |doi=10.1063/1.1714492 |bibcode = 1965JAP....36.2363C }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of two electrodes biased with a fixed voltage and a third which is floating. The bias voltage is chosen to be a few times the electron temperature so that the negative electrode draws the ion saturation current, which, like the floating potential, is directly measured. A common rule of thumb for this voltage bias is 3/e times the expected electron temperature. Because the biased tip configuration is floating, the positive probe can draw at most an electron current only equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity to the ion saturation current drawn by the negative probe, given by :

&lt;math&gt;
-I_{+}=I_{-}=I_i^{max}
&lt;/math&gt;

and as before the floating tip draws effectively no current:

&lt;math&gt;
I_{fl}=0
&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming that: 
1.) The electron energy distribution in the plasma is Maxwellian,
2.) The mean free path of the electrons is greater than the ion sheath about the tips and larger than the probe radius, and
3.) the probe sheath sizes are much smaller than the probe separation,
then the current to any probe can be considered composed of two parts{{spaced ndash}}the high energy tail of the Maxwellian electron distribution, and the ion saturation current:

&lt;math&gt;
I_{probe} = -I_{e} e^{-q_e V_{probe}/(k T_{e} )} + I_i^{max}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the current ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is thermal current. Specifically,

&lt;math&gt;
I_{e} = S J_{e} = S n_{e} q_e \sqrt{kT_{e}/2 \pi m_{e}}
&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''S'' is surface area, ''J&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is electron current density, and ''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is electron density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stanojević|date=1999 |first1= M. |last2= Čerček |first2= M. |last3= Gyergyek |first3= T. |title= Experimental Study of Planar Langmuir Probe Characteristics in Electron Current-Carrying Magnetized Plasma|journal=Contrib. Plasma Phys. |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=197–222 |url= |doi=10.1002/ctpp.2150390303 |bibcode = 1999CoPP...39..197S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that the ion and electron saturation current is the same for each probe, then the formulas for current to each of the probe tips take the form

&lt;math&gt;
I_{+} = -I_{e} e^{-q_e V_{+}/(k T_{e} )} + I_i^{max}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
I_{-} = -I_{e} e^{-q_e V_{-}/(k T_{e} )} + I_i^{max}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
I_{fl} = -I_{e} e^{-q_e V_{fl}/(k T_{e} )} + I_i^{max}
&lt;/math&gt;.

It is then simple to show

&lt;math&gt;

\left(I_{+} - I_{fl})/(I_{+} - I_{-}\right) = \left(1-e^{-q_e(V_{fl}-V_{+})/(k T_{e})}\right)/ \left(1-e^{-q_e(V_{-}-V_{+})/(k T_{e})}\right)

&lt;/math&gt;

but the relations from above specifying that ''I&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;=-I&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;''=0 give

&lt;math&gt;

1/2 = \left(1-e^{-q_e(V_{fl}-V_{+})/(k T_{e})}\right)/ \left(1-e^{-q_e(V_{-}-V_{+})/(k T_{e})}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;,

a transcendental equation in terms of applied and measured voltages and the unknown ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' that in the limit ''q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Bias&lt;/sub&gt; = q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt;&gt; k T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', becomes

&lt;math&gt; 
(V_{+}-V_{fl}) = (k_BT_e/q_e)\ln 2 
&lt;/math&gt;.

That is, the voltage difference between the positive and floating electrodes is proportional to the electron temperature. (This was especially important in the sixties and seventies before sophisticated data processing became widely available.)

More sophisticated analysis of triple probe data can take into account such factors as incomplete saturation, non-saturation, unequal areas.

Triple probes have the advantage of simple biasing electronics (no sweeping required), simple data analysis, excellent time resolution, and insensitivity to potential fluctuations (whether imposed by an rf source or inherent fluctuations). Like double probes, they are sensitive to gradients in plasma parameters.

===Special arrangements===

Arrangements with four ('''tetra probe''') or five ('''penta probe''') have sometimes been used, but the advantage over triple probes has never been entirely convincing. The spacing between probes must be larger than the [[Debye length]] of the plasma to prevent an overlapping [[Debye sheath]].

A '''pin-plate probe''' consists of a small electrode directly in front of a large electrode, the idea being that the voltage sweep of the large probe can perturb the plasma potential at the sheath edge and thereby aggravate the difficulty of interpreting the ''I-V'' characteristic. The floating potential of the small electrode can be used to correct for changes in potential at the sheath edge of the large probe. Experimental results from this arrangement look promising, but experimental complexity and residual difficulties in the interpretation have prevented this configuration from becoming standard.

Various geometries have been proposed for use as '''ion temperature probes''', for example, two cylindrical tips that rotate past each other in a magnetized plasma. Since shadowing effects depend on the ion Larmor radius, the results can be interpreted in terms of ion temperature. The ion temperature is an important quantity that is very difficult to measure. Unfortunately, it is also very difficult to analyze such probes in a fully self-consistent way.

'''Emissive probes''' use an electrode heated either electrically or by the exposure to the plasma. When the electrode is biased more positive than the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are pulled back to the surface so the ''I''-''V'' characteristic is hardly changed. As soon as the electrode is biased negative with respect to the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are repelled and contribute a large negative current. The onset of this current or, more sensitively, the onset of a discrepancy between the characteristics of an unheated and a heated electrode, is a sensitive indicator of the plasma potential.

To measure fluctuations in plasma parameters, '''arrays''' of electrodes are used, usually one{{spaced ndash}}but occasionally two-dimensional. A typical array has a spacing of 1&amp;nbsp;mm and a total of 16 or 32 electrodes. A simpler arrangement to measure fluctuations is a negatively biased electrode flanked by two floating electrodes. The ion-saturation current is taken as a surrogate for the density and the floating potential as a surrogate for the plasma potential. This allows a rough measurement of the turbulent particle flux

&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_{turb} 
= \langle \tilde{n}_e \tilde{v}_{E\times B} \rangle
\propto \langle 
\tilde{I}_i^{max} ( \tilde{V}_{fl,2} - \tilde{V}_{fl,1} ) 
\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

==Cylindrical Langmuir probe in electron flow==

Most often, the Langmuir probe is a small size electrode inserted in plasma and connected through an external (with respect to plasma) electric circuit with the electrode of a large surface area contacting with the same plasma (very often it is metallic wall of a chamber containing plasma) to obtain the probe [[I-V characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;i(V)&lt;/math&gt;. The characteristic &lt;math&gt;i(V)&lt;/math&gt; is measured by sweeping the voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of scanning generator (inserted in the probe circuit) with simultaneous measuring of the probe current.

[[File:ShunkoLPFig01W.tif|thumb|Fig. 1. Illustration to Langmuir Probe I-V Characteristic Derivation]]

Relations between the probe [[I-V characteristic]] and parameters of isotropic plasma were found by the [[Irving Langmuir]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mott-Smith, H. M.  |author2=Langmuir, Irving |date=1926 |title=The Theory of Collectors in Gaseous Discharges |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=727–763 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.28.727 |bibcode = 1926PhRv...28..727M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be derived most elementary for the planar probe of a large surface area &lt;math&gt;S_z&lt;/math&gt;  (ignoring the edge effects problem). Let us choose the point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;  in plasma at the distance &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;  from the probe surface where electric field of the probe is negligible while each electron of plasma passing this point could reach the probe surface without collisions with plasma components: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_D \ll\lambda_{Te}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Debye length]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{Te}&lt;/math&gt;  is the electron free path calculated for its total [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] with plasma components. In the vicinity of the point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; we can imagine a small element of the surface area &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; parallel to the probe surface. The elementary current &lt;math&gt;di&lt;/math&gt; of plasma electrons passing throughout &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; in a direction of the probe surface can be written in the form

&lt;math&gt;di = q_e\Delta Sdn(v, \vartheta)v\cos \vartheta&lt;/math&gt;,   (1)

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;   is a scalar of the electron thermal velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;dn(v,\vartheta)=nf(v)\frac{2\pi\sin \vartheta}{4\pi} dv d\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;,   (2)

&lt;math&gt;2\pi\sin \vartheta d\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; is the element of the solid angle with its relative value &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sin \vartheta d\vartheta / 4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between perpendicular to the probe surface recalled from the point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and the radius-vector of the electron thermal velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; forming a spherical layer of thickness &lt;math&gt;dv&lt;/math&gt; in velocity space, and &lt;math&gt;f(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the electron distribution function normalized to unity

&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_0^\infty f(v)dv = 1&lt;/math&gt;.   (3)

Taking into account uniform conditions along the probe surface (boundaries are excluded), &lt;math&gt;\Delta S \rightarrow S_z&lt;/math&gt;, we can take double integral with respect to the angle &lt;math&gt; \vartheta &lt;/math&gt;, and with respect to the velocity &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;, from the expression (1), after substitution Eq. (2) in it, to calculate a total electron current on the probe

&lt;math&gt; i(v) = q_enS_z \frac{1}{4\pi} \int\limits_{\sqrt{2q_eV/m}}^\infty f(v)dv \int\limits_0^\zeta v\cos \vartheta 2\pi \sin \vartheta d\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;.  (4)

where&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;   is the probe potential with respect to the potential of plasma &lt;math&gt;V = 0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2q_eV/m}&lt;/math&gt;  is the lowest electron velocity value at which the electron still could reach the probe surface charged to the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;   is the upper limit of the angle &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;  at which the electron having initial velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;  can still reach the probe surface with a zero-value of its velocity at this surface. That means the value &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;  is defined by the condition

&lt;math&gt;v\cos\zeta = \sqrt{2q_eV/m}&lt;/math&gt;.    (5)

Deriving the value &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;  from Eq. (5) and substituting it in Eq. (4), we can obtain the probe [[I-V characteristic]] (neglecting the ion current) in the range of the probe potential &lt;math&gt;-\infty &lt;V\leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; in the form

&lt;math&gt;i(V)=\frac{q_enS_z}{4}\int\limits_\sqrt{2q_eV/m}^\infty f(v)\left ( 1 - \frac{2q_eV}{mv^2}\right ) vdv&lt;/math&gt;.    (6)

Differentiating Eq. (6) twice with respect to the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, one can find the expression describing the second derivative of the probe [[I-V characteristic]] (obtained firstly by M. J.  Druyvestein &lt;ref name="Druyvesteyn1930"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Druyvesteyn MJ|title=Der Niedervoltbogen|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=64|issue=11–12|year=1930|pages=781–798|issn=1434-6001|doi=10.1007/BF01773007|bibcode=1930ZPhy...64..781D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;i^{\prime \prime} (V) = \frac{q_e^2 nS_z}{4m}\frac {1}{V}f\left ( \sqrt{2q_eV/m}\right ) &lt;/math&gt;   (7)

defining the electron distribution function over velocity  &lt;math&gt;f\left ( \sqrt{2q_eV/m}\right ) &lt;/math&gt; in the evident form. M. J. Druyvestein has shown in particular that Eqs. (6) and (7) are valid for description of operation of the probe of any arbitrary convex geometrical shape. 
	Substituting the [[Maxwellian distribution]] function:

&lt;math&gt;f^{(0)} (v) = \frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{v^2}{v_p^3}\exp \left (-v^2/v_p^2\right )&lt;/math&gt;,    (8)

where &lt;math&gt;v_p = \langle v\rangle \sqrt{\pi}/2&lt;/math&gt;   is the most probable velocity, in Eq. (6) we obtain the expression

&lt;math&gt;i^{(0)} (V) = \frac{q_en\langle v \rangle}{4}S_z\exp \left (-q_eV/\mathcal{E}_p \right )&lt;/math&gt;.   (9)

[[File:IV Ar 0.058 370 z12.tif|thumb|Fig. 2. I-V Characteristic of Langmuir Probe in Isotropic Plasma]]

From which the very useful in practice relation follows

&lt;math&gt;\ln \left ( i^{(0)} (V)/i^{(0)} (0)\right ) = -q_eV/\mathcal{E}_p &lt;/math&gt;. (10)

allowing one to derive the electron energy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_p  = k_B T&lt;/math&gt;   (for [[Maxwellian distribution]] function only!) by a slope of the probe [[I-V characteristic]] in a semilogarithmic scale. 
Thus in plasmas with isotropic electron distributions, the electron current &lt;math&gt;i_{th} (0)&lt;/math&gt;   on a surface &lt;math&gt;S_z = 2\pi r_z l_z &lt;/math&gt;   of the cylindrical Langmuir probe at plasma potential &lt;math&gt;V = 0&lt;/math&gt;   is defined by the average electron thermal velocity &lt;math&gt;\langle v \rangle &lt;/math&gt;   and can be written down as equation (see Eqs. (6), (9) at  &lt;math&gt;V = 0&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;i_{th}(0) = q_en\langle v\rangle\frac {1}{4}\times 2\pi r_z l_z&lt;/math&gt;,  (11)

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the electron concentration, &lt;math&gt;r_z&lt;/math&gt; is the probe radius, and &lt;math&gt;l_z&lt;/math&gt; is its length. 
It is obvious that if plasma electrons form an electron '''''wind''''' ('''''flow''''') '''''across''''' the '''''cylindrical''''' probe axis with a velocity &lt;math&gt;v_d\gg \langle v\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,  the expression 
 
&lt;math&gt;i_d = env_d \times 2r_z l_z&lt;/math&gt; (12)

holds true. 
In plasmas produced by gas-discharge arc sources as well as inductively coupled sources, the electron wind can develop the Mach number &lt;math&gt;M^{(0)} = v_d /\langle v\rangle = (\sqrt{\pi}/2)\alpha \gtrsim 1 &lt;/math&gt;  . Here the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;   is introduced along with the Mach number for simplification of mathematical expressions. Note that &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{\pi}/2)\langle v\rangle = v_p&lt;/math&gt;, where&lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt;    is the most probable velocity for the [[Maxwellian distribution]] function, so that &lt;math&gt;\alpha = v_d/v_p&lt;/math&gt;  . Thus the general case where &lt;math&gt;\alpha  \gtrsim 1&lt;/math&gt;   is of the theoretical and practical interest. 
Corresponding physical and mathematical considerations presented in Refs. [9,10] has shown that at the [[Maxwellian distribution]] function of the electrons in a reference system moving with the velocity &lt;math&gt;v_d&lt;/math&gt;   '''''across axis of the cylindrical''''' probe set at plasma potential &lt;math&gt;V = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the electron current on the probe can be written down in the form

[[File:CylinderProbeInElectrWind.tif|thumb|Fig.3. I-V Characteristic of the cylindrical probe in crossing electron wind]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac{i(0)}{enS_z} = \frac{\langle v\rangle}{4} \exp(-\alpha ^{2} /2)I_0 (\alpha ^{2} /2) \left (1+\alpha ^{2} \left (1+I_1(\alpha ^{2} /2)/I_0(\alpha ^{2}/ 2)\right )\right )&lt;/math&gt;,    (13)

where &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;  are Bessel functions of imaginary arguments and Eq. (13) is reduced to Eq. (11) at&lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;   being reduced to Eq. (12) at &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;  . 
The second derivative of the probe I-V characteristic &lt;math&gt;i^{\prime \prime}(V)&lt;/math&gt;  with respect to the probe potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;   can be presented in this case in the form (see Fig. 3)

&lt;math&gt;i^{\prime \prime}(x) = enS_z \frac{v_p}{2\pi ^{3/2} (\mathcal {E}_p/e)^2} \frac {1}{\sqrt{x}}\int \limits_0^\pi (\sqrt{x}- \cos \varphi) \exp\left ( -\alpha ^2 (\sqrt{x} - \cos \varphi)\right ) d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;,   (14)

where

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{1}{\alpha^2}\frac{V}{\mathcal {E}_p/e}&lt;/math&gt;  (15)

and the electron energy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal {E}_p/e&lt;/math&gt;  is expressed in eV.

All parameters of the electron population: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle v\rangle &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt;  in plasma can be derived from the experimental probe I-V characteristic second derivative &lt;math&gt;i^{\prime \prime}(V)&lt;/math&gt;   by its least square best fitting with the theoretical curve expressed by Eq. (14). For detail and for problem of the general case of none-Maxwellian electron distribution functions see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E. V.

==Practical considerations==

For laboratory and technical plasmas, the electrodes are most commonly [[tungsten]] or [[tantalum]] wires several thousandths of an inch thick, because they have a high melting point but can be made small enough not to perturb the plasma. Although the melting point is somewhat lower, [[molybdenum]] is sometimes used because it is easier to machine and solder than tungsten. For fusion plasmas, [[graphite]] electrodes with dimensions from 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm are usually used because they can withstand the highest power loads (also sublimating at high temperatures rather than melting), and result in reduced [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation (with respect to metals) due to the low atomic number of carbon. The electrode surface exposed to the plasma must be defined, e.g. by insulating all but the tip of a wire electrode. If there can be significant deposition of conducting materials (metals or graphite), then the insulator should be separated from the electrode by a {{clarify span|meander|date=October 2016}} to prevent short-circuiting.

In a magnetized plasma, it appears to be best to choose a probe size a few times larger than the ion Larmor radius. A point of contention is whether it is better to use '''proud probes''', where the angle between the magnetic field and the surface is at least 15°, or '''flush-mounted probes''', which are embedded in the plasma-facing components and generally have an angle of 1 to 5 °. Many plasma physicists feel more comfortable with proud probes, which have a longer tradition and possibly are less perturbed by electron saturation effects, although this is disputed. Flush-mounted probes, on the other hand, being part of the wall, are less perturbative. Knowledge of the field angle is necessary with proud probes to determine the fluxes to the wall, whereas it is necessary with flush-mounted probes to determine the density.

In very hot and dense plasmas, as found in fusion research, it is often necessary to limit the thermal load to the probe by limiting the exposure time. A '''reciprocating probe''' is mounted on an arm that is moved into and back out of the plasma, usually in about one second by means of either a pneumatic drive or an electromagnetic drive using the ambient magnetic field. '''Pop-up probes''' are similar, but the electrodes rest behind a shield and are only moved the few millimeters necessary to bring them into the plasma near the wall.

A Langmuir probe can be purchased off the shelf for on the order of 15,000 U.S. dollars, or they can be built by an experienced researcher or technician. When working at frequencies under 100&amp;nbsp;MHz, it is advisable to use blocking filters, and take necessary grounding precautions.

In low temperature plasmas, in which the probe does not get hot, surface contamination may become an issue.  This effect can cause [[hysteresis]] in the I-V curve and may limit the current collected by the probe.&lt;ref name="Amataucci"&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. Amatucci |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title= Contamination-free sounding rocket Langmuir probe|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=72 |issue= 4|pages=2052-2057 |url= |doi=10.1063/1.1357234 |bibcode = 2001RScI...72.2052A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A heating mechanism or a glow discharge plasma may be used to clean the probe and prevent misleading results.

[[File:The end of Isbergs gata towards Dockplatsen in Malmö Sweden.jpg|thumb|right|A living street (or ''Gångfartsområde'' - Walking speed area) in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]].]]

A '''living street''' is a [[street]] designed primarily with the interests of pedestrians and cyclists in mind and as a [[social space]] where people can meet and where children may also be able to play legally and safely. These roads are still available for use by [[motor vehicle]]s, however their design aims to reduce both the speed and dominance of motorised transport. This is often achieved using the [[shared space]] approach, with greatly reduced demarcations between vehicle traffic and pedestrians. Vehicle parking may also be restricted to designated bays. It became popular during the 1970s in the Netherlands, which is why the Dutch word for a living street ([[woonerf]]) is often used as a synonym.

Country-specific living street implementations include: [[home zone]] (United Kingdom), residential zone ([[:ru:Жилая зона]], Russia), [[shared zone]] (Australia/New Zealand), woonerf (Netherlands, Flanders, South Africa, Namibia) and ''zone résidentielle'' (France).

==History==
{{expand section|with=developments in US and other parts of the world|date=July 2015}}
Legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom with the [[Highway Act 1835]] which banned the playing of football and games on the highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm|title=Origins of Rugby|work=Rugby Football History|accessdate=2010-04-14|quote="football for the common man was being suppressed, notably by the 1835 highways act which forbade the playing of football on highways and public land - which is where most games took place"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859 a total of 44 children were sent to prison for failure to pay fines for playing in the street in London and [[Middlesex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1860/apr/20/observations|title=Observations|publisher=Hansard|quote=The House would be surprised to hear that under that Act, no fewer than forty-four children were sent to prison in the metropolis last year, and since the commencement of this year twenty-five had been sent to prison. He would mention particularly two or three of these cases. George Dunn, aged twelve years, was sent to gaol for five days for playing at a game called "rounders" in which the boys stood in a ring and knocked a hall from one to another.}}&lt;/ref&gt; rising to 2,000 young people under the age of seventeen by 1935.&lt;ref name=PlayStreetsInLondon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonplay.org.uk/file/1333.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090729220406/http://www.londonplay.org.uk/file/1333.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-07-29|title=Play Streets in London timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the level of fast motorised traffic increased during the 20th century it became apparent that the social and recreational functions of the street were being severely impaired by the volume, speed and dominance of vehicular traffic.

The [[woonerf]] movement originated in the Netherlands in the 1970s as a way of re-balancing the relationship between people and the movement of vehicles.

==Design==
These streets are often built at the same grade as [[sidewalk]]s, without [[Curb (road)|curbs]]. Cars are limited to a speed that does not disrupt other uses of the streets (usually defined to be pedestrian speed), or through traffic is eliminated using [[bollard]]s or circuitous one-way operation. To make this lower speed natural, the street is normally set up so that a car cannot drive in a straight line for significant distances, for example by placing planters at the edge of the street, alternating the side of the street the parking is on, or curving the street itself. Other [[traffic calming]] measures are also used. 

However, early methods of traffic calming such as [[speed humps]] are now avoided in favor of methods which make slower speeds more natural to drivers, rather than an obvious imposition. Implementations of living streets that fail to address motor vehicle speed and volume usually result in domination of the street by motor vehicles and the marginalisation of walking and cycling. Furthermore, the elimination of a clearly defined boundary between vehicles and pedestrians can negatively affect walkability for those with sensory disabilities, most notably blindness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lbc.co.uk/the-new-exhibition-road-dangerous-for-the-blind-50537/album/new_exhibition_road___is_it_dangerouns_/1582&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micro-sustainability''' focuses on the small [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al actions that collectively result in a large [[environmental impact]]. Micro-sustainability centers on individual efforts, [[behavior modification]] and creating attitudinal changes, which result in an environmentally conscious individual or community. Micro-sustainability encourages sustainable changes through "change agents", which are individuals that are encouraged; and therefore, foster positive environmental action inside their [[sphere of influence]]. Examples of micro-sustainability include [[recycling]], [[power saving]] by turning off unused lights, programming [[thermostat]]s for efficient [[energy use|use of energy]], reducing [[water usage]], changing [[driving habits]] or patterns in order to use less gasoline or modifying [[buying habits]] to reduce waste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. The focus is on individual actions, rather than organizational practices. These narrow, small ticket, community level actions have immediate local benefits. If widely imitated, they have a cumulative,&lt;ref name=transformative&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-01-how-personal-actions-can-kick-start-a-sustainability-revolution How personal actions can kick-start a sustainability revolution | Grist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; broader impact.

The remaining large-scale plans for [[sustainability]], categorized under the term ''macro-sustainability'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jessestallone.com/2009/12/29/micro-vs-macro-sustainability/|title=Micro vs Macro Sustainability|date=2009-12-29|work=Jesse Stallone|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macro-economics of mineral and water resources.|last = Kisor|first = Kaulir|publisher = Capital Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = |location = India|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are in most cases addressed by governments, multi-national corporations or companies. They combat [[global issue]]s including [[climate change]], and reliance upon [[petroleum]]-based energy sources. Businesses primarily focus on the business case and return on investment of changes such as their source of energy or the way they transport or manufacture products. Governments confront these larger issues through increased regulation, subsidies, and investment in new technologies and energy sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Moment-resisting frame''' is a rectilinear assemblage of beams and columns, with the beams rigidly connected to the columns.

Resistance to lateral forces is provided primarily by [[rigid frame]] action – that is, by the development of [[bending moment]] and [[shear force]] in the frame members and joints.  By virtue of the rigid beam–column connections, a moment frame cannot displace laterally without bending the beams or columns depending on the geometry of the connection.  The bending rigidity and strength of the frame members is therefore the primary source of lateral stiffness and strength for the entire frame.&lt;ref&gt;Bruneau, Michel. et al., (2011). ''Ductile Design of Steel Structures''. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-07-162395-7}}.page 347&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections between beams and columns, are formed through the use of rigid moment connections. A Moment Connection is a joint that allows the transfer of bending moment forces between a column and beam (or any other two members).&lt;ref&gt;[https://skyciv.com/structural-software/connection-design/moment-connections/ Moment Connections]&lt;/ref&gt; This is different to shear or pinned connections that prevent a moment-resisting frame to occur. An examples of this is pinned truss structures.

The [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] revealed a common flaw in steel-frame construction — poorly welded moment connections — and building codes were revised to strengthen them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usgs.gov/news/20-years-after-northridge-quake-buildings-remain-vulnerable "20 Years After Northridge Quake, Buildings Remain Vulnerable."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

Steel moment-resisting frames have been in use for more than one hundred years, dating to the earliest use of structural steel in building construction.  Steel building construction with the frame carrying the vertical loads initiated with the [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, a 10-story structure constructed in 1884 with a height of 138&amp;nbsp;ft, often credited with being the first skyscraper.  This and other tall buildings in Chicago spawned an entire generation of tall buildings, constructed with load bearing steel frames supporting concrete floors and non-load bearing, unreinforced masonry [[infill wall]]s at their perimeters. Framing in these early structures typically utilized "H" shapes built up from plates, and "L" and "Z" sections.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, Ron. et al., (2009). ''Seismic Design of Steel Structures''.

'''Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services''' ('''MBMS''') is a [[point-to-multipoint]] interface specification for existing and upcoming [[3GPP]] [[cellular network]]s, which is designed to provide efficient delivery of [[broadcast]] and [[multicast]] [[service (economics)|service]]s, both within a cell as well as within the [[core network]]. For broadcast transmission across multiple cells, it defines transmission via [[single-frequency network]] configurations. The specification is referred to as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) when transmissions are delivered through an [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE (Long Term Evolution)]] network. eMBMS is also known as LTE Broadcast.

Target applications include [[mobile TV]] and radio broadcasting, live streaming video services, as well as file delivery and emergency alerts.

Questions remain whether the technology is an optimization tool for the operator or if an operator can generate new revenues with it. Several studies have been published on the domain identifying both cost savings and new revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expway.com/wp-content/uploads/White-Paper-14-LTE-Broadcast-Use-Cases-final.pdf An Analysis of 14 Different LTE Broadcast Business Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployments ==
In 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414062,00.asp Verizon Eyes Broadcast Over LTE for Super Bowl 2014] By Chloe Albanesius, PC Magazine, January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon]] announced that it would launch eMBMS services in 2014, over its nationwide (United States) [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] networks. [[AT&amp;T]] subsequently announced plans to use the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz Lower D and E Block licenses it acquired in 2011 from [[Qualcomm]] for an LTE Broadcast service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-use-lower-700-mhz-d-and-e-block-spectrum-lte-broadcast/2013-09-24#ixzz2p5gWKi16 AT&amp;T to use Lower 700 MHz D and E Block spectrum for LTE Broadcast] By Phil Goldstein, FierceWireless, September 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major operators worldwide have been lining-up to deploy and test the technology. The frontrunners being Verizon in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verizonwireless.com/news/article/2014/05/verizon-wireless-lte-multicast.html Verizon Delivers LTE Multicast Over Commercial 4G LTE Network in Indy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[KT Corporation|Kt]] and [[Jio|Reliance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tele.net.in/view-point/item/15556-rjil-to-invest-in-lte-broadcast-technology-says-market-status-report-by-gsa RJIL to invest in LTE broadcast technology]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Asia]], and recently [[EE Limited|EE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=490119]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vodafone]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/3206/europe-charges-ahead-with-lte-broadcast-trials]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Korea’s Kt launched the first commercial LTE Broadcast service.&lt;ref&gt;http://telecoms.com/217182/koreas-kt-launches-lte-broadcast-service/&lt;/ref&gt; The solution includes Kt’s internally developed eMBMS Bearer Service, and [[Samsung]] mobile devices fitted with the Expway Middleware as the eMBMS User Service.

In February 2014, Verizon demonstrated the potential of LTE Broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], using [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]s, fitted with Expway's eMBMS User Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-uses-super-bowl-to-show-off-lte-broadcast-video/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Nokia]] demonstrated the use of LTE Broadcast to replace Traditional Digital TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsn.com/news-events/press-room/press-releases/nokia-networks-first-to-trial-lte-for-national-tv-broadcasting Nokia Networks first to trial LTE for national TV broadcasting]&lt;/ref&gt; This use case remains controversial as some study are doubting about the capability of LTE Broadcast to address this use case efficiently in its current version.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreports/tr027.pdf Delivery of Broadcast Content over LTE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in July 2014, [[BBC Research &amp; Development]] and EE demonstrated LTE Broadcast during the [[2014 Commonwealth Games|XX Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland using equipment from Huawei and Qualcomm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2014-07-bbc-research-development-to-demonstrate-4g-broadcast-for-commonwealth-games BBC Research &amp; Development to Demonstrate 4G Broadcast for Commonwealth Games] by Andrew Murphy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techworld.com/news/networking/bbc-huawei-ee-unveil-4g-broadcasting-trial-at-commonwealth-games-3531478/ BBC, Huawei and EE unveil 4G broadcasting trial at Commonwealth Games] by Antony Savvas.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Ericsson and Polkomtel successfully tested LTE Broadcast technology by streaming the opening game of the 2014 World Volleyball Championship to hundreds of guests at Warsaw’s National Stadium in Poland on August 30.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericsson.com/news/1852728&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, BBC Research &amp; Development and EE demonstrated LTE Broadcast during the [[FA Cup]] final in the [[U.K.]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015-05-4g-broadcast-trial-wembley-2015-fa-cup-final 4G Broadcast technology trial at Wembley 2015 FA Cup Final] by Chris Nokes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltveurope.net/375521/ee-and-bbc-trial-4g-broadcast-at-fa-cup-final/ EE and BBC trial 4G broadcast at FA Cup Final].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Verizon demonstrated eMBMS by broadcasting [[INDYCAR]] races.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/components/rf-wireless/rf-and-wireless/2015/09/01/lte-broadcast-launches-in-the-us#.VwVminUrKAo&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Verizon commercially launched their [[Go90]] eMBMS service. Go90 offers both On-Demand and LiveTV, in both Unicast and Broadcast, and supports more than 10 different LTE Broadcast mobile devices.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/01/verizon-launches-go90-mobile-video-service/73138654/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[

In February 2016, [[Akamai Technologies|Akamai]] demonstrated with Expway, delivery of video streams across LTE networks with live on the fly switching from unicast to broadcast, at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2016-press/akamai-showcases-mobile-innovation-at-mobile-world-congress-2016.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Verizon, [[Telstra]], KT and EE launched the LTE Broadcast Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/verizon-telstra-kt-and-ee-launch-lte-broadcast-alliance/2016-04-27|title=Verizon, Telstra, kt and EE launch LTE-Broadcast Alliance  {{!}} FierceWireless|last=Alleven|first=Monica|date=April 27, 2016|website=www.fiercewireless.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828085736/https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/verizon-telstra-kt-and-ee-launch-lte-broadcast-alliance|archive-date=August 28, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many technology trials and demonstrations, as of September 2018 there are no commercial deployments of 3G MBMS or 4G eMBMS anywhere in the world.

== Competing technologies ==
Main competing technologies of MBMS include [[DVB-H]]/[[DVB-T]], [[DVB-SH]], [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]], ESM-[[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], and [[MediaFLO]]. However, due to spectrum scarcity and the cost of building new broadcast infrastructure some of these technologies may not be viable. MediaFLO has been deployed commercially in the US by Verizon Wireless through their relationship with MediaFLO USA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Qualcomm) however the service was shut down in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[MediaFLO]]&lt;/ref&gt; DMB and DVB-H trials have been ongoing for more than a year now, like those during the football 2006 championships in Germany.

Huawei's proprietary CMB is a precursor to the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service. It was specified in [[3GPP]] R6 and is using existing [[UMTS]] infrastructure. Huawei says that CMB is based on existing UMTS infrastructure and real time streaming application protocol.

The most significant competition is from services that stream individual video feeds to users over uni-cast data connections. While less efficient in certain situations, particularly the traditional case where everyone watches the same stream simultaneously, the user convenience of individual streaming has taken over the vast majority of the mobile media streaming market.

== Technical description ==
The MBMS feature is split into the MBMS Bearer Service and the MBMS User Service and has been defined to be offered over both [[UTRAN]] (i.e. [[WCDMA]], TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (where it is often referred to as eMBMS). The MBMS Bearer Service includes a Unicast and a Broadcast Mode. MBMS Operation On-Demand (MOOD) allows dynamic switching between Unicast and Broadcast over LTE, based on configured triggers. The MBMS Bearer Service uses IP multicast addresses for the IP flows. The advantage of the MBMS Bearer Service compared to unicast bearer services (interactive, streaming, etc.) is that the transmission resources in the [[Core network|core]] and [[Radio access network|radio]] networks are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericsson.com/res/thecompany/docs/publications/ericsson_review/2013/er-lte-broadcast.pdf Delivering content with LTE broadcast] By Thorsten Lohmar, Michael Slssingar, Vera Kenehan and Stif Puustinen, Ericsson Review, February 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One MBMS packet flow is replicated by [[GGSN]], SGSN and RNCs. MBMS may use an advanced counting scheme to decide, whether or not zero, one or more dedicated (i.e. unicast) radio channels lead to a more efficient system usage than one common (i.e. broadcast) radio channel.

* UTRAN MBMS offers up to 256 kbit/s per MBMS Bearer Service and between 800 kbit/s and 1.7 Mbit/s per cell/band. The actual cell capacity depends on the [[User equipment|UE]] capabilities.
* GERAN MBMS offers between 32 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s. Up to 4 GSM timeslots may be used for one MBMS bearer in the downlink direction. The actual data rate per Traffic Slot depends on network dimensioning.

The MBMS User Service is basically the MBMS Service Layer and offers two different data Delivery Methods:

* The '''Streaming Delivery Method''' can be used for continuous transmissions like mobile television services. An application layer [[Forward error correction|FEC]] code may be used To increase the transmission reliability.
* The '''Download Delivery Method''' is intended for “download and play” services. A '''File Repair''' service may be offered to compensate for unreliable delivery.

MBMS has been standardized in various groups of [[3GPP]] (Third Generation Partnership Project), and the first phase standards are found in [[UMTS]] release 6. As Release 6 was functionally frozen by the 3rd quarter of 2004, practical network implementations may be expected by the end of 2007, and the first functional mobile terminals supporting MBMS are estimated to be available by also end of 2007.

eMBMS has been standardized in various groups of 3GPP as part of LTE release 9.  The [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] version of MBMS, referred to as [[Multicast-broadcast single-frequency network]] (MBSFN), supports broadcast only services and is based on a Single Frequency Network (SFN) based [[OFDM]] waveform and so is functional similar to other broadcast solutions such as DVB-H, -SH and -NGH.

In 2017, Lev announced that she was working on a Japanese coffee-table art book titled ''Eros &amp; Thanatos'', together with Tokyo-based art magazine editor Masanao Amano.&lt;ref name="aux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldvr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Speaker: Nadya Lev|url=https://wvrf17.worldvrforum.com/speakers/nadya-lev/|website=World VR Forum|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed reality===
In 2016, Lev co-founded the technology company Aconite together with [[Star St.Germain]].&lt;ref name=matter&gt;{{cite web|title=Matter Portfolio: Aconite|url=http://matter.vc/portfolio/aconite/|website=Matter Ventures|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lev describes Aconite as "a [[mixed reality]] storytelling platform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borwing|first1=Rebecca|title=A couple of pivots, lots of pitches, and a party.|url=https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/a-recap-on-our-matter-6-teams-990c5317b805|website=Medium|publisher=A Matter-Driven Narrative|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lev and St.Germain define mixed reality stories as immersive experiences that sit at the intersection of adventure, narrative and gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aconite|url=http://www.aconite.co|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFNT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Get Virtual: San Francisco New Tech Showcase|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RZZctlAjj0|publisher=SFNT|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project draws on several gameplay, real-world exploration and storytelling traditions, including [[transmedia]], [[psychogeography]], [[escape room]]s, and [[live-action roleplay]].&lt;ref name="aux"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madeley|first1=Dylan|title=Creative Spotlight: Nadya Lev|journal=Auxiliary Magazine|issue=Spring 2017|pages=44–50|url=http://auxiliarymagazine.com/2017/06/19/spring-2017-issue-now/|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldvr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=matter/&gt;

Aconite's first prototype was ''Limberlost'', a [[location-based game]] with a [[magical realist]] narrative written by [[Steen Comer]], designed to be played at any bookstore or library in the world.&lt;ref name="SFNT"/&gt; The first playtest took place at [[Powell's Books]] during [[XOXO Fest|XOXO Fest 2016]] in Portland.&lt;ref name="steen"/&gt; Players used their mobile phones to solve puzzles which led them through a sequence of physical books.&lt;ref name="SFNT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Comer|first1=Steen|title=Limberlost|url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/limberlost-7153334|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each book contained an illustration that acted as an [[augmented reality]] marker. When triggered, the markers displayed audiovisual data that provided clues for the next book in the sequence, and unlocked new parts of the game's narrative.&lt;ref name="aux"/&gt;

Nallatech was promoted for [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) FPGA technology applied in computing.&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aerospace Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU9KAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boogar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boogar|first=Steve|title=Directory of Electronics Technologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5ZFJ77hLeAC&amp;pg=PA64|publisher=BoogarLists|page=64|id=GGKEY:6PUKR52C2TJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David R. Martinez, Robert A. Bond, and M. Michael Vai, Nallatech systems are "based on a modular design concept in which the designer chooses the number of FPGAs, amount and type of memory, and other expansion cards to include in a system."&lt;ref name="MartinezBond2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martinez|first1=David R.|last2=Bond|first2=Robert A.|last3=Vai|first3=M.

Nallatech's latest innovation in FPGA acceleration is the [http://www.nallatech.com/385A/ 385A FPGA Accelerator Card]. Released as of June 17, 2015, the 385A features the Altera Arria 10 / 1150 FPGA, PCI-Express form factor and works with most major servers, including IBM, HP and Dell.

In March 2011 the company announced a miniaturization service for their FPGAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=EE Times|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1316537 |accessdate=2013-08-21|title=Nallatech offers FPGA miniaturization services for commercial and military applications|author=Clive Maxfield|date=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nallatech has partnered with [[Altera]], and integrated their PCI Express card with Stratix V FPGAs, which may be valuable in financial analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/fpga-gurus/4409503/Two-new-Stratix-milestones-from-NovaSparks-and-Nallatech |accessdate=2013-08-21|work=EDN Network |title=Two new Stratix milestones from NovaSparks and Nallatech |author=Loring Wirbel |date=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company==
The company was founded by Allan Cantle ('Nalla' comes from 'Allan' spelled backwards) in 1993 and was backed by over £4m of equity finance provided by Scottish Equity Partners and [[3i]]. Cantle was the CEO for the firm,&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt; later moving into president and CTO roles.

In 2005 Nallatech announced a Scottish group known as the FPGA High Performance Computing Alliance, to work on a supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Nallatech Helps Forge Alliance to Advance FPGA-Based High-Performance Computing |work= Press release |date= 25 May 2006 |url= http://www.soccentral.com/results.asp?CatID=199&amp;EntryID=13580 |accessdate= 23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nallatech's direct sales team operates in two main geographic areas, one in the USA and one in UK covering UK, Europe and rest of the world.  The team in the USA (Nallatech, Inc.) sales office in [[Eldersburg, Maryland]] and headquartered in [[Camarillo, California]].&lt;ref name="Boogar"/&gt;

{{Net neutrality}}
'''Net neutrality law''' refers to laws and regulations which enforce the principle of [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20170330"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lohr |first=Steve |title=Net Neutrality Is Trump’s Next Target, Administration Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/technology/net-neutrality.html |date=March 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=March 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150410"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=Editorial - Global Threats to Net Neutrality |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/opinion/global-threats-to-net-neutrality.html |date=10 April 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=10 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of net neutrality enforcement claim regulation is unnecessary, because broadband service providers have no plans to block content or degrade network performance.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |title=Internet Law |last= Hart |first=Jonathan D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=BNA Books |isbn=9781570186837 |url= |page=750}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents of net neutrality regulation also argue that the best solution to discrimination by broadband providers is to encourage greater competition among such providers, which is currently limited in many areas.&lt;ref name="podhoretz-post"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/jpodhoretz/383024 |title=Who Runs the Internet: What Lobbying is Really All About |accessdate=3 January 2011 |author=John Podhoretz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225053755/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/jpodhoretz/383024 |archivedate=25 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2014, the [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was reported to be considering a new rule that would permit [[Internet service provider]]s to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier position on net neutrality.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140423"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |title=F.C.C., in ‘Net Neutrality’ Turnaround, Plans to Allow Fast Lane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html |date=23 April 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2014-04-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140424a"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Creating a Two-Speed Internet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/creating-a-two-speed-internet.html |date=24 April 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2014-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140511"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carr |first=David |title=Warnings Along F.C.C.’s Fast Lane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/business/media/warnings-along-fccs-fast-lane.html |date=11 May 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=11 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Municipal broadband]] could provide a net neutral environment, according to [[Susan P. Crawford|Professor Susan Crawford]], a legal and technology expert at [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140428"&gt;{{cite news |last=Crawford |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan P.

==Legal background==


===Historical precedent===
The concept of network neutrality predates the current Internet-focused debate, existing since the age of the [[telegraph]].&lt;ref name="shortheard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdma.com/files/Publication/e078fa3a-8b3c-4bf5-b384-734f26afc9b3/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/ab2b71fb-ec17-47cf-aef1-7eb8bbb7073f/media_law-12_dec_2007.pdf |format=PDF |title= A Short Heard 'Round the World Wide Web: Comcast Violates "Net Neutrality"|date=December 2007 |work=Media Law Bulletin |publisher=Sedgwick, Detert, Moran &amp; Arnold LLP |accessdate=23 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, a U.S. federal law ([[Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860]]) was passed to subsidize a telegraph line, stating that:
{{quote|messages received from any individual, company, or corporation, or from any telegraph lines connecting with this line at either of its termini, shall be impartially transmitted in the order of their reception, excepting that the dispatches of the government shall have priority ...|An act to facilitate communication between the Atlantic and Pacific states by electric telegraph, June 16, 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Telegraph_Act_1860.html|title=The Pacific Telegraph Act (1860) | year=2003 |publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum |accessdate=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1888 [[Almon Brown Strowger]], suspecting his loss of business was caused by a nepotistic telephone operator redirecting his business calls to a competitor, invented an [[electromechanical]]-based [[Telephone exchange#Pre-digital automatic exchanges|automatic telephone exchange]] that effectively removed human interference of telephone calls.&lt;ref name="shortheard" /&gt;

==Degrees of enforcement==

===Full neutrality===
Chile became the first country in the world to pass net neutrality legislation in 2010.&lt;ref name=ChileLaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camara.cl/prensa/noticias_detalle.aspx?prmid=38191|title=Cámara aprueba modificaciones del Senado a proyecto que protege derechos de usuarios de internet|publisher=Cámara de Diputados|date=13 July 2010|accessdate=9 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws adopted there prohibit organizations such as [[Facebook]] and [[Wikipedia]] from subsidizing mobile data usage of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/25090/face-chile-net-neutrality-v-human-right-facebook-wikipedia|title=Face Off in Chile: Net Neutrality v. Human Right to Facebook &amp; Wikipedia|publisher=TechPresident|author= Jessica McKenzie|date=2 Jun 2014|accessdate=9 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of net neutrality law usually includes allowance for discrimination in limited conditions, such as preventing spam, malware, or illegal content. The law in Chile allows exceptions for ensuring privacy and security.&lt;ref name=ChileLaw /&gt; The [[Net neutrality in the Netherlands|law in the Netherlands]], allows exceptions for congestion, security, spam, or legal reasons.

Crawford]] believes that in a neutral Internet, packets on the network must be forwarded on a first-come, first-served basis, with no consideration given to [[quality-of-service]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.imprintmagazine.org/life_and_style/digital_divide_issue_net_neutrality|title=Digital Divide: The Issue of Net Neutrality|first=Anna |last=Uhls |date=19 April 2007|work=Imprint Magazine|accessdate=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of net neutrality interest groups have emerged, including [[Save the Internet|SaveTheInternet.com]] which frames net neutrality as an absence of discrimination, saying it ensures Internet providers cannot block, speed up, or slow down content on the basis of who owns it, where it came from, or where it's going. It helps create the situation where any site on the Internet could potentially reach an audience as large as that of a TV or radio station, and its loss would mean the end for this level of freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="savetheinternet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savetheinternet.com/=faq |title=Save the Internet : Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Save the Internet|SaveTheInternet.com]] |date=December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211200309/http://savetheinternet.com/=faq |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Only allow discrimination based on type of data===

[[Columbia University Law School]] professor [[Tim Wu]] observed the Internet is not neutral in terms of its impact on applications having different requirements. It is more beneficial for data applications than for applications that require low [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and low [[jitter]], such as voice and real-time video. He explains that looking at the full spectrum of applications, including both those that are sensitive to network latency and those that are not, the IP suite isn't actually neutral. He has proposed regulations on Internet access networks that define net neutrality as equal treatment among similar applications, rather than neutral transmissions regardless of applications. He proposes allowing broadband operators to make reasonable trade-offs between the requirements of different applications, while regulators carefully scrutinize network operator behavior where local networks interconnect.&lt;ref name="Wu Neutrality"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wu, Tim|title=Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination|journal=Journal of Telecommunications and High Technology Law|volume=2|page=141|year=2003|doi=10.2139/ssrn.388863|ssrn=388863}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to ensure that these trade-offs among different applications be done transparently so that the public will have input on important policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mowshowitz |first1=Abbe|author2=Kumar, Nanda|title=Net Neutrality: Private vs. Public Interest on the Internet|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=2007|volume=50|issue=7|pages=23–25|doi=10.1145/1272516.1272533|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1272533}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important as the broadband operators often provide competing services—e.g., cable TV, telephony—that might differentially benefit when the need to manage applications could be invoked to disadvantage other competitors.

The proposal of Google and Verizon would allow discrimination based on the type of data, but would prohibit ISPs from targeting individual organizations or websites:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Why Google and Verizon's Net neutrality deal affects you| url= http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/05/technology/google_verizon_net_neutrality_rules/index.htm | date=5 August 2010| publisher= CNNMoney | accessdate=6 August 2010 | first=David | last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google CEO Eric Schmidt explains Google's definition of Net neutrality as follows: if the data in question is video, for example, then there is no discrimination between one purveyor's data versus that of another. However, discrimination between different types of data is allowed, so that voice data could be given higher priority than video data. Google and Verizon are both agreed on this type of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Caught on Video: Google CEO Dishes on Google Wave, Verizon &amp; Social Strategy| url= http://gigaom.com/2010/08/06/google-ceo-dishes-on-google-wave-verizon-social-strategy/ | date=6 August 2010| publisher= Gigaom | accessdate=15 June 2014 | first=Katie | last=Fehrenbacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual prioritization without throttling or blocking===
Some opponents of net neutrality argue that under the ISP market competition, paid-prioritization of bandwidth can induce optimal user welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | authors=R. T. B. Ma, and V. Misra | title= The Public Option: a Non-regulatory Alternative to Network Neutrality | conference=ACM Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT), Tokyo, Japan, December |year=2011 |url= http://dna-pubs.cs.columbia.edu/citation/paperfile/200/netneutrality.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although net neutrality might protect user welfare when the market lacks competition, they argue that a better alternative could be to introduce a neutral ''public option'' to incentivize competition, rather than enforcing existing ISPs to be neutral.

Some ISPs, such as [[Comcast]], oppose blocking or throttling, but have argued that they are allowed to charge websites for faster data delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/comcasts-cohen-whatever-an-internet-fast-lane-is-were-allowed-to-do-it-1201180653/|title=Comcast’s Cohen: Whatever an Internet ‘Fast Lane’ Is, We’re Allowed to Do It|publisher=Variety|author=Todd Spangler|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=14 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AT&amp;T]] has made a broad commitment to net neutrality, but has also argued for their right to offer websites paid prioritization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/10/att-no-one-can-stop-our-paid-prioritization/|title=AT&amp;T: no one can stop our "paid prioritization"|publisher=ArsTechnica|author= Nate Anderson|date=5 Oct 2010|accessdate=14 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/att-promises-to-lower-your-internet-bill-if-fcc-kills-net-neutrality/|title=AT&amp;T promises to lower your Internet bill if FCC kills net neutrality|publisher=ArsTechnica|author= Jon Brodkin|date=24 Mar 2014|accessdate=14 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To clarify the issue, AT&amp;T is strongly opposed to specific types of "paid prioritization" outlined on [http://www.attpublicpolicy.com/fcc/net-neutrality-and-modern-memory/ their website], but is strongly in favor paid prioritization in general.&lt;/ref&gt; and in favor of its current sponsored data agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/at-t-says-sponsored-data-does-not-violate-net-neutrality/|title=AT&amp;T says 'sponsored data' does not violate Net neutrality|publisher=Cnet|author= Marguerite Reardon|date=9 Jan 2014|accessdate=14 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No direct enforcement===
While many countries lack legislation directly addressing net neutrality, net neutrality can sometimes be enforced based on other laws, such as those preventing anti-competitive practices. This is currently the approach of the US FCC, which justifies their enforcement based on compliance with "commercially reasonable" practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/us-regulator-adopts-internet-traffic-rules/article1846054/|title=U.S. regulator adopts Internet traffic rules|publisher=The Globe and Mail]|author=Iain Marlow|date=21 Dec 2010|accessdate=16 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, author [[Andy Kessler (author)|Andy Kessler]] argued in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' that, though network neutrality is desirable, the threat of [[eminent domain]] against the telecommunication companies, instead of new legislation, is the best approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/348yjwfo.asp |title = Give Me Bandwidth...|last = Kessler|first = Andy|work = The Weekly Standard|date= 26 June 2006 |accessdate=9 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Aparna Watal of Attomic Labs said that there had been few violations of net neutrality. She argues that transparency, threat of public backlash, and the FCC's current authority was enough to solve the issues of net neutrality, claiming that the threat of consumers switching providers and the high cost of maintaining a non-neutral network will deter bad practices.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;Watal, Aparna [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1845043 A Co-regulatory Approach to Reasonable Network Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' has written about the government's responsibility being more along the lines of making sure consumers have the ability to find another Internet provider if they are not satisfied with their service, as opposed to determining how Internet providers should go about managing their networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120795829804109371 |title=An Alternative to 'Net Neutrality' |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
{{main|Net neutrality by country}}
{{sect-stub|1=a small, concise summary of the topic|section=8|date=May 2018}}
Governments of countries which comment on net neutrality usually support the concept.

==Concerns with regulation==

===Potential for government abuse===
[[George Mason University]] fellow Adam Thierer has argued that "any government agency or process big enough to control a major sector of our economy will be prone to influence by those most affected by it", and that consequently "for all the talk we hear about how the FCC's move to impose Net Neutrality regulation is about 'putting consumers first' or 'preserving Net freedom and openness,' it's difficult to ignore the small armies of [[special interests]] who stand ready to exploit this new regulatory regime the same way they did telecom and broadcast industry regulation during decades past."&lt;ref&gt;Thierer, Adam (21 December 2010) "[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-20026346-501465.html Who'll Really Benefit from Net Neutrality Regulation?]", [[CBS News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant Babcock, in the [[libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', wrote in 2014 that U.S. government oversight of ISPs could allow government agencies like the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to pressure ISPs into handing over private communication data on their users. He noted that there was a history of U.S. governmental abuse of regulation, including the [[Federal Reserve]] forcing some banks in 2008 to accept [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] funding by threatening to use their regulatory powers against non-compliant banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Net Neutrality—and Obama's Scheme for the Internet—Are Lousy Ideas |url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/12/net-neutrality-is-a-lousy-idea |work=Reason |first=Grant |last=Babcock |date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violation of corporate rights===
One concern of many [[Internet service provider]]s is government enforcement of information anti-discrimination. Arguing that such enforcement is an infringement on the freedoms of their businesses, American ISPs such as Verizon have argued that the FCC forcing anti-discrimination policies on information flowing over company networks is a violation of the ISPs constitutional rights, specifically concerning the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] in [[Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission (2014)|a court case]] challenging the [[Open Internet Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Bomboy, Scott. "First Amendment Issues Remain Open in Net Neutrality Ruling." Constitution Daily. N.p., 20 Jan. 2014. Web. 15 Aug. 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Verizon challenged the Open Internet Order on several grounds, including that the Commission lacked affirmative statutory authority to promulgate the rules, that its decision to impose the rules was arbitrary and capricious, and that the rules contravened statutory provisions prohibiting the Commission from treating broadband providers as common carriers.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit:." Gaming Law Review 5.5 (2001): 509-22. Web
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential for banning legitimate activity===
Poorly conceived legislation could make it difficult for [[Internet Service Providers]] to legally perform necessary and generally useful packet filtering such as combating [[denial of service]] attacks, filtering [[E-Mail spam]], and preventing the spread of computer viruses. Quoting [[Bram Cohen]], the creator of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], "I most definitely do not want the Internet to become like television where there's actual censorship...however it is very difficult to actually create network neutrality laws which don't result in an absurdity like making it so that ISPs can't drop spam or stop...attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Livingstone |first=Adam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5017542.stm |title=News.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |date=30 May 2006 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pieces of legislation, like The Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009, attempt to mitigate these concerns by excluding reasonable network management from regulation.&lt;ref name=hr3458&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-3458|title=Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009|author=[[Anna Eshoo]], [[Edward Markey]]|date=31 July 2009|publisher=[[United States Congress]]}} Sec 3., Sec. 11 (of the [[Communications Act of 1934]]), (d) Reasonable Network Management&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piezotronics effect''' is using the piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) created in materials with [[piezoelectricity]] as a “gate” voltage to tune/control the charge carrier transport properties for fabricating new devices. Neil A Downie showed how simple it was to build simple demonstrations on a macro-scale using a sandwich of piezoelectric material and carbon piezoresistive material to make an FET-like amplifying device and put it in a book of science projects for students in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Downie|first1=Neil A|title=Exploding Disk Cannons, Slimemobiles and 32 Other Projects for Saturday Science|date=2006|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-8506-X|pages=133–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental principle of piezotronics was introduced by Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2007/07_AM_5.pdf] Zhong Lin Wang, “Nanopiezotronics”, Advanced Materials, 2007, 19, 889-892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piezotronics is likely to have important applications in [[sensor]], human-silicon technology interfacing, [[MEMS]], nanorobotics and active flexible electronics.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Piezotronics2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Working mechanism for piezoelectric devices with one end of the piezoelectric material is fixed. The induced piezopotential distribution is similar to the applied gate voltage in a traditional [[field-effect transistor]], as shown in (b).]]
[[File:Coupling.png|thumb|left|upright=1.7|Schematic diagram showing the three-way coupling among [[piezoelectricity]], photoexcitation and [[semiconductor]].]]
Due to the non-central [[symmetry]] in materials such as the [[wurtzite]] structured [[ZnO]], [[GaN]] and [[InN]], a piezopotential is created in the [[crystal]] by applying a [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. Owing to the simultaneous possession of [[piezoelectricity]] and [[semiconductor]] properties, the piezopotential created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport process.  Generally, the construction of the basic piezotronic devices can be divided into two categories. Here we use the nanowires as the example. The first kind is that the piezoelectric nanowire was put on a flexible substrate with two ends fixed by the electrodes. In this case, when the substrate is bended, the nanowire will be purely stretched or compressed.  Piezopotential will be introduced along its axis.  It will modify the [[electric field]] or the [[Schottky barrier]] (SB) height at the contact area. The induced positive piezopotential at one end will reduce the SB height, while the negative piezopotential at the other end will increase it. Thus the electric transport properties will be changed. The second kind of the piezotronic device is that one end of the nanowire is fixed with electrode, while the other end is free. In this case, when a force is applied at the free end of the nanowire to bend it, the piezopotential distribution will be perpendicular to the axis of the nanowire.  The introduced piezoelectric field is perpendicular to electron transport direction, just like applying a [[gate voltage]] in the traditional [[field-effect transistor]]. Thus the electron transport properties will also be changed. 
The materials for piezotronics should be piezoelectric semiconductors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_NTD_02.pdf] Zhong Lin Wang “Piezopotential Gated Nanowire Devices: Piezotronics and Piezo-phototronics”, Nano Today, 5 (2010) 540-552.&lt;/ref&gt; such as ZnO, GaN and InN. Three-way coupling among [[piezoelectricity]], photoexcitation and semiconductor is the basis of piezotronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric-photon excitation coupling), [[optoelectronics]], and [[piezophototronics]] (piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_NTD_02.pdf] Zhong Lin Wang “Piezopotential Gated Nanowire Devices: Piezotronics and Piezo-phototronics”, Nano Today, 5 (2010) 540-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1443">A Web is a term used in the Converting Industry that refers to continuous rolls of thin, flat materials like paper, film and plastic.  Web guiding systems use a sensor to monitor the position of a web as it enters a production process for lateral tracking.  Each type of web guide sensor has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path.  Actuators may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, or some kind of electromechanical device. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its edge — non-contact sensors are used.  

Sensors developed for Web Guiding applications in the [[Converters (industry)|Converting Industry]] may be pneumatic, photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared.  The system’s controls must process the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive an actuator.  Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or ball screw for guiding actuation.  Some electromechanical guiding systems also utilize computers.   

Pneumatic web guide systems are typically easier to install, operate and are less expensive than more complex hydraulic and electronic systems. Pneumatic servo controllers are considered explosion-proof, especially in dusty or contaminated environments.

The '''Porzellanikon''' is a museum complex dealing with the production of [[porcelain]] and [[ceramics]] in [[Selb]] and [[Hohenberg an der Eger]] in the district of [[Wunsiedel (district)|Wunsiedel]] i. [[Fichtel Mountains|Fichtelgebirge]] ([[Upper Franconia|Oberfranken]]) in [[Germany]]. The complex of museums was the result of the merger of the European Industrial Museum for Porcelain, the European Museum of Technical Ceramics, the Rosenthal Museum and the German Porcelain Museum in Hohenberg an der Eger.  Since 2012, the Porzellanikon has been included in the [[European Route of Ceramics]] as a member of the "UNIC" ("Urban Network for Innovation in Ceramics").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.erih.net/about-erih/erih-membership/erih-members/site/show/porzellanikon/|title=ERIH: Porzellanikon|access-date=2017-03-24|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selb locations ==
[[File:Selb_Porzellanikon.JPG|thumb|Porzellanikon – Selb]]
The city of Selb is considered the center of the German porcelain industry. The porcelain manufacturers located in Selb and the surrounding area are market leaders in the field of tableware porcelain. The museum complex of Porzellanikon Selb is composed of three museums. The European Industrial Museum of Porcelain shows the manufacture of porcelain. The European Museum of Technical Ceramics deals with the use of ceramics in the fields of medicine, electrical engineering and aerospace. The Rosenthal Museum documents the product and design history of [[Rosenthal (company)|Rosenthal AG]], a manufacturer of porcelain and other household products.

=== European Industrial Museum for Porcelain ===
The European Industrial Museum for Porcelain is located on the former factory premises of Rosenthal AG in Selb-Plößberg ([[Bavaria]]). Founded in 1866, the factory is now a recognized industrial monument. The museum shows the development of porcelain production in a factory and the conditions from the beginning of the production of ceramics to the present including original workplaces. It is an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH).

The museum shows how crockery was made from the porcelain raw materials over the last centuries. Screens show the inner life of complex machines and make their functioning understandable. The use of special software enables the experimental design of three-dimensional porcelain objects. Touchscreen applications can be used to answer further questions. The museum also addresses social issues.

=== European Museum of Technical Ceramics ===
The European Museum of Technical Ceramics was opened on 10 October 2005 as part of Porzellanikon Selb. It is the first museum in Europe dedicated to high-performance ceramics. Numerous manufacturers of technical ceramics and the Association of the Ceramic Industry (Selb) participated in its development.

For the first time, technical ceramics were used in the form of dentures at the time of the French Revolution. Under Frederick the Great the acid resistance of porcelain was used for laboratory and pharmacy equipment. In 1849 the first ceramic bell insulator was used on the telegraph route between [[Frankfurt]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1891, porcelain insulators were presented for the first time at the [[International Electrotechnical Exhibition]] in Frankfurt. The advancement of the technology brought other applications for technical ceramics.

Today, technical ceramics can also be found in everyday objects such as lighters, mobile phones, espresso machines or cars, since the material is heat-resistant, durable and hard. Ceramic blades cut diamonds, for example.

=== Rosenthal Museum ===
With the Rosenthal Museum, Rosenthal AG returned to its old factory site on the occasion of its 125th anniversary. The museum is housed in the old kiln of the former factory. Originally built in 1889, the building burnt down in 1982 to the outer walls. The reconstruction took the idea of an "open space concept" into account. Of the original three consecutive round ovens, the front one was completely renovated.

The museum shows the history of the company and its products in various themed islands, which began on 30 August 1879 at Schloss Erkersreuth with [[Philipp Rosenthal]]'s porcelain painting. In 1917, Rosenthal acquired the porcelain factory founded by Jacob Zeidler in Selb-Plößberg in 1866. The company used the factories until they moved their production to Rotbühl in 1969.

As a manufacturer of living and lifestyle products, Rosenthal used an early connection between art, architecture, design, porcelain and other materials. Based on the designs of Rosenthal's product designers such as [[Walter Gropius]], [[Elsa Fischer-Treyden]] and [[Bjørn Wiinblad]].&amp;nbsp; The company was able to win internationally renowned artists to design ceramic wares, including [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] and [[Niki de Saint Phalle]].

In 2009, the Rosenthal collection of the insolvent porcelain manufacturer Rosenthal was bought by the State Supervision Foundation, including the originals of Salvador Dalí and [[Andy Warhol]]. The foundation left the remains of the manufacturing plant to the Porcelain Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosenthal-Archiv verkauft|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.schubra.de/de/presseservice/pressemitteilungen/Rosenthal_pm20090812.php|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2015-12-01|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hohenberg an der Eger location ==
[[File:Porzellanikon_Hohenberg.jpg|thumb|Porzellanikon – Hohenberg]]
The German Porcelain Museum was opened in Hohenberg on the Eger in 1982. Previously, the complex had served as the home of the family's company [[Hutschenreuther]] founded by [[Carolus Magnus Hutschenreuther]]. With the foundation of the first porcelain factory in northeast Bavaria in 1814 Hutschenreuther had laid the foundations in Hohenberg for the region to quickly became the center of the German porcelain industry. In 1995, the historical house was extended by a modern extension of glass and steel to 2000 m². Today, the museum shows some 12,000 exhibits, more than 150,000 parts are in the depot.

The permanent exhibition shows porcelain products from China as well as all kinds of porcelain produced in the German-speaking world, both precious individual products for noblemen as well as industrial products. The tour is chronological. In each room the visitor is shown features of a [[Style (visual arts)|Kunstepoche]]. In front of the buildings is the former factory garden with apple trees and rose leaves.

In computer languages, the term pre-declared refers to built-in information, encodings or tools that are available to a [[Computer programmer|programmer]], often in the form of entities, variables, objects, functions or instructions. It is mostly not possible to overwrite or otherwise manipulate them.

== Pre-declared entity ==

A pre-declared entity is a built-in notation convention for a [[Character (mathematics)|character]] or a [[String (computer science)|string]]. For example, in the [[HTML]] markup language, a large number of character and numeric entities are available to represent characters. In HTML, '&amp;amp;lt;' is a possible pre-declared entity to represent '&lt;'. The programmer must not declare this entity by himself before he can use it, since it is already pre-declared by the specifications of the [[HTML]] language. Pre-declared entities are often used as [[escape sequence]]s to represent information that would otherwise cause possible conflicts in its non-encoded form.

== Pre-declared variable ==

When a variable is pre-declared, it provides the programmer with information that he might be interested in. For example, in the [[Perl]] language, a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] %ENV is pre-declared, holding all kinds of environmental information such as the [[operating system]], host information, user information, and many more. Other pre-declared variables in Perl are %INC and %SIG. Almost all common programming languages provide the programmer with such pre-declared variables in one or another form.

When variables are pre-declared, it is commonly assumed that the value for the pre-declared name is also pre-assigned at the same time.

== Pre-declared object==

Pre-declared [[object (computer science)|object]]s have the same goal as pre-declared variables. For example, in the [[javascript]] language, the navigator-object is available to get all kinds of information about the [[web browser|browser]] that is running the script in question.

== Pre-declared functions and instructions ==

Pre-declared [[Subroutine|functions]] or [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] are built-in tools to perform common tasks. For example, in the earliest [[programming language]]s the [[square root]] needed to be calculated by hand. Nowadays programming languages have a pre-declared instruction or function for this task. Pre-declared functions or instructions often hold common tasks and their goal is to simplify the work of the programmer. The available pre-declared instructions or functions can in some languages be extended by using external libraries or [[Modularity (programming)|modules]].

== Narrow semantic sense ==

In a narrow strictly [[semantic]] sense, the term pre-declared may also refer to the [[Declaration (computer programming)|declaration]] of a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] before an assignment takes place. In the following example, the first line is the (pre-)declaration and the second the [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]]:

    '''var''' A;
    '''A''' = 1;

By declaring the name A, the program creates a [[namespace]] for the variable called A. In most modern languages, the variable does not need to be pre-declared on a separate line, as the following instruction achieves exactly the same:

    '''var''' A = 1;

In early computer languages, the variable always needed to be pre-declared as a separate instruction, because the [[operating system]] had to reserve a series of [[byte]]s in the available [[RAM]], before the actual value of the variable could be stored in it. [[Declaration (computer science)|Declaration]] and [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] are still two fundamental different things, though they nowadays mostly appear in a same instruction line.

The '''Propulsion and Structural Test Facility''' is a facility of the [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].  It was the site where the first single-stage rockets with multiple engines were tested.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

This site was built in 1957 by the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] and was the primary center responsible for the development of large vehicles and rocket propulsion systems.  The [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn Family]] of launch vehicles was developed here under the direction of [[Wernher von Braun]].  The [[Saturn V]] remains the most powerful launch vehicle ever brought to operational status, from a height, weight and payload standpoint.&lt;ref name = "nhlsum"/&gt;

'''Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968''' was an amendment to the [[Public Health Service Act]] mandating performance standards for electronic products suspectible of [[electromagnetic radiation]] or radiation emissions. The [[United States Statutes at Large|United States statute]] established provisions
involving research and development programs for the studies of [[electromagnetic shielding]], [[ionizing radiation]], [[non-ionizing radiation]], and [[exposure assessment]] to [[human]]s.

The [[Act of Congress]] was recodified to [[Title 21 of the United States Code|Title 21]] from [[Title 42 of the United States Code|Title 42]] with the passage of the [[Safe Medical Device Amendments of 1990]]. The electronic product radiation control provisions are authorized for [[United States administrative law|administrative law]] purposes by the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].

The H.R. 10790 [[legislation]] was passed by the 90th United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[List of Presidents of the United States|36th President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on October 18, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29188 |title= Lyndon B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7651">The '''return ratio''' of a dependent source in a linear electrical circuit is the ''negative'' of the ratio of ''the current (voltage) returned to the site of the dependent source'' to ''the current (voltage) of a replacement independent source''. The terms ''[[loop gain]]'' and ''return ratio'' are often used interchangeably; however, they are necessarily equivalent only in the case of a single feedback loop system with [[Amplifier#Unilateral or bilateral|unilateral]] blocks.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;

==Calculating the return ratio==
[[File:Bipolar transresistance amplifier.PNG|thumbnail|200px|Figure 1: Collector-to-base biased bipolar amplifier]]
The steps for calculating the return ratio of a source are as follows:&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Set all independent sources to zero.
#  Select the [[dependent source]] for which the return ratio is sought.
#  Place an independent source of the same type (voltage or current) and polarity in parallel with the selected dependent source.
#  Move the dependent source to the side of the inserted source and cut the two leads joining the dependent source to the independent source. 
#  For a '''voltage source''' the return ratio is minus the ratio of the voltage across the dependent source divided by the voltage of the independent replacement source. 
#  For a '''current source''', short-circuit the broken leads of the dependent source. The return ratio is minus the ratio of the resulting short-circuit current to the current of the independent replacement source.

=== Other Methods ===

These steps may not be feasible when the dependent sources inside the devices are not directly accessible, for example when using built-in "[[black box]]" [[SPICE]] models or when measuring the return ratio experimentally.
For SPICE simulations, one potential workaround is to manually replace [[non-linear]] devices by their small-signal equivalent model, with exposed dependent sources. However this will have to be redone if the bias point changes.

A result by Rosenstark shows that return ratio can be calculated by breaking the loop at any unilateral point in the circuit. The problem is now finding how to break the loop without affecting the [[bias point]] and altering the results. Middlebrook&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a771365730~db=all Middlebrook, RD:''Loop gain in feedback systems 1''; Int. J. of Electronics, vol. 38, no. 4, (1975) pp. 485-512 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and Rosenstark&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a777774065~db=all Rosenstark, Sol: ''Loop gain measurement in feedback amplifiers''; Int. J. of Electronics, vol. 57, No. 3 (1984) pp.415-421]&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed several methods for experimental evaluation of return ratio (loosely referred to by these authors as simply ''loop gain''), and similar methods have been adapted for use in SPICE by Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=99170 Hurst, PJ: ''Exact simulation of feedback circuit parameters''; IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems, vol. 38, No. 11 (1991) pp.1382-1389]&lt;/ref&gt; See [http://www.spectrum-soft.com/news/spring97/loopgain.shtm Spectrum user note] or Roberts, or Sedra, and especially Tuinenga.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;

==Example: Collector-to-base biased bipolar amplifier==
[[File:Inserting return ratio source.PNG|700px|thumb|center|Figure 2: Left - small-signal circuit corresponding to Figure 1; center - inserting independent source and marking leads to be cut; right  - cutting the [[dependent source]] free and short-circuiting broken leads]]

Figure 1 (top right) shows a bipolar amplifier with feedback bias resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' driven by a [[Norton's theorem|Norton signal source]]. Figure 2 (left panel) shows the corresponding small-signal circuit obtained by replacing the transistor with its [[hybrid-pi model]]. The objective is to find the return ratio of the dependent current source in this amplifier.&lt;ref name=Spencer2&gt;
{{cite book 
|author=Richard R Spencer &amp; Ghausi MS
|title=Example 10.7 pp. 723-724
|isbn=0-201-36183-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; To reach the objective, the steps outlined above are followed. Figure 2 (center panel) shows the application of these steps up to Step 4, with the dependent source moved to the left of the inserted source of value ''i&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the leads targeted for cutting marked with an ''x''. Figure 2 (right panel) shows the circuit set up for calculation of the return ratio ''T'', which is

::&lt;math&gt; T = - \frac {i_r} {i_t} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The return current is

::&lt;math&gt; i_r = g_m v_{\pi} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The feedback current in ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is found by [[current division]] to be:
::&lt;math&gt;i_f = \frac {R_D//r_O} {R_D//r_O +R_F +r_{\pi}// R_S} \  i_t \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The base-emitter voltage ''v&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt;'' is then, from [[Ohm's law]]:

::&lt;math&gt; v_{\pi} = -i_f \ ( r_{\pi}// R_S ) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,
::&lt;math&gt; T = g_m  (r_{\pi}// R_S ) \  \frac {R_D//r_O} {R_D//r_O +R_F +r_{\pi}// R_S}\ .  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Application in asymptotic gain model ===
The overall [[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|transresistance gain]] of this amplifier can be shown to be:

::&lt;math&gt; G = \frac {v_{out}} {i_{in}} =  \frac {(1-g_m R_F)R_1 R_2} {R_F+R_1+R_2+g_m R_1R_2} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || r&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; || r&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;''.

This expression can be rewritten in the form used by the [[asymptotic gain model]], which expresses the overall gain of a feedback amplifier in terms of several independent factors that are often more easily derived separately than the overall gain itself, and that often provide insight into the circuit. This form is:

::&lt;math&gt; G = \ G_{ \infty } \frac {T} {1+T}  + G_0 \frac {1} { 1+T} \ \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the so-called '''asymptotic gain''' ''G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gain at infinite ''g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', namely:

::&lt;math&gt; G_{\infty} = - R_F \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and the so-called '''feed forward''' or '''direct feedthrough''' ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gain for zero ''g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', namely:

::&lt;math&gt; G_{0} = \frac { R_1 R_2 } {R_F +R_1 +R_2}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

For additional applications of this method, see [[Asymptotic gain model#Return ratio|asymptotic gain model]] and [[Blackman's theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''Soft handover''' or '''soft handoff''' refers to a feature used by the [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] and [[WCDMA|W-CDMA]] standards, where a [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] is simultaneously connected to two or more cells (or cell sectors) during a call. If the sectors are from the same physical [[cell site]] (a sectorised site), it is referred to as '''softer handoff'''.  This technique is a form of mobile-assisted handover, for [[IS-95]]/[[CDMA2000]] CDMA cell phones continuously make power measurements of a list of neighboring cell sites, and determine whether or not to request or end soft handover with the cell sectors on the list.

Due to the properties of the CDMA signaling scheme, it is possible for a CDMA phone to simultaneously receive signals from two or more radio [[base stations]] that are transmitting the same [[bit stream]] (using different transmission codes) on the different physical channels in the same frequency bandwidth. If the signal power from two or more radio base stations is nearly the same, the phone receiver can combine the received signals in such a way that the bit stream is decoded much more reliably than if only one base station were transmitting to the subscriber station. If any one of these signals fades significantly, there will be a relatively high probability of having adequate signal strength from one of the other radio base stations.

On the uplink (phone-to-cell-site), all the cell site sectors that are actively supporting a call in '''soft handover''' send the bit stream that they receive back to the Radio Network Controller (RNC), along with information about the quality of the received [[bit]]s. The RNC examines the quality of all these bit streams and dynamically chooses the bit stream with the highest quality. Again, if the signal degrades rapidly, the chance is still good that a strong signal will be available at one of the other cell sectors that is supporting the call in '''soft handover'''.

Soft handover results in a [[diversity gain]] called soft handover gain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1684">The '''Subiaco Press''' was a [[printing press]] located in [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], [[Italy]]. The Press was established in 1464 by the [[Germans|German]] [[monk]]s [[Arnold Pannartz]] and [[Konrad Sweinheim]] in the [[Abbey of Santa Scolastica, Subiaco|Abbey of Santa Scolastica]] at Subiaco. It was the first printing press in Italy.

The first book printed at Subiaco was a [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]]; it has not been preserved. This was followed by [[Cicero|Cicero's]] ''[[De Oratore]]'' in September 1465 (which is extant - a copy is in the Buchgewerbehaus at [[Leipzig]]).  The next book was [[Lactantius]]'s ''De divinis institutionibus'' printed in October 1465. In 1467, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' was printed. These early books are notable for their [[typography]]. Unlike earlier German books, they were not printed in [[blackletter]] type. Instead, they were printed in a "half Roman" type, as in Italy there was a desire to use [[Roman type|Roman]] characters.  Furthermore, Lactantius's ''De divinis institutionibus''  contains the world's first [[Greek language|Greek]] printed characters. These were used for the extensive quotations in Greek which employed mobile letters now called "Subiaco type."

In 1467, Pannartz and Sweinheim left Subiaco and settled in [[Rome]].

'''TARGET2''' (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System) is the [[real-time gross settlement]] (RTGS) system for the [[Eurozone]], and is available to non-Eurozone countries. It was developed by and is owned by the [[Eurosystem]]. TARGET2 is based on an integrated central technical infrastructure, called the '''Single Shared Platform''' (SSP).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ANNEX4TARGET24thprogress.pdf "Single Shared Platform: General Functional Specifications: Version 2.1"], ''ecb.europa.eu''.&lt;/ref&gt; SSP is operated by three providing [[central bank]]s: France ([[Banque de France]]), Germany ([[Deutsche Bundesbank]]) and Italy ([[Banca d'Italia]]). TARGET2 started to replace TARGET in November 2007.

TARGET2 is also an interbank RTGS [[payment system]] for the [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] of cross-border transfers in the eurozone. Participants in the system are either direct or indirect. Direct participants hold an RTGS account and have access to real-time information and control tools. They are responsible for all payments sent from or received on their accounts by themselves or any indirect participants operating through them. Indirect participation means that payment orders are always sent to and received from the system via a direct participant, with only the relevant direct participant having a legal relationship with the Eurosystem. Finally, [[bank branch]]es and subsidiaries can choose to participate in TARGET2 as multi-addressee access or addressable [[Bank Identifier Code|BICs]].

== Objectives ==
The objectives of TARGET2 are to:
* support the implementation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy and the functioning of the euro money market
* minimise systemic risk in the payments market
* increase the efficiency of cross-border payments in euro, and
* maintain the integration and stability of the Eurozone money market.

==Participation ==
The use of TARGET2 is mandatory for the settlement of any euro operations involving the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem consists of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the national [[central bank]]s of the 19 [[European Union member states]] that are part of the Eurozone.&lt;ref name=ECBorganisation&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/educational/facts/orga/html/or_002.en.html |title=European Central Bank/Eurosystem, Organisation |access-date=24 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914031229/http://www.ecb.int/ecb/educational/facts/orga/html/or_002.en.html |archive-date=14 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in TARGET2 is mandatory for new member states joining the Eurozone.

TARGET2 services in euro are available to non-Eurozone states. National central banks of states which have not yet adopted the euro can also participate in TARGET2 to facilitate the settlement of transactions in euro. Central banks from four non-Eurozone states Bulgaria, Denmark, Poland and Romania also participate in TARGET2.

In 2012, TARGET2 had 999 direct participants, 3,386 indirect participants and 13,313 correspondents.

== Activity ==
TARGET2 is the [[real-time gross settlement]] (RTGS) system with payment transactions being settled one by one on a continuous basis in [[monetary base|central bank money]] with immediate finality. There is no upper or lower limit on the value of payments. TARGET2 mainly settles operations of monetary policy and money market operations. TARGET2 has to be used for all payments involving the Eurosystem, as well as for the settlement of operations of all large-value net settlement systems and securities settlement systems handling the euro. TARGET2 is operated on a single technical platform. The business relationships are established between the TARGET2 users and their national central bank. In terms of the value processed, TARGET2 is one of the largest payment systems in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/targetar2012en.pdf|title=TARGET Annual Report 2012|website=Europa.eu|date=2013|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single Shared Platform===
TARGET2 is a harmonised RTGS system covering the Eurozone. It operates on the Single Shared Platform (SSP), which replaced the decentralised first-generation TARGET system. It was designed to provide an enhanced service with benefits for economies of scale which allows it to charge lower fees and offer cost-efficiency. All participants of the Eurosystem, and outside it, can access the same functionalities and interfaces, as well as a single price structure. [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] standards and services (i.e. FIN, InterAct, FileAct and Browse) are used in the harmonised communication between the system and its participants.

Before the introduction of TARGET2, some central banks held "home accounts" (also called "proprietary home accounting systems") outside their RTGS systems. These were used primarily to manage minimum reserves, standing facilities and cash withdrawals, but also to settle ancillary systems’ transactions.

It was agreed that, in the context of the new system, these types of transaction should ultimately be settled on the RTGS accounts held on the SSP. However, some countries’ domestic arrangements did not allow these operations to be moved rapidly to the SSP. As a result, the Eurosystem agreed on a maximum transition period of four years for moving the settlement of these payments to the SSP.

The Information and Control Module (ICM) allows direct users to access information and manage parameters linked to balances and payments online. Via the ICM, users have access to the Payments Module and the Static Data Management function. Users of the ICM are able to choose what information they receive and when. Urgent messages (e.g. system broadcasts from central banks and warnings concerning payments with a debit time indicator) are automatically displayed on the screen.

TARGET2 provides settlement services for a wide range of ancillary systems. While each of these used to have its own settlement procedure, TARGET2 now offers six generic procedures for the settlement of ancillary systems and allows these systems to access any account on the SSP via a standardised interface.

===Statistics===
In 2012, TARGET2:

===Liquidity management===
The availability and cost of liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low-cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves – which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank – can be used in full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully collateralised, i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools that will allow them to track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location – e.g. their head office. TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.

TARGET2 has a range of features allowing efficient liquidity management, including payment priorities, timed transactions, liquidity reservation facilities, limits, liquidity pooling and optimisation procedures.

===Access criteria===
The access criteria for TARGET2 aim to allow broad levels of participation by institutions involved in clearing and settlement activities. Supervision by a competent authority ensures the soundness of such institutions. Supervised credit institutions established within the European Economic Area are the primary participants. Supervised investment firms, clearing and settlement organisations which are subject to oversight and government treasuries can also be admitted as participants.

===Pricing===
There are two pricing schemes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesbank.de/target2/target2_preise.en.php |title=TARGET2 – Prices |website=Bundesbank.de |access-date=2016-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423053326/http://www.bundesbank.de/target2/target2_preise.en.php |archivedate=23 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the establishment of the European Economic Community in 1958, there has been a progressive movement towards a more integrated European financial market. This movement has been marked by several events: In the field of payments, the most visible were the launch of the euro in 1999 and the cash changeover in the euro area countries in 2002. The establishment of the large-value central bank payment system TARGET was less visible, but also of great importance. It formed an integral part of the introduction of the euro and facilitated the rapid integration of the euro area money market.

The implementation of TARGET2 was based on a decision of the ECB Council of autumn 2002. TARGET2 started operations on 19 November 2007, when the first group of countries (Austria, Cyprus, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia) migrated to the SSP. This first migration was successful and confirmed the reliability of SSP. After this initial migration, TARGET2 already settled around 50% of overall traffic in terms of volume and 30% in terms of value.

On 18 February 2008, the second migration successfully migrated to TARGET2, comprising Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

On 19 May 2008, the final group migrated to TARGET2, comprising Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Poland and the ECB. The six-month migration process went smoothly and did not cause any operational disruptions.

Slovakia joined TARGET2 on 1 January 2009, Bulgaria joined in February 2010, and Romania joined on 4 July 2011.

==Relation to the world financial and European debt crisis ==
{{One source|section|text=This section almost exclusively relies on scientific work of a single economist, [[Hans-Werner Sinn]].|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Target2% 20graph% 20-% 20% 20ecb% 20data(1).jpg|thumb|TARGET2 balances of selected countries of Euro system starting 2001]]
{{main article|Financial crisis of 2007-2008|European debt crisis}}
The main subjects of criticism are the unlimited credit facilities made available since the establishment of the TARGET system by the national central banks of the Eurosystem on the one hand and by the ECB on the other.

The issue of the increasing Target balances was brought to public attention for the first time in early 2011 by [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], president of the Munich [[Ifo Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung|Ifo Institute]]. In an article in ''[[Wirtschaftswoche]]'', he drew attention to the enormous increase in Target claims held by Germany's Bundesbank, from €5 billion at the end of 2006 to €326 billion at the end of 2010, and to the attendant liability risk.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.wiwo.de/politik/ausland/denkfabrik-deutschland-drohen-neue-belastungen/5245288.html ''Neue Abgründe''], ''Wirtschaftswoche'', No. 8, 21 February 2011, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the German daily ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' he put the entire volume of the Target liabilities of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain at 340 billion euros at the end of February 2011. Moreover, he pointed out that if these countries should exit the Eurozone and declare insolvency, Germany's liability risk would amount to 33% of that sum, or 114 billion euros, relating these sums to the other rescue facilities of euro countries and the International Monetary Fund. Before he made them public, Target deficits or surpluses were not explicitly itemised, being usually buried in obscure positions of central bank balance sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/rettungsschirm-fuer-den-euro-tickende-zeitbombe-1.1080370 ''Tickende Zeitbombe''], "Süddeutsche Zeitung", No. 77, 2 April 2011, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Sinn interpreted the Target balances for the first time within the context of current account deficits, international private capital movements and the international shifting of the refinancing credit that the national central banks of the Eurosystem grant to the [[commercial bank]]s in their [[jurisdiction]]. He proved that the ECB system compensated the interruption and reversal in [[capital flow]]s triggered by the financial crisis by shifting refinancing credit among national central banks. The increase in Target liabilities is a direct measure of net payment orders across borders, i.e. of the portion of the current account deficit that is not counterbalanced by capital imports, or, equivalently, the sum of the current account deficit and net capital exports. Indirectly, they also measure a country's amount of central bank money created and lent out beyond what is needed for domestic circulation. Since every country needs a relatively steady amount of central bank money for its domestic transactions, payment orders to other countries, which reduce the domestic stock of money, must be offset by a continuous issuing of new refinancing credit, i.e., the creation of new central bank money. Similarly, the increase in money balances in the country whose central bank honours the payment orders reduces the demand for fresh refinancing credit. Hence, a country's Target liabilities also indicate the extent to which its central bank has replaced the capital markets to finance its current account deficit, as well as any possible capital flight, by creating new central bank money through corresponding refinancing credit. Sinn illustrated that from an economic perspective, Target credit and formal rescue facilities serve the same purpose and involve similar liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/europas-schuldenkrise/target-kredite-die-riskante-kreditersatzpolitik-der-ezb-1637926.html ''Die riskante Kreditersatzpolitik der EZB''], ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', No. 103, 4 May 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/ifosd_2011_9_2.pdf ''Target-Salden, Außenhandel und Geldschöpfung''], ifo Schnelldienst 64, No. 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn's presentation on 19 May 2011 at the Munich Economic Summit motivated an op-ed column in the ''Financial Times''. They reconstructed the data on the basis of the balance sheets of the Eurosystem's national central banks and the balance-sheet statistics of the International Monetary Fund.

Later, in June 2011, Hans-Werner Sinn and Timo Wollmershaeuser compiled the first panel database of the Eurozone's Target balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sinn | first1 = H. W. | last2 = Wollmershäuser | first2 = T. | doi = 10.1007/s10797-012-9236-x | title = Target loans, current account balances and capital flows: The ECB's rescue facility | journal = International Tax and Public Finance | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 468–508 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The authors presented their findings at various conferences, such as [http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoContent/N/pr/pr-PDFs/20110509-Vortrag-Berlin_Einladung.pdf ''H.-W. Sinn’s lectures on May 9th 2011 at the Humboldt University''] and showed that Target balances are classical balance-of-payment imbalances. Their method was also used later by the ECB itself, in their October 2011 monthly report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Central Bank: [http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/mobu/mb201110en.pdf ''TARGET2 balances of national central banks in the Euro area''], Monthly Bulletin, October 2011, p. 36, footnote 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors point out that the additional creation of money by the central banks of the crisis-stricken countries was provided by a lowering of the standards for the collateral that commercial banks have to provide to their national central banks to obtain refinancing credit. Furthermore, they showed that the commercial banks of the Eurozone's core countries used the incoming liquidity to reduce the refinancing credit they drew from their national central bank, even lending the surplus liquidity to this central bank, which implies that the Target balances indirectly also measure the reallocation of refinancing credit among the countries of the Eurozone. The authors showed that the national central banks of the northern countries became net debtors to their own banking systems. Sinn and Wollmershaeuser argue that the euro crisis is a balance-of-payments crisis, which in its substance is similar to the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods crisis]]. Moreover, they show the extent to which Target credit financed current account deficits or capital flight in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. They also show that the current account deficits of Greece and Portugal were financed for years by refinancing credits of their national central banks and the concomitant Target credit. They document as well the Irish capital flight and the capital flight from Spain and Italy, which began in earnest in summer 2011. Following Sinn,&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.voxeu.org/article/fed-versus-ecb-how-target-debts-can-be-repaid "Fed versus ECB: How TARGET debts can be repaid"], Vox, March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the authors compare the Target balances of the Eurosystem with the corresponding balances in the US settlement system ([[Interdistrict Settlement Account]]) and point out that US balances relative to US GDP have decreased thanks to a regularly performed settlement procedure in which ownership shares in a common Fed clearing portfolio are reallocated among the various District Feds comprising the US Federal Reserve System. They advocate the establishment of a similar system in Europe to end the ECB's role as a provider of international public credit that undercuts private market conditions. Hans-Werner Sinn addressed the Target balances issue again in a special edition of 'ifo Schnelldienst' and made it the main topic of his book ‘Die Target-Falle‘ ("The Target Trap"), published in early October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/ifosd_Sonderausgabe_20120321-1.pdf ''Die Target-Kredite der deutschen Bundesbank''], ifo Schnelldienst 65, Special issue, 21 March 2012, pp. 3–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.cesifo-group.de/sinn-2012-target-falle ''Die Target-Falle: Gefahren für unser Geld und unsere Kinder''], Hanser, Munich 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of economists took a stand on the issue of the Target balances in a publication of the Ifo Institute, confirming Sinn's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, Helmut Schlesinger, Wilhelm Kohler, Charles B. Blankart, Manfred J. M. Neumann, Peter Bernholz, Thomas Mayer, Jochen Moebert and Christian Weistroffer, Georg Milbradt, [[Stefan Homburg]], Friedrich L. Sell and Beate Sauer, Ingo Sauer, Jens Ulbrich and Alexander Lipponer, Christian Fahrholz and Andreas Freytag, Ulrich Bindseil, Philippine Cour-Thimann und Philipp Koenig, Franz-Christoph Zeitler, Klaus Reeh, in: Sinn, Hans-Werner (ed.), [http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/1215229.PDF ''The European Balance of Payments Crisis'']{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, CESifo Forum, Special Issue, January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial commentator [[David Marsh (financial specialist)|David Marsh]], writing in early 2012, noted that TARGET2 provides "automatic central bank funding for EMU countries suffering capital outflows provided through it" and that the balances would "have to be shared out by central banks throughout the [[Eurosystem]] ... if [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] fragments into its constituent parts. So the pressure on Germany is to keep the balances growing, in order to avoid crystallization of losses that would be hugely damaging not just to Berlin but also to central banks and governments in Paris and Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, David, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-myths-about-the-european-quagmire-2012-02-27?link=MW_story_featstor "10 myths about the European quagmire"], ''MarketWatch'', 27 February 2012. Myth No. 9 addresses Target-2. Retrieved 2012-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official reactions to Sinn's research findings were mixed. At first, in February and March 2011, the Bundesbank downplayed the Target balances as an irrelevant statistical position.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Bundesbank, [http://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BBK/2011/2011_02_22_target2_salden_der_bundesbank.html ''TARGET2-Salden der Bundesbank ''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202172939/http://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BBK/2011/2011_02_22_target2_salden_der_bundesbank.html |date=2 February 2014 }}, Press release, 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Bundesbank, [http://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publications/Monthly_Report/2011/2011_03_monthly_report.pdf?__blob=publicationFile ''The dynamics of the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 balance''], Monthly Report 63, March 2011, No. 3, pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in early 2012, Bundesbank chief [[Jens Weidmann]] wrote a letter to ECB head [[Mario Draghi]] on the subject which "found its way into the columns of the conservative [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] newspaper. It appeared to suggest more secure collateralisation for the overall ECB credits to weaker EMU central banks, which now amount to more than €800 billion under the ECB's TARGET2 electronic payment system," Marsh noted in a subsequent column.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, David, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/weidmann-reawakens-debate-on-bundesbanks-power-2012-03-05 "Weidmann reawakens debate on Bundesbank’s power"], ''MarketWatch'', 5 March 2012. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jens Ulbrich and Alexander Lipponer (economists at the Bundesbank) justified the policy of the ECB during the European balance-of-payments crisis as follows: In the crisis, the Eurosystem consciously assumed a larger intermediation function in view of the massive disruptions in the interbank market by extending its liquidity control instruments. With this greater role in the provision of central bank money – essentially by changing to a full allotment procedure in refinancing operations and the extension of longer-term refinancing operations – the total volume of refinancing credits provided has increased (temporarily even markedly). At the same time, the quality requirements for the underlying collateral were reduced in the crisis. The higher risk was accepted to maintain the functioning of the financial system under more difficult conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Ulbrich and Alexander Lipponer, [http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/1215229.PDF ''Balances in the Target2 Payments System – A Problem?'']{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, in: Sinn, Hans-Werner (ed.), The European Balance of Payments Crisis, CESifo Forum, Special Issue, January 2012, pp.73–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ifo Institute’s regularly updated "Exposure level indicator" (‘Haftungspegel‘) shows Germany’s potential financial burden should the crisis-stricken euro countries exit the currency union and declare insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;ifo Institute: [http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/policy/Haftungspegel.html "The Exposure Level"]&lt;/ref&gt; In another development, the Institute of Empirical Economic Research at the University of Osnabrueck collects and publishes Target2 data from all euro countries on the basis of the balance sheets of each central bank.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Empirical Economic Research, Osnabrueck University: [http://www.iew.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/8959.htm Target2 data]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are also some economists who contradict some points of Sinn's analysis. [[Paul De Grauwe]] and Yuemei Ji argue that Germany's and other countries’ Target claims could be made void, without suffering any losses, since that the value of the central bank money, being  "[[fiat money]]", is independent of a central bank's assets.&lt;ref&gt;De Grauwe, Paul and Yuemei Ji, [http://www.voxeu.org/article/how-germany-can-avoid-wealth-losses-if-eurozone-breaks-limit-conversion-german-residents ''What Germany should fear most is its own fear''], VOX, 18 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn, in his rejoinder, showed that the Target balances represent the shift of refinancing credit to the crisis-stricken countries, representing thus the claim on the interest returns from these countries. Eliminating the Target balances would thus entail a real loss of resources amounting to the present value of this interest income, which is reflected exactly by the amount of Target claims. This loss would result in a smaller transfer of Bundesbank's revenues to the German budget and, should the situation arise, in the necessity to recapitalise the Bundesbank through increased taxation.&lt;ref name="Sinn"&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.voxeu.org/article/target-losses-case-euro-breakup ''Target losses in case of a euro breakup''], Vox, 22 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn uses the same reasoning in his book ‘Die Target-Falle‘.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn, Hans-Werner, [http://www.cesifo-group.de/sinn-2012-target-falle ''Die Target-Falle: Gefahren für unser Geld und unsere Kinder''], Hanser, Munich 2012, Chapter 7, Section "Die Umwidmung der Ersparnisse".&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn points out that the option of self-rescue for the crisis-affected countries by drawing Target credit forces Germany to approve the formal rescue facilities and eventually to accept Eurobonds as well. He considers the resulting path dependence in policy-making a "trap". Analysis of TARGET2 balances countering the Ifo conclusions have been advanced by economist Karl Whelan at [[University College Dublin]]. In summer 2012, Thomas A. Lubik, a senior economist and research advisor, and Karl Rhodes, a writer, both at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]] (Virginia, USA), cited Whelan's work and also drew parallels and distinctions between the [[Federal Reserve System|US Fed]] and the ECB in analysing the balances. Lubik and Rhodes argued that "TARGET2 merely reflects persistent imbalances in current accounts and capital accounts. It does not cause them ... [and does not represent] a 'stealth bailout' of the periphery nations".&lt;ref&gt;Lubik, Thomas A., and Karl Rhodes, [http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2012/pdf/eb_12-08.pdf "TARGET2: Symptom, Not Cause, of Eurozone Woes"], ''richmondfed.org'', August 2012; via Steve Goldstein, [http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2012/08/06/fed-bank-weighs-in-on-hot-europe-debate/ "Fed bank weighs in on hot Europe debate"], ''MarketWatch'', 6 August 2012. Retrieved 2012-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn countered that he was misinterpreted in this point insofar as he was just "saying that the current-account deficits were sustained with the extra refinancing credit behind the TARGET balances" and this would "not equate to claiming that current-account deficits and TARGET deficits were positively correlated".&lt;ref name="Sinn" /&gt;

Alexander L. Wolman believes that rising Interdistrict Settlement Account (ISA) balances - the US-equivalent of rising target balances, if there were no yearly rebalancing - would not be a reason for concern in the US, because the borderlines of the [[Federal Reserve District]]s do not follow national, not even state borders. Further, a rising ISA balance of the Federal Reserve District of New York would be regarded as not surprising, New York being the financial center of the United States. So till 1975 there was no rebalancing between Federal Reserve Districts, a fact  which did not lead to major discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2013/q2/pdf/wolman.pdf Alexander L. Wolman, „Federal Reserve Interdistrict Settlement“, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Volume 99, Number 2ó Second Quarter 2013, S. 117-141, S. 128-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in late 2016, after some years of relative improvement but with rising worries over Italy, the level of TARGET2 intra-eurozone balances at the ECB had surpassed 2012's record levels. The claims represented half of the Germany's net foreign assets and were on track shortly to reach €1 trillion if trends continued unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marsh (financial specialist)|Marsh, David]], [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germany-worrying-again-about-its-hidden-bailout-of-italy-greece-2016-12-21 "Opinion: Germany worrying again about its hidden bailout of Italy, Greece"], ''MarketWatch'', December 21, 2016.

A '''tachistoscope''' is a [[machine|device]] that displays an [[image]] for a specific amount of time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which elements of an image are memorable.  Projection tachistoscopes use a [[Slide projector|slide]] or [[Overhead projector|transparency projector]] equipped with the mechanical [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] system typical of a [[camera]].  The slide is loaded, the shutter locked open, and focusing and alignment are adjusted, then the shutter is closed.  When ready for the test, a [[shutter speed]] is selected, and the shutter is tripped normally. 

== History ==
The first tachistoscope was originally described by the German physiologist [[A.W. Volkmann]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Benschop 1998, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Renshaw]] used it during [[World War II]] in the training of fighter pilots to help them identify aircraft silhouettes as friend or foe.&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Godnig, "The Tachistoscope: Its History and Uses", ''Journal of Behavioral Optometry'' '''14''':2:39 (2003) [http://www.oepf.org/sites/default/files/journals/jbo-volume-14-issue-2/14-2%20Godnig.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Before [[Personal computer|computers]] became ubiquitous, tachistoscopes were used extensively in [[Psychology|psychological research]] to present visual stimuli for controlled durations. Some experiments employed pairs of tachistoscopes so that an experimental participant could be given different stimulation in each [[visual field]].

Tachistoscopes were used during the late 1960s in public schools as an aid to increased reading comprehension for [[speed reading]]. There were two types: the student would look through a lens similar to an aircraft bombsight viewfinder and read letters, words and phrases using manually advanced slide film. The second type projected words and phrases on a screen in sequence. Both types were followed up with comprehension and vocabulary testing.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, James I, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40018033 "Teaching Reading With the Tachistoscope"], ''Journal of Developmental Reading'', Winter, 1958, 1(2)8-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Tachistoscopes continue to be used in market research, where they are typically used to compare the visual impact, or memorability of marketing materials or packaging designs. Tachistoscopes used for this purpose still typically employ slide projectors rather than computer monitors, due to

* the opportunity to show large or life-size images.

'''Tracy Caldwell Dyson''' (born '''Tracy Ellen Caldwell'''; August 14, 1969) is an American [[chemist]] and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. Caldwell Dyson was a Mission Specialist on [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] flight [[STS-118]] in August 2007. She was part of the [[Expedition 24]] crew on the [[International Space Station]] between April 4, 2010 and September 25, 2010. She has completed three spacewalks, logging more than 22 hrs of [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] including work to replace a malfunctioning coolant pump.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pe /&gt;

==Academic career==
As an undergraduate researcher at the [[California State University, Fullerton]] (CSUF), Caldwell Dyson designed, constructed and implemented electronics and hardware associated with a laser-ionization, [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]] for studying atmospherically relevant [[gas-phase chemistry]].&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

Also at CSUF, she worked for the Research and Instructional Safety Office as a lab assistant performing environmental monitoring of laboratories using hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials, as well as calibrating survey instruments and helping to process chemical and radioactive waste. During that time (and for many years prior) she also worked as an electrician/inside wireman for her father’s electrical contracting company doing commercial and light industrial type construction.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

At the [[University of California, Davis]], Caldwell Dyson taught general chemistry laboratory and began her graduate research. Her dissertation work focused on investigating molecular-level [[surface reactivity]] and kinetics of metal surfaces using [[electron spectroscopy]], [[laser desorption]], and [[Fourier transform]] mass spectrometry techniques. She also designed and built peripheral components for a variable temperature, ultra-high vacuum [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] system.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

In 1997, Caldwell Dyson received the Camille and Henry Drefus Postdoctoral Fellowship in Environmental Science to study [[atmospheric chemistry]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. There she investigated reactivity and kinetics of atmospherically relevant systems using atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopies. In addition, she developed methods of chemical ionization for spectral interpretation of trace compounds. Caldwell Dyson has published and presented her work in numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in June 1998, Caldwell Dyson reported for training in August 1998. Her Astronaut Candidate Training included orientation briefings and tours, numerous scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and [[International Space Station]] (ISS) systems, physiological training, ground school to prepare for [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] flight training, as well as learning water and wilderness survival techniques. Completion of this training and evaluation qualified her for flight assignment as a mission specialist.

In 1999, Caldwell Dyson was assigned to the Astronaut Office ISS Operations Branch as a Russian Crusader, participating in the testing and integration of Russian hardware and software products developed for ISS. In 2000, she was assigned prime Crew Support Astronaut for the ISS [[Expedition 5]] crew, serving as their representative on technical and operational issues throughout the training and on-orbit phase of their mission.

During ISS Expeditions 4 through 6, Caldwell Dyson also served as an ISS spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) inside Mission Control. In 2003, she made a transition to the Astronaut Shuttle Operations Branch and was assigned to flight software verification in the [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory]] (SAIL) and also worked supporting launch and landing operations at [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida. Caldwell Dyson also served as Lead CAPCOM for [[Expedition 11]].

Caldwell Dyson was assigned to, and later flew on STS-118, Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'', on August 8–21, 2007, which was the 119th space shuttle flight, the 22nd flight to the station, and the 20th flight for ''Endeavour''. Caldwell Dyson was assigned as Mission Specialist #1 on this flight. During the mission Endeavour's crew successfully added another truss segment, a new gyroscope and external spare parts platform to the International Space Station. A new system that enables docked shuttles to draw electrical power from the station to extend visits to the outpost was activated successfully. A total of four spacewalks (EVAs) were performed by three crew members. ''Endeavour'' carried some 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies to the station and returned to Earth with some 4,000 pounds of hardware and no longer needed equipment. Traveling 5.3&amp;nbsp;million miles in space, the STS-118 mission was completed in 12 days, 17 hours, 55 minutes and 34 seconds. Finally, during the flight of STS-118, Caldwell Dyson celebrated her 38th birthday in space.

On April 4, 2010, Caldwell Dyson joined the [[Expedition 23]] crew aboard [[ISS]]. She lifted off on April 2, 2010 from the [[Baikonur]] spaceport aboard a Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] capsule ([[Soyuz TMA-18]]). After 176 days duty as part of the [[Expedition 24]] crew, she returned to Earth with the Soyuz TMA-18 landing unit.  Together with commander [[Aleksandr Skvortsov (cosmonaut)|Aleksandr Skvortsov]] and flight engineer [[Mikhail Korniyenko]], Dyson landed in [[Kazakhstan]] on September 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/info/soyuz-tma18/soyuz-tma18.htm|title=Soyuz TMA-18 Descent Module Landing Photos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a television interview on the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing, she said she is the first astronaut who was born after Apollo 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanindian.net/kusi/tracycaldwell/index.html|title=Astronaut Tracy Caldwell &amp; "Officer Phil" Konstantin's KUSI TV 9/51 Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tracy Dyson, she is the host of a series on [[NASA TV]] called ''StationLife'', which focuses on facets of life aboard the International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airuci.uci.edu/news/astronaut-tracy-caldwell-dyson-hosts-nasa-show |title=Astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson hosts NASA show |publisher=Atmospheric Integrated Research at University of California, Irvine |date=January 19, 2015 |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared on Episode 3 of ''[[MasterChef Junior]]'' Season 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3kdcuy|title=MasterChef Junior Season 4 Episode 3 - Hashtag Best Day Ever [HDTV]|last=Viralvideoz007|first=|date=2016-01-01|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2017, Dyson stood behind [[President Trump]] as he signed a bill for NASA to send humans to Mars in 2030s and receive $19.5 billion in 2018 funding. Dyson and fellow NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy presented Trump with an official flight jacket during the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.space.com/36154-president-trump-signs-nasa-authorization-bill.html|title=President Trump Signs NASA Authorization Bill|accessdate = 2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Caldwell Dyson, the younger of two girls, was born in [[Arcadia, California]],&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; and later moved to [[Beaumont, California]], in the early 1980s to attend junior high school where her father worked as an electrician. Her recreational interests include running, weight training, hiking, softball, basketball, and auto repair/maintenance. As an undergraduate, she competed in intercollegiate athletics on the [[CSUF Titans]] track team as both a sprinter and long jumper.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

Caldwell Dyson is a private pilot and conversational in [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/4096-astronaut-biography-tracy-caldwell.html|title=Astronaut Biography: Tracy E. Caldwell|newspaper=Space.com|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is married to [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] George Dyson.&lt;ref name="pe" /&gt;  She is also the lead vocalist for the all-astronaut band [[Max Q (Astronaut band)|Max Q]].&lt;ref name="apod"&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Home from Above|date=November 15, 2010|access-date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Caldwell Dyson served as the guest judge on a space-themed episode of the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Cupcake Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/2011/06/cupcake-wars-the-final-frontier/|title=Cupcake Wars Recap: The Final Frontier - FN Dish – Food Network Blog|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caldwell Dyson advised [[Jessica Chastain]] when the actress was preparing to appear as an astronaut and mission commander in the 2015 movie ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]].''  Chastain said she was very inspired by Caldwell Dyson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieweb.com/movie/the-martian/jessica-chastain-tracy-dyson-junket-interview/|title=The Martian - Jessica Chastain &amp; Tracy Dyson Junket Interview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She believes in [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;NASA Preflight Interview of Tracy Caldwell Dyson, 23 March 2010. Dyson says of her education and early career: "but I think God planted enough people in my life that said, you need to just follow your heart, you need to do what interests you."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5926">The '''Unique Device Identification''' (UDI) System is intended to assign a unique identifier to medical devices within the United States. It was signed into law on September 27, 2007, as part of the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]]. This act includes language related to the establishment of a Unique Device Identification System. When implemented, the new system will require:

* The label of a device to bear a unique identifier, unless an alternative location is specified by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) or unless an exception is made for a particular device or group of devices. 
* The unique identifier to be able to identify the device through distribution and use 
* The unique identifier to include the lot or serial number if specified by FDA

A national UDI system will create a common vocabulary for reporting and enhance electronic tracking abilities. Currently, analysis of adverse event reports is limited by the fact that the specific devices involved in an incident are often not known with the required degree of specificity. Without a common vocabulary for medical devices, meaningful analysis based on data from existing voluntary systems is problematic. Reliable and consistent identification of medical devices would enable safety surveillance so that the FDA and manufacturers could better identify potential problems or device defects, and improve patient care.

The UDI is expected to improve patient safety (in part by helping to identify counterfeit products and by improving the ability of staff to distinguish between devices that are similar in appearance but serve different functions),&lt;ref name="Ament"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ament | first = Lucy | date = November 13, 2006 | title = AHA calls for medical device identification system | journal = AHA News | volume = 42 | issue = 23 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitate and improve the recall process, and create efficiences within the medical system.&lt;ref name="DiConsiglio2007p264-26"&gt;{{cite journal | last = DiConsiglio | first = John | date = September 2007 | title = Solve a unique challenge | journal = Materials Management in Health Care | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages =24–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most basic format, the UDI would be a coded number registered with [[standards organization]]s, and would incorporate a variety of information, including (but not limited to) the manufacturer of the device, expiry dates, the make and model of the device, and any special attributes that the device may possess.&lt;ref name="DiConsiglio2007p26"&gt;{{cite journal | last = DiConsiglio | first = John | date = September 2007 | title = Solve a unique challenge | journal = Materials Management in Health Care | volume = 16 | issue = 9 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a medical sense, "device" refers to any product that is not [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] in nature, and while the FDA have been given approval to exempt some devices, Jay Crowely (who was responsible for implementing the UDI requirements in the Act), has expressed an intent to apply the UDI to "everything until somebody gives us good reason not to", (excluding devices which won't need identification).&lt;ref name="Joch2008p"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Joch | first = Alan | date = October 2008 | title = A device by any other name | journal = Materials Management in Health Care | volume = 17 | issue = 10 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the passing of the Act, there were calls for the FDA to publish a timeline for the implementation of the UDI;&lt;ref name="HospitalsCalling"&gt;{{cite journal | date = June 2008 | title = Hospitals calling for device ID | journal = Materials Management in Health Care | volume = 17 | issue = 6 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was subsequently done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDeviceIdentification/CompliancedatesforUDIRequirements/default.htm FDA - Compliance Dates for UDI Requirements]. Accessed 16 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GUDID Submission'''
The Final Rule on Unique Device Identifiers also mandates medical device manufacturers to make a submission to the FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database. The submission to the GUDID will include the Primary Device Identifier portion of the UDI as well as associated data attributes about each model or version number of the device.

Compliance with the submission component of UDI compliance is phased according to the Class of device. Class III device labelers must submit to the GUDID for all existing products by September 24, 2014. Labelers of Implantable, Life Supporting or Life Sustaining devices must submit to the GUDID by September 24, 2015. Class II labelers must comply with submission guidelines by September 24, 2016, and Class I labelers by September 24, 2018.

Submission to the GUDID may be made in one of two methods. The first method utilizes the FDA's GUDID Web Interface, which is meant for low volumes of GUDID submissions. The second method utilizes an HL7 SPL submission and is transmitted to the FDA through an Electronic Submission Gateway account.

Once the initial submission is made, labelers of medical devices must update the GUDID submission each time there is a change to the device attributes. While many device attributes may be updated once the device record is published within the GUDID, several attributes cannot be changed and will necessitate the labeler deactivate the existing submission and resubmit using a new Device Identifier.

In 1998, a statute enacted by the legislature of the State of Alabama amended the obscenity provisions of the Alabama Code to make the distribution of certain defined sexual devices a criminal offense. Vendors and users of such devices filed a constitutional challenge to the statute in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]] against [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], in his official capacity as the Attorney General of the State of Alabama.&lt;ref name="NDAla"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Williams v. Pryor |vol=41 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1257 |pinpoint= |court=N.D.

==Background==

After the 1998 amendment, the Alabama Code obscenity provisions provide the following:
''It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or offer or agree to distribute any obscene material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs for any thing of pecuniary value.''

A first violation is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to one year of jail or hard labor; a subsequent violation is a class C felony.  The State conceded the statute's proscription of the distribution of sexual devices in Alabama does not apply to devices acquired as gifts or by purchases in another state. The statute also does not restrict possession or use of a sexual device by an individual, but only the commercial distribution of the devices. 
After considering Supreme Court precedent, the District Court determined the statute does not implicate previously recognized fundamental constitutional rights. The court also declined to extend those rights to provide a fundamental right to the use of sexual devices  The district court next reviewed the statute under rational basis scrutiny and concluded the statute lacked a rational basis. The court accordingly held the statute unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction against its enforcement.&lt;ref name="NDAla"/&gt;

==Eleventh Circuit ruling==
The Circuit Court explained that whether a statute is constitutional is determined in large part by the level of scrutiny applied by the courts. Statutes that infringe fundamental rights, or that make distinctions based upon suspect classifications such as race or national origin, are subject to [[strict scrutiny]], which requires that the statute be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Most statutes reviewed under the very stringent strict scrutiny standard are found to be unconstitutional.  Quoting ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', the Circuit Court stated that "if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the [law] so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Pryor'', 240 F.3d at 948, quoting {{ussc|name=Romer v. Evans|link=|volume=517|page=620|pin=632|year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Court, almost every statute subject to the very deferential [[Rational basis review|rational basis]] scrutiny standard is found to be constitutional.

The Circuit Court concluded that the district court erred in determining the Alabama statute lacks a rational basis. It found that the State's interest in public morality is a legitimate interest rationally served by the statute, and that the crafting and safeguarding of public morality has long been an established part of the States' plenary police power to legislate and indisputably is a legitimate government interest under rational basis scrutiny.

The Court rejected plaintiffs argument that the statute is constitutionally irrational because it is contrary to a wide spectrum of public and professional opinions which recognize numerous legitimate and beneficial uses of sexual devices, especially the necessity of sexual devices for some persons to achieve medical or emotional health. The Court said that however misguided the legislature of Alabama may have been in enacting the statute challenged in this case, the statute is not constitutionally irrational under rational basis scrutiny because it is rationally related to the State's legitimate power to protect its view of public morality. "The Constitution presumes that ... improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Pryor'', 240 F.3d at 952, quoting {{ussc|name=Vance v. Bradley|link=|volume=440|page=93|pin=97|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court remanded the [[as-applied challenge]]s for consideration by the district court because the record and stipulations were too narrow to permit the Court to decide whether or to what extent the Alabama statute infringes a fundamental right to sexual privacy of the specific plaintiffs in this case.

==Subsequent challenges==
In December 2003 the Supreme court ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' which overturned the previous decision of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' In light of this the [[ACLU]] again challenged the decision before the 11th Circuit in February 2007. The 11th circuit ruled that even though ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' had been overruled that in doing so the Supreme Court had

&lt;blockquote&gt;"declined the invitation" to recognize a fundamental right to sexual privacy, which would have compelled us to employ strict scrutiny in assessing the constitutionality of the challenged statute ... Thus, because there is no fundamental right at issue, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the challenged statute.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ... Accordingly, we find that public morality survives as a rational basis for legislation even after ''Lawrence'', and we find that in this case the State's interest in the preservation of public morality remains a rational basis for the challenged statute. By upholding the statute, we do not endorse the judgment of the Alabama legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Williams v. Morgan |vol=478 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1316 |pinpoint=1320-23 |court=11th Cir. |date=2007 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/478/1316/473287/ |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Reliable Consultants Inc. v. Earle]],'' on February 12, 2008, the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas ban on the sale of sex toys using the similar facts that failed in the above appeal. It held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as in ''Lawrence'', the State here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the State is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification for the statute after ''Lawrence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Reliable Consultants Inc. v. Earle |vol=517 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=738 |pinpoint=746 |court=5th Cir. |date=2008 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081255517f3d73811253 |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[This That and the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga.]],'' the 11th Circuit struck down on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds a Georgia law that banned advertising obscene material, including sex toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=This That and the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v.
