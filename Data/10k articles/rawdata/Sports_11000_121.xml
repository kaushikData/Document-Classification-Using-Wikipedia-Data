The '''12th [[Southeast Asia Basketball Association]] [[SEABA Championship|Championship]]''' was the qualifying tournament for the [[2017 FIBA Asia Cup]]. It also served as a regional championship involving Southeast Asian basketball teams. It was held from 12 to 18 May 2017 in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="postpone"&gt;{{cite news|title=PBA, Gilas 5.0 face scheduling dilemma as Seaba tournament postponed to mid-May|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/pba-gilas-pilipinas-face-dilemma-as-seaba-tournament-postponed-to-mid-may|accessdate=1 February 2017|work=Sport Interactive Network Philippines|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Araneta"&gt;{{cite news|title=Araneta Coliseum - and not Cebu - will play host to Gilas stint in Seaba championship|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/news/araneta-coliseum-and-not-cebu-will-play-host-to-gilas-stint-in-seaba-championship|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Sport Interactive Network Philippines|date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally scheduled to be held from 23 to 30 April 2017, [[SEABA]] decided to postpone the tournament to 15 to 21 May 2017&lt;ref name="postpone"/&gt; due to conflicting schedule with the [[ASEAN Basketball League]] and the [[Indonesian Basketball League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henson|first1=Joaquin|title=SEABA joust reset to May|url=http://beta.philstar.com/sports/2017/02/11/1671079/seaba-joust-reset-may|accessdate=11 February 2017|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, this tournament only allotted one spot for the subzone for the renamed continental championship which was held in Lebanon from 10 to 20 August 2017.

Aside from the hosts, the national teams of {{nbt|Indonesia}}, {{nbt|Malaysia}}, {{nbt|Myanmar}}, {{nbt|Singapore}}, {{nbt|Thailand}} and {{nbt|Vietnam}} participated in the week-long tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bracher|first=Jane|title=Manila to host 2017 SEABA basketball tournament|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/159240-manila-host-2017-seaba-basketball-tournament|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Rappler|date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2017 SEABA Under-16 Championship|SEABA U16 Championship for Men]] was also hosted by the [[Philippines]] from 14 to 18 May 2017 at the same venue.

==Host selection==
The defending champions, through the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] (SBP), was awarded the hosting rights of the championship. This was the first time that the Philippines hosted the SEABA Championship since [[2001 SEABA Championship|2001]].&lt;ref name=hosting&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Gerry|title=Gilas 5.0 to play first tournament at home as Philippines awarded Seaba hosting right|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/news/gilas-50-plays-first-tournament-at-home-as-ph-gets-nod-as-2016-seaba-host-|accessdate=23 January 2017|publisher=spin.ph|date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country signified its interest to host the 2017 tournament sometime in December 2016, before the December 31 deadline set by SEABA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bracher|first1=Jane|title=SBP to bid for SEABA Championship hosting|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/157606-sbp-philippines-bid-2017-seaba-championship-hosting|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Rappler|date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AccesSurf''' is a [[nonprofit]] [[charity organization]] that offers a variety of programs, services, and events for people with a disability. Based in [[Honolulu, HI]], AccesSurf was founded in 2006. Their mission is to “empower people with disabilities by providing adaptive surfing and therapeutic educational programs on water recreation and enriches lives by helping families to access the beach and ocean in a barrier free environment.”&lt;ref name=Autism&gt;{{cite web|title=AccesSurf|url=http://www.hawaiiautismfoundation.org/resources/|website=Hawaii Autism Foundation|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AccesSurf educates the general public about how to help people with disabilities and provide the resources necessary to create the opportunities. They have created programs locally and nationally to assist anyone with a [[physical disability]] or [[cognitive disability]] in the water environment. For the fiscal year of 2013, AccesSurf netted $104,960 with their asset amount of $112,408.&lt;ref name="Charity Navigator" /&gt;

==History==
AccesSurf was founded in 2006 in Honolulu, Hi&lt;ref name="Charity Navigator"&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Largest Charity Evaluator|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&amp;ein=204420646#.VayvLflViko|website=Charity Navigator|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mark Marbles.&lt;ref name=NCHPAD&gt;{{cite web|title=Surf's Up at AccesSurf! : NCHPAD - Building Inclusive Communities|url=http://www.nchpad.org/788/4170/Surf~s~Up~at~AccesSurf~|website=National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD)|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of friends and family, Marbles wanted to create an area where people with disabilities could come out and enjoy the beach. AccesSurf started with their program “Day at the Beach”&lt;ref name="AccesSurf's Day at the Beach"&gt;{{cite web|title=AccesSurf's Day at the Beach|url=https://www.accessurf.org/day-at-the-beach/|website=AccesSurf Hawaii Nonprofit RSS|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually expanded by creating a “Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach”. With the growth of both of these events, AccesSurf became the first accredited [[Paralympic]] Sports Club in Hawaii in 2012.&lt;ref name="Paralympic Sports Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Sports Club|url=https://www.accessurf.org/paralympic-sports-club/|website=AccesSurf Hawaii Nonprofit RSS|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
AccesSurf offers a wide variety of programs such as the “Day at the Beach” and the “Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach”&lt;ref name="Wounded Warrior"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wounded Warrior|url=https://www.accessurf.org/wounded-warrior/|website=AccesSurf Hawaii Nonprofit RSS|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also part of the only Paralympic Sports Club in Hawaii.

===Day at the Beach===
The “Day at the Beach” program is a free monthly service provided by trained volunteers to introduce adaptive aquatic recreation using specialized [[surfboards]], wave skis, and flotation devices for anyone with a [[physical disability]] or [[cognitive disability]].&lt;ref name="AccesSurf's Day at the Beach" /&gt;  Due to the struggle that persons with disabilities and their families experience when attempting to access the beach, AccesSurf repurposed military industrial mats (Mobi-Mats) to create a wheelchair- and stroller-accessible beach path.&lt;ref name=Mobi-Mat&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview mark marble president and ceo accessurf|url=http://www.mobi-mat-chair-beach-access-dms.com/interview-mark-marble-president-and-ceo-accessurf-hawaii-united-states/|website=Mobi-Mat|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with equipment, AccesSurf provides specially-trained professionals. The intention of the program is to allow people to have a fun and realizing day without having to worry about disabilities.

===Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach===
Similar to “Day at the Beach,” the “Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach” is another service offered by AccesSurf. This service is for veterans who have been classified [[Wounded Warriors]].&lt;ref name="Wounded Warrior" /&gt;

===Paralympic Sports Club===
In 2012, AccesSurf became the first accredited Paralympic Sports Club in Hawaii. With the help of swim coaches from Swim Mechanix, AccesSurf was able to develop swim clinics both in the pool and the ocean.&lt;ref name="Paralympic Sports Club" /&gt;

===International Surfing Association Adaptive Surfing World Championship===
AccesSurf and its volunteers have been invited to help and sponsor athletes in the first ever adaptive surfing world championship&lt;ref name="International Surfing Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIRST-EVER ISA WORLD ADAPTIVE SURFING CHAMPIONSHIP|url=http://www.isasurf.org/first-ever-isa-world-adaptive-surfing-championship-set-to-be-held-in-la-jolla-california-september-24-27/|website=International Surfing Association|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in [[La Jolla, California]] in September 2015.

'''Andrew "Boy" Charlton Pool''' is an eight-lane outdoor heated salt-water {{convert|50|m|yd|adj=on}} [[swimming pool]] on the shore of [[Woolloomooloo Bay]] in [[the Domain, Sydney|the Domain]] in [[Sydney, Australia]], near the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]].{{sfn|McDonald|2011|loc=Andrew (Boy) Charlton Pool}} It was re-opened for the 2011–12 summer season, having undergoing a major refurbishment during 2011.{{sfn|McDonald|2011|loc=Andrew (Boy) Charlton Pool}} In 1968, the pool, previously called the new Domain Baths, was renamed in honour of [[Boy Charlton|Andrew "Boy" Charlton]], an Australian swimmer who won five Olympic medals during the 1920s.{{sfn|Poke|2012|p=57}}

==Early years==
Since the first European settlement in Sydney there have been 11 different bathing establishments in [[Woolloomooloo|Woolloomooloo Bay]]. In the early years, the small sandy beach where the Andrew "Boy" Charlton Pool now stands was reserved for the exclusive use of the military of NSW including the Marines, the [[New South Wales Corps]] and any British regiments stationed here.

In the 1820s the use of Woolloomooloo Bay by others was increasing. Two hulks, ''Ben Bolt'' and the ''Cornwallis'' were moored at the swimming place then known as the Fig Tree. Some dressing sheds were also built but the swimming area was not enclosed.

The first swimming facility planned for the area was a floating public baths called Robinson's Hot and Cold Baths. Thomas Robinson was granted a lease for the area in December 1829 but construction of the baths took another ten years to complete.

Beating Robinson to the jump was the wife of [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie's]] coachman, Mrs Biggs. She opened the first ladies baths, which included a [[bathing machine]], in 1833 on a small flat inlet near the north-western corner of [[Cowper Wharf]]. The baths went out of operation in the late 1840s.

In November 1843, Robinson's baths reopened after a refurbishment which included deepening the ladies pool and the introduction of a shallow children's’ area. Warm showers and a towel were also available for all bathers.

==First swimming races==
It was in the "Gentlemen's Baths" that Australia's the first official competitive swimming events took place. On 14 February 1846 two races were held, an open event over 440 yards (won by W. Redman in a time of 8 min 43 sec) and a 100-yard event for juveniles. Annual championships were held here for some years afterwards.

In 1850 the Fig Tree baths and what was left of Mrs Biggs’ women's baths were granted by the Government to [[City of Sydney|Sydney Council]] with the intention that the Council build new baths on the site. However, with the dismissal of the council in 1853 the project stalled.

In 1854 Mrs Macquarie's Road was opened to horse-drawn vehicles improving access to the baths. Towards the end of the 1850s Sydney Council, or "Corporation" as it was known, built new baths around the wharf at Fig Tree which projected into Woolloomooloo Bay.

This brought to three the sets of baths in the bay at this time. In addition to the Corporation Baths was a Ladies Baths (not Mrs Biggs’ although near her former site) and a fully enclosed Gentlemen's Baths. Although the Corporation Baths were still there in 1888, more than 30 years later, they were largely unusable because of sewerage discharged into Woolloomooloo Bay. By 1890 there were four baths; the Corporation had a ladies and a gentleman's baths and there were also independent ladies and gentleman's baths.

In 1901, since the sewer had been diverted to [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]] and no longer emptied into [[Sydney harbour|Sydney Harbour]] at Woolloomooloo, the State Government extended the lease for the baths with Sydney Council. Funding was also provided to remove the haphazard collection of bathing buildings which had accumulated over the years and construct a new baths. These were officially opened in October 1908 and consisted of a fenced swimming area and concrete platform over the old stone one attached to the shore. Another fence provided privacy from the path and there was a timber and corrugated iron change shed.

=="Boy" Charlton==
Apart from Australia's first swimming races, the most memorable event to take place in the Domain Baths was in January 1924 when [[Boy Charlton|Andrew "Boy" Charlton]] swam against [[Arne Borg]] of Sweden. A crowd of 6000 came to see him beat Borg over 440 yards, equal Borg's world record and set a new Australian record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1895766 |title=SWIMMING. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=14 January 1924 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton was already very popular in [[New South Wales]] when he took on Borg. At the age of 14 he beat Hawaiian swimmer [[William Harris (swimmer)|Bill Harris]] over 880 yards setting a new world record in the process.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} At 15 years of age he beat Olympic swimmer [[Frank Beaurepaire]] and won the NSW 800m freestyle title in world record time talking 19 seconds off the old mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16039527 |title=CHARLTON'S SWIM. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 January 1923 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his win over Borg, however, that launched him to national stardom. To show that it was no fluke he beat Borg again over 220 yards and 880 yards at the NSW Championships.

Charlton went on to win the gold medal in the 1500m freestyle event at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Olympics]] later that year and silver in the 400m and 1500m events at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles Olympics]].

His 1924 world record in the Domain baths was the first set there, an achievement which was recognised in January 1968 when, after yet another refurbishment, the pool was reopened and named after him.

They beat [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]]'s Treaty Stone in the Munster Final by 1-02 to 1-01. The team was trained by James McDonnell. This is the only time that the title was won by a Kerry team.

===The Boys From Ballyduff===
This song was written by P.J. Sheehy on the occasion of the Ballyduff/Crossabeg All-Ireland Hurling final in 1891. Patrick Sheehy was grandfather of Sean Sheehy who won championship medals with Ballyduff in 1972 and 1973, and great-grandfather of Tomas O'Sullivan who won championship medals with Ballyduff in 1988 and 1989.

Just a mile or thereabouts,

From the lordly Shannon mouth,

There's a spot to which none other I'd compare;

It's a village, not a town,

Though her sons have gained renown,

For the Boys from Ballyduff are always there.

'''Boltwood''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who made a single known appearance for [[All-England cricket teams|All-England]] against [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] at [[Laleham Burway]] on 10–11 September 1778.&lt;ref name=GB86&gt;Buckley, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CA45"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/45.html |publisher=''CricketArchive'' |title=Chertsey v All-England 1778 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boltwood scored 34 runs with a highest score of 27.&lt;ref name="CA45"/&gt; Boltwood may have played in the return match at the [[Artillery Ground]] on 15 September, but no details of that match have survived.&lt;ref name=GB86/&gt;

As Boltwood had established his reputation by 1778, he must have been active for some years previously. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Boltwood.

The '''Pabellón de la Fama del Caribe''' (In English, the ''Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame'') was established in 1996&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Caribbean_Hall_of_Fame Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame].

It honors the most prominent baseball players who have made significant achievements in the [[Caribbean Series]], as well as efforts to honor people who have contributed to the development of Caribbean baseball.

In February each year, during the course of the Series, the winners are voted in by journalists, radio and television broadcasters, as well as baseball historians from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Each nominee has to receive at least the minimum seventy-five percent of votes to secure his enshrinement in the Hall, just like it is for the [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]].&lt;ref name=UNIVERSAL2001/&gt;

Since 2009, the prize is awarded to personalities born in the host country of the Series.&lt;ref name=UNIVERSAL2001/&gt;

==Production==
This film is the directorial and screenwriting debut of [[Danila Kozlovsky]].

Initially Danila Kozlovsky thought that he would participate in the project only as an actor and producer. However, in the end, he also became the director of the project, as well as a co-author of the script.

[[Danila Kozlovsky]] previously played the role of a football player in the film ''[[Garpastum]]'' (2005) directed by [[Aleksei Alekseivich German|Aleksei German Jr.]]

Olga Zueva, who worked with [[Danila Kozlovsky]] in the film ''In the Hood'' (2018), initially asked for the role of Varya. But Danila felt that she did not fit in the style and image, and continued to look for another performer. Meanwhile, Olga Zueva reworked the script, giving the character of her character more strength, courage and a bit of eccentricity. The director positively evaluated the proposals and approved the actress for the role.&lt;ref name="Hello"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ru.hellomagazine.com/kino-i-televidenie/21160-trener-chto-nam-izvestno-o-novom-filme-danily-kozlovskogo.html|title="Тренер": что нам известно о новом фильме Данилы Козловского|publisher=[[Hello! (magazine)|Hello!]]|date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the workers of the set were dressed in the branded jackets of the Meteor team. If the camera captured one of them when shooting, that person fit into the frame as an employee of the club.&lt;ref name="Hello" /&gt;

The project was created with the support of the [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Ministry of Sport of the Russian Federation]], the [[Russian Football Union]] and personally [[Vitaly Mutko]].&lt;ref name="ria" /&gt; Also the film received financial support from the [[Cinema Foundation of Russia]].&lt;ref name="tass" /&gt;
[[File:Rus-IvoryCoast (9).jpg|thumb|Danila Kozlovsky and [[Vitaly Mutko]] of the World Cup.]]

About three thousand professional football players auditioned for a role in the picture, from whom the creators of the project selected about 200 people. Among them were [[Alan Gatagov]] and [[Dmitri Sychev]]; the latter compared Kozlovsky with [[Guus Hiddink]] based on the results of the shooting, who combining exactingness and democracy, managed to lead the national team to bronze medals of [[Euro 2008]]. For two months, the team, assembled from athletes and professional actors, lived on a tough athletic regimen. Kozlovsky trained with them too.&lt;ref name="Hello" /&gt;

The '''Dominican Summer League Cubs''' or '''DSL Cubs''' are a [[Rookie League|rookie league]] affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]] based in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?t=t_ros&amp;cid=602 MinorLeagueBaseball.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They play in the Boca Chica North Division of the [[Dominican Summer League]].

==History==
The team began in 1991 with a joint affiliation with the [[Kansas City Royals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id%3D6a176e10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313063028/http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=6a176e10 |archivedate=2014-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An affiliation with the [[Colorado Rockies]] was added in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=117816d0&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1993 season, the team shared an affiliation with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=0e88765e&lt;/ref&gt;  They then shared an affiliation with the [[San Diego Padres]] for the next three seasons (1994–1996).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=c0ecc38c&lt;/ref&gt;

The team became independently affiliated with the Cubs in 1997.  From 2008 to 2012, the team split into two squads as DSL Cubs 1 and DSL Cubs 2, but became a unified team again for the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?code=DOSL&amp;class=FRk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frankfurter Handball Club''' is a [[Germany|German]] women's [[team handball|handball]] from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]].

==History==
During the [[East Germany|communist era]] Frankfurter HC was the handball section of military sports club '''ASK Vorwärts''', installed in Frankfurt since 1971. Vorwärts was one of the most successful East German team in the 1980s, winning six [[DDR-Oberliga (women's handball)|national championships]] between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddr-handball.de/ List of champions] in ddr-handball.de&lt;/ref&gt; It was also successful in international competitions, winning two [[Women's EHF Cup|EHF Cups]] in 1985 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-sports.org/handball-women-s-ehf-cup-presentation-medal-winners-s8-c0-b0-g78-t2761.html List of champions] in the-sports.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the [[reunification of Germany]] the ASK Vorwärts society was disbanded in 1991, and Frankfurt became an independent club and joined the [[Handball-Bundesliga Frauen|Handball-Bundesliga]] as '''BFV Frankfurt'''. In 1994 the club merged with local team and took its current name. 

While the club's status has decreased following the reunification Frankfurter has still been fairly successful since, winning the 1997 [[Women's EHF Challenge Cup|EHF City Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohandball.com/ec/city/women/1996-97/clubs/001731 Profile and record] in the [[European Handball Federation]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; the 2003 [[Frauen DHB Pokal|national cup]] and the 2004 championship. Most recently it was sixth in 2011, qualifying for the EHF Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoresway.com/?sport=handball&amp;page=round&amp;id=347 2011 Bundesliga table and results] in scoresway.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haimie Anak Nyaring''' (born 31 May 1998) is a [[Brunei]]an [[Association football|footballer]] of [[Iban people|Iban]] descent who plays professionally for [[DPMM FC]] of the [[Singapore Premier League]] as a [[Goalkeeper#Association football|goalkeeper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC sign new S League squad|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/dpmm-fc-sign-new-s-league-squad/|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

Haimie was initially a defender in his youth years, even managing to represent Brunei in an under-15 tournament held in Malaysia in June 2013 while playing in that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei U-15 kick off campaign on wrong foot|url=http://www.bruneiolympic.org/?t=news/index&amp;p=news/2013/20130626a|date=26 June 2013|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converted into a goalkeeper by the time he was brought in by [[Panchor Murai FC]] debuting in the [[Brunei Premier League]] in [[2015 Brunei Premier League|2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfabd.org/schedules/dst-premierleague-2015-teams-06.htm|title=PANCHOR MURAI FOOTBALL CLUB|publisher=National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam|date=|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411175050/http://nfabd.org/schedules/dst-premierleague-2015-teams-06.htm|archivedate=11 April 2015|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2016 Brunei Super League|following season]], Haimie was placed by [[National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam|NFABD]] to play for [[Tabuan Muda|Tabuan U21]], the league team of the [[Brunei national under-21 football team|national under-21 side]] in the [[Brunei Super League|Super League]]. He was largely an understudy to [[Ishyra Asmin Jabidi]] in his time there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jerudong fight back to draw with Tabuan U-21|url=http://msabdbft.blogspot.com/2016/04/jerudong-fight-back-to-draw-with-tabuan.html|date=10 April 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haimie returned to Panchor Murai FC in the first half of 2017, unfortunately his side finished last in the [[2017 Brunei Premier League|Premier League]] with only five points from a possible 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DST PREMIER LEAGUE 2017|url=http://www.nfabd.org/schedules/dst-premierleague-2017-standings.htm|date=|publisher=National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances for the [[Brunei national under-23 football team|national under-23s]] instigated a move to [[Indera SC]] for the second half of the [[2017–18 Brunei Super League|2017 Super League season]], and found regular playing time there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=INDERA FIGHT BACK TO DRAW AGAINST KOTA RANGER|url=https://www.brusports.com/2017/11/18/indera-fight-back-to-draw-against-kota-ranger/|date=18 November 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, he became the league's Best Player by helping Indera to third place, despite only at the club halfway through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MS ABDB pertahankan kejuaraan Liga Super DST|url=http://www.pelitabrunei.gov.bn/Lists/Berita%202018/NewDisplayForm.aspx?ID=12710|date=10 February 2018|publisher=Pelita Brunei|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Haimie joined Brunei's professional side [[DPMM FC]] after impressing new head coach [[Renê Weber]] at a pre-season trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local quartet poised to join DPMM FC 2018 squad|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/local-quartet-poised-to-join-dpmm-fc-2018-squad/|date=6 February 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut against [[Home United FC|Home United]] on 7 April in a 4–2 win, unfortunately scoring an own goal in the 75th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC usher new era with Home win|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/dpmm-fc-usher-new-era-with-home-win/|date=8 April 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June, he was sent off for violent conduct on [[Taku Morinaga]] in the 74th minute during the 5-0 loss against [[Albirex Niigata Singapore FC|Albirex Niigata (S)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/singapore-football/894830/albirex-unstoppable-11th-win-season-10-man-brunei-dpmm/|title=Albirex unstoppable with 11th win of the season against 10-man Brunei DPMM|publisher=[[Fox Sports Asia]]|date=4 June 2018|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
As part of [[Tabuan Muda|Tabuan U21]], Haimie was invited to train with the [[Brunei national football team|full national team]] for a regional tournament in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nat’l team on right track|url=http://modasys.net/3g/index.php/sports/local-sports/22392-nat-l-team-on-right-track.html|date=2 February 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following October, he joined up with the squad yet again for two friendly matches against the [[Malaysia national under-22 football team|Malaysian national under-22 squad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wasps leave for friendlies against M’sia Under-22 team|url=http://bruneifootball.blogspot.com/2016/10/wasps-leave-for-friendlies-against-msia.html|date=5 October 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not selected for the [[2016 AFF Championship qualification]] matches, nor the [[2016 AFC Solidarity Cup]]; Ishyra Asmin Jabidi was chosen instead.

Haimie's luck made an upturn in 2017 when he was selected to play ahead of Ishyra for the first match of the [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification]] held in [[Myanmar]] in July for the [[Brunei national under-23 football team|Brunei under-23s]], against regional giants [[Australia national under-23 football team|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AFC U-23 CHAMPIONSHIP 2018: AUSTRALIA 2 - 0 BRUNEI DARUSSALAM|url=http://cms.the-afc.com/afcasfeeds?fixtureid=11375&amp;stageid=436&amp;tMode=C&amp;view=ajax&amp;show=matchsummary|date=|publisher=Asian Football Confederation|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed admirably, keeping out the Olyroos' 10 chances in the first half alone, before a 53rd-minute penalty by [[George Blackwood]] and a [[Riley McGree]] strike in the last five minutes sank the Young Wasps to a 2–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AFC U-23 CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFIERS: GROUP F - AUSTRALIA 2-0 BRUNEI / MYANMAR 2-0 SINGAPORE|url=http://cms.the-afc.com/afc-u-23-championship-2018/afc-u-23-championship-qualifiers-group-f-md1|date=19 July 2017|publisher=Asian Football Confederation|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew praise from opposition coach [[Josep Gombau]] and subsequently kept his place for the remainder of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haimie impresses in Aussie defeat|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/haimie-impresses-aussie-defeat/|date=20 July 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, the Under-23s competed in the [[Football at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games|29th SEA Games]] held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=105 ATHLETES NAMED TO REPRESENT BRUNEI AT 29TH SEA GAMES|url=https://www.brusports.com/2017/07/29/105-athletes-named-to-represent-brunei-at-29th-sea-games/|date=29 July 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haimie started the opening game of the tournament against [[Malaysia national under-23 football team|the hosts]] and once again kept the scoreline to a minimum, only conceding twice to the Young Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei make Malaysia uncomfortable in narrow defeat|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/brunei-make-malaysia-uncomfortable-narrow-defeat/|date=15 August 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two defeats to [[Myanmar national under-23 football team|Myanmar]] and [[Laos national under-23 football team|Laos]] followed where he let in nine unanswered goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faris tears DPMM to shreds in Home United’s extraordinary 9-3 mauling|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/news/faris-tears-dpmm-shreds-home-uniteds-extraordinary-9-3-mauling|date=19 August 2017|publisher=[[Mizzima News]]|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football: Brunei look to avoid finishing pointless after Laos loss|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/football-brunei-look-to-avoid-finishing-pointless-after-laos-loss/|date=22 August 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was benched for Ishyra in the last deadwood game against [[Singapore national under-23 football team|Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Singapore salvage some pride after narrow SEA Games win over Brunei|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/singapore-salvage-some-pride-after-narrow-sea-games-win-over-brunei|date=23 August 2017|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]] Singapore|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Haimie was recalled to the national team for the [[2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup]] and played in the 4–0 loss against [[Indonesia national under-23 football team|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BRUNEI FALL TO INDONESIA IN RAIN SOAKED ENCOUNTER|url=https://www.brusports.com/2017/12/03/brunei-fall-to-indonesia-in-rain-soaked-encounter/|date=3 December 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he was selected for the [[2018 AFF Championship qualification|2018 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification]] matches against [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] in early September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minister urges national team to make impact at AFF Suzuki Cup qualifier|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/minister-urges-national-team-to-make-impact-at-aff-suzuki-cup-qualifier/|date=30 August 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained his first full national team cap on 1 September in the first leg at [[Kuala Lumpur]] in a 3–1 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei face uphill battle after first leg loss in AFF qualifiers|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/brunei-face-uphill-battle-after-first-leg-loss-in-aff-qualifiers/|date=2 September 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept a clean sheet in the second leg at home, but the Wasps failed to progress to the tournament proper with only a 1–0 win at [[Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium]] on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei win 1-0 against Timor Leste but miss out on AFF final round|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/brunei-win-1-0-against-timor-leste-but-miss-out-on-aff-final-round/|date=9 September 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideal Clothiers Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Wellingborough]], [[Northamptonshire]].  The ground was constructed by Ideal Clothiers, a clothes making company based in Wellingborough.  The first and only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match on the ground was in 1929, when [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] played [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2227_f.html First-Class Matches played on Ideal Clothiers Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground fell out of use in the 1970s.

The '''javelin throw''' is a [[track and field]] event where the [[Javelin (weapon)|javelin]], a [[spear]] about {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} in length, is thrown. The javelin thrower gains [[momentum]] by running within a predetermined area. Javelin throwing is an event of both the men's [[decathlon]] and the women's [[heptathlon]].

==History==
[[File:Javelin throwers Ancient Greece.png|thumb|A scene depicting javelin throwers and other pentathletes. Originally found on a Panathenaic amphora from Ancient Greece, circa 525 B.C. British Museum.]]
The javelin was part of the [[pentathlon]] of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] beginning in 708&amp;nbsp;BC in two disciplines, distance and target throw.  The javelin was thrown with the aid of a thong, called ''[[Amentum|ankyle]]'' wound around the middle of the shaft. Athletes would hold the javelin by the thong and when the javelin was released this thong unwound giving the javelin a spiraled flight.

Throwing javelin-like poles into targets was revived in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] in the early 1870s. In Sweden, these poles developed into the modern javelin, and throwing them for distance became a common event there and in [[Finland]] in the 1880s. The rules continued to evolve over the next decades; originally, javelins were thrown with no run-up, and holding them by the grip at the center of gravity was not always mandatory. Limited run-ups were introduced in the late 1890s, and soon developed into the modern unlimited run-up.&lt;ref name="jukola"&gt;{{cite book |title=Huippu-urheilun historia |year=1935 |publisher=[[Werner Söderström Osakeyhtiö]] |author=Jukola, Martti |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|435–436}}

Sweden's [[Eric Lemming]], who threw his first world best (49.32 meters) in 1899 and ruled the event from 1902 to 1912, was the first dominant javelin thrower.&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;{{rp|436,441}}&lt;ref name="synty"&gt;{{cite book |title=Urheilulajien synty |author1=Kanerva, Juha |author2=Tikander, Vesa |isbn=9789518513455 |publisher=Teos |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|478}} When the men's javelin was introduced as an Olympic discipline at the [[Athletics at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Intercalated Games]], Lemming won by almost nine metres and broke his own world record; Sweden swept the first four places, as Finland's best throwers were absent and the event had yet to become popular in any other country.&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;{{rp|437}} Though challenged by younger talents, Lemming repeated as Olympic champion in 1908 and 1912; his eventual best mark (62.32&amp;nbsp;m, thrown after the 1912 Olympics) was the first javelin world record to be officially ratified by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]].&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;{{rp|436–441}}&lt;ref name=iaaf&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th century, most javelin competitions were two-handed; the implement was thrown with the right hand and separately with the left hand, and the best marks for each hand were added together. Competitions for the better hand only were less common, though not unknown.&lt;ref name="synty" /&gt; At the Olympics a both-hands contest was held only once, in [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's two handed javelin throw|1912]]; Finland swept the medals, ahead of Lemming.&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;{{rp|441}} After that, this version of the javelin rapidly faded into obscurity, together with similar variations of the shot and the discus; Sweden's [[Yngve Häckner]], with his total of 114.28&amp;nbsp;m from 1917, was the last official both-hands world record holder.&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182341/http://www.fcatletisme.cat/Ctecnic/documentacio/modelstecnics/12_JAVELINA_2011.pdf |archivedate= 2 April 2015 |url=http://www.fcatletisme.cat/Ctecnic/documentacio/modelstecnics/12_JAVELINA_2011.pdf |title=Part III: Llançaments - Tema 12 Javelina |author=Vélez Blasco, Miguel |language=Catalan |publisher=Institut Nacional d'Educació Física de Catalunya / Federació Catalana d'Atletisme |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early variant was the freestyle javelin, in which holding the javelin by the grip at the center of gravity was not mandatory; such a [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's freestyle javelin throw|freestyle competition]] was held at the 1908 Olympics, but was dropped from the program after that.&lt;ref name="synty"/&gt;{{rp|478}} Hungary's [[Mór Kóczán]] used a freestyle end grip to break the 60-meter barrier in 1911, a year before Lemming and [[Julius Saaristo]] first did so with a regular grip.&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;{{rp|440}}&lt;ref name="wrp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaaf-ebooks.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/Progression-of-IAAF-World-Records-2015/projet/IAAF-WRPB-2015.pdf |title=IAAF World Records Progression |edition=2015 |author1=Hymans, Richard |author2=Matrahazi, Imre |publisher=[[International Association of Athletics Federations]] |format=pdf |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}}

The first known women's javelin marks were recorded in Finland in 1909.&lt;ref name="iaaf9427"/&gt; Originally, women threw the same implement as men; a lighter, shorter javelin for women was introduced in the 1920s. Women's javelin throw was added to the Olympic program in 1932; [[Babe Didrikson Zaharias|Mildred "Babe" Didrikson]] of the United States became the first champion.&lt;ref name="synty"/&gt;{{rp|479}}

For a long time, javelins were made of solid wood, typically birch, with a steel tip. The hollow, highly aerodynamic Held javelin, invented by American thrower [[Bud Held]] and developed and manufactured by his brother Dick, was introduced in the 1950s; the first Held javelins were also wooden with steel tips, but later models were made entirely of metal.&lt;ref name="synty"/&gt;{{rp|478–479}}&lt;ref name="iaaf9427"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606232418/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid%3D9427.html |url=http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=9427.html |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |publisher=IAAF |title=Javelin Throw - Introduction |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1955/06/06/602157/track |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=6 June 1955 |title=Track: A Salute To The Javelin And Its Practitioners—One Of Whom, Bud Held, Is Showing Those Finns A Thing Or Two |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new javelins flew further, but were also less likely to land neatly point first; as a response to the increasingly frequent flat or ambiguously flat landings, experiments with modified javelins started in the early 1980s. The resulting designs, which made flat landings much less common and reduced the distances thrown, became official for men starting in April 1986 and for women in April 1999, and the world records (then 104.80&amp;nbsp;m by [[Uwe Hohn]], and 80.00&amp;nbsp;m by [[Petra Felke]]) were reset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coachr.org/javrevision.htm |title=Why did the senior javelin specification have to be changed? |author=Bremicher, Erick |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current ({{as of|2017|lc=y}}) men's world record is held by [[Jan Železný]] at 98.48&amp;nbsp;m (1996); [[Barbora Špotáková]] holds the women's world record at 72.28&amp;nbsp;m (2008).

Of the 69 Olympic medals that have been awarded in the men's javelin, 32 have gone to competitors from Norway, Sweden or Finland. Finland is the only nation to have swept the medals at a currently recognized official Olympics, and has done so twice, in 1920 and 1932, in addition to its 1912 sweep in the two-handed javelin; in 1920 Finland swept the first four places, which is no longer possible as only three entrants per country are allowed. Finland has, however, never been nearly as successful in the women's javelin.&lt;ref name="synty"/&gt;{{rp|479}}

The javelin throw has been part of the [[decathlon]] since the decathlon was introduced in the early 1910s; the all-around, an earlier ten-event contest of American origin, did not include the javelin throw. The javelin was also part of some (though not all) of the many early forms of women's pentathlon, and has always been included in the [[heptathlon]] after it replaced the pentathlon in 1981.&lt;ref name="iaafst7"&gt;IAAF Scoring Tables for Combined Events, pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and competitions==
The size, shape, minimum weight, and center of gravity of the javelin are all defined by [[IAAF]] rules. In international competition, men throw a javelin between {{convert|2.6|and|2.7|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|800|g|abbr=on}} in weight, and women throw a javelin between {{convert|2.2|and|2.3|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|600|g|abbr=on}} in weight. The javelin has a grip, about {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} wide, made of cord and located at the javelin's center of gravity ({{convert|0.9|to|1.06|m|abbr=on}} from the javelin tip for the men's javelin and {{convert|0.8|to|0.92|m|abbr=on}} from the javelin tip for the women's javelin).

[[File:Matti Järvinen.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Matti Järvinen (javelin)|Matti Järvinen]] throwing the javelin at the 1932 Olympics]]

Unlike the other throwing events ([[shot put]], [[discus]], and [[Hammer throw|hammer]]), the technique used to throw the javelin is dictated by [[IAAF]] rules and "non-orthodox" techniques are not permitted. The javelin must be held at its grip and thrown overhand, over the athlete's shoulder or upper arm. Further, the athlete is prohibited from turning completely around such that his back faces the direction of throw. In practice, this prevents athletes from attempting to spin and hurl the javelin sidearm in the style of a [[discus throw]].  This rule was put in place when a group of athletes began experimenting with a spin technique referred to as "free style".  On 24 October 1956, [[Pentti Saarikoski (athlete)|Pentti Saarikoski]] threw {{T&amp;Fcalc|99.25}}&lt;ref&gt;Pentti Saarikosk&lt;/ref&gt; using the technique holding the end of the javelin.  Officials were so afraid of the out of control nature of the technique that the practice was banned through these rule specifications.

Instead of being confined to a circle, javelin throwers have a runway {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} wide and at least {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} in length, ending in a curved arc from which their throw will be measured; athletes typically use this distance to gain momentum in a "run-up" to their throw. Like the other throwing events, the competitor may not leave the throwing area (the runway) until after the implement lands. The need to come to a stop behind the throwing arc limits both how close the athlete can come to the line before the release as well as the maximum speed achieved at the time of release.

The javelin is thrown towards a "sector" covering an angle of 28.96 degrees extending outwards from the arc at the end of the runway. A throw is legal only if the tip of the javelin lands within this sector, and the tip strikes the ground before any other part of the javelin. The distance of the throw is measured from the throwing arc to the point where the tip of the javelin landed, rounded down to the nearest centimeter.

Competition rules are similar to other throwing events: a '''round''' consists of one attempt by each competitor in turn, and competitions typically consist of three to six rounds. The competitor with the longest single legal throw (over all rounds) is the winner; in the case of a tie the competitors' second-longest throws are also considered. Competitions involving large numbers of athletes sometimes use a "cut": all competitors compete in the first three rounds, but only athletes who are currently among the top eight or have achieved some minimum distances are permitted to attempt to improve on their distance in additional rounds (typically three).

===Javelin redesigns===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0513-018, Uwe Hohn.jpg|thumb|[[Uwe Hohn]] (pictured in 1984) holds the "eternal world record" with a throw of 104.80 m as a new type of javelin was implemented in 1986.]]
On 1 April 1986, the men's javelin ({{convert|800|g|lbs|sigfig=3|lk=on}}) was redesigned by the governing body (the [[IAAF]] Technical Committee). They decided to change the rules for javelin design because of the increasingly frequent flat landings and the resulting discussions and protests when these attempts were declared valid or invalid by competition judges. The world record had also crept up to a potentially dangerous level, {{convert|104.80|m|abbr=on}} by [[Uwe Hohn]]. With throws exceeding 100 meters, it was becoming difficult to safely stage the competition within the confines of a stadium infield. The javelin was redesigned so that the [[centre of gravity]] was moved {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on}} forward. In addition, the surface area in front of centre of gravity was reduced, while the surface area behind the centre of gravity was increased. This had an effect similar to that produced by the feathers on an arrow. The javelin turns into the [[relative wind]]. This relative wind appears to originate from the ground as the javelin descends, thus the javelin turns to face the ground. As the javelin turns into the wind less lift is generated, reducing the flight distance by around 10% but also causing the javelin to stick in the ground more consistently. In 1999, the women's javelin ({{convert|600|g|lbs|sigfig=3}}) was similarly redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofjavelin.com/posts/physics-javelin-designs-whats-the-significance/|title=Physics: Javelin Designs, what’s the significance?  -  World of Javelin|work=worldofjavelin.com|access-date=27 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160908/http://www.worldofjavelin.com/posts/physics-javelin-designs-whats-the-significance/|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were forbidden at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books. [[Seppo Räty]] had achieved a world record of {{convert|96.96|m|abbr=on}} in 1991 with such a design, but this record was nullified.

===Weight rules by age group===
The weight of the javelin in the [[Under-20 athletics|Under-20]] category is the same as the [[Open class (track and field)|senior]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.athleticsdirect.co.uk/throwing-weight-rules-1/|title=Throwing Weight Rules per Age Group|publisher=athleticsdirect.co.uk|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and training==
Unlike other throwing events, javelin allows the competitor to build speed over a considerable distance. In addition to the core and upper body strength necessary to deliver the implement, javelin throwers benefit from the agility and athleticism typically associated with running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more physical characteristics with sprinters than with others, although they still need the skill of heavier throwing athletes.

Traditional free-weight training is often used by javelin throwers. Metal-rod exercises and resistance band exercises can be used to train a similar action to the javelin throw to increase power and intensity. Without proper strength and flexibility, throwers can become extremely injury prone, especially in the shoulder and elbow. Core stability can help in the transference of physical power and force from the ground through the body to the javelin. Stretching and sprint training are used to enhance the speed of the athlete at the point of release, and subsequently, the speed of the javelin. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 113&amp;nbsp;km/h (70&amp;nbsp;mph).

Due to the fear of liability, the javelin throw is not an event in [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] high school competition in 36 states, though [[USATF]] youth competitions for the same aged athletes do hold javelin competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatf.org/groups/officials/files/resources/field-events/officiating-the-throws-usatf-monograph.pdf | title=The Throwing Officials' Manual | publisher=USA Track &amp; Field | year=2007 | editor-first=George | editor-last=Kleeman | accessdate=1 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At various points in time, high schools have attempted to create substitute events, including the [[softball throw]], football throw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cifss.org/admin/images/history_corner/32footballthrowintrack.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011222630/http://www.cifss.org/admin/images/history_corner/32footballthrowintrack.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[grenade]] throw,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cifss.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/46grenadethrow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; throwing different objects under rules similar to javelin throw rules. In those states that do allow high school javelin competition, a few specify that the tip must be of rubber. Further, in age group track meets in the U.S., and in particular with elementary-school children in the Northeast, the Turbojav—a smaller plastic implement with a rubber tip but with similar flying characteristics as a real javelin—is a popular alternative.

==Culture==
[[File:A mens and womens javelin.png|thumb|right|60px|A women's and a men's javelin]]
Javelin throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins.  One of the recent samples is the €5 Finnish [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2005 coinage|10th IAAF World Championships in Athletics commemorative coin]], minted in 2005 to commemorate the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]]. On the obverse of the coin, a javelin thrower is depicted. On the reverse, legs of hurdle runners with the [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]] tower in the background can be seen.

===Toronto Argonauts===
Hajrullahu became a [[free agent]] on February 9, 2016 and signed with the [[Toronto Argonauts]] that same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argonauts.ca/2016/02/09/argos-sign-canadian-kicker-hajrullhau/ Argos sign Canadian kicker Hajrullahu]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the first player to score points in the first regular-season CFL game at BMO Field on June 23, 2016. Oddly enough, he scored the first CFL points for both a visiting team and the Argonauts. He conceded a [[safety]] to the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]], then later kicked a [[field goal]] for the Argos. Hamilton won the game, 40-23.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/games/2276/hamilton-tiger-cats-vs-toronto-argonauts/ TiCats steal the thunder; take down Argos in BMO Field opener]&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below lists the runners up (''[[jun-yusho]]'') in the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division at official [[sumo]] tournaments or ''[[honbasho]]'' since the six tournaments per year system was instituted in 1958. The runner up is determined by the wrestler with the second highest win-loss score after fifteen bouts, held at a rate of one per day over the duration of the 15-day tournament.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Rules of Sumo: Tournament| publisher=Nihon Sumo Kyokai| url=http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/rules.html#tournament| accessdate=2007-06-05| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601161839/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/rules.html#tournament| archivedate=2007-06-01| df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Names in italics mark a ''jun-yusho'' performance by a ''[[maegashira]]'' or lower ranked wrestler. Figures in brackets mark the number of ''jun-yusho'' earned up to that tournament for wrestlers who were runner up more than once. Those with a P after their name means they  were the runner up after a playoff.

The '''Meadow Lane Stadium''' (usually known simply as '''Meadow Lane''')&lt;ref name="world.nottscountyfc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://world.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10426~2105675,00.html |title=Notts County &amp;#124; Club &amp;#124; Meadow Lane &amp;#124; Meadow Lane&amp;nbsp;— The Home Of Notts County FC |publisher=Nottscountyfc.premiumtv.co.uk |access-date=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]. It is the home ground of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], who have played there since 1910. The stadium was also home to [[Notts County Ladies F.C.]] from 2014 until 2017.

It currently has an all-seated capacity of 19,841 for Football League games. The record attendance is 47,310, who watched Notts lose 1–0 to [[York City]] in the [[FA Cup]] Sixth Round on 12 March 1955.&lt;ref&gt;"Club Records". Notts County official website. Retrieved 2014-04-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Meadow Lane lies just {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=off|spell=in}} away from the [[City Ground]], home of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The two grounds are the closest in [[England]] and the second-closest in the [[United Kingdom]] after the grounds of [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. The Trent End of the City Ground is visible from parts of the [[Jimmy Sirrel]] stand and the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]].

The stadium also hosts the men's and women's football in the [[Varsity Series (Nottingham universities)|Varsity Series]] – a sporting series contested by [[Nottingham Trent University]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].

== History ==

Prior to 1910, Notts County played their home games across the [[River Trent]] at [[Trent Bridge]] as a tenant of [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club]]. [[Cricket]] took priority on the ground and the football club were often forced to play early and late season fixtures at other venues to avoid a clash.&lt;ref&gt;The Official History Notts County Tony Brown {{ISBN|1-874427-61-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Football League]] eventually deemed that this practice was inappropriate and demanded that Notts either seek more favourable terms for the use of Trent Bridge or relocate to a new ground on which they could fulfil all of their fixtures.

In 1910, a plot of land near the cattle market on the opposite side of the River Trent was leased from the city council and a new stadium hastily erected. Part of the new stadium was a temporary stand from Trent Bridge which was literally floated across the river.

On 3 September 1910, County moved to Meadow Lane, the first game was a 1–1 draw with old rivals Nottingham Forest, played in front of {{formatnum:27000}} fans paying receipts of £775.&lt;ref&gt;The Magpies Keith Warsop page 52 {{ISBN|0-86023-214-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 the landlord, Nottingham Corporation, which leased the land to the club, came very close to removing the club from its premises to make way for an abattoir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10426~2155601,00.html nearly an abattoir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924072522/http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10426~2155601,00.html |date=24 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium remained largely the same until 1923 when the [[Sneinton]] Side was replaced with a new stand, named the County Road Stand after the newly constructed road behind it.

Meadow Lane was bombed during [[World War II]] forcing the club to suspend all fixtures during the 1942 season. The northern side of the Main Stand was badly damaged and the pitch left in an unplayable condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottscounty-mad.co.uk/news/loadsngl.asp?cid=ED21 Meadow Lane bombed]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial image showing the proximity of Meadow Lane (top) to the [[City Ground]]]]
The stadium has played host to Forest games on a number of occasions. After the war, when flooding from the River Trent left the City Ground in an unplayable condition and again in 1968 when the Main Stand at the City Ground was destroyed by fire in a game against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

==A new stadium==

During the 1970s and 80s the stadium became increasingly dilapidated. The Meadow Lane End was demolished in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wain|first=Paul|title=Notts County: a pictorial history|date=2004|publisher=Yore Publications|location=Harefield, U.K.|isbn=0-9547830-3-4|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and replaced by a building which housed new dressing rooms, a social club and a variety of other facilities designed to generate more income. There was no stand at this end for several years and Meadow Lane was reduced to a three sided ground. Eventually a small terrace was installed on this side. The [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and [[Hillsborough disaster]] brought the safety of football stadia into the public gaze and eventually the [[Taylor Report]] required that football clubs modernise their grounds. Meadow Lane was subsequently redeveloped during the early 1990s, although the work was planned before the report was issued. The Meadow Lane End, County Road Stand and Spion Kop were all demolished in the 1992 close season and replaced with the ''Family Stand'', the ''[[Jimmy Sirrel]] Stand'' and the ''Spion Kop Stand'' respectively. The Main Stand was replaced during the close season of 1994 by the ''Derek Pavis Stand''.

In June 2002, as part of a sponsorship deal, the ground was briefly renamed the "Aaron Scargill Stadium". However, the ground reverted to its original name when the deal later fell through.&lt;ref name="world.nottscountyfc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2179121.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Magpies sponsor deal collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2002 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meadow Lane today==

The Derek Pavis Stand contains a number of conference and function facilities to complement ''The Broken Wheelbarrow'' bar behind the Family Stand. These host numerous functions throughout the year, ranging from social evenings organised by Notts County's supporter organisations, to wedding receptions and meetings of [[Protestantism|evangelical]] Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracechurchnottingham.org |title=Grace Church Nottingham |publisher=Grace Church Nottingham |date= |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Away supporters are normally restricted to the Jimmy Sirrel stand, at the County Road side. This features a triangular gable (a replica of that on the old County Road stand) with the name of the club and its year of formation. Such gables are also present in the stadia of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].

The Family Stand was renamed The Haydn Green Family Stand in 2007, after the man who saved Notts County from liquidation in 2003, by buying the lease on the ground and investing several million pounds. Haydn Green died suddenly in 2007 leaving an estate which still controls the lease on the ground.

Outside the stadium on Meadow Lane is a bronze statue of [[Jimmy Sirrel]] and coach [[Jack Wheeler (footballer, born 1919)|Jack Wheeler]]. Entitled "Legends of the Lane", the statue was sculpted by Andy Edwards and unveiled on 5 May 2016.

==Rugby Union==

In 2006, it was announced that [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham Rugby]] would play a number of home games at the stadium. It was further announced in May 2006 that Notts County and Nottingham Rugby were negotiating making the agreement permanent. In October 2006 it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Notts County, allowing Nottingham Rugby to play the remainder of their 2006/07 home fixtures at Meadow Lane. In 2014 it was announced that the rugby club would move out of Meadow Lane to play at The Bay, West Bridgford.

==Stands==

For the 2017-18 season, the capacity set by the local authority for football is 19,841.&lt;ref&gt;[http://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/documents/s58996/2017%2006%2023%20NCFC%20report%202017%20final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has a total of 20,211 seats.

'''A. J. Palumbo Center''' is a 4,406-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in the [[Bluff (Pittsburgh)|Uptown]] area of [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] served by exits on both [[Interstate 376]] and [[Interstate 579]]. The arena opened in 1988, and is part of [[Duquesne University]]. It is home to the Duquesne Dukes [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|basketball]], [[volleyball]] and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] programs. The center hosts concerts, boxing, and other special events, and is capable of converting the seating arrangement into a sport, stage, or theatre setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajpalumbo.duq.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225111812/http://www.ajpalumbo.duq.edu/ |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was named in honor of its benefactor, Antonio J. Palumbo, who was elected to the Duquesne University board of directors and, in 1987, received an honorary doctorate of Business and Administration from Duquesne.  Performance Magazine, a concert trade magazine, has consistently ranked the Palumbo Center as one of the top 10 grossing arenas of its size since its opening in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.citysearch.com/profile/11278514/pittsburgh_pa/a_j_palumbo_center.html|title=A J Palumbo Center Pittsburgh|author=|date=|website=Citysearch|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618214425/http://pittsburgh.citysearch.com/profile/11278514/pittsburgh_pa/a_j_palumbo_center.html|archivedate=2007-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
In 2006, the Palumbo Center underwent major renovations. In addition to resurfacing the basketball court, upgrading video monitors, and replacing some seating sections, the facility was updated and renovated to include:
*New men's and women's basketball staff offices
*Recruiting suite
*Video breakdown room
*Strength and conditioning facilities
*Athletic trainer facilities
The center houses the administrative offices for the athletic department and facility management. The center is also open to intramural sports and other recreation groups; however, in 2007, Duquesne University completed a new five-story recreational facility on Forbes Ave. near the A.J. Pablumbo Center, which has now become the primary facility for recreational sports and activities.

After the 2009-2010 basketball season, Duquesne University began major renovations on the Palumbo Center. A new center-hung scoreboard was installed as well as new corner scoreboards. In addition, current bleacher seating on the north end of the arena was replaced with permanent stadium chairs. The University also received $1.8 million in private donations to upgrade the locker rooms for the men's and women's basketball teams and the volleyball team. It will be called the James and Janice Schaming Athletic Center, named after the largest donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10356/1112497-135.stm|title=Duquesne: Another gift will add to Palumbo renovation|author=|date=|website=www.post-gazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Prior to the building of the facility, the men's basketball team played games at various sites around the city, including [[Mellon Arena|Pittsburgh Civic Arena]] (their exclusive home from 1964 to 1988, and used for occasional big games until 2009), [[Fitzgerald Field House]], and [[Duquesne Gardens]], as well as several high school gymnasiums.  The first men's basketball game was played in the arena on December 3, 1988, in which Duquesne defeated St. Joseph's 73-69.  As of January 2008, Duquesne men's basketball had 132-125 (.514) all-time record at the Palumbo Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gwsports.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/012508aab.html|title=Men's Basketball To Face Duquesne Saturday Night in Pittsburgh|author=|date=|website=cstv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is used for most major sports at Duquesne, and has played host to [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] games, [[Women's National Invitation Tournament|WNIT]] games, high school post season championships, national wrestling championships, and [[Atlantic 10]] tournament competitions. During the 1994-95 basketball season, the Palumbo Center was the home of the Continental Basketball Association's Pittsburgh Piranhas. In the team's lone season in Pittsburgh, the Piranhas lost to the Yakima Sun Kings in the 1995 CBA finals.  The new [[CONSOL Energy Center]] is now the home to the annual [[Pitt Panthers]]-Duquesne Dukes [[City Game]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/sports/dukes-blog/6888-qaa-submissions-120209-future-site-of-the-city-game-|title=Q&amp;A submissions 12/02/09 -- Future site of the City Game?|first=Colin|last=Dunlap|date=|website=post-gazette.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110609112355/http://blogs.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/sports/dukes-blog/6888-qaa-submissions-120209-future-site-of-the-city-game-|archivedate=2011-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as basketball games of regional interest, such as a men's game played on December 12, 2010 between the [[West Virginia Mountaineers]] and Duquesne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/sports/dukes-blog?start=5|title=Sports|author=|date=|website=post-gazette.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110117190134/http://blogs.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/sports/dukes-blog?start=5|archivedate=2011-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palumbo Center is also home to the women's volleyball team and hosted the Atlantic 10 Championship in 2012, won by Temple.

For their 2017-18 season and part of the 2018-19 season, the arena will serve as the home of the [[2017–18 Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball team|Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball team]] for four games while the new UPMC Events Center is constructed on campus.

'''Panathinaikos New Stadium''' is a proposed football stadium with an additional multi-use sports complex in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], that will host all departments of the [[Panathinaikos]] sports club. The complex will be located in the historic [[Votanikos]] area, west of downtown Athens. The whole project includes the football stadium (seating 52,000), a basketball arena (8,000), a volleyball stadium (3,000), swimming pool, gymnastic facilities etc.

The Votanikos area  is a bit rubbish zone that has been in decline for several decades.{{lopsided|date=October 2018}} It currently houses mostly vacant, dilapidated storage and industrial facilities and has been in urgent need of redevelopment and improvements in infrastructure.

The football stadium was to be ready for the 100 years of the club in 2008, with the rest of the complex completed by 2011.

As of October 2013 and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]] were cancelled. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.

The '''Paraguayan Basketball Federation''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Confederación Paraguaya de Básquetbol'') is the governing body of [[basketball]] in [[Paraguay]]. The PBF organizes both the [[Paraguayan National Basketball League|National League]] (for teams outside of [[Asunción]]) and the [[Paraguayan Metropolitan Basketball League|Metropolitan League]] (only for teams from Asunción), and runs the [[Paraguay national basketball team]].

==History==
In 1936, no governing body of basketball existed in Paraguay, so basketball was part of the ''Paraguayan Sports Association'' until 1947, the year in which the Paraguayan Basketball Federation was founded. That same year, it joined the [[International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA).

The '''National Olympic Stadium''' ({{lang-km|ពហុកីឡាដ្ឋានជាតិអូឡាំពិក}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]]. It has a capacity of 50,000. Despite its name, the stadium has never hosted an [[Olympic Games]].

==History==
[[File:PP Olympic Stadium - Tennis courts.jpg|thumbnail|Tennis courts at the Olympic Stadium]]
Construction on the National Sports Complex started in 1963 and was completed in 1964.&lt;ref name = "ka-tours"&gt;[http://www.ka-tours.org/ Khmer Architecture Tours], retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; Designer [[Vann Molyvann]] made use of massive [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]]s to create the stadium, digging up 500,000 cubic meters of earth to shape the grounds.&lt;ref name = "Deconstructing"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IJ27Ae02.html Deconstructing Cambodia's modernist heritage], Asia Times Online; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium might have been built to host the [[1963 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games]], but the games were cancelled due to political problems in Cambodia. There was also the short-lived [[GANEFO]] games, that were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in November 25~December 6, 1966 and were named 'First Asian GANEFO'.  The stadium did play host to appearances by visiting dignitaries and state occasions, and was the home of Cambodia's national athletics teams.&lt;ref name = "ka-tours"/&gt;

The stadium played a small part in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] when [[Korea DPR national football team|North Korea]] faced [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] in a qualifier as the two remaining Asia/Oceania zone teams.&lt;ref&gt;South Korea had been forced to withdraw due to logistical issues after the matches were moved from Japan, and South Africa, who had been moved to the zone, were disqualified after being suspended by FIFA due to apartheid.&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[North Korea]] lacked diplomatic relations with most countries and did not have a suitable venue at the time, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult until Head of State [[Norodom Sihanouk]], an ally of [[Kim Il-sung]], said the matches could be held in Phnom Penh.

The matches attracted 60,000 and 40,000 fans, with Sihounouk decreeing half would cheer for Australia, while the other half cheered the Koreans.  The matches were held on 21 November 1965 and on 24 November 1965, with North Korea winning both (6–1 and 3–1). Because all African teams had withdrawn in protest against FIFA, North Korea automatically qualified for the final tournament, where they reached the quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gluckman.com/NKFootball.html The greatest story never told], Ron Gluckman; retrieved 2008-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1966/wc66qualification.html 1966 Qualifying Competition], Planet World Cup; retrieved 2007-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the facilities are [[Olympic size swimming pool|Olympic-size pools]] for swimming and diving&lt;ref name = "ka-tours"/&gt; and an indoor volleyball court with a capacity of up to 8,000, now known as the Olympic Stadium Indoor Arena. The diving boards and swimming pools were restored in 2017 after years of disuse, and are now enjoyed daily by the general public.

During the [[Khmer Rouge]] era, the stadium was used as an execution site where officials of the [[Khmer Republic]] formerly led by [[Lon Nol]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garella.com/rich/camnotes.htm Notes from Cambodia], Rich Garella; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades following the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium facilities fell into disrepair. In 2000, the stadium complex was redeveloped by a Taiwanese firm, the Yuanta Group, which refurbished the stadium but also redeveloped parcels of the complex into condominiums and commercial properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambodiapolitic.org/disposals_of_state_properties.htm Illegal disposals of state property] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031201405/http://www.cambodiapolitic.org/disposals_of_state_properties.htm |date=2007-10-31 }}, CambodiaPolitic.org; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Building"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/27/arts/cambarch.php Building Phnom Penh: An Angkorian heritage], Robert Turnbull, ''International Herald Tribune''; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has come to be a popular attraction for Phnom Penh residents, who attend daily exercise sessions, as well as football games and other activities.

In May 2007, the Irish singer [[Ronan Keating]] performed in concert in the stadium's Indoor Arena, the first concert by a major international act in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://detailsaresketchy.wordpress.com/2007/05/05/ronan-keating-does-cambodia/ Ronan Keating does Cambodia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520082004/http://detailsaresketchy.wordpress.com/2007/05/05/ronan-keating-does-cambodia/ |date=2007-05-20 }}, Details are Sketchy; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/04/23/ronan_keating_to_perform_in_cambodia Ronan Keating to perform in Cambodia], Starpulse; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

In November–December 2007, the [[World Organization Volleyball for Disabled]] held its world cup in the stadium's Indoor Arena, the first major international sporting event in Cambodia in more than 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1678686,00.html Prosthetic Prowess], ''Time''; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=102873 Disabled world cup volleyball kicks off in Cambodia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005230601/http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=102873 |date=2008-10-05 }}, Agence France Presse, via ''Inquirer''; retrieved 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodia, seeded fourth in the world, finished third.

In 2010, the stadium hosted all the football matches for the Cambodian Premier League, known for sponsorship purposes as the Metfone C-League.

The [[2023 Southeast Asian Games]] will not be held at the Olympic Stadium, but at a new stadium under construction in another part of Phnom Penh, to be known as the [[Morodok Techo National Sports Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2012082458250/Sport/pp-sports-complex-plans-laid-bare.html |title=Phnom Penh sports complex plans laid bare |author=Yeun Ponlok and Ung Chamroeun |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=Phnom Penh post |accessdate=24 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826144301/http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2012082458250/Sport/pp-sports-complex-plans-laid-bare.html |archivedate=August 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

By far the most important category of the semi-closed openings are the ''Indian systems'', which begin 1.d4 Nf6.
As these defenses have much in common and have a great deal more theory than all the remaining semi-closed openings put together, they are treated in a separate article; see [[Indian defence|Indian defense]] for details.

The third most common response to 1.d4 (after 1...Nf6 and 1...d5) is 1...e6. This move is sometimes used by players wishing to play the [[Dutch Defense]] (1.d4 f5) without allowing White the option of 2.e4!?, the [[Staunton Gambit]]. 1...e6 rarely has independent significance, usually transposing to another opening, e.g. the aforementioned [[Dutch Defense]] (2.c4 f5 or 2.Nf3 f5), [[French Defense]] (2.e4 d5), or [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] (2.c4 d5). Another possibility is 2.c4 Bb4+, the [[Keres Defence]] (also known as the Kangaroo Defence), which is fully playable, but also little independent significance, since it often transposes into the Dutch, [[Nimzo-Indian Defence|Nimzo-Indian]], or [[Bogo-Indian Defence|Bogo-Indian]].

Other important responses to 1.d4 include the Dutch (1...f5) and the [[Benoni Defense]] (1...c5). The Dutch, an aggressive defense adopted for a time by World Champions [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]] and [[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]], and played by both Botvinnik and challenger [[David Bronstein]] in their 1951 [[World Chess Championship|world championship match]], is still played occasionally at the top level by [[Nigel Short|Short]] and others. The [[Benoni Defense]] is also fairly common, and may become very wild if it develops into the [[Modern Benoni]], though other variations are more solid.

1...d6 is reasonable, and may transpose to the [[King's Indian Defense]] (e.g. after 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4 Bg7 4.Nc3 d6), [[Grünfeld Defence]] (e.g. after 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4 Bg7 4.Nc3 d5), [[Old Indian Defense]] (e.g. after 2.Nf3 Nbd7 3.c4 e5 4.Nc3 Be7), [[Pirc Defense]] (2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6), or even [[Philidor's Defense]] (e.g. 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 e5). The [[Wade Defence]], a slightly offbeat but fully playable line, arises after 1...d6 2.Nf3 Bg4. Note that the plausible 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5?! dxe5 4.Qxd8+ Kxd8 scores less than 50% for White.

The remaining semi-closed openings are uncommon. The [[Polish Defense]] has never been very popular but has been tried by [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojević|Ljubojević]], and [[István Csom|Csom]], among others. The [[Queen's Knight Defense]] is an uncommon opening that often transposes to the [[Nimzowitsch Defence]] after 1.d4 Nc6 2.e4 or the [[Chigorin Defense]] after 2.c4 d5, although it can lead to unique lines, for example after 1.d4 Nc6 2.d5 or 2.c4 e5. The [[Englund Gambit]] is a rare and dubious [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]].

'''Shymbulak''' ({{lang-kk|'''S'ymbulaq'''}}, ''Шымбұлақ''), also known as '''Chimbulak''' ({{lang-ru|Чимбулак}}) is a [[ski resort]] near [[Almaty]]. It is the largest ski resort in Central Asia. It is located in the upper part of the Medeu Valley in the [[Zaiilisky Alatau]] mountain range, at an elevation of {{convert|2200|m|ft|-2}} above sea level. The resort area is about {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} south of [[Almaty]] city by [[Medeo]] road.  It is popular for its mild climate, large quantity of sunny days and great amount of snow through the winter (from November till May).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welovealmaty.com/shymbulak-ski-resort-almaty.html Symbulak Ski Resort]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Shymbulak (also known as "Chimbulak") was disscovered by amateur skiers in the 1940s. Soon after, it became the first downhill route in the Soviet Union. Skiers originally needed to climb up the mountain tops on foot (which took roughly 3 hours). In 1954 a 1500 meters ski tow was built. Starting from 1961, Shymbulak hosted several USSR Championships and the Silver Edelweisse prize skiing competitions. In 1983 it became the Olympic ski training center for the USSR. During this time, various commodities were built including restaurants and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kazakhstandiscovery.com/history-of-shymbulak.html History of Shymbulak ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The annual "Artyemenko" Prize competition has been held in Shymbulak since 2011. The competition is held on February. Almaty hosted the [[2011 Asian Winter Games]], bid for [[2014 Winter Olympics]], considered a bid for [[2018 Winter Olympics]], but decided to bid for [[2022 Winter Olympics]] instead; Shymbulak was a venue for the Alpine Skiing events (both speed and technical), and would have been for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/winter_olympic_bids/1216133778.html Almaty Considers 2018 Winter Games bid]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Ski area information ==
[[Image:Shimbulak1.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Shymbulak Ski Area]]
[[File:Shymbulak, Medeu District.jpg|thumb|Shymbulak in summer.]]
The Shymbylak ski resort is located in the upper part of the Medeu Valley in the Zaiilisky Alatau mountain range, 25km from Almaty. The resort can be reach by Gondola cars from Meadeu.

The weather varies from {{convert|20|C|F}} in summer to {{convert|−7|C|F}} in winter and the snow base is about {{convert|1.5|to(-)|1.8|m|in|round=5}}.The average snowfall is around 1.5 m. The duration of the ski season is from November to April.

The ski areas span over 3000 ft of vertical drop (920m) and nearly 7.5 miles (12km) of ski runs. There are three ski lifts at the resort with the highest going to 3200 meters above sea  level. There is also a Hotel located at the Resort, enabling those wishing to ski during the day, have a place to stay at night.

It is popular for its mild climate, large quantity of sunny days and great amount of snow through the winter (from November till May). 
The resort offers a ski and snowboard school.  There is also ''Shymbulak'' hotel (4 stars) and [[ski]], [[snowboard]] and [[sleigh]] rentals.

There are three [[ski lift]]s, which cumulatively reach Talgar pass ({{convert|3200|m|ft|-2|disp=sqbr}} above the sea level), the highest point of the ski resort.  The total length of the lifts is {{convert|3620|m|ft|-1}}.  There are 3 stations of them; the first one is ''Intersection'' Station ({{convert|2260|m|ft|-1|disp=sqbr}} above the sea level) (9 minute trip), then ''20th Prop'' Station ({{convert|2630|m|ft|-1|disp=sqbr}} above the sea level) (16.5 minutes) and ''Talgar pass'' Station ({{convert|3200|m|ft|-2|disp=sqbr}} above the sea level).  There is also ''Snow-Park'' for the fans of [[snowboarding]].

'''Wielka Krokiew''' (''The Great Krokiew'', in [[Polish language|Polish]] ''krokiew'' means ''rafter'') is the one - the biggest - of ski jumps built on the slope of Krokiew mountain (1378 m) in [[Zakopane]], [[Poland]]. It was opened in 1925. 
From 1989 the ski jump bears the official name '''Wielka Krokiew im. [[Stanislaw Marusarz|Stanisława Marusarza]]'''.
It is a regular venue in the [[Fédération Internationale de Ski|FIS]] [[Ski jumping World Cup]]. The capacity of the ski jumping stadium is 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumzone.weebly.com/|title=StadiumZone|website=StadiumZone|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wielka Krokiew 2014.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Wielka Krokiew in 2014]]

The hill was featured in competitions at the [[1939 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships|1939]] and [[1962 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] as well as the 2001 [[Universiade]].

In 1997, [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]], while visiting his native country, celebrated a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] at the hill's stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_06061997_en.html|title=Zakopane - Beatifications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, due to the success of Polish jumper [[Adam Małysz]], Wielka Krokiew has seen some of the largest audiences in [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|World Cup ski jumping]].

'''Île Lacroix''' (English: ''Lacroix Island'') is an ice hockey arena in [[Rouen]], [[France]], named for the island it sits on. It is a part of the ''Centre Sportif Guy Boissière'' (English: ''Guy Boissière Sport Center''), formerly known as the ''Centre Sportif du Docteur Duchêne'' (English: ''Dr. Duchêne Sport Center''). It is the home arena of the [[Dragons de Rouen]] of the [[Ligue Magnus]].

The Île Lacroix features two [[ice rink]]s—an Olympic-sized rink with over 2700 spectator seats around it, and a smaller, public rink for recreational skating.

The rinks were renovated in 2010, to change the ice-cooling systems over from [[Freon]] to [[R507]], in accordance with EU standards, at a cost of {{currency|2.35 million|EUR|first=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Réparation et préparation|url=http://www.rouenhockeyelite76.com/News306?PHPSESSID%3Da78cae76269ef85f72fba0e36275c6f8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224061057/http://www.rouenhockeyelite76.com/News306?PHPSESSID%3Da78cae76269ef85f72fba0e36275c6f8 |dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 February 2011|accessdate=2 June 2012|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
