[[File:Stirling Engine.jpg|thumb|250px|A desktop gamma Stirling engine. The working fluid in this engine is air. The hot heat exchange is the glass cylinder on the right, and the cold heat exchanger is the finned cylinder on the top. This engine uses a small [[alcohol]] burner (bottom right) as a heat source]]

'''Applications of the [[Stirling engine]]''' range from mechanical propulsion to heating and cooling to electrical generation systems. A Stirling engine is a [[heat engine]] operating by cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas, the "[[working fluid]]", at different temperature levels such that there is a net conversion of [[heat]] to mechanical [[Work (physics)|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stirling Engines |first=Graham |last=Walker |year=1980 |publisher=Clarenden Press |page=1 |quote=A Stirling engine is a mechanical device which operates on a *closed* regenerative thermodynamic cycle, with cyclic compression and expansion of the working fluid at different temperature levels. |isbn=9780198562092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=William R. |last=Martini |title=Stirling Engine Design Manual |edition=Second |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830022057_1983022057.pdf |format= 17.9&amp;nbsp;MB PDF |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |year=1983 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling cycle]] heat engine can also be driven in reverse, using a mechanical energy input to drive heat transfer in a reversed direction (i.e. a heat pump, or refrigerator).&lt;ref name="FPSC_CO2"/&gt;

There are several design configurations for Stirling engines that can be built, many of which require rotary or sliding seals, which can introduce difficult tradeoffs between [[friction]]al losses and [[refrigerant]] leakage.  A [[free-piston]] variant of the Stirling engine can be built, which can be completely [[hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]], reducing friction losses and completely eliminating refrigerant leakage.  For example, a Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC) can convert an electrical energy input into a practical heat pump effect,  used for high-efficiency portable refrigerators and freezers.  Conversely, a free-piston electrical generator could be built, converting a heat flow into mechanical energy, and then into electricity.  In both cases, energy is usually converted from/to electrical energy using magnetic fields in a way that avoids compromising the hermetic seal.&lt;ref name="FPSC_CO2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=JingwenLubYut |last2=kaKitamurab |first1=ChunfengSong |title=Study on the COP of free piston Stirling cooler (FPSC) in the anti-sublimation CO2 capture process |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148114005412 |website=Science Direct |accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunpower_AD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunpower Free-Piston Stirling Engine Technology |url=https://sunpowerinc.com/1kw-stirling-engine |publisher=Sunpower Inc |accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical output and propulsion ==

=== Automotive engines ===
It is often claimed that the Stirling engine has too low a power/weight ratio, too high a cost, and too long a starting time for automotive applications. They also have complex and expensive heat exchangers. A Stirling cooler must reject twice as much heat as an [[Otto engine]] or [[Diesel engine]] radiator. The heater must be made of stainless steel, exotic alloy or ceramic to support high heating temperatures needed for high power density, and to contain hydrogen gas that is often used in automotive Stirlings to maximize power. The main difficulties involved in using the Stirling engine in an automotive application are startup time, acceleration response, shutdown time, and weight, not all of which have ready-made solutions.

However, a modified Stirling engine has been introduced that uses concepts taken from a patented internal-combustion engine with a sidewall combustion chamber (US patent 7,387,093) that promises to overcome the deficient power-density and specific-power problems, as well as the slow acceleration-response problem inherent in all Stirling engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Hasci |title=Modified Stirling Engine With Greater Power Density |url= http://www.createthefuturecontest.com/pages/view/entriesdetail.html?entryID=1329 |work=Create the Future Design Contest |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration &amp; SolidWorks |date=14 July 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106155529/http://www.createthefuturecontest.com/pages/view/entriesdetail.html?entryID=1329 |archivedate=6 January 2009 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be possible to use these in co-generation systems that use waste heat from a conventional piston or gas turbine engine's exhaust and use this either to power the ancillaries (e.g.: the alternator) or even as a [[turbo-compound]] system that adds power and torque to the crankshaft.

Automobiles exclusively powered by Stirling engines were developed in test projects by [[NASA]], as well as earlier projects by the [[Ford Motor Company]] using engines provided by [[Philips]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Science: A Stirling Performance |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904117,00.html |journal=Time |date=9 September 1974 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) with several cars equipped with units from Sweden's United Stirling built under a license from Philips. The NASA vehicle test projects were designed by contractors and designated MOD I and MOD II.

NASA's Stirling MOD 1 powered engineering vehicles were built in partnership with the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) and NASA, under contract by AMC's [[AM General]] to develop and demonstrate practical alternatives for standard engines.&lt;ref name="lindsley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindsley |first=E.F. |title=Stirling auto engine&amp;nbsp;‚Äì a lot of progress, but... |journal=Popular Science |volume=222 |issue=1 |date=January 1983 |pages=50‚Äì53 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RN4_jLbVO3YC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Stirling+auto+engine+a+lot+of+progress,+but+Spirit |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Stirling AB's P-40 powered [[AMC Spirit]] was tested extensively for over {{convert|50000|mi|km|0}} and achieved average fuel efficiency up to {{convert|28.5|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://green.autoblog.com/2009/07/08/blast-from-the-past-nasas-stirling-powered-amc-spirit/ |title=Blast from the Past: NASA's Stirling-powered AMC Spirit |first=Jeremy |last=Korzeniewski |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=green.autoblog.com |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1980 4-door liftback [[VAM Lerma]] was also converted to United Stirling P-40 power to demonstrate the Stirling engine to the public and to promote the U.S. government's alternative engine program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Energy technology: proceedings of the Energy Technology Conference, Volume 8 |year=1981 |publisher=Government Institutes |isbn=978-0-86587-008-6 |page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests conducted with the 1979 AMC Spirit, as well as a 1977 [[Opel]] and a 1980 [[AMC Concord]] revealed the Stirling engines "could be developed into an automotive power train for passenger vehicles and that it could produce favorable results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual ASQC Quality Congress &amp; Exposition, Volume 37 |year=1983 |publisher=The ASQC Society |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l6HuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=AMC+Spirit+successful |author=American Society for Quality Control |page=308 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, progress was achieved with equal-power spark-ignition engines since 1977, and the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) requirements that were to be achieved by automobiles sold in the U.S. were being increased.&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans |first=Robert L. |title=Automotive engine alternatives |year=1987 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=9780306425493 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Stirling engine design continued to exhibit a shortfall in fuel efficiency&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; There were also two major drawbacks for consumers using the Stirling engines: first was the time needed to warm up&amp;nbsp;‚Äì because most drivers do not like to wait to start driving; and second was the difficulty in changing the engine's speed&amp;nbsp;‚Äì thus limiting driving flexibility on the road and traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgetts |first=Philip J. |title=Stirring Among the Playthings |year=2010 |publisher=Vantage Press |isbn=978-0-533-16224-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gYlLmSEUqk8C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=AMC+Spirit |page=64 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of auto manufacturers converting their existing facilities and tooling for the [[mass production]] of a completely new design and type of powerplant was also questioned.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt;

The MOD II project in 1986 produced one of the most efficient automotive engines ever made. The engine reached a peak thermal efficiency of 38.5%, compared to a modern spark-ignition gasoline engine, which has a peak efficiency of 20-25%.  The Mod II project replaced the normal spark-ignition engine in a 1985 4-door [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] [[notchback]]. In the 1986 MOD II Design Report (Appendix A) the results showed that highway gas mileage was increased from {{convert|40|to|58|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} and achieved an urban range of {{convert|26|to(-)|33|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} with no change in vehicle gross weight. Startup time in the NASA vehicle was a maximum of 30&amp;nbsp;seconds,while Ford's research vehicle used an internal electric heater to quickly start the engine, giving a start time of only a few seconds.  The high torque output of  the Stirling engine at low speed eliminated the need for a torque converter in the transmission resulting in decreased weight and transmission drivetrain losses negating somewhat the weight disadvantage of the Stirling in auto use.  This resulted in increased efficiencies being mentioned in the test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mechanicalengineering.net/publications/automotive-stirling-engine.pdf |title=Automotive Stirling Engine Mod II Design Report |first=Noel P. |last=Nightingale |date=October 1986 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mac6.ma.psu.edu/stirling/reports/19970012689_1997021349.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908215605/http://mac6.ma.psu.edu/stirling/reports/19970012689_1997021349.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-08 |title=Automotive Stirling Engine Development Project |first=William D. |last=Ernst |first2=Richard K. |last2=Shaltens |date=February 1997 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=2 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiments indicated that the Stirling engine could improve vehicle operational efficiency by ideally detaching the Stirling from direct power demands, eliminating a direct mechanical linkage as used in most current vehicles. Its prime function used in an extended-range [[Hybrid vehicle#Hybrid electric-petroleum vehicles|series electric hybrid vehicle]] would be as a generator providing electricity to drive the electric vehicle traction motors and charging a buffer battery set. In a [[Hybrid vehicle#Petro-hydraulic hybrid|petro-hydraulic hybrid]] the Stirling would perform a similar function as in a petro-electric series-hybrid turning a pump charging a hydraulic buffer tank. Although successful in the MOD 1 and MOD 2 phases of the experiments, cutbacks in funding further research and lack of interest by automakers ended possible commercialization of the Automotive Stirling Engine Program.&lt;ref name="lindsley"/&gt;

=== Electric vehicles ===
Stirling engines as part of a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid electric drive]] system may be able to bypass the design challenges or disadvantages of a non-hybrid Stirling automobile.

In November 2007, a prototype [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid car]] using solid [[biofuel]] and a Stirling engine was announced by the Precer project in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Precer Group | title = Solid Biofuel-Powered Vehicle Technology | url = http://www.precer.com/Files/Precer_Data_Sheet_D.pdf |accessdate = 2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Hampshire Union Leader]] reports that [[Dean Kamen]] has developed a series [[plug-in hybrid]] car using a [[Ford Think]].&lt;ref name="Wickham2008"&gt;{{cite web|first=S.K. |last=Wickham |title=Kamen's Revolt |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?articleId=1b081989-f67b-458e-8e42-913c8568fb36 |publisher=Union Leader |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522195440/http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?articleId=1b081989-f67b-458e-8e42-913c8568fb36 |archivedate=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]], Kamen's technology company in the [[Manchester Millyard]], has demonstrated an electric car, the [[DEKA Revolt]], that can reach approximately {{convert|60|mi}} on a single charge of its [[lithium battery]].&lt;ref name="Wickham2008"/&gt;

=== Aircraft engines ===
Robert McConaghy created the first flying stirling engine powered aircraft in August 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mcconaghy |first=Robert |title=Design of a Stirling Engine for Model Aircraft |journal=IECEC |date=1986 |pages=490‚Äì493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beta type engine weighed 360 grams, and produced only 20 Watts of power.&lt;ref name="Stirling airplane model engineer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConaghy|first1=Robert|title=A Hot Aero Engine|journal=Model Engineer|date=Feb 1996|volume=176|issue=4009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The engine was attached to the front of a modified Super Malibu radio control glider with a gross takeoff weight of 1&amp;nbsp;kg.  The best published test flight lasted 6 minutes and exhibited "barely enough power to make the occasional gentle turn and maintain altitude".&lt;ref name="Stirling airplane model engineer"/&gt;

=== Marine engines ===
The Stirling engine could be well suited for underwater power systems where electrical work or mechanical power is required on an intermittent or continuous level.  [[General Motors]] have undertaken a considerable amount of work on advanced Stirling cycle engines which include thermal storage for underwater applications. United Stirling, in [[Malm√∂|Malm√∂, Sweden]], are developing an experimental four‚Äìcylinder engine using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in underwater power systems. The SAGA (Submarine Assistance Great Autonomy) submarine became operational in the 1990s and is driven by two Stirling engines supplied with [[diesel fuel]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. This system also has potential for surface-ship propulsion, as the engine's size is less of a concern, and placing the radiator section in seawater rather than open air (as a land-based engine would be) allows for it to be smaller.

Swedish shipbuilder [[Kockums]] has built 8 successful Stirling powered submarines since the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | title = The Kockums Stirling AIP system&amp;nbsp;‚Äì proven in operational service | publisher = Kockums | url = http://www.sesusa.org/submarine.pdf | accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kockums"&gt;Kockums (a)&lt;/ref&gt; They carry compressed oxygen to allow fuel combustion submerged, providing heat for the Stirling engine. They are currently used on submarines of the [[Gotland class submarine|''Gotland'']] and [[S√∂dermanland class submarine|''S√∂dermanland'']] classes. They are the first submarines in the world to feature Stirling [[air-independent propulsion]] (AIP), which extends their underwater endurance from a few days to several weeks.&lt;ref name="Kockums" /&gt;

This capability has previously only been available with [[Submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]]s.

The Kockums engine also powers the Japanese [[S≈çry≈´ class submarine|''S≈çry≈´''-class]] submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065926751&amp;pu=1&amp;rd=janes_com|title=First Improved Oyashio-class boat takes to the water|date=June 12, 2007|publisher=IHS|accessdate=June 3, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110607184930/http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065926751&amp;pu=1&amp;rd=janes_com| archivedate= 7 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pump engines ===

Stirling engines can power pumps to move fluids like water, air and gasses.  For instance the ST-5 from Stirling Technology Inc. power output of {{convert|5 |hp}} that can run a 3&amp;nbsp;kW generator or a centrifugal water pump.&lt;ref name="ST-5"&gt;

== Electrical power generation ==

=== Combined heat and power ===
In a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power]] (CHP) system, mechanical or electrical power is generated in the usual way, however, the waste heat given off by the engine is used to supply a secondary heating application. This can be virtually anything that uses low temperature heat. It is often a pre-existing energy use, such as commercial space heating, residential water heating, or an industrial process.

[[Thermal power station]]s on the [[electric grid]] use fuel to produce [[electricity]]. However, there are large quantities of waste heat produced which often go unused. In other situations, high-grade fuel is burned at high temperature for a low temperature application. According to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], a heat engine can generate power from this temperature difference. In a CHP system, the high temperature primary heat enters the Stirling engine heater, then some of the energy is converted to mechanical power in the engine, and the rest passes through to the cooler, where it exits at a low temperature. The "waste" heat actually comes from engine's main ''cooler'', and possibly from other sources such as the exhaust of the burner, if there is one.

The power produced by the engine can be used to run an industrial or agricultural process, which in turn creates biomass waste refuse that can be used as free fuel for the engine, thus reducing waste removal costs. The overall process can be efficient and cost effective.

Inspirit Energy, a UK-based company have a gas fired CHP unit called the Inspirit Charger which is on sale in 2016. The floor standing unit generates 3&amp;nbsp;kW of electrical and 15&amp;nbsp;kW of thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspirit-energy.com/product-detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127055318/http://inspirit-energy.com/product-detail.html |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidermedia.com/publications/yorkshire-business-insider/yorkshire-business-insider-december-2015/in-the-spirit-of-innovation&lt;/ref&gt;

WhisperGen, a [[New Zealand]] firm with offices in [[Christchurch]], has developed an "AC Micro Combined Heat and Power" Stirling cycle engine. These [[microCHP]] units are gas-fired central heating boilers which sell unused power back into the [[electricity grid]]. WhisperGen announced in 2004 that they were producing 80,000&amp;nbsp;units for the residential market in the [[United Kingdom]]. A 20&amp;nbsp;unit trial in Germany was conducted in 2006.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/what-is-microgeneration.html |title=What is Microgeneration? And what is the most cost effective in terms of CO2 reduction |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar power generation ===
[[File:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Dish Stirling]] from SES]]
Placed at the focus of a parabolic mirror, a Stirling engine can convert [[solar power|solar energy]] to electricity with an efficiency better than non-concentrated [[photovoltaic cells]], and comparable to [[concentrated photovoltaics]]. On August 11, 2005, [[Southern California Edison]] announced an agreement with [[Stirling Energy Systems]] (SES) to purchase electricity created using over 30,000 Solar Powered Stirling Engines over a twenty-year period sufficient to generate 850&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity. These systems, on an 8,000&amp;nbsp;acre (19&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) solar farm will use mirrors to direct and concentrate sunlight onto the engines which will in turn drive generators. "In January, 2010, four months after breaking ground, Stirling Energy partner company Tessara Solar completed the 1.5 MW [[Maricopa Solar]] power plant in [[Peoria, Arizona]], just outside Phoenix.

=== Nuclear power ===
There is a potential for nuclear-powered Stirling engines in electric power generation plants. Replacing the steam turbines of nuclear power plants with Stirling engines might simplify the plant, yield greater efficiency, and reduce the radioactive byproducts. A number of breeder reactor designs use liquid sodium as coolant. If the heat is to be employed in a steam plant, a water/sodium heat exchanger is required, which raises some concern as sodium reacts violently with water. A Stirling engine eliminates the need for water anywhere in the cycle. This would have advantages for nuclear installations in dry regions.

United States government labs have developed a modern Stirling engine design known as the [[Stirling Radioisotope Generator]] for use in space exploration. It is designed to generate electricity for deep space probes on missions lasting decades. The engine uses a single displacer to reduce moving parts and uses high energy acoustics to transfer energy. The heat source is a dry solid nuclear fuel slug, and the heat sink is radiation into free space itself.

== Heating and cooling ==
{{anchor|Heating and cooling}}
If supplied with mechanical power, a Stirling engine can function in reverse as a [[heat pump]] for heating or cooling.  In the late 1930s, the Philips Corporation of the Netherlands successfully utilized the Stirling cycle in cryogenic applications.&lt;ref name=Hargreaves63&gt;{{Cite book | author = C.M. Hargreaves | title = The Philips Stirling Engine | publisher=Elsevier Science | year = 1991 | isbn=0-444-88463-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have been performed using wind power driving a [[Stirling cycle]] heat pump for domestic heating and air conditioning.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Stirling cryocoolers ===
Any Stirling engine will also work ''in reverse'' as a [[heat pump]]: when mechanical energy is applied to the shaft, a temperature difference appears between the reservoirs. The essential mechanical components of a Stirling cryocooler are identical to a Stirling engine. In both the engine and the heat pump, heat flows from the expansion space to the compression space; however, input work is required in order for heat to flow "uphill" against a thermal gradient, specifically when the compression space is hotter than the expansion space. The external side of the expansion-space heat exchanger may be placed inside a thermally insulated compartment such as a vacuum flask. Heat is in effect pumped out of this compartment, through the working gas of the cryocooler and into the compression space. The compression space will be above ambient temperature, and so heat will flow out into the environment.

One of their modern uses is in [[cryogenics]] and, to a lesser extent, [[refrigeration]]. At typical refrigeration temperatures, Stirling coolers are generally not economically competitive with the less expensive mainstream [[Rankine cycle|Rankine]] cooling systems, because they are less energy-efficient. However, below about ‚àí40...‚àí30&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, Rankine cooling is not effective because there are no suitable refrigerants with boiling points this low. Stirling cryocoolers are able to "lift" heat down to ‚àí200&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (73 K), which is sufficient to liquefy [[air]] (specifically the primary constituent gases [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]]). They can go as low as 40‚Äì60 K for single-stage machines, depending on the particular design. Two-stage Stirling cryocoolers can reach temperatures of 20 K, sufficient to liquify hydrogen and neon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stirling Cycle |url=http://www.stirlingcryogenics.com/~uploads/list/Stirling%20Cycle%20English.pdf |website=Stirling Cryogenics |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703060608/http://www.stirlingcryogenics.com/~uploads/list/Stirling%20Cycle%20English.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cryocoolers for this purpose are more or less competitive with other cryocooler technologies. The [[coefficient of performance]] at cryogenic temperatures is typically 0.04‚Äì0.05 (corresponding to a 4‚Äì5% efficiency). Empirically, the devices show a linear trend, typically with the {{nowrap|[[coefficient of performance|COP]] {{=}} 0.0015 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;‚àí 0.065}}, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the cryogenic temperature. At these temperatures, solid materials have lower specific heat values, so the regenerator must be made from unexpected materials, such as [[cotton]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The first Stirling-cycle cryocooler was developed at [[Philips]] in the 1950s and commercialized in such places as [[liquid air]] production plants. The Philips Cryogenics business evolved until it was split off in 1990 to form the Stirling Cryogenics BV, The Netherlands. This company is still active in the development and manufacturing of Stirling cryocoolers and cryogenic cooling systems.

A wide variety of smaller Stirling cryocoolers are commercially available for tasks such as the cooling of electronic [[sensors]] and sometimes [[microprocessors]]. For this application, Stirling cryocoolers are the highest-performance technology available, due to their ability to lift heat efficiently at very low temperatures. They are silent, vibration-free, can be scaled down to small sizes, and have very high reliability and low maintenance. As of 2009, cryocoolers were considered to be the only widely deployed commercially successful Stirling devices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Heat pumps ===
A Stirling [[heat pump]] is very similar to a Stirling cryocooler, the main difference being that it usually operates at room temperature. At present, its principal application is to pump heat from the outside of a building to the inside, thus heating it at lowered energy costs.

As with any other Stirling device, heat flow is from the expansion space to the compression space.  However, in contrast to the Stirling ''engine'', the expansion space is at a ''lower'' temperature than the compression space, so instead of producing work, an ''input'' of mechanical work is required by the system (in order to satisfy the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]).  The mechanical energy input can be supplied by an electrical motor, or an internal combustion engine, for example.  When the mechanical work for the heat pump is provided by a second Stirling engine, then the overall system is called a "heat-driven heatpump".

The expansion side of the heat pump is thermally coupled to the heat source, which is often the external environment. The compression side of the Stirling device is placed in the environment to be heated, for example a building, and heat is "pumped" into it. Typically there will be [[thermal insulation]] between the two sides so there will be a temperature rise inside the insulated space.

Heat pumps are by far the most energy-efficient types of heating systems, since they "harvest" additional heat from the environment, rather than turning all their input energy directly into heat.  In accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, heat pumps always require the ''additional input'' of some external energy to "pump" the collected heat "uphill" against a temperature differential.

Compared to conventional heat pumps, Stirling heat pumps often have a higher [[coefficient of performance]]{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} . To date, Stirling systems have seen limited commercial use; however, use is expected to increase along with market demand for energy conservation, and adoption will likely be accelerated by technological refinements.

=== Portable refrigeration ===
The Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC) is a completely sealed heat transfer system that has only two moving parts (a piston and a displacer), and which can use [[helium]] as the [[working fluid]].  The piston is typically driven by an oscillating magnetic field that is the source of the power needed to drive the refrigeration cycle.  The magnetic drive allows the piston to be driven without requiring any seals, gaskets, [[O-ring]]s, or other compromises to the [[hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]] system.&lt;ref name=TwinbirdFAQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Twinbird Company|title=Welcome to the Dr. Cool's FAQ Room !|url=http://fpsc.twinbird.jp/legacy/en/faq_e.html|publisher=Twinbird Company|accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed advantages for the system include improved efficiency and cooling capacity, lighter weight, smaller size and better controllability.&lt;ref name=TwinbirdAbout&gt;{{cite web|last=Twinbird Company|title=About FPSC|url=http://fpsc.twinbird.jp/legacy/en/about_fpsc_e.html|publisher=Twinbird Company|accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FPSC was invented in 1964 by William Beale (1928-2016), a professor of Mechanical Engineering at [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]].  He founded Sunpower Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stirling Cycle |url=http://www.sunpowerinc.com/services/technology/stirling.php |publisher=Sunpower Inc. |accessdate=2013-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722192657/http://sunpowerinc.com/services/technology/stirling.php |archivedate=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which researches and develops FPSC systems for military, aerospace, industrial, and commercial applications. A FPSC cooler made by Sunpower was used by [[NASA]] to cool instrumentation in [[satellites]].&lt;ref name=SunpowerCryo&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryocoolers|url=http://www.sunpower.com/index.php?pg=79|publisher=Sunpower |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suppliers of FPSC technology include the Twinbird Company of Japan&lt;ref name=TwinbirdAbout/&gt; and Global Cooling NV of the Netherlands, which (like Sunpower) has a research center in Athens, Ohio.&lt;ref name=GlobalAbout&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Cooling NV|title=About|url=http://www.globalcooling.nl/about/|publisher=Global Cooling NV|accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years starting around 2004, the [[Coleman Company]] sold a version of the Twinbird "SC-C925 Portable Freezer Cooler 25L" under its own brand name,&lt;ref name=Lui&gt;{{cite web|last=Lui |first=Chi-Tien |title=2004 Coleman Free Piston Stirling Cooler [photographic teardown] |url=http://www.ctlny.com/stirling-cooler/stirlingcooler.html |publisher=CTL Electronics |accessdate=2011-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826023848/http://www.ctlny.com/stirling-cooler/stirlingcooler.html |archivedate=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman Company |title=Model 5726-750 Instruction Manual (26 Quart Power Cooler) |url=http://www.coleman.com/coleman/images/pdf/5726-750.pdf |publisher=Coleman |accessdate=2011-04-06 |date=2004-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821132011/http://www.coleman.com/coleman/images/pdf/5726-750.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has since discontinued offering the product.

== Low temperature difference engines ==
[[File:MM-7 Stirling Engine.jpg|thumb|A low-temperature-difference Stirling engine, shown here running on the heat from a warm hand]]

A '''low temperature difference''' ('''LTD''', or '''Low Delta T''') Stirling engine will run on any low temperature differential, for example the difference between the palm of a hand and room temperature, or room temperature and an ice cube. A record of only 0.5&amp;nbsp;¬∞C temperature differential was achieved in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Senft |first=James R. |title=An Introduction to Low Temperature Differential Stirling Engines |year=1996 |publisher=Moriya Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually they are designed in a gamma configuration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animatedengines.com/ltdstirling.shtml |title=Low Temperature Differential Stirling Engine |publisher=animatedengines.com |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for simplicity, and without a regenerator, although some have slits in the displacer typically made of foam for partial regeneration. They are typically unpressurized, running at pressure close to 1&amp;nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]. The power produced is less than 1&amp;nbsp;W, and they are intended for demonstration purposes only. They are sold as toys and educational models.

However, larger (typically 1 m square) low temperature engines have been built for pumping water using direct sunlight with minimal or no magnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bsrsolar.com/sv/produkte3_e.html |title=Solar Electrical Generator |publisher=Sunvention International |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic Stirling Heat Engine ===
{{see also|Thermoacoustic hot air engine}}
Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed an "Acoustic Stirling Heat Engine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott |last=Backhaus |first2=Greg |last2=Swift |title= Acoustic Stirling Heat Engine: More Efficient than Other No-Moving-Parts Heat Engines |url= http://www.lanl.gov/mst/engine/ |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |year=2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801212651/http://www.lanl.gov/mst/engine/ |archivedate=1 August 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no moving parts. It converts heat into intense acoustic power which (quoted from given source) "can be used directly in acoustic refrigerators or pulse-tube refrigerators to provide heat-driven refrigeration with no moving parts, or ... to generate electricity via a linear alternator or other electro-acoustic power transducer".

=== MicroCHP ===
[http://www.whispergen-europe.com/ WhisperGen], (bankruptcy 2012&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bhkw-infothek.de/nachrichten/10236/2012-12-03-hersteller-des-whispergen-muss-insolvenz-anmelden/&lt;/ref&gt;) a New Zealand-based company has developed Stirling engines that can be powered by natural gas or diesel. An agreement has been signed with [[Mondrag√≥n Cooperative Corporation|Mondragon Corporaci√≥n Cooperativa]], a Spanish firm, to produce WhisperGen's microCHP (Combined Heat and Power) and make them available for the domestic market in Europe. Some time ago [[E.ON UK]] announced a similar initiative for the UK. Domestic Stirling engines would supply the client with hot water, space heating and a surplus electric power that could be fed back into the electric grid.

Based on the companies' published performance specifications, the off-grid diesel fueled unit produces combined heat (5.5&amp;nbsp;kW heat) and electric (800W electric) output, from a unit being fed 0.75&amp;nbsp;liters of automotive grade diesel fuel per hour. Whispergen units are claimed to operate as a combined co-generation unit reaching as high as ~80% operating efficiency.

However the preliminary results of an Energy Saving Trust review of the performance of the WhisperGen microCHP units suggested that their advantages were marginal at best in most homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Carbon Trust |title=Micro CHP (Combined Heat and Power) Accelerator - Final report |url= http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/micro-chp-accelerator |date=March 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However another author shows that Stirling engine microgeneration is the most cost effective of various microgeneration technologies in terms of reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy1"/&gt;

=== Chip cooling ===
MSI (Taiwan) developed a miniature Stirling engine cooling system for [[Northbridge (computing)|personal computer chips]] that uses the waste heat from the chip to drive a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tweaktown.com/news/9051/msi_employs_stirling_engine_theory/index.html |title=MSI employs Stirling Engine Theory |first=Cameron |last=Wilmot |date=29 February 2008 |publisher=tweaktown.com |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Desalination ===
In all thermal power plants there has to be an exhaust of [[waste heat]]. However, there's no reason that the waste heat cannot be diverted to run stirling engines to pump seawater through [[reverse osmosis]] assemblies except that any additional use of the heat raises the effective heat sink temperature for the thermal power plant resulting in some loss of energy conversion efficiency. In a typical nuclear power plant, two-thirds of the thermal energy produced by the reactor is waste heat. In a stirling assembly the waste heat has potential to be used as an additional source of electricity.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Australites''' are [[tektites]] found in [[Australia]]. They are mostly dark or black, and have shapes including discs and bowls that are not seen in other tektites. [[NASA]] used the shape of "flanged button" australites in designing re-entry modules for the [[Apollo program]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=" museumvictoria"/&gt;

==History==
[[Indigenous Australians]] termed australites ''ooga'' ("staring eyes"), and they were used as sacred objects or as cutting tools.&lt;ref name="Australite Investigations"/&gt; Europeans found out about australites in 1857, when explorer [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] gave naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] a mysteriously shaped piece of natural black glass. Darwin thought that australites were of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin due to their similarity to [[obsidian]], volcanic glass.&lt;ref name=" museumvictoria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Australite Investigations"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" The Scientist and Science Communicator"/&gt; Later, australites were called ''blackfellows' buttons'' and ''obsidian bombs''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

One of the first scientists to seriously study australites was Charles Fenner, who saw his first australite in 1907. He believed that australites were glass [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref name=" Catalog of National Library of Australia "/&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Australite core type.jpg|thumb|right|3 grams 'core-type' aerodynamically shaped Australite, looking like a miniature Apollo capsule.]]Early theories about the source of australites included volcanoes, the [[bushfire]]s that are common in Australia, or fusion of sand by lightning ([[fulgurite]]s). Some scientists believed them to be meteorites, possibly [[lunar meteorite]]s  ejected from the Moon in [[impact crater|impact]]s (now disproved due to the different composition of lunar rocks).&lt;ref name=" museumvictoria"/&gt;

Although different theories about the origin of australites are still circulating, most scientists believe that australites formed during a large asteroid or comet impact on the Earth. The impact ejected myriads of small rocks right out of the atmosphere. The australites acquired their streamlined, aerodynamic forms when they re-entered the Earth's atmosphere while molten and travelling at high velocities.&lt;ref name=" museumvictoria"/&gt;

Most australites are found in Southern Australia, below 25 degrees latitude.&lt;ref name=" Australian museum"/&gt; Based on similar ages &lt;ref name="Ages"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992LPI....23..593I], G.A. Izett, J.D. Obradovich, ''LPSC'' 33 (1992), 593-594&lt;/ref&gt; and compositions,&lt;ref name="compositions"&gt;Blum et al., ''Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta'' 56 (1992), 83-492&lt;/ref&gt; they represent the southern edge of the vast [[Australasian strewnfield|Australasian tektite strewnfield]] that stretches from southern China to Australia. The Australasian strewnfield has an age of 0.8 million years and is the result of an impact in Indochina.

==Shapes==
[[Image:Australite_tektite_shallow_bowl.jpg|thumb|right|A very rare shape of australite tektite - "shallow bowl"]]
The primary forms of australites are sphere, oval, boat, dumbbell and teardrop. Australites are smaller than other tektites and different in shape. Their initial velocity was higher than other tektites: enough to propel them just out of the Earth's atmosphere, so they then re-entered the atmosphere and underwent a rare secondary melting.&lt;ref name=" Australite Shapes "/&gt;

One of the most famous australite shapes is the "flanged button". Flanged buttons are rare, but the most unusual and rarest australites are discs, bowls, plates and other small forms (mini tektites). They are very thin. George Baker called them "flying flanges", the result of distortion of "initially small primary forms by aerodynamic frictional heating". He wrote: {{quote|These are all very special forms of tektites not encountered among the other known tektite-strewn fields of the world, the rarity and unexcelled character of these well-preserved, complete to nearly complete, unique types of tektites cannot be overstressed.&lt;ref name=" Disc-, Plate-, and Bowl-Shaped Australites"/&gt;}} Well preserved shapes are found near [[Port Campbell]] in  western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Chapman and Larson experimented on the [[ablation]] of australites. At first they seemed to prove their [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin, but later in repeated studies they claimed that the australites could not have come from outside the Earth-Moon system. They were able to reproduce the shapes, [[flange]]s and the peculiar network of the rings on the front face in great detail.&lt;ref name="Advances in Geophysics, Volume 10 "/&gt;

A '''barrier pipe''' is a type of [[plastic]] [[water]] pipe used in domestic heating systems. The pipe is manufactured with a barrier that prevents [[oxygen]] from penetrating the material and entering the water system, reducing the risk of [[corrosion]].
The 'barrier' is usually a resin material bonded between the outer and inner layer of the pipe itself. The pipe been either a cross linked [[polyethylene]] or polybutylene.

'''[[Beryllium]] oxide''' ('''BeO'''), also known as '''beryllia''', is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] BeO. This colourless solid is a notable electrical insulator with a higher thermal conductivity than any other non-metal except [[diamond]], and exceeds that of most metals.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[amorphous solid]], beryllium oxide is white. Its high melting point leads to its use as a [[refractory]] material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TKSG6LWIEQC&amp;pg=PA301 |page=301 |author=Raymond Aurelius Higgins |year=2006 |title=Materials for Engineers and Technicians |publisher=Newnes |isbn=0-7506-6850-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in nature as the mineral [[bromellite]]. Historically and in materials science, beryllium oxide was called '''glucina''' or glucinium oxide. Formation of BeO from beryllium and oxygen releases [[Energy density|the highest energy per mass of reactants]] for any chemical reaction, close to 24&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Preparation and chemical properties==
Beryllium oxide can be prepared by calcining (roasting) beryllium carbonate, dehydrating [[beryllium hydroxide]], or igniting metallic beryllium:
:BeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí BeO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí BeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:2 Be + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí 2 BeO
Igniting beryllium in air gives a mixture of BeO and the nitride [[Beryllium nitride|Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt;  Unlike the oxides formed by the other group 2 elements (alkaline earth metals), beryllium oxide is [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] rather than basic.

Beryllium oxide formed at high temperatures (&gt;800&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) is inert, but dissolves easily in hot aqueous [[ammonium bifluoride]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or a solution of hot concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ammonium sulfate]] ((NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Structure==
BeO crystallizes in the hexagonal [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] structure, featuring tetrahedral Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2‚àí&lt;/sup&gt; centres, like [[lonsdaleite]] and w-[[boron nitride|BN]] (with both of which it is [[Isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]]).  In contrast, the oxides of the larger group-2 metals, i.e., [[magnesium oxide|MgO]], [[calcium oxide|CaO]], [[strontium oxide|SrO]], [[barium oxide|BaO]], crystallize in the cubic [[rock salt]] motif with octahedral geometry about the dications and dianions.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt; At high temperature the structure transforms to a tetragonal form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A. F. Wells |year=1984 |title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5 |publisher=Oxford Science Publications |isbn=0-19-855370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vapour phase, beryllium oxide is present as discrete [[diatomic molecule]]s. In the language of [[valence bond theory]], these molecules can be described as adopting &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridisation on both atoms, featuring one [[œÉ bond|œÉ]] (between one &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt; orbital on each atom) and one [[œÄ bond]] (between aligned &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals on each atom oriented perpendicular to the molecular axis). Molecular orbital theory provides a slightly different picture with no &lt;i&gt;net&lt;/i&gt; sigma bonding (because the 2&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of the two atoms combine to form a filled sigma bonding orbital and a filled sigma* anti-bonding orbital) and two pi bonds formed between both pairs of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals oriented perpendicular to the molecular axis. The sigma orbital formed by the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals aligned along the molecular axis is unfilled. The corresponding ground state is ...(2sœÉ)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2sœÉ*)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2pœÄ)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (as in the isoelectronic C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule), where both bonds can be considered as dative bonds from oxygen towards beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Spectroscopy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfM9B3JshegC&amp;pg=PA234 |accessdate=29 November 2011 |publisher=Allied Publishers |isbn=978-81-7023-911-6 |pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
High-quality crystals may be grown [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermally]], or otherwise by the [[Auguste Victor Louis Verneuil|Verneuil method]]. For the most part, beryllium oxide is produced as a white amorphous powder, [[sintered]] into larger shapes. Impurities, like carbon, can give a variety of colours to the otherwise colourless host crystals.

[[Sintered]] beryllium oxide is a very stable [[ceramic]].&lt;ref&gt;G√ºnter Petzow, [[Fritz Aldinger]], Sigurd J√∂nsson, Peter Welge, Vera van Kampen, Thomas Mensing, Thomas Br√ºning"Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_011.pub2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium oxide is used in rocket engines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Beryllium+oxide+is+used+in+rocket+engines&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwituojsqdPXAhUF82MKHX8_Bv0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Beryllium%20oxide%20is%20used%20in%20rocket%20engines&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds |last=Ropp |first=Richard C. |date=2012-12-31 |publisher=Newnes |isbn=9780444595539 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a transparent [[Anti-corrosion|protective over-coating]] on [[Silvering|aluminised]] [[Curved mirror|telescope mirrors]].

Beryllium oxide is used in many high-performance [[semiconductor]] parts for applications such as radio equipment because it has good [[thermal conductivity]] while also being a good electrical insulator. It is used as a filler in some thermal interface materials such as [[thermal grease]].&lt;ref name="apmag"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greg Becker |author2=Chris Lee |author3=Zuchen Lin |title=Thermal conductivity in advanced chips ‚Äî Emerging generation of thermal greases offers advantages |journal=Advanced Packaging |year=2005 |pages=2‚Äì4 |url=http://www.apmag.com/ |accessdate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621233638/http://www.apmag.com/ |archivedate=June 21, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[power semiconductor device]]s have used beryllium oxide ceramic between the [[silicon]] chip and the metal mounting base of the package to achieve a lower value of [[Thermal resistance in electronics|thermal resistance]] than a similar construction of [[aluminium oxide]]. It is also used as a structural [[ceramic]] for high-performance microwave devices, [[vacuum tube]]s, [[magnetron]]s, and [[gas laser]]s. BeO has been proposed as a [[neutron moderator]] for naval marine high-temperature [[gas-cooled reactor]]s (MGCR), as well as NASA's [[Kilopower]] nuclear reactor for space applications.&lt;ref name="KiloPower Reactor Materials Study"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McClure |first1=Patrick |last2=Poston |first2=David |last3=Gibson |first3=Marc |last4=Bowman |first4=Cheryl |last5=Creasy |first5=John |title=KiloPower Space Reactor Concept ‚Äì Reactor Materials Study |date=14 May 2014 |url=http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-14-23402 |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
BeO is [[carcinogen]]ic in powdered form &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/0226.pdf|title=Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet|publisher=New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may cause chronic [[Berylliosis|beryllium disease]]. Once fired into solid form, it is safe to handle if not subjected to machining that generates dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.americanberyllia.com/safety |title=Beryllium Oxide Safety |website=American Beryllia |access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beryllium oxide ceramic is not a hazardous waste under federal law in the USA.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">'''''Black Gate''''' is the name of a brand of audio grade [[electrolytic capacitor]] made in [[Japan]].  They have acquired a reputation for very high quality for use in the signal path, and [[power supplies]], of audio [[electrical network|circuitry]].

The quality of capacitors may vary considerably depending on their construction and the type of insulating materials used. They are also known to deteriorate (or "drift") over time, just like any electrolytic capacitor.

The Black Gate capacitors are considered by some (Audio Note among others) to be the best electrolytic capacitor ever made although they are now discontinued.  They do however, continue to be held in high regard by many high-end Hi-Fi manufacturers; 
Due to dwindling stock and demand, prices have skyrocketed lately.  Many of their capacitors on the market are now fakes or just not available.

Black Gate capacitors base their manufacture on something called 'The Transcendent Electron Transfer' theory. The manufacturer attributes the capacitor's sonic quality to the use of fine [[graphite]] particles used in the separator between its [[anode]] and [[cathode]].  While the manufacturer may claim that graphite(graphite is a conductor not insulator) is used as the dielectric in its capacitors, the truth is the carbon impregnated paper inside the Black Gate capacitors was the cathode, the aluminum foil was the anode and the alumina (aluminum oxide) layer that formed on the surface of the aluminum anode was the dielectric (separator) between the two plates.  Since aluminum oxide has the characteristics well suited for its dielectric duty to insulate the cathode from the anode whilst permitting a relatively high flux environment as the oxide layer formed could be very thin allowing the plates to be very close to each other, thus increasing capacitance.

==Settling-in Period ==
Many [[audiophile]]s believe it can take many hours before the maximum sonic benefits are heard in audio circuits that use Black Gates. This long settling-in procedure is often a controversial issue when auditioning such equipment, as the [[frequency response]] is said to tend to shift around greatly during this period, making the equipment sound different from one audition to another. Once completely 'burnt-in' however, the benefits are said to be heard clearly.  This settling period or burn in period was most likely attributed to the aluminum layer completing its reaction to form a complete and stable oxide layer on its surface once current and voltage are applied to the capacitor in a circuit.

==Production==
The Black Gate production has stopped in 2006, said to be caused by problems between Jelmax Co., Ltd. and [[Rubycon Corporation|Rubycon Corp.]], after 18 years of availability. The capacitors were manufactured by Rubycon under license for Jelmax Co., Ltd. which should close its doors in August 2007, once all their stocks get sold out.

Once the capacitors will become unavailable, or the current stocks become too old to be used due to deterioration, alternatives will have to be found. The Black Gate was very affordable when comparing it to some other similar-performing capacitors, and was easily available.

''' Coal in Europe ''' describes coal as [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] fuel in Europe today. Coal includes [[hard coal]], [[brown coal]], and [[lignite]].

Coal production in Europe is falling, and imports exceed production. There is, however, growing controversy in Europe over the use of coal, as many denounce it for reasons such as health risks and links to [[global warming]].

== Coal supply in the EU ==
[[International Energy Agency]] reports data for EU28 countries since 1990. According to IEA, EU28 countries use of coal as fuel has went from 5,289 TWh in 1990 to 3057 TWh in 2015, a reduction of 42%. During the same period, coal use in the world increased by 73%.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.iea.org/statistics/?country=EU28&amp;year=2015&amp;category=Key%20indicators&amp;indicator=TPESbySource&amp;mode=chart&amp;categoryBrowse=true&amp;dataTable=BALANCES&amp;showDataTable=false EU28 Primary Energy Supply]'', International Energy Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.iea.org/statistics/?country=WORLD&amp;year=2015&amp;category=Emissions&amp;indicator=TPESbySource&amp;mode=chart&amp;categoryBrowse=true&amp;dataTable=BALANCES&amp;showDataTable=false World Primary Energy Supply]'', International Energy Agency&lt;/ref&gt; EU28 use of coal:

=== Coal types ===

Coal includes [[anthracite]], [[bituminous coal]], [[lignite]], and [[peat]]. Coal from fields differ in ash and moisture content, energy value, volatile elements, sulphur content, and other properties.  Anthracite and bituminous coal are relatively high value compared to lignite and peat, which have lower energy and higher moisture contents. Coal is often used in the iron and steel industry, or to produce energy.

== Production and import ==
{{See also|List of countries by coal production|List of European countries by coal production|List of coalfields}}

Russia (365 Mt), Germany (176 Mt) and Poland (131 Mt) are the largest producers of coal in Europe as of 2016. Largest net importer was Germany with 53 Mt, and the largest net exporter was Russia with 147 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2017.pdf#page=18 Key World Energy Statistics 2017]'', International Energy Agency, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Largest electricity production from coal in 2016 were in Germany (284 TWh), Russia (159 TWh) and Poland (133 TWh).&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2017.pdf#page=32 Key World Energy Statistics 2017]'', International Energy Agency, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
In 2009 the new electricity capacity in the [[European Union]] was 25 GW: 10.2 GW from [[wind power]], 6.6 GW from natural gas, 4.2 GW from photovoltage [[solar power]], and 2.4 GW from [[coal power]].&lt;ref name="stat9"&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/statistics/general_stats_2009.pdf Wind in power, 2009 European statistics] February 2010, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;
The total amount of public support for electricity production from coal is around ‚Ç¨10 billion in 2012. Since 1970 this has accumulated to between ‚Ç¨100 and 200 billion. When disregarding subsidies and [[externalities]], coal has the lowest average [[Cost of electricity by source|cost]] in EU. Coal has the highest external cost.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/studies/doc/20141013_subsidies_costs_eu_energy.pdf Subsidies and costs of EU energy.

Coal has been linked to [[acid rain]], smog pollution, [[respiratory diseases]], [[mining accidents]], reduced agricultural yields and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Coal2008&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/cost-of-coal/  The True Cost of Coal] Greenpeace 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of coal downplay these claims and instead advocate the low cost of using coal for energy. Many European countries, such as Italy, have turned to coal as natural gas and oil prices rose.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_EuropeBackToCoal&gt;Rosenthal, Elisabeth [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/europe/23coal.html?pagewanted=all Europe Turns Back to Coal, Raising Climate Fears] 23 April 2008 ''New York Times'' 24 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal technology has also advanced over the years, and emissions of soot and gases released in the burning of coal have been greatly reduced. New [[coal pollution mitigation]] technology, which often refers to [[carbon capture and storage]], is a new and still-developing technology that seeks to capture carbon dioxide from power plants, and prevent it from entering the atmosphere by storing it. Proponents of this approach argue that it can effectively eliminate coal's contributions to climate change, while opponents doubt whether it can be done on a large scale.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_EuropeBackToCoal /&gt;

The Dutch Research Institute CE Delft estimates that the worldwide "external costs", or hidden costs, of coal in 2007 were ‚Ç¨360 billion, excluding the costs of accidents, mining damages, and any loss of [[cultural heritage]] or human rights violations that occur as a result of coal production.&lt;ref name="Coal2008"/&gt; According to IEA the coal based emissions in 1971‚Äì2008 were 303,262 Mt worldwide, 58,210 Mt (19.2%) in OECD Europe, and 5,086 Mt (1.7%) in non-OECD Europe. Europe here excludes European Russia and all the ex-Soviet states. The estimated external costs of coal carbon emissions in 2007 were ‚Ç¨69 billion in OECD Europe and ‚Ç¨6 billion in non-OECD Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/work/2011/statistics/s1_kwes.pdf IEA Key World Energy Statistics 2011] October 2011.

The coal mining industry also has occupational hazards. In the Komi Republic, Russia, at the centre of the mining industry, occupational diseases are five time more prevalent than in the rest of the Russian Federation. [[Mining accident|Accidents]] are also known to happen in coal mines, caused by the liberation of methane from mining.&lt;ref name=Fwatch2010&gt;[http://www.finnwatch.org/images/stories/Kivihiili_EN_web.pdf Coal from the East and the South], Responsibility in energy company coal purchases, [[FinnWatch]] 23 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">The '''Comisi√≥n Nacional de la Energ√≠a''' (in short '''CNE''' and in English National Energy Commission) of [[Spain]] is the [[energy regulator|regulator of energy systems]], created by Law 34/1998 of October 7, the hydrocarbons sector, and developed by Royal Decree 1339/1999 of 31 July, which adopted its regulation.

Its objectives are to ensure [[effective competition]] in energy systems and the objectivity and transparency of its operations for the benefit of all individuals who operate these systems and consumers. For this purpose, energy systems means the [[market power]] and Markets [[hydrocarbon]] s both liquid and gaseous ([[natural gas]], [[oil]]...).

The CNE was closed in 2013 along with the Comisi√≥n del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones (CMT), the Comisi√≥n Nacional de la Competencia (CNC) and the Comisi√≥n Nacional del Sector Postal (CNSP). These bodies were unified in the Comisi√≥n Nacional de los Mercados y de la Competencia (CNMC) in October 2013.

== Organization ==

The National Energy Commission is governed by a Board of Directors, composed of the President, Vice-President, six Directors and a Secretary, with voice but no vote. The President, Vice President and Directors are appointed by the Government of Spain, by Royal Decree on the proposal of Minister of Industry, for a term of six years, which could not be removed and may not be nominated by more than 2 terms (max 12).

The Council's current composition is:
* President: [[Maria Teresa Costa Campi]]
* Vice President: [[Fernando Marti Scharfhausen]]

Directors:
[[Maria del Carmen Fernandez Rozado]]
* [[Jos√© Sierra L√≥pez]]
* [[Pawn Francisco Javier Torre]]
* [[Luis Albentosa Puche]]
* [[Jorge Fabra Utray]]
* [[Jaime Gonz√°lez Gonz√°lez]]
* [[Sebasti√† Ruscalleda i Gallart]]

The president of the CNE, Maria Teresa Costa Campi, was secretary of Industry and Energy of the Generalitat of Catalonia, as well as deputy for Barcelona in the last parliament by the PSC-PSOE.

Past presidents of the CNE were [[Pedro Mero√±o]] (PP) and [[Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez]] (PSOE), and former Chairman was [[Vicente Lopez Ibor Mayor]].

'''Critical ionization velocity''' (CIV), or '''critical velocity''' (CV), is the relative velocity between a neutral [[gas]] and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (an ionized gas), at which the neutral gas will start to [[ionize]]. If more energy is supplied, the velocity of the atoms or molecules will not exceed the critical ionization velocity until the gas becomes almost fully ionized.

The phenomenon was predicted by Swedish engineer and plasma scientist, [[Hannes Alfv√©n]], in connection with his model on the origin of the [[Solar System]] (1942).&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfv√©n "On the cosmogony of the Solar System", in ''Stockholms Observatoriums Annaler'' (1942) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/StoAn/0014//0000042.000.html Part I] [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1942StoAn..14....5A Part II] [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1942StoAn..14....9A Part III]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfv√©n, ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1954QB501.A53......&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c08806 On the Origin of the Solar System]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfv√©n, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1960RvMP...32..710A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c08305 Collision between a nonionized gas and a magnetized plasma], ''Rev. Mod. Phys.''., vol. 32, p. 710, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, no known mechanism was available to explain the phenomenon, but the theory was subsequently demonstrated in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="U.V.

Space Sci''. 144 15&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a [[Lower hybrid oscillation|''lower hybrid'']] plasma [[instability]] is involved in transferring energy from the larger ions to electrons so that they have sufficient energy to ionize. Application of the theory to astronomy through a number of experiments have produced mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;R. Torbert,: "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1988AdSpR...8Q..39T&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c02285 Review of ionospheric CIV experiments]", XXVIIth COSPAR Meet., (1988) Helsinki, Finland, paper XIII.2. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lai, Shu T. 2001 p. 471-506"&gt;Lai, Shu T., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001RvGeo..39..471L&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03435 A review of critical ionization velocity] (2001) ''Reviews of Geophysics'', Volume 39, Issue 4, p. 471-506&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental research==
The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm carried out the first laboratory tests, and found that (a) the relative velocity between a plasma and neutral gas could be increased to the critical velocity, but then additional energy put into the system went into ionizing the neutral gas, rather than into
increasing the relative velocity, (b) the critical velocity is roughly independent of the pressure and magnetic field.&lt;ref name="U.V. Fahleson 1961"/&gt;

In 1973, Lars Danielsson published a review of critical ionization velocity, and concluded that the existence of the phenomenon "is proved by sufficient experimental evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Lars Danielsson, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1973Ap%26SS..24..459D&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03369 Review of the Critical Velocity of Gas-Plasma Interaction. I: Experimental Observations]", ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' (1973)
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Alfv√©n reported that "The first observation of the critical velocity effect under cosmic conditions was reported by Manka et al. (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Manka, R. H., et al., "Evidence for acceleration of lunar ions", in ''Lunar Science III'', C. Watkins, ed., (The Lunar Science Institute, Houston, Tx.): 504. (1972)
&lt;/ref&gt; from the Moon. When an abandoned lunar [391] excursion module was made to impact on the dark side of the Moon not very far from the terminator, a gas cloud was produced which when it had expanded so that it was hit by the solar wind gave rise to superthermal electrons."&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfv√©n, "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch21.htm Mass Distribution and the Critical Velocity]", ''Evolution of the Solar System'' (1976)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, critical ionization velocity has been recognised for some time, and is seen in the penumbra produced by a [[dense plasma focus]] device (or plasma gun). Its existence in cosmic plasmas has not been confirmed.

In 1986, Gerhard Haerendel, suggested that critical velocity ionization may stabilize the plasma flow in a cometary coma,.&lt;ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu"&gt;G. Haerendel: "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986GeoRL..13..255H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c32239 Plasma flow and critical velocity ionization in cometary comae]", (1986) ''Geophys. Res. Lett''. 13 25 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, E. Golbraikh and M. Filippov argued that critical ionization velocity could play a role in [[coronal mass ejection]]s and [[solar flare]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Golbraikh, E. I.; Filippov, M. A., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1992ssts.rept..345G&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03435 Possible manifestation of the critical ionization velocity phenomenon in the solar corona] (1992), ''ESA, Study of the Solar-Terrestrial System''.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1992, [[Anthony Peratt]] and [[Gerrit Verschuur]] suggested that interstellar neutral hydrogen emissions bore the signature of critical velocity ionization,.&lt;ref&gt;Peratt, Anthony; Verschuur, Gerrit, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002APS..DPPQP1017P&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03435 The Critical Ionization Velocity Signature Manifested in Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen Emission Profile Structure], (1992), ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'', Vol. 34, p.766
&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 review of the phenomenon by Shu T. Lai reports that ".. laboratory experiments, and computer simulations have all shown CIV as feasible and reasonably understood, although all CIV experiments in space have yielded negative results with perhaps three exceptions".&lt;ref name="Lai, Shu T. 2001 p. 471-506"/&gt;

Also in 2001, C. Konz, et al., ".. discuss the critical velocity effect as a possible explanation for the observed HŒ± emission [..] in the Galactic halo near the edges of cold gas clouds of the Magellanic Stream"&lt;ref&gt;Konz, C.; Lesch, H.; Birk, G. T.; Wiechen, H., "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001ApJ...548..249K&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=4521318e0206624 The Critical Velocity Effect as a Cause for the HŒ± Emission from the Magellanic Stream]" (2001) in ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Volume 548, Issue 1, pp. 249-252&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIV phenomenon has been also demonstrated in different Low Temperature Plasma (LTP) laboratory experiments where a plasma and a neutral gas are in relative motion across a magnetic field such as magnetrons. Simulations involving plasma accelerated in a gas similar to the cross-field LTP experiments shows rotating instabilities moving at a velocity close to the critical ionization velocity&lt;ref&gt;Boeuf, J. P.; Chaudhury, B., "[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.155005 Rotating Instability in Low-Temperature Magnetized Plasmas]" (2013) in ''Physical Review Letter'', Volume 111, 155005&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the critical ionization velocity of a neutral cloud, that is, when the cloud begins to become ionized, is when the relative kinetic energy is equal to the ionization energy, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = eV_{ion}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''eV&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ionization potential of the atoms or molecules in the gas cloud, ''m'' is the mass, ''v'' is the velocity. The phenomenon is also called the ''Critical velocity ionization'',&lt;ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu"/&gt; and also ''Critical velocity effect'',.&lt;ref&gt;Petelski, E. F.; Fahr, H. J.; Ripken, H. W.; Brenning, N.; Axnas, I., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1980A&amp;A....87...20P Enhanced interaction of the solar wind and the interstellar neutral gas by virtue of a critical velocity effect] (1980)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfv√©n considered a neutral gas cloud entering the Solar System, and noted that a neutral atom will fall towards the Sun under the influence of gravity, and its kinetic energy will increase. If their motion is random, collisions will cause the gas temperature to rise, so that at a certain distance from the Sun, the gas will ionize. Alfv√©n writes that the ionization potential of the gas, V&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;, occurs when:

:&lt;math&gt;eV_{ion} = E_g = \frac{k M m}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

that is, at a distance of:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{i} = E_g = \frac{k M m}{eV_{ion}} = 6.9\cdot 10^{-20}M \frac{m'}{V_{ion}} = 13.5\cdot 10^{13} \frac{m'}{V_{ion}} cm&lt;/math&gt;

(where r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ion distance from the Sun of mass ''M'', ''m''' is the atom weight, ''V&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in volts, ''k'' is the gravitational constant). Then when the gas becomes ionized, electromagnetic forces come into effect, of which the most important is the magnetic force which is usually greater than the gravitational force which gives rise to a magnetic repulsion from the Sun. In other words, a neutral gas falling from infinity toward the Sun is stopped at a distance r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; where it will accumulate, and perhaps condense into planets.

Alfv√©n found that by taking a gas cloud with an average ionisation voltage of 12&amp;nbsp;V, and average atomic weight of 7, then the distance r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is found to coincide with the orbit of Jupiter.

The critical ionization velocity of hydrogen 50.9&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s (50.9&amp;nbsp;km/s), and helium is 34.3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;cm/s (34.3&amp;nbsp;km/s).&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"&gt;Hannes Alfv√©n, Evolution of the Solar System (1980) "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch21.htm 21. Mass Distribution And The Critical Velocity]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background  ===

Alfv√©n discusses his thoughts behind critical velocity, in his NASA publications Evolution of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; After criticising the "Inadequacy of the Homogeneous Disc Theory", he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;".. it is more attractive to turn to the alternative that the secondary bodies derive from matter falling in from "infinity" (a distance large compared to. the satellite orbit). This matter (after being stopped and given sufficient angular momentum) accumulates at specific distances from the central body. Such a process may take place when atoms or molecules in free fall reach a kinetic energy equal to their ionization energy. At this stage, the gas can become ionized by the process discussed in sec. 21.4; the ionized gas can then be stopped by the magnetic field of the central body and receive angular momentum by transfer from the central body as described in sec. 16.3.".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">A '''crude oil assay''' is the chemical evaluation of [[crude oil]] [[Raw material|feedstocks]] by [[petroleum]] testing laboratories. Each crude oil type has unique [[molecule|molecular]] and [[chemistry|chemical]] characteristics. No two crude oil types are identical and there are crucial differences in crude oil quality. The results of crude oil assay testing provide extensive detailed [[hydrocarbon]] analysis data for refiners, oil traders and producers. Assay data help refineries determine if a crude oil feedstock is compatible for a particular petroleum refinery or if the crude oil could cause yield, quality, production, environmental and other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crude oil assay testing|url=http://www.intertek.com/petroleum/crude-oil-assay/|publisher=Intertek|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assay can be an inspection assay or comprehensive assay. Testing can include crude oil characterization of whole crude oils and the various boiling range [[Fraction (chemistry)|fractions]] produced from physical or simulated distillation by various procedures. Information obtained from the petroleum assay is used for detailed refinery engineering and client marketing purposes. Feedstock assay data are an important tool in the refining process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">The '''Curie‚Äìvon Schweidler law''' refers to the response of [[dielectric]] material to the step input of a direct current (DC) voltage first observed by [[Jacques Curie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recherches sur le pouvoir inducteur sp√©cifique et sur la conductibilit√© des corps cristallis√©s|author1=Curie, Jaques |year=1889|volume=17 |pages= 384‚Äì434|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Egon Ritter von Schweidler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Studien √ºber die Anomalien im Verhalten der Dielektrika (Studies on the anomalous behaviour of dielectrics)|author1=Schweidler, Egon Ritter von |year=1907|volume=329|issue=14 |pages= 711‚Äì770|doi=10.1002/andp.19073291407|journal=Annalen der Physik|bibcode=1907AnP...329..711S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to this law, the current decays according to a power law:

:&lt;math&gt;
I\left(t\right) \propto t^{-n},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I\left(t\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the current at a given charging time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant such that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;n&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Given that the dielectric has a finite conductance, the equation for current measured through a dielectric under a DC electrical field is:

:&lt;math&gt;
I\left(t\right) = at^{b} + c,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of proportionality, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant (i.e., &lt;math&gt;b=-n&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the intrinsic conductance of the dielectric. This stands in contrast to the [[Debye relaxation|Debye]] formulation, which states that the current is proportional an exponential function with a time constant, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, according to:

:&lt;math&gt;
I\left(t\right) \propto \exp\left\{-t/ \tau\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The Curie‚Äìvon Schweidler behavior has been observed in many instances such as those shown by Andrzej Ka Johnscher&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jonscher|first=Andrzej Ka|title=Dielectric Relaxation in Solids|publisher = Chelsea Dielectrics Press Limited |year=1983|isbn=978-0-9508711-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jameson ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Thermal Degradation of Polyimide Insulation and its Effect on Electromagnetic Coil Impedance|author1=Jameson, N. Jordan|author2=Azarian, Michael H.|author3 = Pecht, Michael|year=2017|conference=Proceedings of the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology 2017 Annual Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been interpreted as a many-body problem by Jonscher, but can also be formulated as an infinite number of [[RC circuit|resistor-capacitor]] circuits. This comes from the fact that the power law can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;
t^{-n} = \frac{1}{\Gamma\left(n\right)} \int_0^\infty \tau^{-\left(n+1\right)} e^{-t/ \tau} d\tau,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left(n\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamma function]]. Effectively, this relationship shows the power law expression to be composed of an infinite ''weighted sum'' of Debye responses.

'''Delaware Mountain Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] located in the [[Delaware Mountains]] of [[Culberson County, Texas]]. The farm consists of thirty-eight [[Enron Wind|EWC]] Zond Z-48 750 kilowatt wind turbines that produce up to 28.5 megawatts of [[electricity]]. All electricity produced by the project is purchased by the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]]. The project was completed in 1999 by Orion Energy LLC and National Wind Power. [[NextEra Energy Resources]] now owns and operates the wind farm. As a result of damage to the wind farm and transmission infrastructure by an ice storm in November 2013, the Delaware Mountain Wind Farm and the adjacent [[Wind Power Partners 94]] wind farm have been off-line. NextEra has informed the ERCOT, Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that it is dismantling the farms and "... they will be decommissioned and retired on 7 August 2014."&lt;ref&gt;Hudspeth County Herald and Dell Valley Review Jan 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reNEWS - Renewable Energy News 2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=NextEra shutters Texas duo |website=reNEWS - Renewable Energy News |date=2014-05-21 |url=http://renews.biz/66975/nextera-shutters-texas-duo/ |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9959">'''Dynamic vapor sorption''' (DVS) is a [[gravimetric analysis|gravimetric]] technique that measures how quickly and how much of a solvent is absorbed by a sample: such as a dry powder absorbing water. It does this by varying the vapor concentration surrounding the sample and measuring the change in mass which this produces. [[Water vapor]] is most commonly used, but it is also possible to use a wide range of [[organic solvent]]s.

Dr Daryl Williams, founder of Surface Measurement Systems Ltd, invented Dynamic Vapor Sorption in 1991 and the first instrument was delivered to Pfizer UK in 1992. DVS was originally developed to replace the time and labor-intensive [[desiccator]]s and saturated salt solutions to measure [[moisture sorption isotherm|water vapor sorption isotherm]]s.

==Water sorption isotherms==

The main application of DVS is to measure water [[sorption]] isotherms.  In general, a vapor [[sorption isotherm]] shows the [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] amount of vapor sorbed as a function of steady state relative [[vapor pressure]] at a constant temperature.  For [[Moisture sorption isotherm|water sorption isotherms]], water relative vapor pressure is more commonly expressed as [[relative humidity]].  In a DVS experiment this is accomplished by exposing a sample to a series of step changes in [[relative humidity]] and monitoring the mass change as a function of time.  The sample mass must be allowed to reach [[gravimetric]] equilibrium at each step change in humidity before progressing to the next humidity level.  Then, the equilibrium mass values at each [[relative humidity]] step are used to generate the isotherm.  Isotherms are typically divided into two components: ''[[sorption]]'' for increasing humidity steps and ''[[desorption]]'' for decreasing humidity steps.  Sorption can be further divided into ''[[adsorption]]'' (sorbate located on the surface) and ''[[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]]'' (sorbate penetrates the bulk).

==Typical Results==

Figure 1 shows a typical water [[sorption]] result from a DVS experiment for a microcrystalline cellulose sample.  The kinetic data (Figure 1a) shows the change in mass and humidity as a function of time.  From the kinetic results, the rate of water uptake and water diffusion coefficients can be determined.  The equilibrium mass values at the end of each humidity step were used to calculate the [[sorption]] and desorption isotherms (Figure 1b).  The difference in water vapor uptake between the sorption and desorption isotherms is called the hysteresis.  The shape and location of the isotherm [[hysteresis]] can elucidate information about the [[sorption]] mechanism and sample porosity.  Although an isotherm experiment is the most common use of a DVS instrument, humidity (or other vapor) ramping experiments can be performed to investigate vapor-induced phase changes.  These changes include: glassy to rubbery transitions, amorphous to crystalline conversions, and sample deliquescence.

==Applications==

DVS measurement has applications over a wide range of industries.  Both equilibrium vapor sorption isotherms and vapor sorption kinetic results can yield vital information for materials ranging from pharmaceuticals to [[fuel cells]].  Although water [[sorption]] experiments are most common, the use of organic vapor in DVS experiments can reveal additional sample properties.  The below sections highlight how DVS experiments are utilized in several industries.

===Pharmaceuticals===

The moisture sorption properties of pharmaceutical materials such as excipients, drug formulations and packaging films are recognized as critical factors in determining their storage, stability, processing and application performance.&lt;ref&gt;P. York, International Journal of Pharmaceutics. 14 (1983) 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Zografi and M.J. Kontny, ‚ÄúSorption of Water by Solids‚Äù in Physical Characterization of   Pharmaceutical Solids, ed. H.G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, New York, NY (1995) pp. 385-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, vapor sorption experiments can be used to study [[hydrate]] &lt;ref&gt;F.G. Vogt, J. Brum, L.M. Katrincic, A. Flach, J.M. Socha, R.M. Goodman, and R.C. Haltiwanger, Crystal Growth &amp; Design. 6 (2006) 2333-2354.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[solvate]] &lt;ref&gt;D.J. Burnett, F. Thielmann, and T. Sokoloski, Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry. 89 (2007). 693-698. 
&lt;/ref&gt; formation. Gravimetric vapor sorption experiments are one of the most sensitive methods for determining amorphous contents,&lt;ref&gt;A. Saleki-Gerhard, C. Ahlneck, and G. Zografi, International Journal of Pharmaceutics. 101 (1994) 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Mackin, R. Zanon, J.M. Park, K. Foster, H. Opalenik, and M. Demonte, International Journal of Pharmaceutics. 231 (2002) 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Young, H. Chiou, T. Tee, D. Trainj, H.-K. Chan, F. Thielmann, and D. Burnett, Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy. 33 (2007) 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt; which may have a detrimental impact on the stability, manufacturability and dissolution characteristics of the formulated drug product.

===Food science===

The moisture [[sorption]] properties of food products are recognized as critical factors in determining their storage, stability, processing and application performance.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Labuza, Food Technology. (1980) 36-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Lomauro, A. S. Bakshi, and T. P. Labuza, Journal of Food Science. 50 (1985) 397-400.&lt;/ref&gt; DVS is also used to measure moisture and flavor diffusion properties for packaging and barrier applications.&lt;ref&gt;O. Bley, J. Siepmann, and R. Bodmeier, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 98 (2009) 651-664.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Dury-Brun, V. Jury, V. Guillard, S. Desobry, A. Voilley, and P. Chalier, Food Research International, 39 (2006) 1002-1011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, moisture sorption plays critical roles in the storage and performance of agricultural products like [[pesticides]], [[herbicides]], fertilizers, and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;W. Duan, E. Yang, M. Xiang, and X. Liu, Biocontrol Science and Technology. 18 (2008), 613-620.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jr. Connick, W.J. Daigle, C.D. Boyette,  K.S. Williams, B.T. Vinyard, and P.C. Quimby Jr., P.C. Biocontrol Science and Technology. 6 (1996), 277-284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.D. Menkov, Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research. 76 (2000) 373-380.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal care products===

DVS experiments have been widely used in the study of personal care materials.  For instance, the moisturization of hair samples with different chemical (i.e. conditioning, coloring, and bleaching) and mechanical (i.e. perming, combing, and blow-drying) treatments.&lt;ref&gt;A.

===Building materials===

In particular to building materials,&lt;ref&gt;Lieff, M. and Trechsel, HR, editors, Moisture Migration in Buildings, ASTM: PA, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; moisture sorption has significant implications for cements,&lt;ref&gt;Maekawa, K., Ishida, T., and Kishi, T., 2003. Journal of Advanced Concrete Technology, 1, 91-126.&lt;/ref&gt; woods,&lt;ref&gt;Skaar, C., Wood-Water Relations, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; insulation materials,&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, R.G. and Kumaran, M.K., Journal of Thermal Insulation and Building Envelopes, 1994. 
17, 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt; and fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Okubayashi, S., Griesser, U.J., and Bechtold, T., Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 2005. 97, 1621-1625.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moisture damage is a significant factor limiting a building‚Äôs lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Qin, M., Belarbi, R., Ait-Mokhtar, A., and Nilsson, L-O., 2009. Construction and Building Materials, 23, 967-975.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, moisture infusion through a building‚Äôs outer structure can have a significant effect on indoor air quality and air-conditioning load.

===Proton exchange membranes===

A critical parameter affecting the performance of [[proton exchange membranes]] is the water content.  Water is typically supplied to the fuel cell by humidifying the gas feed stream. The level of hydration within the [[proton exchange membrane]] is vital to its performance: if the hydration level is too low, the [[polymers]] exhibit greatly reduced [[ionic conductivity]];&lt;ref&gt;T.V Nguyen and N. Vanderborgh, J. Membrane Sci. 143 (1998) 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  if hydration level is too high, excess water can flood the pores in the gas diffusion layer and impede mass transport within the electrode structure.&lt;ref&gt;W-k. Lee, S. Shimpalee, and J.W. Van Zee, J. Electrochem. Soc. 150 (2003) A341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Zawodzinski., M. Neman, L.O. Sillerud, and S. Gottesfeld, J. Phys. Chem. 95 (1991) 6040.&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, DVS has been used to study the water sorption and transport properties of [[proton exchange membranes]].&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Burnett, A.R. Garcia, and F. Thielmann, Journal of Power Sources. 160 (2006) 426-430.

'''Erbium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Er''' and [[atomic number]] 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements. It is a [[lanthanide]], a [[rare earth element]], originally found in the [[gadolinite]] mine in [[Ytterby]] in [[Sweden]], from which it got its name.

Erbium's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications. Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are optically pumped at around 980 or {{val|1480|u=nm}} and then radiate light at {{val|1530|u=nm}} in stimulated emission. This process results in an unusually mechanically simple [[laser]] [[optical amplifier]] for signals transmitted by fiber optics. The {{val|1550|u=nm}} wavelength is especially important for [[optical communications]] because standard single mode [[optical fibers]] have minimal loss at this particular wavelength.

In addition to optical fiber amplifier-lasers, a large variety of medical applications (i.e. dermatology, dentistry) rely on the erbium ion's {{val|2940|u=nm}} emission (see [[Er:YAG laser]]) when lit at another wavelength, which is highly absorbed in water in tissues, making its effect very superficial. Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in [[laser surgery]], and for the efficient production of steam which produces enamel ablation by common types of [[dental laser]].

===Physical properties===
[[Image:Erbium(III)chloride sunlight.jpg|thumb|left|Erbium(III)chloride in sunlight, showing some pink fluorescence of Er&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; from natural ultraviolet.]]
A [[valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] element, pure erbium [[metal]] is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air, and does not [[oxidation|oxidize]] as quickly as some other [[rare-earth metals]]. Its [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp [[absorption spectra]] bands in [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], and near [[infrared]]. Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its [[sesquioxide]] is called [[erbia]]. Erbium's properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present. Erbium does not play any known biological role, but is thought to be able to stimulate [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=emsley&gt;{{cite book | title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements  | last = Emsley | first = John | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2001 | location = Oxford, England, UK | isbn = 0-19-850340-7 | chapter = Erbium | pages = 136‚Äì139 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erbium is [[ferromagnetic]] below 19&amp;nbsp;K, [[antiferromagnetic]] between 19 and 80 K and [[paramagnetic]] above 80&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Jackson, M. | title =Magnetism of Rare Earth| url =http://www.irm.umn.edu/quarterly/irmq10-3.pdf | journal = The IRM quarterly | volume =10| issue = 3| page = 1| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erbium can form propeller-shaped atomic clusters Er&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, where the distance between the erbium atoms is 0.35&amp;nbsp;nm. Those clusters can be isolated by encapsulating them into [[fullerene]] molecules, as confirmed by [[transmission electron microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Structures of ''D''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''-C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''-Er''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N@C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; Fullerenes and Their Rotation Inside Carbon Nanotubes Demonstrated by Aberration-Corrected Electron Microscopy| date = 2007| journal = Nano Letters| volume = 7| page = 3704|bibcode = 2007NanoL...7.3704S| issue = 12 |doi =10.1021/nl0720152|last1 = Sato|first1 = Yuta| last2 = Suenaga| first2 = Kazu| last3 = Okubo| first3 = Shingo| last4 = Okazaki| first4 = Toshiya| last5 = Iijima| first5 = Sumio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Erbium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form [[erbium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Er + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí 2 Er&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Erbium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form erbium hydroxide:
:2 Er (s) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) ‚Üí 2 Er(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Erbium metal reacts with all the halogens:
:2 Er (s) + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) ‚Üí 2 ErF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [pink]

Erbium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing hydrated Er(III) ions, which exist as rose red [Er(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; hydration complexes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/erbium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Erbium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of erbium}}
Naturally occurring erbium is composed of 6 stable [[isotope]]s, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|162}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|164}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|166}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|167}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|168}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|Er|170}} with {{SimpleNuclide|Er|166}} being the most abundant (33.503% [[natural abundance]]). 29 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the most stable being {{SimpleNuclide|Er|169}} with a [[half-life]] of {{val|9.4|u=days}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|172}} with a half-life of {{val|49.3|u=hours}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|160}} with a half-life of {{val|28.58|u=hours}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|165}} with a half-life of {{val|10.36|u=hours}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|Er|171}} with a half-life of {{val|7.516|u=hours}}. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than {{val|3.5|u=hours}}, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 4 minutes. This element also has 13 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being {{SimpleNuclide|Er|167|m}} with a half-life of {{val|2.269|u=seconds}}.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3‚Äì128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotopes of erbium range in [[atomic weight]] from {{val|142.9663|ul=u}} ({{SimpleNuclide|Er|143}}) to {{val|176.9541|u=u}} ({{SimpleNuclide|Er|177}}). The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, {{SimpleNuclide|Er|166}}, is [[electron capture]], and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before {{SimpleNuclide|Er|166}} are element 67 ([[holmium]]) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 69 ([[thulium]]) isotopes.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt;

== History ==
Erbium (for [[Ytterby]], a village in [[Sweden]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mosander, C. G. |date=1843|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA241|title=On the new metals, Lanthanium and Didymium, which are associated with Cerium; and on Erbium and Terbium, new metals associated with Yttria|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume= 23|issue=152| pages =241‚Äì254|doi=10.1080/14786444308644728}} Note: The first part of this article, which does NOT concern erbium, is a translation of: C.

Mosander (1842) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XK4tAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=387 "N√•got om Cer och Lanthan"] [Some (news) about cerium and lanthanum], ''[[Scandinavian Scientist Conference|F√∂rhandlingar vid de Skandinaviske naturforskarnes tredje m√∂te (Stockholm)]]'' [Transactions of the Third Scandinavian Scientist Conference (Stockholm)], vol. 3, pp. 387‚Äì398.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosander was working with a sample of what was thought to be the single metal oxide [[yttria]], derived from the mineral [[gadolinite]]. He discovered that the sample contained at least two metal oxides in addition to pure yttria, which he named "[[erbia]]" and "[[terbia]]" after the village of Ytterby where the gadolinite had been found. Mosander was not certain of the purity of the oxides and later tests confirmed his uncertainty. Not only did the "yttria" contain yttrium, erbium, and terbium; in the ensuing years, chemists, geologists and spectroscopists discovered five additional elements: [[ytterbium]], [[scandium]], [[thulium]], [[holmium]], and [[gadolinium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piguet|first=Claude|year=2014|title=Extricating erbium|url=http://www.nature.com/naturechemistry|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=6|page=370|doi=10.1038/nchem.1908|bibcode=2014NatCh...6..370P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time. A spectroscopist mistakenly switched the names of the two elements during spectroscopy.  After 1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia. Fairly pure Er&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was independently isolated in 1905 by [[Georges Urbain]] and [[Charles James (chemist)|Charles James]]. Reasonably pure erbium metal was not produced until 1934 when [[Wilhelm Klemm]] and [[Heinrich Bommer]] reduced the [[anhydrous]] [[chloride]] with [[potassium]] vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Erbium |url=https://www.livescience.com/38389-erbium.html |website=Live Science |accessdate=22 October 2018|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 1990s that the price for Chinese-derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages =378‚Äì379| url =https://books.google.com/?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA377| title = The development of modern chemistry| last= Ihde |first= Aaron John | publisher = Courier Dover Publications| date = 1984| isbn =0-486-64235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/ftinterface?content=a910855554&amp;rt=0&amp;format=pdf --&gt;

== Occurrence ==
[[File:MonaziteUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Monazite sand]]
The concentration of erbium in the Earth crust is about 2.8&amp;nbsp;mg/kg and in the sea water 0.9&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book | last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot | date = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 293‚Äì295| isbn =0-07-049439-8 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA293 | accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concentration is enough to make erbium about 45th in [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|elemental abundance in the Earth's crust]].

Like other rare earths, this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in [[monazite]] sand ores. It has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but [[ion-exchange]] chromatography methods&lt;ref&gt;Early paper on the use of displacement ion-exchange chromatography to separate rare earths: {{cite journal | last1 = Spedding | first1 = F. H. | last2 = Powell | first2 = J. E. | date = 1954 | title = A practical separation of yttrium group rare earths from gadolinite by ion-exchange | journal = Chemical Engineering Progress | volume = 50 | pages = 7‚Äì15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their [[chemical compound]]s.

The principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals [[xenotime]] and [[euxenite]], and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China; in consequence, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is about two-thirds of the total by weight, and erbia is about 4‚Äì5%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.

==Production==
Crushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or [[sulfuric acid]] that transforms insoluble rare-earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) to pH 3‚Äì4. [[Thorium]] precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths into their insoluble [[oxalate]]s. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in [[nitric acid]] that excludes one of the main components, [[cerium]], whose oxide is insoluble in HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The solution is treated with [[magnesium nitrate]] to produce a crystallized mixture of [[double salt]]s of rare-earth metals. The salts are separated by [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt; Erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with [[calcium]] at {{val|1450|u=¬∞C}} under argon atmosphere.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:Erbium-glass.jpg|thumb|Erbium-colored glass]]
Erbium's everyday uses are varied. It is commonly used as a [[filter (photography)|photographic filter]], and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive. Other uses:
* Used in [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] technology in neutron-absorbing [[control rod]]s.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-7923-5593-9 | chapter = Use of UraniumErbium and PlutoniumErbium Fuel in RBMK Reactors | pages = 121‚Äì125 | editor= Parish, Theodore A. | editor2= Khromov, Vyacheslav V. | editor3= Carron, Igor | date = 1999 | publisher = Kluwer | location = CBoston | title = Safety issues associated with Plutonium involvement in the nuclear fuel cycle | url = https://books.google.com/?id=aamn7uifb3gC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When added to [[vanadium]] as an [[alloy]], erbium lowers hardness and improves workability.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| last= Hammond |first= C. R. |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 81st| publisher =CRC press| date = 2000| isbn = 0-8493-0481-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Erbium oxide]] has a pink color, and is sometimes used as a colorant for [[glass]], [[cubic zirconia]] and [[porcelain]]. The glass is then often used in [[sunglasses]] and cheap [[jewelry]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;
* Erbium-doped [[optical fibers|optical silica-glass fibers]] are the active element in [[erbium-doped fiber amplifier]]s (EDFAs), which are widely used in [[optical communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-12-084590-3 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=uAOq75yt5CcC | last1 = Becker|first1= P. C. | last2 = Olsson|first2= N. A. | last3 = Simpson| first3 =  J. R.  | date = 1999 | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | title = Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers fundamentals and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same fibers can be used to create fiber [[lasers]]. In order to work efficiently, erbium-doped fiber is usually co-doped with glass modifiers/homogenizers, often aluminum or phosphorus.  These dopants help prevent clustering of Er-ions and transfer the energy more efficiently between the Er ions and the signal. Co-doping of optical fiber with Er and Yb is used in [[high-power Er/Yb fiber lasers]]. Erbium can also be used in [[erbium-doped waveguide amplifier]]s.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;
* An erbium-[[nickel]] alloy Er&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni has an unusually high specific heat capacity at liquid-helium temperatures and is used in [[cryocoolers]]; a mixture of 65% Er&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[cobalt|Co]] and 35% Er&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;[[Ytterbium|Yb]]&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni by volume improves the specific heat capacity even more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Advances in Cryogenic Engineering | volume= 39a | editor=Kittel, Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Cryogenic Regenerative Heat Exchangers | first = Robert A. | last = Ackermann | publisher = Springer | date = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-306-45449-3 | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=nIzviZ_-_NsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A large variety of medical applications (i.e. dermatology, dentistry) utilize erbium ion's {{val|2940|u=nm}} emission (see [[Er:YAG laser]]), which is highly absorbed in water ([[Attenuation coefficient|absorption coefficient]] about {{val|12000|up=cm}}). Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is necessary for laser surgery, and the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in dentistry.

==Biological role==
Erbium does not have a biological role, but erbium salts can stimulate [[metabolism]]. Humans consume 1 milligram of erbium a year on average. The highest concentration of erbium in humans is in the [[bone]]s, but there is also erbium in the human [[kidneys]] and [[liver]].&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;

===Toxicity===
Erbium is slightly toxic if ingested, but erbium compounds are not toxic.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; Metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haley|first1= T.

'''Fouling communities''' are communities of organisms found on artificial surfaces like the sides of docks, [[marinas]], harbors, and boats. Settlement panels made from a variety of substances have been used to monitor settlement patterns and to examine several community processes (e.g., succession, recruitment, predation, competition, and invasion resistance). These communities are characterized by the presence of a variety of sessile organisms including [[Ascidia|ascidians]], [[Bryozoan|bryozoans]], [[Mussel|mussels]], tube building [[Polychaete|polychaetes]], [[Sea anemone|sea anemones]], [[Sponge|sponges]], [[Barnacle|barnacles]], and more. Common predators on and around [[Biofouling|fouling]] communities include small [[Crab|crabs]], [[starfish]], [[fish]], [[Limpet|limpets]], [[Chiton|chitons]], other [[Gastropod|gastropods]], and a variety of [[Worm|worms]].

== Ecology ==
Fouling communities follow a distinct succession pattern in a natural environment.

== Environmental impact ==

=== Positive impacts ===
Fouling communities are a part of a healthy aquatic system.

Helps test the ecological effectiveness of artificial coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jimenez|first=Carlos|last2=Hadjioannou|first2=Louis|last3=Petrou|first3=Antonis|last4=Andreou|first4=Vasilis|last5=Georgiou|first5=Andreas|date=2016-12-01|title=Fouling Communities of Two Accidental Artificial Reefs (Modern Shipwrecks) in Cyprus (Levantine Sea)|url=https://doaj.org/article/ab5ed7963ee643b7923a75ecadf65069|journal=Water|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|issn=2073-4441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative impacts ===
Fouling communities can have a negative economic impact on humans, such as by damaging the bottom of boats.

It can, when attached to the bottoms of boats, bring invasive species to locations where there use to be none.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.M.|first=Drake,|last2=D.M.|first2=Lodge,|date=2007|title=Hull fouling is a risk factor for intercontinental species exchange in aquatic ecosystems|url=http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=143380|journal=Aquatic Invasions|language=en|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Research history ==
Fouling communities were highlighted particularly in the literature of [[marine ecology]] as a potential example of alternate stable states through the work of John Sutherland in the 1970s at [[Duke University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=John P.|date=November‚ÄìDecember 1974|title=Multiple Stable Points in Natural Communities|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2459615|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=108|issue=964|pages=859‚Äì873|doi=10.1086/282961|jstor=2459615|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although this was later called into question by Connell and Sousa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell|first=Joseph H.|last2=Sousa|first2=Wayne P.|date=June 1983|title=On the Evidence Needed to Judge Ecological Stability or Persistence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2460854|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=121|issue=6|pages=789‚Äì824|doi=10.1086/284105|jstor=2460854|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Topographic map of Saint Helena-en.svg|thumb|St Helena island]]
'''Saint Helena''' is an island in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], about midway between [[South America]] and [[Africa]]. St Helena has a land area of 122 square kilometres and is part of the territory of [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]] which includes [[Ascension Island]] and the island group of [[Tristan da Cunha]].

==Physical geography==

===Climate===
{{See also|Jamestown, Saint Helena#Climate}}
[[Image:St-Helena-The Barn.jpg|thumb|The Barn, which forms the northeast point of the island]]
The climate of [[Saint Helena]] island can be described as tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the [[Benguela Current]] and [[trade winds]] which blow almost continuously. Similarly, the climate of [[Tristan da Cunha]] is marine, mild and also tempered by trade winds, although the climate is temperate in nature. Ascension Island is warmer and wetter than St Helena.

===Terrain===
[[Image:Lot and Lot's Wife in background.jpg|thumb|Picture of 'Lot' and 'Lot's Wife'.]]
[[Saint Helena]] has a rugged, [[volcanic]] terrain, with small scattered [[plateau]]s and [[plain]]s, with the largest area of level ground on the island being [[Prosperous Bay Plain]] in the eastern arid area. The other islands of the group have a volcanic origin. The highest point on the island is [[Diana's Peak]] at 818 metres (2,684&amp;nbsp;ft), though [[Queen Mary's Peak]] on [[Tristan da Cunha]] is the highest in the British territory at 2,062 m.

A natural hazard on Tristan da Cunha is active volcanism, though this is not the case on St Helena itself.

===Geology ===
[[Image:Saint Helena Island.jpg|thumb|Saint Helena Island as seen from space.]]

St. Helena exists because of the [[St. Helena hotspot]] which began to produce basaltic lava about 145 million years ago when it was near the [[Divergent boundary|constructive plate margin]] of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. The movement of the [[African Plate]] away from the hotspot has left the chain of the St. Helena [[seamounts]], which may connect with the [[Cameroon Volcanic Line]]. St. Helena, the most south westerly point on the chain, is close to the plate margin, but the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago.

The first investigations of St. Helena geology were made when [[Charles Darwin]] visited the island on the voyage of [[H.M.S. Beagle]] in July 1836. He "used the observations on St Helena to formulate an intermediate hypothesis (published in 1844 in his book "Geological Observations on the volcanic islands and parts of South America visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. "Beagle") - volcanoes rise by slow, gradual and episodic events".&lt;ref&gt;David Bressan in [[Scientific American]] July 8, 2013, "8, July 1836: Darwin on St Helena and the Birth of a Volcano"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geological features====
The Barn is a capping of younger lavas upon weaker rocks. The Barn features cliffs on the side that faces the sea. It overlooks the pyroclasts and weak flows of Turk's Cap Valley to the south.

Taking their names from the story of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] in the Book of Genesis, "Lot" and "Lot's Wife" are two solitary pillars of rock topping two valleys near Sandy Bay.  The pillars are [[phonolitic]] [[intrusion]]s, which are more resistant to erosion than surrounding volcanic features which have, in time, eroded away.&lt;ref&gt;web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~sa_sa/st_helena/st_helena_geology.html; The Geology of Saint Helena Island, Reginald A. Daly,Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,Vol. 62, No. 2 (Mar., 1927), pp. 31-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
Saint Helena possesses [[fish]] as a main natural resource. Land use in the island group is divided between [[arable land]] (with 12.9% of the area given to this) and other uses, which occupy the remaining 87.1%.

In terms of maritime claims, St Helena has an exclusive fishing zone of 200 nautical miles, and a territorial sea of twelve nautical miles.

===Islands===
Just off the coast of St Helena island itself are numerous small islands. Starting from the north and running clockwise, these are: Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock, The Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, Black Horse Island, White Bird Island, Frightus Island, Jar Rock, Castle Point Rock, Robert Rock, Salt Rock, Speery Island, Flat Rock, The Needle, Lower and Upper Black Rock, Bird Island, Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock, Long Ledge, and Red Rock.

==Ecology==
{{See also|Wildlife of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha|Flora of St Helena}}
Saint Helena harbours at least 40 species of plants unknown anywhere else in the world, and Ascension is a breeding ground for [[sea turtle]]s and [[sooty tern]]s.

==Districts==
The island of St Helena is divided into [[Saint Helena#Administrative divisions|8 districts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohive.com/cntry/gb-sh.aspx GeoHive] St Helena&lt;/ref&gt; which are used for electoral and administrative purposes.

'''Georges Claude''' (24 September 1870{{spaced ndash}}23 May 1960) was a [[France|French]] engineer and inventor. He is noted for his early work on the industrial liquefaction of air, for the invention and commercialization of [[neon lighting]], and for a large experiment on generating energy by pumping cold seawater up from the depths.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news |title=Georges Claude, Inventor, Dies; Creator of Neon Light was 89 |work=The New York Times |date=May 24, 1960 |page=37}} Paid access.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been considered by some to be "the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] of France".&lt;ref name=Time45&gt;{{cite news |title=FRANCE: Paranoia? |work=Time Magazine |date=July 9, 1945 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852306,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiles&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Chiles |first = James |title = The Other Renewable Energy |journal = Invention and Technology |volume = 23 |issue = 4 |pages = 24‚Äì35 |date = Winter 2009 |url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2009/4/2009_4_24.shtml |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091202083037/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2009/4/2009_4_24.shtml |archivedate = 2009-12-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude was an active [[Collaborationism|collaborator]] with the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupiers of France during the Second World War]], for which he was imprisoned in 1945 and stripped of his honors.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Venner&gt;{{cite book |first=Dominique |last=Venner |title=Histoire de la collaboration |language=French |trans-title=History of the Collaboration |publisher=Pygmalion-G√©rard Watelet |year=2000 |isbn=978-2-85704-642-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAFnAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Georges Claude studied at the [[√âcole sup√©rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris]] (ESPCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espci.org/fr/anciens/eleves/5/  |title=ESPCI ParisTech Alumni 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then held several positions. He was an electrical inspector in a cable factory and the laboratory manager in an electric works. He founded and edited a magazine, ''L'√âtincelle √âlectrique'' (''The Electric Spark''); his important friendship with [[Jacques-Ars√®ne d'Arsonval]] apparently dates from this time.&lt;ref name=Blondel&gt;{{cite book |title=Expository Science: Forms and Functions of Popularisation |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Shinn |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Whitley |last1=Blondel |first1=Christine |chapter=Industrial science as a "show": A case study of Georges Claude |page=251 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATpe1PJf3CoC&amp;pg=PA251 |year=1985 |publisher=D. Reidel |isbn=978-90-277-1831-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1896, Claude learned of the explosion risk for bottled [[acetylene]], which was used at the time for lighting. Acetylene is explosive when stored under pressure. Claude showed that acetylene dissolved well in [[acetone]], equivalent to storing it under 25 atmospheres of pressure, reduced the risk in handling the gas.&lt;ref name=Alqvist&gt;{{cite book |title=History of industrial gases |page=242 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI0fTJhydh4C&amp;pg=PA242 |first=Ebbe |last=Almqvist |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-306-47277-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquefaction of air==
In 1902 Claude devised what is now known as the Claude system for [[Liquefaction of gases|liquifying air]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Industrial Gases |last=Greenwood |first=Harold Cecil |year=1919 |publisher=D. Van Nostrand |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz9DAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system enabled the production of industrial quantities of liquid nitrogen, oxygen, and argon; Claude's approach competed successfully with the earlier system of [[Carl von Linde]] (1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physical Chemistry |last=Iqbal |first=S. A. |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2005 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZquSjRU7hPwC&amp;pg=PA42 |isbn=978-81-7141-994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude and businessman Paul Delorme founded ''L'Air Liquide, S.A.'' ([[Air Liquide]]), which is presently a large multinational corporation headquartered in Paris, France.

==Neon lighting==
{{main|Neon lighting}}
[[File:NeTube.jpg|thumb |right | |alt=Photograph of glass tube that's been bent to form the connected letters "Ne". The tube is glowing brightly with a red color. |Gas discharge tube containing neon; "Ne" is the chemical symbol for neon.]]
Inspired by [[Geissler tube]]s and by [[Daniel McFarlan Moore]]'s invention of a nitrogen-based light (the "Moore tube"), Claude developed neon tube lighting to exploit the neon that was produced as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business.&lt;ref name=Claude1913 /&gt; These were all "glow discharge" tubes that generate light when an electric current is passed through the rarefied gas within the tube. Claude's first public demonstration of a large neon light was at the [[Paris Motor Show]] (''Salon de l'Automobile et du Cycle''), 3‚Äì18 December 1910.&lt;ref name=Claude&gt;There is, as yet, no satisfactory primary source to the actual date on which Claude unveiled his neon lights at the 1910 Paris Motor Show. Many references give 3 December 1910, which was the starting date for the show. See {{cite book |title=The book of firsts |first=Patrick |last=Robertson |publisher=C. N. Potter |year=1974}} and also the [[:Image:12eSalondelAutomobile.jpg|Motor Show poster]]. Others give 11 December; see {{cite book |title=Broadway: its history, people, and places : an encyclopedia |first=Ken |last=Bloom |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-93704-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Testelin&gt;{{cite web |title=Reportage ‚Äì Il √©tait une fois le n√©on No. 402 |language=French |last=Testelin |first=Xavier |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/photo-402.html |accessdate=2010-12-06 }} Claude's 1910 demonstration of neon lighting lit the peristyle of the ''[[Grand Palais]]'' in Paris; this webpage includes a recent photograph that gives an impression of it. It is part of an extensive selection of images of neon lighting; see {{cite web |title=Reportage ‚Äì Il √©tait une fois le n√©on |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/sujet-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude's first patent filing for his technologies in France was on 7 March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent| country=FR |number=424190 |status=patent |title=''Perfectionnements dans l'eclairage par tubes luminescents'' |pubdate= |gdate=1911-03-08 |fdate=1910-03-07 |pridate= |invent1=Georges Claude}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude himself wrote in 1913 that, in addition to a source of neon gas, there were two principal inventions that made neon lighting practicable. First were his methods for purifying the neon (or other inert gases such as argon). Claude developed techniques for purifying the inert gases within a completely sealed glass tube, which distinguished neon tube lighting from the Moore tubes; the latter had a device for replenishing the nitrogen or carbon dioxide gases within the tube. The second invention was ultimately crucial for the development of the Claude lighting business; it was a design for minimizing the degradation (by "sputtering") of the electrodes that transfer electric current from the external power supply to the glowing gases within the sign.&lt;ref name=Claude1913&gt;{{cite journal |last=Claude |first=Georges |title=The Development of Neon Tubes |journal=The Engineering Magazine |date=November 1913 |pages=271‚Äì274 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "neon light" and "neon sign" are now often applied to electrical lighting incorporating sealed glass tubes filled with argon, mercury vapor, or other gases instead of neon. In 1915 a U.S. patent was issued to Claude covering the design of the electrodes for neon lights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=1125476 |title=Systems of Illuminating by Luminescent Tubes |invent1=Georges Claude |gdate=1915-01-19 |fdate=1911-11-09}} See [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090315205020/http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/History-of-Neon-Light-Gallery/Neon-Lamp-Patent-Drawing.htm reproduction of patent.]&lt;/ref&gt; this patent became the strongest basis for the monopoly held in the U.S. by his company, Claude Neon Lights, through the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Claude Neon Lights Wins Injunction Suit: Also Gets Rights to Recover Profits and Damages Resulting From Patent Infringement |work=The New York Times |date=November 28, 1928}} Paid access.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Georges Claude and his French company Claude Neon, introduced neon gas signs to the [[United States]], by selling two to [[Earle C. Anthony]], the owner of [[Packard]] car dealerships in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Photos from 1923 of the one in San Francisco show the neon Packard sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-c1-los-angeles-neon-20131203-dto-htmlstory.html |title=Pair sheds new light on L.A.'s claim to neon fame |last=Saillant |first=Catherine |date=2013-12-03 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neon lighting quickly became a popular fixture in outdoor advertising. Visible even in daylight, people would stop and stare at the first neon signs for hours, dubbed "liquid fire."&lt;ref name="FontaniCosta2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fontani |first1=Marco |last2=Costa |first2=Mariagrazia |last3=Orna |first3=Mary Virginia |title=The Lost Elements: The Periodic Table's Shadow Side |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nRrVBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT287 |accessdate=2018-09-23 |date=2014-10-01 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199383368 |page=287 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean thermal energy conversion==
[[File:Georges Claude √† l'Institut 1926.jpg|thumb|Georges Claude conducting a demonstration on ocean thermal energy conversion at the [[Institut de France]] in 1926.]]{{main|Ocean thermal energy conversion}}
Claude's mentor and friend was [[Jacques-Ars√®ne d'Arsonval]], the inventor of the "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion" (OTEC) concept. Claude was also the first person to build prototype plants of that technology. Claude built his plant in [[Cuba]] in 1930. The system produced 22 kilowatts of electricity with a low-pressure [[turbine]].&lt;ref name=Chiles /&gt;&lt;ref name=dow-book&gt;{{Cite book |title = Deep Ocean Water as Our Next Natural Resource |last = Takahashi |first = Masayuki Mac |translator=Kitazawa, Kazuhiro |translator2=Snowden, Paul |year = 2000 |publisher = Terra Scientific Publishing Company |location = Tokyo, Japan |chapter = 2.

In 1935, Claude constructed another plant, this time aboard a 10,000-ton cargo vessel moored off the coast of [[Brazil]]. Weather and waves destroyed both plants before they could become net power generators.&lt;ref name=dow-book/&gt; (Net power is the amount of power generated after subtracting power needed to run the system.)

==Wartime collaboration and post-war imprisonment==
Even as a young engineer, Claude was unsympathetic to democratic rule.&lt;ref name=Blondel /&gt; In 1933 he joined the ''[[Action fran√ßaise]]'', which favored restoration of a monarchy in France.&lt;ref name=Venner /&gt; He was a close friend of the monarchist leader [[Charles Maurras]].&lt;ref name=Time45 /&gt; Following the 1940 defeat of France by Germany at the beginning of the Second World War, the subsequent German occupation of northern France and establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in the south, Claude publicly supported French collaboration with Germany. Among his other activities, he published several tracts supporting collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histoire d'une √©volution: de l'hostilit√© √† la collaboration |language=French |trans-title=History of an Evolution: On Hostility Against Collaboration |last=Claude |first=Georges |publisher=Les √âditions de France |year=1941 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w8jAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Claude |first=Georges |title=La seule route |language=French |trans-title=The Only Route |publisher=Inter-France |year=1942 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54odAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fran√ßais, il faut comprendre! |language=French |trans-title=France!

Hardy |year=1943 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5JPWSAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of a Distinguished Committee of the ''[[Groupe Collaboration]]'', which had been founded in September, 1940. He was nominated by the Vichy regime as a member of the ''[[:fr:conseil national consultatif|Conseil National Consultatif]]'' in 1941.

Following the Allied liberation of France in 1944, Claude was taken into custody on 2 December 1944 because of his [[collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaboration with the Axis Powers]]. He was removed from the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. In 1945 he was tried and convicted of propaganda work favoring collaboration, but was cleared of another charge that he helped design the [[V-1 flying bomb]]. He was condemned to life imprisonment, and was imprisoned. In 1950 he was released from prison, with acknowledgment of his research on ocean thermal energy conversion.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;

==Selected bibliography&lt;!--should be completed--&gt;==
Claude wrote several semi-popular descriptions of his research, in addition to his wartime tracts and a memoir.
*{{cite book |title=L'√âlectricit√© √† la port√©e de tout le monde |publisher=Vve C. Dunod |year=1901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PatiQwAACAAJ}} Claude's first book, ''Electricity Made Accessible to Everyone'', was a very popular exposition. It won the ''Prix H√©bert de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie des Sciences'', and was translated into German. Christine Blondel writes of it, "In fact the success of the book was enormous. More than 60,000 copies were sold, nearly double the number of [[Jean Perrin]]'s famous book, ''Les atomes''."&lt;ref name=Blondel /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">'''Grog''', also known as '''firesand''' and '''chamotte''', is a [[ceramic]] raw material. It has high percentage of [[silica]] and [[alumina]]. It can be produced by firing selected [[fire clay]]s to high temperature before grinding and screening to specific particle sizes. It can also be produced from [[pitchers (ceramic material)|pitchers]]. The [[particle size distribution]] is generally coarser in size than the other raw materials used to prepare clay bodies. It tends to be porous and have low density. 

It is normally available as a powder or chippings, and is an important ingredient in [[Coade stone]].

==Properties==
Grog is composed of: 40% minimum [[alumina]], 30% minimum [[silica]], 4% maximum [[Iron(III) oxide]], 2% maximum of [[calcium oxide]] and [[magnesium oxide]] combined.&lt;ref name="jain"&gt;{{harvnb|Jain|2003|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its melting point is approximately {{convert|1780|C|F|abbr=on}}. Its boiling point is over {{convert|9000|C|F|abbr=on}}. Its water absorption is 7% maximum. Its [[thermal expansion coefficient]] is 5.2&amp;nbsp;mm/m and [[thermal conductivity]] is 0.8 W/(m¬∑K) at 100 ¬∞C and 1.0 W/(m¬∑K) at 1000 ¬∞C. It is also not easily [[wetted]] by [[steel]].&lt;ref name="jain"/&gt;

==Applications==
Grog is used in [[pottery]] and [[sculpture]] to add a gritty, rustic texture called "tooth"; it also reduces shrinkage and aids even drying.  This prevents defects such as cracking, crow feet patterning, and lamination. The coarse particles open the green clay body to allow gases to escape. It also adds structural strength to hand-built and thrown pottery during shaping although it can diminish fired strength.

The finer the grog particles are, the closer the clay bond, and the denser and stronger the resulting fired product. "The strength in the dry state increases with grog down as fine as that passing the 100-[[Mesh (scale)|mesh]] sieve, but decreases with material passing the 200-mesh sieve." &lt;ref name="liddell"&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|1922|p=503}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In archaeology==
In archaeological terminology, 'grog' is crushed fired pottery of '''any''' type that is added as a [[Ceramic#Ceramics in archaeology|temper]] to unfired clay.  Several pottery types from the European [[Bronze Age]] are [[typology (archaeology)|typologised]] on the basis of their grog inclusions.

'''Iron(II) sulfide''' or '''ferrous sulfide'''  (Br.E. '''sulphide''') is one of a family [[chemical compound]]s and [[mineral]]s with the approximate [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|[[iron|Fe]][[sulfide|S]]}}. Iron sulfides are often iron-deficient [[non-stoichiometric]].  All are black, water-insoluble solids.

==Preparation and structure== 
FeS can be obtained by the heating of iron and [[sulfur]]:&lt;ref&gt;H. Lux "Iron (II) Sulfide" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 1502.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Fe  +  S   ‚Üí   FeS

FeS adopts the [[nickel arsenide]] structure, featuring [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] Fe centers and trigonal prismatic sulfide sites.

==Reactions==
Iron sulfide reacts with [[hydrochloric acid]], releasing [[hydrogen sulfide]]
:FeS  +  2 HCl   ‚Üí   FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

{{citation needed|reason=Dilute [[sulphuric acid]] is added over iron(II) sulphide:|date=September 2017}}
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí  FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In moist air, iron sulfides oxidize to hydrated [[ferrous sulfate]].

==Biology and biogeochemistry==
Iron sulfides occur widely in nature in the form of [[iron‚Äìsulfur protein]]s.

As organic matter decays under low-oxygen (or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]]) conditions such as in swamps or [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]] of lakes and oceans, [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] reduce various [[sulfate]]s present in the water, producing [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water or solid to produce iron or metal sulfides, which are not water-soluble. These metal sulfides, such as iron(II) sulfide, are often black or brown, leading to the color of sludge.

[[Pyrrhotite]] is a waste product of the ''[[Desulfovibrionales|Desulfovibrio]]'' bacteria, a sulfate reducing bacteria.

When eggs are cooked for a long time, the [[yolk]]'s surface may turn green. This color change is due to iron(II) sulfide, which forms as iron from the yolk reacts with hydrogen sulfide released from the egg white by the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://chestofbooks.com/food/science/Experimental-Cookery/The-Formation-Of-Ferrous-Sulfide-In-Cooked-Eggs.html|chapter=The formation of ferrous sulfide in cooked eggs|title=Experimental cookery from the chemical and physical standpoint|author=Belle Lowe|year=1937|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|||title=[[McGee on Food and Cooking]]|author=[[Harold McGee]]|year=2004|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of ferrous sulfide as a visible black [[precipitate]] in the [[growth medium]] [[peptone iron agar]] can be used to distinguish between [[microorganisms]] that produce the [[cysteine metabolism|cysteine metabolizing]] enzyme [[D-cysteine desulfhydrase|cysteine desulfhydrase]] and those that do not. Peptone iron agar contains the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]] and a [[chemical indicator]], [[ammonium ferric citrate|ferric citrate]]. The degradation of cysteine releases [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas that reacts with the [[ferric]] [[citrate]] to produce ferrous sulfide.

'''Lead(II) titanate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is the [[lead]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[titanic acid]]. Lead(II) titanate is a yellow powder that is [[Solubility|insoluble]] in [[water]].

At high temperatures, lead titanate adopts a cubic [[perovskite structure]]. At 760&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref&gt;Noheda, Cereceda, Iglesias, Lifante, Gonzalo, Chen and Wang, Phys. Rev. B 51, 16388 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; the material undergoes a second order [[phase transition]] to a tetragonal perovskite structure which exhibits ferroelectricity. Lead titanate is one of the end members of the [[lead zirconate titanate]] ([[Lead|Pb]]&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Zirconium|''x''}}{{Titanium|1-''x''}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Oxygen|3}} 0‚â§''x''‚â§1, PZT) system, which is technologically one of the most important ferroelectric and [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] ceramics; PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a high ratio of k33 to kp with a high kt.

Lead titanate occurs in nature as mineral macedonite.&lt;ref&gt;Radusinoviƒá, Du≈°an and Markov, Cvetko "Macedonite - lead titanate: a new mineral", ''American Mineralogist'' '''56''', 387-394 (1971), http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM56/AM56_387.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, E.A.J. and Kieft, C. "Second occurrence of makedonite, PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, L√•ngban, Sweden", ''Lithos'' '''4''', 101-104 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Lead titanate is toxic, like other lead compounds. It [[irritation|irritates]] [[human skin|skin]], [[mucous membrane]]s and [[human eye|eye]]s. It may also cause harm to unborn babies and might have effects on fertility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alfa.com/content/msds/USA/35671.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solubility in water==
The solubility of hydrothermally-synthesized perovskite-phase PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water was experimentally determined at 25 and 80&amp;nbsp;¬∞C to depend on pH and vary from 4.9x10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí4&lt;/sup&gt; mol/kg  at pH‚âà3, to 1.9x10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí4&lt;/sup&gt; mol/kg at pH‚âà7.7, to "undetectable" (&lt;3.2x10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí7&lt;/sup&gt; mol/kg) in the range 10&lt;pH&lt;11.  At still higher pH values, the solubility increased again. The solubility was apparently [[incongruent transition|incongruent]] and was quantified as the analytical concentration of Pb.&lt;ref&gt;Jooho Moon, Melanie L. Carasso, Henrik G. Krarup, Jeffrey A. Kerchner, "Particle-shape control and formation mechanisms of hydrothermally derived lead titanate", Journal of Materials Research, Vol. 14, No.3, March 1999.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237652068_Particle-Shape_Control_and_Formation_Mechanisms_of_Hydrothermally_Derived_Lead_Titanate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples are discrete fields and [[local field]]s such as the field of complex numbers and the ''p''-adic fields. Since one can always give discrete topology to a field, any field can be turned into a locally compact field.

''The Baltic Connection in Russian America.'' Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas, Neue Folge 42, No. 3 (1994), pp. 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; 1780 [[Drusti parish|Drostenhof]], [[Governorate of Livonia]], [[Russian Empire]] ‚Äì December 24, 1833) was a [[Baltic German]] who held the rank of [[History of Russian military ranks|Captain of the 1st rank]] in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. He was a maritime explorer of [[Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], and served briefly in 1817-1818 as the second Chief Manager of the [[Russian-American Company]].

== Career in the Navy ==
Hagemeister was born to an ethnic [[Baltic German]] family in the Russian Empire. He began his service in the Russian naval forces in 1795 as a volunteer midshipman. Along with a group of fellow junior servicemen, he joined the [[British Royal Navy]] in 1802 on board the [[HMS Argus (1799)|''HMS Argus'']].&lt;ref name=Pierce&gt;Pierce, Richard A. ''Russian America: A Biographical Dictionary.'' Kingston, Canada: The Limestone Press. 1990, pp. 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806 he was directed to take the [[Russian warship Neva|''Neva'']] with provisions needed to [[Russian America]]; this was the first of three [[circumnavigation]]s in his career to [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]].&lt;ref name=Baltic/&gt; Departing on 20 October 1806 from [[Kronstadt]], the ''Neva'' began to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south, to go around the continent of Africa and sail East. After passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]], Hagemeister and his subordinates were the first Russian crew to visit the [[Australian mainland]], reaching the port of [[Sydney|Port Jackson]] on 4 June.&lt;ref name=Pierce/&gt;

Reaching [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]] (now Sitka, Alaska) on 13 September, Hagemeister was stationed on [[Kodiak Island]] for most of 1808. The Russian forces were at war with the Tlingit. He was ordered by Chief Manager of the [[Russian American Company]] (RAC), [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Aleksandr Baranov]], to secure needed provisions from the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] on 30 November 1808 and perhaps find a suitable location for a Russian colony there.&lt;ref name=Pierce/&gt; Hagemeister explored portions of the North Pacific and met with King [[Kamehameha I]] in early 1809. Amicable conversations were commenced with the monarch and Hagemeister purchased a cargo of salt.&lt;ref name=Pierce/&gt; Delivering the salt to New Archangel, he later departed for [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1810 on the ''Neva''.

Hagemeister reached [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on 28 May and began the overland trek through [[Siberia]]. His circumnavigation was recognized by Russian authorities at St. Petersburg, as he was promoted to [[Captain lieutenant]] and awarded the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] 4th class.&lt;ref name=Pierce/&gt; He served as chairman of the [[Admiralty]] of [[Irkutsk]] from 1812 to 1815, in which capacity Hagemeister was responsible for building the first ships to cross [[Lake Baikal]].

[[Vasily Golovnin]] encouraged him to plan another journey to New Archangel, and worked for his appointment to an RAC ship. Besides delivering more needed provisions, Hagemeister was ordered to investigate Baranov's financial management of the company and deputed to replace him as Chief Manager if he felt it necessary. Baranov, then 70, had requested relief from his position for years in order to return to Russia.&lt;ref name=Borneman&gt;Borneman, Walter R. ''Alaska, Saga of a Bold Land.'' New York City: HarperCollins. 2003, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Commanding the ''Kutuzov'', Hagemeister started his second circumnavigation in 1816. Hagemeister arrived at New Archangel during 1817, with his second-in-command, [[Semyon Yanovsky]].

Before examining Baranov's financial records, Hagemeister traveled to northern [[California]] to formalize relations with the [[Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria|Kashia Pomo]] people. He was the principal negotiator with leaders of the local Pomo band, and obtained the privilege to establish [[Fort Ross]]. The parties signed a treaty on 22 September 1817, with tribal officials reported to have said that "They are very pleased to see Russians occupy this land, for they now live in safety from other Indians who used to attack them from time to time. This security began only from the time of Russian settlement."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer-Hancock, Diane, William E. Pritchard and Ina Kaliakin. "Notes to the 1817 Treaty between the Russian American Company and Kashaya Pomo Indians." ''California History'' 59, No. 4 (1980/1981), pp 306-313.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was made by RAC officials as a part of a scheme to take over [[Alta California]] from the [[Spanish Empire]].

Returning to New Archangel, Hagemeister and other naval officers spent the winter examining the financial records of the RAC. Sources disagree on what was found: Khlebnikov says that the records showed no evidence of malfeasance.&lt;ref&gt;Khlebnikov, K.T., 1973, ''Baranov, Chief Manager of the Russian Colonies in America,'' Kingston: The Limestone Press, {{ISBN|0919642500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borneman says that they found a discrepancy in the amount of supplies listed in accounting records.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt;  On 11 January 1818 Baranov was, "in a most arrogant way",&lt;ref name=Baltic/&gt; removed by Hagemeister from office.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt;

Hagemeister took over, changing the methods of payment to the ''[[promyslenniki]]'' workers, by giving currency for salaries and abandoning the share system in favor of provisions.&lt;ref name=Baltic/&gt; He worked to improve relations with the Hawaiian Kingdom, as they had been damaged from the [[Sch√§ffer affair]]. Hagemeister outlawed trade by non-RAC Europeans, a policy later adopted by the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Lydia T. ''Russians in Alaska, 1732-1867.'' Fairbanks, AK: University of Alaska Press. 2004, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was contained in the [[Ukase of 1821]], a decree from the Imperial Government that extended Russian land claims to northern California and banned all non-Russian European merchants from the area.

Hagemeister appointed his direct second-in-command, [[Semyon Ivanovich Yanovsky]], as the next Chief Manager.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; In late October 1818, Hagemeister and Baranov departed from New Archangel; the latter was pleased to be at last returning to Russia. But Baranov died in 1819, while they were still at sea, and was buried at sea. In 1820 Yanovsky was replaced by another naval officer, chosen directly by the Board of the RAC.

In 1828‚Äì1829, Hagemeister made his final circumnavigation on the ship ''Krotky''. During this journey, he surveyed the [[Kwajalein|Menshikov Atoll (Kwajalein)]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], plotting it on the map and specifying the location of some other islands. His diaries are composed in several European languages, including [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=Baltic/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4568">The helicity of a smooth vector field defined on a domain in 3D space is the standard measure of the extent to which the field lines wrap and coil around one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella J, DeTurck D, Gluck H, et al. Influence of geometry and topology on helicity[J]. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1029/GM111 Magnetic Helicity in Space and Laboratory Plasmas], 1999: 17-24. {{doi|10.1029/GM111p0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to magnetic helicity, this "vector field" is magnetic field. It is a generalization of the topological concept of [[linking number]] to the differential quantities required to describe the magnetic field. As with many quantities in electromagnetism, magnetic helicity (which describes magnetic field lines) is closely related to [[Hydrodynamical helicity|fluid mechanical helicity]] (which describes fluid flow lines).

If magnetic field lines follow the strands of a twisted [[rope]], this configuration would have nonzero magnetic helicity; left-handed ropes would have negative values and right-handed ropes would have positive values.

Formally,
:&lt;math&gt; H = \int {\mathbf A}\cdot{\mathbf B}\,d^3{\mathbf r} &lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt; is the helicity of the entire magnetic field {{Clarify|date=February 2016}}
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field strength 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vector potential]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf B}=\nabla\times{\mathbf A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d^3{\mathbf r} &lt;/math&gt; is the differential volume element for the [[volume integral]]

Magnetic helicity has units of Wb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Weber (unit)|weber]]s squared) in SI units and Mx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]]s squared) in Gaussian Units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/ppd/sites/www.nrl.navy.mil.ppd/files/pdfs/NRL_FORMULARY_13.pdf|title=NRL Plasma Formulary 2013 PDF|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]] in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (zero resistivity), and still remains conserved in a good approximation even with a small but finite resistivity, in which case [[magnetic reconnection]] dissipates [[energy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}   The concept is useful in [[Sun|solar dynamics]] and in [[dynamo theory]].&lt;ref&gt;

Magnetic helicity is a gauge-dependent quantity, because &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; can be redefined by adding a gradient to it (gauge transformation). However, for perfectly conducting boundaries or periodic systems without a net magnetic flux, the magnetic helicity is gauge invariant. A gauge-invariant ''relative helicity'' has been defined for volumes with non-zero magnetic flux on their boundary surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;

At speeds close to, and faster than, the maneuvering speed, full deflection of any [[flight control surface]] should not be attempted because of the risk of damage to the aircraft structure.&lt;ref name=AC23-19A&gt;[[Federal Aviation Administration]], [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/d1a4060f22939f36862572eb0061ca3f/$FILE/AC%2023-19A.pdf Advisory Circular 23-19A, ''Airframe Guide for Certification of Part 23 Airplanes'', Section 48 (p.27)] Retrieved 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

The maneuvering speed of an aircraft is shown on a cockpit placard and in the aircraft's flight manual but is not commonly shown on the aircraft's [[airspeed indicator]].

In the context of [[air combat maneuvering]] (ACM), the maneuvering speed is also known as '''corner speed''' or '''cornering speed'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder5/NFO_SNFO/P-821(2).PDF CNATRA P-821 (Rev. 01-08) "Flight Training Instruction, Advanced Naval Flight Officer (T-45C)".] ''Department of the Navy'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

It has been widely misunderstood that flight below maneuvering speed will provide total protection from [[structural failure]]. In response to the destruction of [[American Airlines Flight 587]], a [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] Final Rule was issued clarifying that "flying at or below the design maneuvering speed does not allow a pilot to make multiple large control inputs in one airplane axis or single full control inputs in more than one airplane axis at a time". Such actions "may result in structural failures at any speed, including below the maneuvering speed."&lt;ref name=faa&gt;Federal Aviation Administration, [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/395c3f064247018a862577b200495b5a!OpenDocument 14CFR ¬ß25.1583 Final Rule] Retrieved 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design maneuvering speed V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;==
V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the design maneuvering speed and is a [[calibrated airspeed]].  Maneuvering speed cannot be slower than &lt;math&gt;V_s \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; and need not be greater than V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=0eb6ca22ab5efa94f23f757d30af7726&amp;h=L&amp;n=14y1.0.1.3.10&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML#14:1.0.1.3.10.3.70.9 14 CFR &amp;sect;23.335(c)(2)] Definition of Maneuvering Speed&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;V_A&lt;/math&gt; is chosen by the manufacturer to be exacly &lt;math&gt;V_s \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; the aircraft will stall in a nose-up pitching maneuver before the structure is subjected to its limiting aerodynamic load.  However, if &lt;math&gt;V_A&lt;/math&gt; is selected to be greater than &lt;math&gt;V_s \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the structure will be subjected to loads which exceed the limiting load unless the pilot checks the maneuver.

The maneuvering speed or maximum operating maneuvering speed depicted on a cockpit placard is calculated for the maximum weight of the aircraft.  Some [[Pilot's Operating Handbook]]s also present safe speeds for weights less than the maximum.

The formula used to calculate a safe speed for a lower weight is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V_A \sqrt{W_2 \over W_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is maneuvering speed (at maximum weight), W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is actual weight, W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is maximum weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Jeppesen Instrument/Commercial Manual |year=2000 |ISBN=0-88487-274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximum operating maneuvering speed V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;==
Some aircraft have a maximum operating maneuvering speed V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;.  Note that this is a different concept than design maneuvering speed.  The concept of maximum operating maneuvering speed was introduced to the US [[Type certificate|type-certification]] standards for light aircraft in 1993.&lt;ref name=AC23-19A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/2A0AA756267EFE8F85256687007232CC?OpenDocument USA 14CFR ¬ß23.1557] Retrieved 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum operating maneuvering speed is selected by the aircraft designer and cannot be more than &lt;math&gt;V_s \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speed of the aircraft, and ''n'' is the maximal allowed positive [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]].

{{short description|The temperature minimum at the boundary between the mesosphere and the thermosphere}}
 
The '''mesopause''' is the temperature minimum at the boundary between the [[mesosphere]] and the [[thermosphere]] [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] regions. Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong [[radiative cooling]] from [[carbon dioxide]], the mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (-148&amp;nbsp;¬∞F or 173 [[Kelvin|K]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. "mesosphere". Compendium of Chemical Terminology Internet edition&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude of the mesopause for many years was assumed to be at around 85&amp;nbsp;km (53&amp;nbsp;mi.), but observations to higher altitudes and modeling studies in the last 10 years have shown that in fact the mesopause consists of two minima - one at about 85&amp;nbsp;km and a stronger minimum at about 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Xu, Jiyao|author2=Liu, H.-L.|author3=Yuan, W.|author4=Smith, A.K.|author5=Roble, R. G.|author6=Mertens, C.J.|author7=Russell, J.M.|author8=Mlynczak, M.G.|title=Mesopause structure from Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED)/Sounding of the Atmosphere Using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER)|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=112|issue=D9|doi=10.1029/2006jd007711|bibcode=2007JGRD..112.9102X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature is that the summer mesopause is cooler than the winter (sometimes referred to as the ''mesopause anomaly''). It is due to a summer-to-winter circulation giving rise to upwelling at the summer pole and downwelling at the winter pole. Air rising will expand and cool resulting in a cold summer mesopause and conversely downwelling air results in compression and associated increase in temperature at the winter mesopause. In the mesosphere the summer-to-winter circulation is due to [[gravity wave]] dissipation, which deposits momentum against the mean east-west flow, resulting in a small north-south circulation.&lt;ref&gt;The Physics of Atmospheres, John Theodore Houghton, section and references therein of ''The general circulation of the middle atmosphere''&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the mesopause has also been the focus of studies on global [[climate change]] associated with increases in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Unlike the [[troposphere]], where [[greenhouse gases]] result in the atmosphere heating up, increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[mesosphere]] acts to cool the atmosphere due to increased radiative emission. This results in a measurable effect - the mesopause should become cooler with increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Observations do show a decrease of temperature of the mesopause, though the magnitude of this decrease varies and is subject to further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beig|first1=G.|last2=Keckhut|first2=P.|last3=Lowe|first3=R.P.|display-authors=etal|title=Review of mesospheric temperature trends (2003)|journal=Rev.

[[Image:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|right]]

'''[[Saudi Arabia]]''' is not known to have a '''[[nuclear weapons]] program'''. From an official and public standpoint, Saudi Arabia has been an opponent of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, having signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], and is a member of the coalition of countries demanding a [[Nuclear-weapon-free zone]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://disarmament.un.org/TreatyStatus.nsf/NPT%20(in%20alphabetical%20order)?OpenView&amp;Start=1.145 Parties to the NPT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nti.org"&gt;Akaki Dvali. Center for Nonproliferation Studies (nti.org) (March 2004). ''[http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_40a.html Will Saudi Arabia Acquire Nuclear Weapons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210020335/http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_40a.html |date=10 February 2007 }}''; Arnaud de Borchgrave. ''Washington Times'' (22 October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of nuclear proliferation have not identified Saudi Arabia as a country of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), US Congress, ''Technologies Underlying Weapons of Mass Destruction'' (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 12/93), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Weapons of mass destruction}}

However, over the years there have been media reports of Saudi Arabia's intent to purchase a nuclear weapon from an outside source. In 2003, a leaked strategy paper laid out three possible options for the Saudi government: to acquire a nuclear deterrent, to ally with and become protected by an existing nuclear nation, or to try to reach agreement on having a nuclear-free Middle East. UN officials and weapon specialists have suggested this review was prompted by a distancing of relations with the US, concerns over Iran's nuclear program, and the lack of international pressure on Israel to give up its nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (18 September 2003). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/saudi/story/0,11599,1044402,00.html Saudis consider nuclear bomb]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear deal with United States ==

In May 2008, the [[United States]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] signed a [[memorandum of understanding]], as part of the United States' vintage [[Atoms for Peace]] program, to boost Saudi efforts for a civilian nuclear program.  This program did not involve support for development of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080516.wsaudioil0516/BNStory/Business |title=reportonbusiness.com: Purchase this article&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=6 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218160252/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080516.wsaudioil0516/BNStory/Business |archive-date=18 December 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MeshkatiHuffPost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/najmedin-meshkati/atoms-for-peace-in-the-pe_b_4552716.html | title=Atoms for Peace in the Persian Gulf: The Vital Byproduct of P5+1 Nuclear Agreement With Iran | publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc | date=1 January 2014 | accessdate=14 January 2016 | author=Meshkati, Najmedin | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310121052/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/najmedin-meshkati/atoms-for-peace-in-the-pe_b_4552716.html | archive-date=10 March 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan's involvement==

{{Main|Pakistan‚ÄìSaudi Arabia relations|Science in Pakistan}}
Historically, [[Pakistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] have had a cordial [[Special relationship (international relations)|relationship]].&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce Riedel|title=Saudi Arabia: Nervously Watching Pakistan: For the Saudi Arabia Kingdom, Pakistan remains a unique partner|url=http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0128_saudi_arabia_riedel.aspx|work=Brookings 1775 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20036|publisher=Brookings Inc.|accessdate=14 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205150154/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0128_saudi_arabia_riedel.aspx|archive-date=5 February 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pakistani political scientists and historians have noted that Saudi interest in nuclear technology began in the 1970s after [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] convened a meeting of Pakistan's leading theoretical physicists (who went on to join the [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]]) with the [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi royal government]] during a visit by the [[Saudi royal family]] to Pakistan in 1974 as part of the [[Organization of Islamic Conference|2nd OIC conference at Lahore]]. At this meeting, Bhutto noted the advances made in the [[Israeli nuclear program|Israeli]] and the [[Indian nuclear programme]]s, which he took as attempts to intimidate the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."/&gt;

It is widely believed that Saudi Arabia has been a major financier of Pakistan's own integrated [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic bomb project]] since 1974, a programme founded by former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Australian'' (originally from ''The Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomlinson|first=Hugh|title=Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons to counter Iran|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/saudi-arabia-to-acquire-nuclear-weapons-to-counter-iran/story-fnb64oi6-1226268171576|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=''The Australian'' (originally from ''The Times''|date=11 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201716/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/saudi-arabia-to-acquire-nuclear-weapons-to-counter-iran/story-fnb64oi6-1226268171576|archive-date=10 February 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, Chief Martial Law Administrator and [[President of Pakistan|President]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] paid a state visit to Saudi Arabia where he unofficially told the King that: "Our achievements are yours".&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."/&gt; This cooperation was allegedly furthered by socialist prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1995.  In 1998, the conservative [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]] informed Saudi Arabia confidentially before ordering the nuclear tests (see ''[[Chagai-I]]'' and ''[[Chagai-II]]'') in the [[Ras Koh Hills|Weapon-testing labs-III]] (WTL) located in the [[Chagai Hills|Chagai remote site]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan Province]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."/&gt; In June 1998, the Prime Minister paid a farewell visit to [[King Fahd]] and publicly thanked the Saudi government for supporting the country after the tests.&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."/&gt; Shortly thereafter, [[Minister of Defense|Saudi Minister of Defense]] [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Sultan]] went with Prime Minister Sharif on a tour of a classified institute, the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories]] (KRL), where leading scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] briefed the Prince and Prime Minister Sharif on nuclear physics and sensitive issues involving nuclear explosive devices.&lt;ref name="Brookings Inc."/&gt;

Since 1998, [[Western world|Western]] diplomats and intelligence agencies have long believed that an agreement exists in which Pakistan would sell Saudi Arabia nuclear warheads and its own [[nuclear technology]] should security in the [[Persian Gulf]] deteriorate. Both countries have sharply denied the existence of such an agreement.&lt;ref name="The Australian'' (originally from ''The Times"/&gt; In 2003, globalsecurity.org reported that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had entered a secret agreement on nuclear cooperation providing Saudi Arabia with nuclear weapons technology in return for access to cheap [[Petroleum|oil]] for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/031022-pakistan_saudi-arabia.htm |title=Pakistan, Saudi Arabia in secret nuke pact&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=17 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513194353/http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/031022-pakistan_saudi-arabia.htm |archive-date=13 May 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, the [[Germany|German]] magazine ''[[Cicero (magazine)|Cicero]]'' reported that Saudi Arabia had, since 2003, received assistance from Pakistan to acquire nuclear missiles and warheads. Satellite photos allegedly reveal an underground city with nuclear silos containing [[Ghauri (strategic ballistic missile system)|Ghauri]] rockets in [[As Sulayyil|Al-Sulaiyil]], south of the capital [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;"Saudia [sic] Arabia working on secret nuclear program with Pakistan help‚Äì report", ''Forbes, from AFX News'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120115022055/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2006/03/28/afx2629000.html (March 28 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan has denied aiding Saudi Arabia in its nuclear ambitions.

'''&lt;big&gt;Israeli-Saudi's nuclear collaboration&lt;/big&gt;'''

Western security agencies believe that Israel is selling nuclear information to Saudi Arabia, ''Arabi21'' has reported. According to Israeli writer Ami Dor-on, such information will give the government in Riyadh nuclear weapons capabilities. Writing on the ''News One'' website, Dor-on said that the joint intention is to make sure that Iran will not be the only country in the region that possesses such weapons which threaten the security and safety of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180531-israel-is-selling-nuclear-information-to-saudi-arabia/|title=Israel ‚Äòis selling nuclear information‚Äô to Saudi Arabia|date=2018-05-31|work=Middle East Monitor|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720225439/https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180531-israel-is-selling-nuclear-information-to-saudi-arabia/|archive-date=20 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dor-on, the Tel Aviv is aware that Saudis would eventually make the move for developing nuclear weapons and want to make sure they would not go to other regional players such as Pakistan to obtain the know-how.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdnews.com/index/israel-selling-nuclear-information-to-saudi-israeli-expert/|title=Israel 'selling nuclear information' to Saudi: Israeli expert - AWDnews|website=www.awdnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721014159/http://www.awdnews.com/index/israel-selling-nuclear-information-to-saudi-israeli-expert/|archive-date=21 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saudi financing of Iraqi nuclear program==

In 1994, [[Mohammed al Khilewi]], second-in-command of the Saudi mission to the [[United Nations]], applied for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the [[United States]]. He provided a packet of 10,000 documents{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that allegedly described long-time Saudi support of the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi nuclear weapons program]]. According to these documents, during [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime in [[Iraq]] the Saudis supported the Iraqi nuclear program with $5 billion, on the condition that workable nuclear technology and possibly even nuclear weapons would be transferred to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/saudi/index.html |title=Saudi Arabia Special Weapons&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=17 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518062207/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/saudi/index.html |archive-date=18 May 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khilewi obtained asylum in the US, with the consent of Saudi Arabia. Khilewi's allegations have not been confirmed by any other source. US officials have stated that they have no evidence of Saudi assistance to Iraqi nuclear development.&lt;ref&gt;http://cns.miis.edu/research/wmdme/saudi.htm#1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511155802/http://cns.miis.edu/research/wmdme/saudi.htm#1 |date=11 May 2008 }} Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi officials denied the allegations.&lt;ref name="nti.org"/&gt;

Senior [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] officials responsible for Mideast affairs at the time Khilewi sought asylum, including [[Robert Pelletreau]] of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and [[Bruce Riedel]] of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], said they found nothing in Khilewi's debriefings to back up the Media reports about a Saudi nuclear program. "There was nothing there," Pelletreau said. (Vartan 2005)

==Nuclear sharing with Arab States of the Persian Gulf nuclear programs==
{{Main|Nuclear sharing}}
The [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]] plan to start their own joint civilian nuclear program.  An agreement in the final days of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration provided for cooperation between the United Arab Emirates and the United States of America in which the United States would sell the UAE nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel.  The UAE would, in return, renounce their right to enrich uranium for their civilian nuclear program.  At the time of signing, this agreement was touted as a way to reduce risks of [[nuclear proliferation]] in the Persian Gulf. However, Mustafa Alani of the [[Dubai]]-based [[Gulf Research Center]] stated that, should the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty collapse, nuclear reactors such as those slated to be sold to the UAE under this agreement could provide the UAE with a path toward a nuclear weapon, raising the specter of further nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name="AP on UAE nuclear pact"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Jan21/0,4675,MLMideastUSNuclear,00.html |title=US-UAE nuclear energy pact has messages for Iran |publisher= Associated Press |date=21 January 2009 |accessdate= 10 Sep 2014 |author= Dareini, Ali Akbar |page=1 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140911012422/http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Jan21/0,4675,MLMideastUSNuclear,00.html |archive-date= 11 September 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, foreign ministers of the six-member [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] met in Saudi Arabia to discuss progress in plans agreed in December 2006, for a joint civilian nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0521283720070305 |title=Saudi defends Gulf Arab atom plans, criticizes Iran {{!}} International {{!}} Reuters |access-date=2 July 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070307091257/http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0521283720070305 |archive-date=7 March 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
In 2011, Prince [[Turki al-Faisal]], who has served as the Saudi intelligence chief and as ambassador to the United States has
suggested that the kingdom might consider producing nuclear weapons if it found itself between the atomic arsenals of Iran and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-may-seek-nuclear-weapons-prince-says.html |work=The New York Times |title=Saudi Arabia May Seek Nuclear Weapons, Prince Says |date=6 December 2011 |access-date=27 February 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170417135751/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-may-seek-nuclear-weapons-prince-says.html |archive-date= 17 April 2017 |dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it was confirmed that Saudi Arabia would launch its own nuclear weapons program immediately if Iran successfully developed nuclear weapons. In such an eventuality, Saudi Arabia would start work on a new ballistic missile platform, purchase nuclear warheads from overseas and aim to source uranium to develop weapons-grade material.

Officials in the U.S. alliance believe Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have an understanding in which [[Islamabad]] would supply the kingdom with warheads if security in the Persian Gulf was threatened. A U.S. official told ''[[The Times]]'' that Riyadh could have the nuclear warheads in a matter of days of approaching Islamabad. Pakistan's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Naeem Khan, was quoted as saying that "Pakistan considers the security of Saudi Arabia not just as a diplomatic or an internal matter but as a personal matter." Naeem also said that the Saudi leadership considered Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to be one country. Any threat to Saudi Arabia is also a threat to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/10/10369793-report-saudi-arabia-to-buy-nukes-if-iran-tests-a-bomb |title={title} |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213030211/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/10/10369793-report-saudi-arabia-to-buy-nukes-if-iran-tests-a-bomb |archive-date=13 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vendors were also likely to enter into a bidding war if Riyadh indicated that it was seeking nuclear warheads.

===2013 revelations===
In November 2013, a variety of sources told [[Newsnight|BBC Newsnight]] that Saudi Arabia had invested in [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistani nuclear weapons projects]] and believes it could obtain nuclear bombs at will. Earlier in the year, a senior [[NATO]] decision maker told [[Mark Urban]], a senior diplomatic and defense editor, that he had seen intelligence reporting that nuclear weapons made in Pakistan on behalf of Saudi Arabia are now sitting ready for delivery. In October 2013, [[Amos Yadlin]], a former head of [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Israeli military intelligence]], told a conference in [[Sweden]] that if [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]] got the bomb, "the Saudis will not wait one month. They already paid for the bomb, they will go to Pakistan and bring what they need to bring." Since 2009, when [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] of Saudi Arabia warned visiting US special envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross that if Iran crossed the threshold, "we will get nuclear weapons", the kingdom has sent the Americans numerous signals of its intentions. Gary Samore, who until March 2013 was President Barack Obama's counter-proliferation adviser, told [[Newsnight|BBC Newsnight]]: "I do think that the Saudis believe that they have some understanding with Pakistan that, in extremis, they would have claim to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan."&lt;ref name=bbc-20131106&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24823846 |title=Saudi nuclear weapons 'on order' from Pakistan |author=Mark Urban |publisher=BBC |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107025033/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24823846 |archive-date=7 November 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
According to the US based think-tank, the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], the BBC report on possible [[nuclear sharing]] between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia is partially incorrect. There is no indication of the validity or credibility of the BBC‚Äôs sources, nor does the article expand on what essentially constitutes an unverified lead. It noted that if Pakistan were to transfer nuclear warheads onto Saudi soil, it is highly unlikely that either nation would face any international repercussions if both nations were to follow strict nuclear sharing guidelines similar to that of [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://poniforum.csis.org/blog/no-price-is-right-why-the-bbc-is-incorrect-about-a-saudi-arabia-p |title={title} |access-date=19 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714205353/http://poniforum.csis.org/blog/no-price-is-right-why-the-bbc-is-incorrect-about-a-saudi-arabia-p |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research paper produced by the [[British House of Commons]] [[Defence Select Committee]] states that as long as current NATO nuclear sharing arrangements remain in place, NATO states would have few valid grounds for complaint if such a transfer were to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |page=Ev 80 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmdfence/111/111.pdf#page=208 |title=The future of NATO and European defence |work=Defence Select Committee |publisher=UK Parliament |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040212/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmdfence/111/111.pdf#page=208 |archivedate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missile capability==
{{Main|Royal Saudi Strategic Missile Force}}
In 1987, Saudi Arabia purchased Chinese-made [[DF-3A|CSS-2]] [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/30/why-did-saudi-arabia-buy-chinese-missiles/ |title={title} |access-date=6 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913185022/http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/30/why-did-saudi-arabia-buy-chinese-missiles/ |archive-date=13 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed and used by the Chinese as a nuclear-armed missile, but reportedly sold to Saudi Arabia with conventional high-explosive warheads. However their low [[circular error probable]] accuracy (1‚Äì1.5&amp;nbsp;km) makes them unsuitable for effective military use against military targets when carrying a conventional warhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/theater/df-3a.htm |title={title} |access-date=2 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171821/https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/theater/df-3a.htm |archive-date=4 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSS-2 has a range of 4,850&amp;nbsp;km with a payload of either 2,150 or 2,500&amp;nbsp;kg.

''Newsweek'' quoted an anonymous source in 2014 that Saudi Arabia had acquired [[DF-21|CSS-5]] [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s from China in 2007 with "Washington's quiet approval on the condition that CIA technical experts could verify they were not designed to carry nuclear warheads".&lt;ref name="Stein2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-cia-helped-saudis-secret-chinese-missile-deal-227283 | title="Exclusive: CIA Helped Saudis in Secret Chinese Missile Deal" | publisher=NEWSWEEK LLC | work=Newsweek (Web site) | date=29 January 2014 | accessdate=10 September 2016 | author=Stein, Jeff | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917172201/http://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-cia-helped-saudis-secret-chinese-missile-deal-227283 | archive-date=17 September 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] lists the CSS-5 as being capable of carrying either 250-[[kiloton]] or 500-kiloton nuclear or various types of conventional high-explosive warheads.&lt;ref name="CSIS2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/dong-feng-21-df-21/ | title="DONGFENG-21 (DF-21/CSS-5 MODS 1, 2, 6)" | publisher=The Center for Strategic and International Studies Missile Defense Project | work=Missile Threat (Web site) | date=13 April 2016 | accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSS-5, while it has a comparatively shorter range (2,800&amp;nbsp;km) and half the [[payload]] (1 ton) of the CSS-2, is solid-fueled, thus can be set up and placed on alert status more easily than the liquid-fueled CSS-2, and its accuracy is much greater ([[circular error probable]] of 30 meters).&lt;ref name="StrategyPage 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://strategypage.com/htmw/htart/articles/20140210.aspx | title="Artillery: Saudi Ballistic Missiles Secretly Upgraded" | publisher=StrategyWorld.com | date=10 February 2014 | accessdate=10 September 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008215740/https://strategypage.com/htmw/htart/articles/20140210.aspx | archive-date=8 October 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peacekeeper Rail Garrison''' is a [[Railroad car#Mobile missile systems|mobile missile system]] that was developed by the [[United States Air Force]] during the 1980s as part of a plan to place fifty [[MGM-118A Peacekeeper]]&lt;ref&gt;Parsch 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] on the rail network of the United States. The railcars were intended, in case of increased threat of [[nuclear war]], to be deployed onto the nation's rail network to avoid being destroyed by a [[first strike]] [[counterforce]] attack by the [[Soviet Union]]. However the plan was cancelled as part of defense cutbacks following the end of the [[Cold War]], and the Peacekeeper missiles were installed in [[missile silo|silo launchers]] as LGM-118s instead.

Train-based ICBMs do offer some advantages over missiles in fixed silos, namely that the enemy can never be sure where they are, or more accurately, where all of them are at any given moment. But as a 2014 RAND study&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG1210.html&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out, rail and truck launchers have their drawbacks. Maintaining a missile on a train is more difficult than in a silo, while rail lines and roads can be blocked by snow, which tends to restrict railroad ICBMs to warmer climates. In addition, because there are only a limited number of rail lines and highways in an area, enemy surveillance can focus on a few areas. And, once located, mobile missiles are more vulnerable than ICBMs in hardened silos.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalinterest.org/blog/russias-nuclear-missile-death-train-arriving-2019-19581&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Convair-General Dynamics Plant and Personnel-Peacekeeper Rail Garrison (8126202147).jpg|thumbnail|left|Train pulling the Garrison car, which would be painted to resemble a standard rail car. (Missile hidden inside)]]
On December 19, 1986, the [[White House]] announced that U.S. [[President of the United States of America|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had given approval to a plan for the development of a railroad-based system for basing part of the planned [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] ‚Äì originally referred to as "M-X"&lt;ref name="USWM"/&gt; ‚Äì  intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force.&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt; Intended to increase the survivability of the force in the event of a [[counterforce]] nuclear attack by the Soviet Union, the 50 train-based missile launchers, fitted two to each of twenty-five trains, would supplement a force of 50 silo-based missiles that would replace existing [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] missiles.&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Air launch and mobile dispersion in trenches were also considered as basing options for the M-X missile.&lt;ref name="USWM"&gt;Dornan 1978, p. 67, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; |group=N}}

Each train was planned to [[consist]] of two [[locomotive]]s (appeared to be [[EMD GP40-2]] in unclassified diagrams &lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/spp/military/program/smc_hist/SMCHOV8.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;), two cars for housing security forces (using a modified box car), two launchers each holding a single missile (using a modified box car), a launch control car (using a modified Westinghouse box car), a [[tank car|fuel car]], and a maintenance car (using a modified box car).&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt; Each launching car would carry one missile in a tube that, upon the receipt of an authenticated firing command, would elevate to fire the missile from the bed of the car. The launch cars were {{convert|87|ft|m|2}} long, and when loaded with a missile weighed over {{convert|550000|lb|kg}} or {{convert|275|ST|LT t|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt; A crew of 42 people‚Äîincluding the train commander, four launch control officers, four railroad engineers, one medic, six maintenance personnel, and 26 security police‚Äîcould live in the launch control and security cars for up to one month.&lt;ref name="VAFB_1992"&gt;Vandenberg AFB 30th Space Wing History, 1992-1993, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Following testing in 1989 at Hudson, CO two ex-CSX  locomotives, an EMD GP40-2 and an EMD GP38-2, were sent to Precision National in Mount Vernon, IL for modification to GP40-2DE (Dynamic braking, Extended range) with bulletproof glass in the cab windows. The trains were expected to be in service within about 2 years. [[Strategic Air Command]] wanted the first trains stationed at [[F. E. Warren Air Force Base]] near the [[Union Pacific]] mainline at Cheyenne, WY. The expected in-service date was December 1992. Rail Garrisons would resemble small freight yards with four spurs leading to slant-sided steel and earthen hardened shelters to house the trains.

Two hi-cube boxcars were constructed by St Louis Refrigerator Car Company. They were modified at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], receiving bogie trucks, distributing their {{convert|550000|lb|kg}} of weight over 8 axles. Low-slung beams were added to the underside to level the car against the track during launch. {{convert|80|ft|m|2|adj=on}} roof panels were designed to fall off when the missile was erected. The Air Force was seeking US$2.16 billion in fiscal year 1991 to purchase the first seven MX trains.

The deployment plan called for the trains to be permanently based in shelters that would be constructed on [[Strategic Air Command]] bases throughout the United States, with the missile crews on continuous alert.&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt; Ten bases were in the running; [[Fairchild Air Force Base]] (Spokane, WA), [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]] (Great Falls, MT), [[Minot Air Force Base]] (Minot, ND), [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]] (Grand Forks, ND), [[Dyess Air Force Base]] (Abilene, TX), [[Whiteman Air Force Base]], Knob Noster, MO), [[Blytheville Air Force Base]] (Blytheville, AR), [[Little Rock Air Force Base]] (Little Rock, AR), [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] (Shreveport, LA), and [[Wurtsmith Air Force Base]] (Oscoda, MI). Upon the receipt of a signal indicating an increase in alert level, the trains would be "flushed", dispersing onto the American railroad network,&lt;ref name="Peacenik"&gt;Croddy, Wirtz and Larsen 2005, p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it difficult for an enemy to determine where the missiles were at any given time to target them.&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt;

Major contractors for the rail garrison system were Boeing Aerospace Corporation, Westinghouse Marine Division and Rockwell International Autonetics. The proposed main garrison for the weapons deployment system was to be [[F.E. Warren Air Force Base]] in [[Wyoming]], with each selected garrison hosting up to four trains.&lt;ref name="Draft"&gt;Peacekeeper Rail Garrison Program EIS&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years of development, the prototype Rail Garrison Car was delivered to the U.S. Air Force on October 4, 1990. After undergoing initial evaluation at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], the car was then sent to the [[Transportation Test Center]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] for further testing on the [[Association of American Railroads]]' test track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9476915.html |title=Rockwell delivers first functional car for Peacekeeper Rail Garrison launch control system |date=October 4, 1990 |publisher=PR Newswire |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, with the end of the Cold War, the Peacekeeper rail garrison system was cancelled.&lt;ref name="USAF"/&gt; As a result, all operational Peacekeeper missiles produced were installed in former Minuteman silos.&lt;ref&gt;Graham 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following termination, the prototype rail garrison car was delivered to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in 1994 for public display.&lt;ref name="USAF"&gt;USAF fact sheet, "Peacekeeper Rail Garrison Car"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White Petrolatum1.jpg|thumb|Petroleum jelly]]
'''Petroleum jelly''', '''petrolatum''', '''white petrolatum''', '''soft paraffin'''/'''paraffin''' wax or '''multi-hydrocarbon''', [[CAS number]] 8009-03-8, is a [[semi-solid]] mixture of [[hydrocarbon]]s (with [[carbon number]]s mainly higher than 25),&lt;ref name=inchem&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1440.htm |title=Petrolatum (white) |work=inchem.org |publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety and the Commission of the European Communities |date=March 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally promoted as a topical [[ointment]] for its healing properties.

After petroleum jelly became a medicine chest staple, consumers began to use it for many ailments, as well as cosmetic purposes, including [[Onychomycosis|toenail fungus]], genital rashes (non-[[sexually transmitted disease|STD]]), [[nosebleed]]s, [[diaper rash]], and [[Common cold|chest colds]]. Its folkloric medicinal value as a "cure-all" has since been limited by better scientific understanding of appropriate and inappropriate uses. It is recognized by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as an approved [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC) [[skin]] protectant and remains widely used in [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] skin care.

== History ==
[[File:US127568 Vaseline patent.TIF|thumb|Original US patent application for the Vaseline product]]
The raw material for petroleum jelly was discovered in 1859 in [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], on some of the country's first  [[Drilling rig|oil rigs]]. Workers disliked the [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]]-like material forming on rigs because it caused them to malfunction, but they used it on cuts and burns because they believed that it hastened healing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The History of Vaseline Petroleum Jelly began in the Pennsylvania Oil Fields!, Drake Well Museum pamphlet, copyright 1996 by Holigan Group Ltd, Dallas, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaseline.com.pk/about-us/history/ |title=Vasoline corporate history page |access-date=15 July 2015 |quote=...Chesebrough noticed that oil workers would smear their skin with the residue from their drills, as it had the property to heal their cuts and burns. He got curious and took some Rod Wax home where he started experimenting with it...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Chesebrough]], a young [[chemist]] whose previous work of [[distillation|distilling]] fuel from the oil of [[sperm whales]] had been rendered obsolete by [[petroleum]], went to Titusville to see what new materials had commercial potential. Chesebrough took the unrefined black "rod wax", as the drillers called it, back to his laboratory to refine it and explore potential uses.
Chesebrough discovered that by distilling the lighter, thinner oil products from the rod wax, he could create a light-colored gel. Chesebrough [[patent]]ed the process of making petroleum jelly by {{US patent|127568}} in 1872. The process involved [[vacuum distillation]] of the crude material followed by filtration of the still residue through [[bone char]].

Chesebrough traveled around [[New York (state)|New York]] demonstrating the product to encourage sales by burning his skin with acid or an open flame, then spreading the ointment on his injuries and showing his past injuries healed, he claimed, by his miracle product.

He opened his first factory in 1870 in [[Brooklyn]] using the name [[Vaseline]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Physical properties ==
Petroleum jelly is a mixture of hydrocarbons, having a melting point usually close to human body temperature, approximately {{convert|37|¬∞C|¬∞F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vaseline.com/Product.aspx?Path=Consumer/OurProducts/PetroleumJelly |title=Vaseline¬Æ &amp;#124; Petroleum Jelly |work=vaseline.com |year=2011 |quote=has a melting point just above body temperature |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is flammable only when heated to liquid; then the fumes will light, not the liquid itself, so a wick material like leaves, bark, or small twigs is needed to ignite petroleum jelly. It is colorless or has a pale yellow color (when not highly distilled), [[translucent]], and devoid of taste and smell when pure. It does not oxidize on exposure to the air and is not readily acted on by chemical reagents. It is insoluble in water. It is soluble in [[dichloromethane]], [[chloroform]], [[benzene]], [[diethyl ether]], [[carbon disulfide]] and oil of [[turpentine]].&lt;ref name="inchem"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makingcosmetics.com/msds1/msds-vaseline.pdf Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)] (June 15, 2007). MakingCosmetics.com Inc. Retrieved August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the specific application of petroleum jelly, it may be [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]], [[British Pharmacopoeia|B.P.]], or [[European Pharmacopoeia|Ph. Eur.]] grade. This pertains to the processing and handling of the petroleum jelly so it is suitable for medicinal and personal-care applications.

===Comparison with glycerol===

Because they feel similar when applied to human skin, there is a common misconception that petroleum jelly and [[glycerol]] (glycerine) are physically similar. Petroleum jelly is a non-polar [[hydrophobic]] (water-repelling) hydrocarbon and insoluble in water. Glycerol is an [[alcohol]] that is strongly [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (water-attracting): by continuously absorbing moisture from the air ([[hygroscopic]]), it produces the feeling of wetness on the skin. This feeling of wetness is similar to the feeling of greasiness produced by petroleum jelly.

== Uses ==
Most uses of petroleum jelly exploit its lubricating and coating properties.

=== Medical treatment ===

Vaseline brand First Aid Petroleum Jelly, or carbolated petroleum jelly containing [[phenol]] to give the jelly additional [[antibacterial]] effect, has been discontinued. During [[World War II]], a variety of petroleum jelly called ''red veterinary petrolatum,'' or Red Vet Pet for short, was often included in life raft survival kits. Acting as a [[sunscreen]], it provides protection against [[ultraviolet]] rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1  =MacEachern | first1 = William | first2 = Otis | last2 = Jillson | title = A Practical Sunscreen ‚Äì 'Red Vet Pet' | journal = Archives of Dermatology | pmid = 14070829 | year = 1964 | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 147‚Äì50 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.1964.01590250153027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Dermatology]] recommends keeping skin injuries moist with petroleum jelly to reduce scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proper wound care: How to minimize a scar |date=2017 |publisher=American Academy of Dermatology |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A verified medicinal use is to protect and prevent moisture loss of the skin of a patient in the initial post-operative period following laser skin resurfacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-69007-0_136 |chapter=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Laser Resurfacing Immediate Postoperative Care Prior to Complete Epithelialization |title=Pearls and Pitfalls in Cosmetic Oculoplastic Surgery |year=2008 |last1=Khan |first1=Jemshed A. |isbn=978-0-387-25389-3 |page=417 |editor1-first=Morris E. |editor1-last=Hartstein |editor2-first=John B. |editor2-last=Holds |editor3-first=Guy G. |editor3-last=Massry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00201.x |title=Resurfacing of Pitted Facial Acne Scars with a Long-Pulsed Er:YAG Laser |year=2001 |last1=Jeong |first1=Jeung-Tae |last2=Kye |first2=Young-Chul |journal=Dermatologic Surgery |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=107‚Äì10 |pmid=11207680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one case report published in 1994 indicating petroleum jelly should not be applied to the inside of the [[nose]] due to the risk of [[lipid pneumonia]], but this was only ever reported in one patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1378/chest.105.3.968 |title=Exogenous lipoid pneumonia due to nasal application of petroleum jelly |year=1994 |last1=Brown |first1=A.

H. |journal=Chest |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=968‚Äì9 |pmid=8131586}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, petroleum jelly is used extensively by otolaryngologists&amp;mdash;ear, nose, and throat surgeons&amp;mdash;for nasal moisture and [[epistaxis]] treatment, and to combat nasal crusting. Large studies have assessed petroleum jelly applied to the nose for short durations to have no significant side effects.&lt;ref&gt;Loughran S, Spinou E, Clement WA, et al.

Historically, it was also consumed for internal use and even promoted as "Vaseline confection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaseline |url=http://lcdl.library.cofc.edu/lcdl/catalog/lcdl:60674 |website=Lowcountry Digital Library |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903102600/http://lcdl.library.cofc.edu/lcdl/catalog/lcdl:60674 |archivedate=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Co1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chesebrough Manufacturing Co|title=Petroleum: Its Origin, Uses, and Future Development : a Highly Interesting Sketch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQZbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=1884|publisher=Chesebrough Manufacturing Company|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skin and hair care ===
Most petroleum jelly today is used as an ingredient in skin [[lotion]]s and cosmetics, providing various types of skin care and protection by minimizing friction or reducing moisture loss, or by functioning as a grooming aid.

==== Preventing moisture loss ====
By reducing moisture loss, petroleum jelly can prevent [[chapped lips|chapped hands and lips]], and soften nail cuticles.

This property is exploited to provide heat insulation: petroleum jelly can be used to keep swimmers warm in water when training or during channel crossings or long ocean swims. It can prevent chilling of the face due to evaporation of skin moisture during cold weather outdoor sports.

==== Hair grooming ====
In the first part of the twentieth century, petroleum jelly, either pure or as an ingredient, was also popular as a hair [[pomade]]. When used in a 50/50 mixture with pure [[beeswax]], it makes an effective [[moustache wax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=D.I.Y. Moustache Wax|author=[[Ted Sedman ]]|publisher=[[Handlebar Club]]|year=2007|url=https://www.handlebarclub.co.uk/wax/diy.shtml|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin lubrication ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to reduce the friction between skin and clothing during various sport activities, for example to prevent [[chafing (skin)|chafing]] of the seat region of cyclists, the [[nipples]] of long distance runners wearing loose T-shirts, and is commonly used in the [[crotch]] area of [[wrestlers]] and [[footballers]].

Petroleum jelly is commonly used as a [[personal lubricant]] because it does not dry out like water-based lubricants, and has a distinctive "feel", different from that of [[K-Y]] and related [[methylcellulose]] products.&lt;ref name=thebody&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thebody.com/content/art6019.html |title=Condoms Fact Sheet |work=thebody.com |date=June 4, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011|quote=The oils in ‚Ä¶ Vaseline ‚Ä¶ will make latex fall apart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not recommended for use with [[condoms]] during sexual activity because it swells latex and thus increases the chance of rupture. It is also not recommended for vaginal intercourse because it may increase the risk of [[yeast infection]] and bacterial vaginosis in women.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Product care and protection ===

==== Coating ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to coat corrosion-prone items such as metallic trinkets, non-stainless steel blades, and gun barrels prior to storage as it serves as an excellent and inexpensive water repellent. It is used as an environmentally friendly underwater antifouling coating for motor boats and sailing yachts. It was recommended in the [[Porsche]] owner‚Äôs manual as a preservative for light alloy (alleny) [[anodized]] [[Fuchs wheels]] to protect them against corrosion from road salts and brake dust. ‚ÄúEvery three months (after regular cleaning) the wheels should be coated with petroleum jelly.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;P. 61 Porsche Owner‚Äôs Manual 911 Turbo 911 Carrera WKD91102187&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finishing ====
It can be used to finish and protect wood, much like a mineral oil finish. It is used to condition and protect smooth leather products like bicycle saddles, boots, motorcycle clothing, and used to put a shine on patent leather shoes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A new use for Vaseline|url=https://archive.org/stream/hardwaremerch1890toro#page/n107/mode/1up|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Hardware|date=31 Jan 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; (when applied in a thin coat and then gently buffed off).

==== Lubrication ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to lubricate zippers and [[slide rule]]s. It was also recommended by Porsche in maintenance training documentation for lubrication (after cleaning) of "Weatherstrips on Doors, Hood, Tailgate, Sun Roof". The publication states "‚Ä¶before applying a new coat of lubricant‚Ä¶" "Only acid-free lubricants may be used, for example: glycerine, Vaseline, tire mounting paste, etc. These lubricants should be rubbed in, and excessive lubricant wiped off with a soft cloth."&lt;ref&gt;P.16 928S Maintenance and General Repairs - Service Training Center WKS006021&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in bullet lubricant compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fryxell|first1=Glen|title=From Ingot to Target: A Cast Bullet Guide for Handgunners|pages=Chapter 5, Cast bullet lubrication|url=http://www.lasc.us/Fryxell_Book_Chapter_5_Lubrication.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial production processes ===
Petroleum jelly is a useful material when incorporated into candle wax formulas. The petroleum jelly softens the overall blend, allows the candle to incorporate additional fragrance oil, and facilitates adhesion to the sidewall of the glass. Petroleum jelly is used to moisten nondrying modelling clay such as [[plasticine]], as part of a mix of hydrocarbons including those with greater ([[paraffin wax]]) and lesser ([[mineral oil]]) molecular weights. It is used as a tack reducer additive to printing inks to reduce paper lint "picking" from uncalendered paper stocks. It can be used as a release agent for plaster molds and castings. It is used in the leather industry as a waterproofing cream.

===Other===
====Explosives====

Petroleum jelly is mixed with a high proportion of strong inorganic chlorates due to it acting as a plasticizer and a fuel source. An example of this is [[Cheddite]] C which consists of a ratio of 9:1, KClO3 to petroleum jelly. This mixture is unable to detonate without the use of a [[Detonator|blasting cap]].

It was used as a stabiliser in the manufacture of the propellant [[Cordite]]. 

==== Mechanical, barrier functions ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to coat the inner walls of [[terrariums]] to prevent animals crawling out and escaping.

A stripe of petroleum jelly can be used to prevent the spread of a liquid. For example, it can be applied close to the hairline when using a home hair dye kit to prevent the hair dye from irritating or staining the skin. It is also used to prevent [[diaper rash]].

==== Surface cleansing ====
Petroleum jelly is used to gently clean a variety of surfaces, ranging from makeup removal from faces to tar stain removal from leather.

==== Pet care ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Petroleum jelly is used to moisturize the paws of dogs, and to inhibit fungal growth on aquatic turtles‚Äô shells. It is a common ingredient in hairball remedies for domestic cats.

=== Clean-up ===
Petroleum jelly is very sticky and hard to remove from non-[[biology|biological]] surfaces with the usual and customary cleaning agents typically found in the home. It may be [[solvent|dissolved]] with [[paint thinner]] or other petroleum solvents such as [[acetone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modelrailforum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=8860 |title=A solvent for petroleum jelly aka Vaseline - Model Rail Forum |accessdate=2012-10-18 |quote=General Purpose thinners, acetone or any petroleum based thinner, or even MEK will remove Vaseline.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dissolves many [[plastic]]s.

Petroleum jelly is slightly soluble in alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Beringer, Paul |author2=Troy, David A. |author3=Remington, Joseph P. |title=Remington, the science and practice of pharmacy |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2006 |page=1077 |quote=Solubility--Insoluble in water; almost insoluble in cold or hot alcohol or in cold dehydrated alcohol; freely soluble in benzene, carbon disulfide, chloroform, or turpentine oil; soluble in ether, solvent hexane, or in most fixed and volatile oils, the degree of solubility in these solvents varying with the composition of the petrolatum. |isbn=0-7817-4673-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFGSSSbaWjwC&amp;pg=PA1077#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid damage to plastics and minimize ventilation issues, [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol]] can be used to remove petroleum jelly from most surfaces. Isopropyl alcohol is inert to most household surfaces, including almost every plastic, and removes petroleum jelly efficiently. While alcohol causes fewer ventilation problems than petroleum solvents, ventilation is still recommended, especially if large surface areas are involved.

Petroleum jelly is also soluble in lower-molecular-weight oils. Using an oil to dissolve the petroleum jelly first can render it more soluble to solvents and soaps that would not dissolve pure petroleum jelly. Vegetable oils such as canola and olive oil are commonly used to aid in the removal of petroleum jelly from hair and skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Petroleum-Jelly-from-Hair-Using-Olive-Oil-and-Detergent|title=How to Remove Petroleum Jelly from Hair Using Olive Oil and Detergent|accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 German consumer watchdog [[Stiftung Warentest]] analyzed cosmetics containing mineral oils. After developing a new detection method they found high concentrations of Mineral Oil Aromatic Hydrocarbons (MOHA) and even polyaromatics in products containing mineral oils with Vaseline products containing the most MOHA of all tested cosmetics (up to 9%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.test.de/Mineraloele-in-Kosmetika-Kritische-Stoffe-in-Cremes-Lippenpflegeprodukten-und-Vaseline-4853357-0/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] sees MOHA and polyaromatics as possibly carcinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.test.de/Mineraloele-in-Kosmetika-Kritische-Stoffe-in-Cremes-Lippenpflegeprodukten-und-Vaseline-4853357-0/&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the results, Stiftung Warentest warns not to use Vaseline for lip care or any product that is based on mineral oils.

The prediction was that atoms do not move far and only a slight crystal non-symmetrical deformation occurs, say from cubic to tetragonal.  This transition they called martensitic. They suggested looking at [[sodium tungsten bronze]] and [[InTl]] alloy. They realised that the free electrons in the metal would neutralise the effect of the polarization at a global level, but that the conduction electrons do not strongly affect transverse optical phonons, or the local electric field inherent in [[ferroelectricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=P.

[[File:Pressure cooker bomb.jpg|thumb|Pressure cooker fragment that has 3,000 m explosive radius believed by the FBI to be part of one of the explosive devices used in the [[2013 Boston Marathon bombings]]]]

A '''pressure cooker bomb''' is an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED) created by inserting [[explosive material]] into a [[pressure cooker]] and attaching a [[blasting cap]] into the cover of the cooker.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/16/a-short-history-of-pressure-cooker-bombs/|title=A Short Recent History of Pressure Cooker Bombs|work=swampland|date=April 16, 2013|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure cooker bombs have been used in a number of attacks in the 21st century. Among them have been the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]], [[2010 Stockholm bombings]] (failed to explode), the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] (failed to explode), the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombing]], and the [[2017 Manchester Arena bombing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What we know about the Boston bombing and its aftermath|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/18/us/boston-marathon-things-we-know/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 19, 2013| date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Pressure.cooker.jpg|thumb|right|Pressure cooker]]
Pressure cooker bombs are relatively easy to construct. With the exception of the explosive charge itself, most of the materials required can be easily obtained. The bomb can be triggered using a simple [[electronic device]] such as a digital watch, garage door opener, cell phone, pager, kitchen timer, or alarm clock.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-bombs-pressure-cookers_n_3093288.html |author= |title=Boston Bombs Were In Pressure Cookers And Hidden In Black Duffel Bags, Says Person Briefed On Probe |publisher=Huffington Post |date= April 16, 2013|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the explosion depends on the size of the pressure cooker and the amount and type of explosives used.&lt;ref name="homeland_sec_alert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5nr.org/downloads/notice/PotentialTerrorist.pdf|title=POTENTIAL TERRORIST USE OF PRESSURECOOKERS|author=US Department of Homeland Security|year=2004}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to a [[pipe bomb]], the containment provided by the pressure cooker means that the energy from the explosion is confined until the pressure cooker itself explodes. This in turn creates a relatively large explosion using [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low explosives]] and generating potentially lethal [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].&lt;ref name="ctvnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/how-pressure-cooker-bombs-boost-the-deadliness-of-low-explosives-1.1241516 |author= |title=How pressure-cooker bombs boost the deadliness of 'low explosives' |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=February 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===2000‚Äì09===
French police prevented [[Strasbourg Cathedral bombing plot|a terrorist attack in Strasbourg]], France, on New Year's Eve 2000. Ten [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic militant]]s were convicted for the plot.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/04/16/f-pressure-cooker-bomb.html |title=A history of pressure cooker bombs |publisher=CBC News |date= |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002‚Äì04, pressure cooker bombs were widely used in terror and IED attacks in [[Afghanistan]], India, and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowley |first=Michael |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/16/a-short-history-of-pressure-cooker-bombs/ |title=A Short Recent History of Pressure Cooker Bombs |publisher=Time |date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a terrorist from [[Chechnya]] named Abudullah, carrying a pressure cooker bomb detonated explosives and killed six people before being arrested near [[Kabul International Airport]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/29/1072546443203.html |author= |title=Taliban claims Kabul suicide attack |publisher=smh.com.au |date=December 29, 2003 |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Taliban]] claimed responsibility.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;  In 2004, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] issued a warning to US agencies about pressure cookers being converted to IEDs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In July 2006, in Mumbai, India, 209 people were killed and 714 injured by pressure cooker bombs in the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  According to [[Mumbai Police]], the bombings were carried out by [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] and [[Students Islamic Movement of India]] (SIMI).&lt;ref name="autogenerated CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/30/india.bombs/index.html?section=cnn_world#|title=Death Toll at 209|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=April 17, 2013|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6736">In [[physics]], a '''quantum phase transition''' ('''QPT''') is a [[phase transition]] between different [[quantum phases]] ([[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] at [[absolute zero|zero temperature]]). Contrary to classical phase transitions, quantum phase transitions can only be accessed by varying a physical parameter‚Äîsuch as [[magnetic field]] or pressure‚Äîat [[absolute zero]] temperature. The transition describes an abrupt change in the [[ground state]] of a many-body system due to its quantum fluctuations. Such a quantum phase transition can be a [[second-order phase transition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=The Ehrenfest Classification of Phase Transitions: Introduction and Evolution|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|date=1 May 1998|volume=53|issue=1|pages=51‚Äì81|doi=10.1007/s004070050021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical description==

To understand quantum phase transitions, it is useful to contrast them to [[Phase transition|classical phase transitions]] (CPT) (also called thermal phase transitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=The Ehrenfest Classification of Phase Transitions: Introduction and Evolution|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|date=1 May 1998|volume=53|issue=1|pages=51‚Äì81|doi=10.1007/s004070050021}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CPT describes a cusp in the thermodynamic properties of a system. It signals a reorganization of the particles; A typical example is the [[freezing]] transition of water describing the transition between liquid and solid. The classical phase transitions are driven by a competition between the [[energy]] of a system and the [[entropy]] of its thermal fluctuations. A classical system does not have entropy at zero temperature and therefore no phase transition can occur. Their order is determined by the first discontinuous derivative of a thermodynamic potential. 
A phase transition from water to ice, for example, involves latent heat (a discontinuity of the [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;) and is of first order. A phase transition from a [[ferromagnet]] to a [[paramagnet]] is continuous and is of second order. (See [[phase transition]] for Ehrenfest's classification of phase transitions by the derivative of free energy which is discontinuous at the transition). 
These continuous transitions from an ordered to a disordered phase are described by an order parameter, which is zero in the 
disordered and nonzero in the ordered phase. For the aforementioned ferromagnetic transition, the order parameter would represent the total magnetization of the system.

Although the thermodynamic average of the order parameter is zero in the disordered state, its fluctuations can be nonzero and become 
long-ranged in the vicinity of the critical point, where their typical length scale ''Œæ'' (correlation length) and typical fluctuation decay time scale ''œÑ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' (correlation time) diverge:

:&lt;math&gt; \xi \propto |\epsilon |^{-\nu}\,\,= \left (\frac{|T-T_c|}{T_c}\right )^{-\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \tau_c \propto \xi^{z} \propto |\epsilon |^{-\nu z}, &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{T-T_c}{T_c} &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the relative deviation from the critical temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. We call ''&amp;nu;'' the ([[correlation length]]) ''[[critical exponent]]'' and ''z'' the ''dynamical critical exponent''. Critical behavior of nonzero temperature phase transitions is fully described by [[classical thermodynamics]]; [[quantum mechanics]] does not play any role even if the actual phases require a quantum mechanical description (e.g. [[superconductivity]]).

==Quantum description==

[[File:QuantumPhaseTransition.svg|thumb|Diagram of temperature (T) and pressure (p) showing the quantum critical point (QCP) and quantum phase transitions.]]

Talking about ''quantum'' phase transitions means talking about transitions at ''T'' = 0: by tuning a non-temperature parameter like pressure, chemical composition or magnetic field, one could suppress e.g. some transition temperature like the Curie or N√©el temperature to 0 K.

As a system in equilibrium at zero temperature is always in its lowest-energy state, a QPT cannot be explained by [[thermal fluctuations]]. Instead, [[quantum fluctuations]], arising from [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]], drive the loss of [[Order and disorder (physics)|order]] characteristic of a QPT. The QPT occurs at the [[quantum critical point]] (QCP), where quantum fluctuations driving the transition diverge and 
become scale invariant in space and time. 

Although absolute zero is not physically realizable, characteristics of the transition can be detected in the system's low-temperature behavior near the critical point. At nonzero temperatures, classical 
fluctuations with an energy scale of ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'' compete with the quantum fluctuations of energy scale ''ƒßœâ.'' Here ''œâ'' is the characteristic frequency of the quantum oscillation and is inversely proportional to the correlation time. Quantum fluctuations dominate the system's behavior in the region where ''ƒßœâ'' &gt; ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'', known as the quantum critical region. This quantum critical behavior manifests itself in unconventional and unexpected physical behavior like novel non Fermi liquid phases. From a theoretical point of view, a phase diagram like the one shown on the right is expected: the QPT separates an ordered from a disordered phase (often, the low temperature disordered phase is referred to as 'quantum' disordered).

At high enough temperatures, the system is disordered and purely classical. Around the classical phase transition, the system is governed by classical thermal fluctuations (light blue area). This region becomes narrower with decreasing energies and converges towards the quantum critical point (QCP). Experimentally, the 'quantum critical' phase, which is still governed by quantum fluctuations, is the most interesting one.

[[Spacecraft]] operating in the inner [[Solar System]] usually rely on the use of [[photovoltaic]] [[solar panel]]s to derive electricity from [[sunlight]]. In the outer solar system, where the sunlight is too weak to produce sufficient power, [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs) are used as a power source.&lt;ref name="EPSD"&gt;NASA JPL Publication: Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 11. Typical Onboard Systems , Electrical Power Supply and Distribution Subsystems, {{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518124056/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-3.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first spacecraft to use solar panels was the [[Vanguard 1]] satellite, launched by the US in 1958. This was largely because of the influence of Dr. [[Hans K. Ziegler|Hans Ziegler]], who can be regarded as the father of spacecraft solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Uses ==
[[File:Capturing the Solar Maximum Mission satellite.jpg|thumb|The solar panels on the SMM satellite provided electrical power. Here it is being captured by an astronaut in a mobile space-suit that runs on chemical battery power.]]
Solar panels on spacecraft supply power for two main uses:

* power to run the sensors, active heating, cooling and telemetry.
* power for [[spacecraft propulsion]] ‚Äì [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]], sometimes called solar-electric propulsion.&lt;ref name="NASA11"&gt;NASA JPL Publication: Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 11. Typical Onboard Systems, Propulsion Subsystems, http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html#propulsion {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093125/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html |date=2006-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both uses, a key [[figure of merit]] of the solar panels is the specific power (watts generated divided by [[solar array]] mass), which indicates on a relative basis how much power one array will generate for a given launch mass relative to another.  Another key metric is stowed packing efficiency (deployed watts produced divided by stowed volume), which indicates how easily the array will fit into a launch vehicle.  Yet another key metric is cost (dollars per watt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=David|title=Thin Film Solar Array Parametric Assessment|journal=AIAA|date=July 2000|volume=AIAA-2000-2919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the specific power, typical solar panels on spacecraft use close-packed solar cell rectangles that cover nearly 100% of the sun-visible area of the solar panels,
rather than the [[solar wafer]] circles which, even though close-packed, [[Sphere packing#Circle packing|cover about 90%]] of the sun-visible area of typical solar panels on earth. However, some solar panels on spacecraft have solar cells that cover only 30% of the sun-visible area.&lt;ref name="NASA11" /&gt;

== Implementation ==
[[File:SpacecraftBus-model.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the [[Spacecraft Bus (JWST)|Spacecraft Bus]] on the planned [[James Webb Space Telescope]], which is powered by solar panels (coloured green in this 3/4 view). Note that shorter light purple extensions are radiator shades not solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b171c5e4b047061239404b/t/57b30618b8a79bb69fff7b4c/1471350297818/SPIE990405_Status+of+the+JWST+Sunshield+and+Spacecraft.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Solar panels need to have a lot of surface area that can be pointed towards the Sun as the spacecraft moves. More exposed surface area means more electricity can be converted from light energy from the Sun. Since spacecraft have to be small, this limits the amount of power that can be produced.&lt;ref name="EPSD" /&gt;

All electrical circuits generate [[waste heat]]; in addition, solar arrays act as optical and thermal as well as electrical collectors. Heat must be radiated from their surfaces.  High-power spacecraft may have solar arrays that compete with the active payload itself for thermal dissipation. The innermost panel of arrays may be "blank" to reduce the overlap of [[View factor|views]] to space.  Such spacecraft include the higher-power communications satellites (e.g., later-generation [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System|TDRS]]) and [[Venus Express]], not high-powered but closer to the Sun.

Spacecraft are built so that the solar panels can be pivoted as the spacecraft moves. Thus, they can always stay in the direct path of the light rays no matter how the spacecraft is pointed. Spacecraft are usually designed with solar panels that can always be pointed at the Sun, even as the rest of the body of the spacecraft moves around, much as a tank turret can be aimed independently of where the tank is going. A tracking mechanism is often incorporated into the solar arrays to keep the array pointed towards the sun.&lt;ref name="EPSD"/&gt;

Sometimes, satellite operators purposefully orient the solar panels to "off point," or out of direct alignment from the Sun. This happens if the batteries are completely charged and the amount of electricity needed is lower than the amount of electricity made; off-pointing is also sometimes used on the International Space Station for orbital [[Night Glider mode|drag reduction]].

== Ionizing radiation issues and mitigation ==
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Illumination test on one of Juno's solar panels.jpg|thumb|[[Juno (spacecraft)|''Juno'']] is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and the first solar-powered craft to do so.]]

Space contains varying levels of ionizing radiation, that which includes flares and other solar events.  Some satellites orbit within the protective zone of the [[magnetosphere]], while others do not.

== Types of solar cells typically used ==

[[Gallium arsenide]]-based solar cells are typically favored over [[crystalline silicon]] in industry because they have a higher efficiency and degrade more slowly than silicon in the radiation present in space. The most efficient solar cells currently in production are [[multi-junction photovoltaic cell]]s. These use a combination of several layers of gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide, and germanium to capture more energy from the solar spectrum. Leading edge multi-junction cells are capable of exceeding 38.8% under non-concentrated AM1.5G illumination and 46% using concentrated AM1.5G illumination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solar cell efficiency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft that have used solar power ==

To date, solar power, other than for propulsion, has been practical for spacecraft operating no farther from the [[Sun]] than the orbit of [[Jupiter]]. For example, ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'', ''[[Magellan probe|Magellan]]'', ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'', and ''[[Mars Observer]]'' used solar power as does the Earth-orbiting, [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The [[Rosetta space probe|''Rosetta'' space probe]], launched 2 March 2004, used its {{convert|64|sqm}} of solar panels&lt;ref name="rosettaFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions|title=Rosetta's frequently asked questions|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as far as the orbit of [[Jupiter]] (5.25 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]); previously the furthest use was the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'' spacecraft]] at 2 AU. Solar power for propulsion was also used on the European lunar mission [[SMART-1]] with a [[Hall effect thruster]].

The ''[[Juno (space mission)|Juno]]'' mission, launched in 2011, is the first mission to Jupiter (arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016) to use solar panels instead of the traditional RTGs that are used by previous outer solar system missions, making it the furthest spacecraft to use solar panels to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newfrontiers.nasa.gov/missions_juno.html Juno mission page at NASA's New Frontiers Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203235637/http://newfrontiers.nasa.gov/missions_juno.html |date=2007-02-03 }}.

Another spacecraft of interest is ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' which went into orbit around [[4 Vesta]] in 2011. It used [[ion thrusters]] to get to [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].

The potential for solar powered spacecraft beyond Jupiter has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/nov_2007_meeting/presentations/solar_power.pdf Scott W. Benson ‚Äì '''Solar Power for Outer Planets Study''' (2007) ‚Äì NASA Glenn Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Space Station also uses solar arrays to power everything on the station. The 262,400 solar cells cover around {{convert|27,000|sqft}} of space. There are four sets of solar arrays that power the station and the fourth set of arrays were installed in March 2009. 84 to 120 kilowatts of electricity can be generated from these solar arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays-about.html|title=About the Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=2017-07-31|work=NASA|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future uses ==
[[File:ISS-52 Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) (4).jpg|thumb|Flexible solar arrays are being investigated for use in space. The [[Roll Out Solar Array]] (ROSA) was deployed on the International Space Station in July 2017.]]
For future missions, it is desirable to reduce solar array mass, and to increase the power generated per unit area. This will reduce overall spacecraft mass, and may make the operation of solar-powered spacecraft feasible at larger distances from the sun. Solar array mass could be reduced with thin-film photovoltaic cells, flexible blanket substrates, and composite support structures. Solar array efficiency could be improved by using new photovoltaic cell materials and solar concentrators that intensify the incident sunlight. Photovoltaic concentrator solar arrays for primary spacecraft power are devices which intensify the sunlight on the photovoltaics. This design uses a flat lens, called a [[Fresnel lens]], which takes a large area of sunlight and concentrates it onto a smaller spot. The same principle is used to start fires with a [[magnifying glass]] on a sunny day.

Solar concentrators put one of these lenses over every solar cell. This focuses light from the large concentrator area down to the smaller cell area. This allows the quantity of expensive solar cells to be reduced by the amount of concentration. Concentrators work best when there is a single source of light and the concentrator can be pointed right at it. This is ideal in space, where the Sun is a single light source. Solar cells are the most expensive part of solar arrays, and arrays are often a very expensive part of the spacecraft. This technology may allow costs to be cut significantly due to the utilization of less material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|title=Concentrators Enhance Solar Power Systems|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2012/ee_6.html|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solid film lubricant'''s are [[paint]]-like coatings of very fine [[colloid|particle]]s of [[lubrication|lubricating]] [[pigment]] blended with a [[binder (material)|binder]] and other additives.  The lubricant is applied to a substrate by spray, dip or brush methods and, once cured, creates a solid film which repels water, reduces [[friction]] and increases the wear life of the substrate to which it has been applied.  Certain film lubricants also offer additional properties such as [[corrosion]] inhibition.  Solid film lubricants are used in the automotive, transportation and aerospace industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3251">'''Spent caustic''' is a waste industrial [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] solution that has become exhausted and is no longer useful (or spent). Spent caustics are made of [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], [[water]], and contaminants.  The contaminants have consumed the majority of the sodium (or potassium) hydroxide and thus the caustic liquor is spent, for example, in one common application [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (''gas'')]] is [[scrubber|scrubbed]] by the [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH (''aqueous'')]] to form NaHS (''aq'') and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''l''), thus consuming the caustic.

==Types==
* '''Ethylene spent caustic''' comes from the caustic scrubbing of cracked gas from an [[ethylene]] [[cracking (chemistry)|cracker]].  This liquor is produced by a caustic scrubbing tower.  Ethylene product gas is contaminated with {{chem|H|2|S}}(g) and {{CO2}}(g), and those contaminants are removed by absorption in the caustic scrubbing tower to produce {{chem|NaHS}}(aq) and {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}(aq). The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewater (ethylene spent caustic) is contaminated with the sulfides and carbonates and a small fraction of organic compounds.
*'''Refinery spent caustic''' comes from multiple sources: the [[Merox]] processing of [[gasoline]]; the Merox processing of [[kerosene]]/[[jet fuel]]; and the caustic scrubbing/Merox processing of [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. In these streams sulfides and organic acids are removed from the product streams into the caustic phase. The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewaters (cresylic for gasoline; naphthenic for kerosene/jet fuel; sulfidic for LPG -spent caustics) are often mixed and called '''refinery spent caustic'''. This spent caustic is contaminated with sulfides, carbonates, and in many cases a high fraction of heavy [[organic acids]].

==Treatment technologies==
Spent caustics are malodorous [[wastewater]]s that are difficult to treat in conventional [[wastewater]] processes. Typically the material is disposed of by high [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] with [[biotreatment]], deep well injection, [[incineration]], [[wet air oxidation]], [[Humid Peroxide Oxidation]] or other speciality processes. Most ethylene spent caustics are disposed of through wet air oxidation.

In [[aeronautics]], '''transonic''' (or '''transsonic''') flight is flying at or near the [[speed of sound]] 343 meters per second (1,235 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph; 667 kn), at sea level under average conditions), relative to the air through which the vehicle is traveling. A typical convention used is to define transonic flight as speeds in the range of [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.72 to&amp;nbsp;1.0 ({{convert|965|‚Äì|1235|km/h|abbr=on}} at sea level).

This condition depends not only on the travel speed of the craft, but also on the temperature of the airflow in the vehicle's local environment. It is formally defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an air vehicle or airfoil are [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near Mach&amp;nbsp;1.2, when most of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds some of the airflow is supersonic, but a significant fraction is not.

Most modern [[jet engine|jet]] powered aircraft are engineered to operate at transonic air speeds.{{fact|date=March 2017}} Transonic airspeeds see a rapid increase in drag from about Mach 0.8, and it is the fuel costs of the drag that typically limits the airspeed. Attempts to reduce wave drag can be seen on all high-speed aircraft. Most notable is the use of [[swept wing]]s, but another common form is a wasp-waist fuselage as a side effect of the [[Whitcomb area rule]].

Severe instability can occur at transonic speeds. Shock waves move through the air at the speed of sound. When an object such as an aircraft also moves at the speed of sound, these shock waves build up in front of it to form a single, very large shock wave. During transonic flight, the plane must pass through this large shock wave, as well as contend with the instability caused by air moving faster than sound over parts of the wing and slower in other parts.

Transonic speeds can also occur at the tips of [[Rotorcraft|rotor]] blades of helicopters and aircraft. This puts severe, unequal stresses on the rotor blade and may lead to accidents if it occurs. It is one of the limiting factors of the size of rotors and the forward speeds of helicopters (as this speed is added to the forward-sweeping [leading] side of the rotor, possibly causing localized transonics).

==Condensation clouds==
At transonic speeds [[Prandtl‚ÄìMeyer_expansion_fan|supersonic expansion fans]] form intense low-pressure, low-temperature areas at various points around an aircraft. If the temperature drops below the [[dew point]] a visible cloud will form. These clouds remain with the aircraft as it travels. It is not necessary for the aircraft as a whole to reach [[supersonic]] speeds for these clouds to form. Typically, the tail of the aircraft will reach supersonic flight while the bow of the aircraft is still in subsonic flight. A bubble of supersonic expansion fans terminating by a wake shockwave surround the tail. As the aircraft continues to accelerate, the supersonic expansion fans will intensify and the wake shockwave will grow in size until infinity is reached, at which point the bow shockwave forms. This is Mach 1 and the [[Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert singularity]].

==Transonic flows in astronomy and astrophysics==

In astrophysics, wherever there is evidence of shocks (standing, propagating or oscillating), the flow close by must be transonic, as only supersonic flows form shocks. All black hole [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretions]] are transonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakrabarti|first=Sandip|title=Theory of Transonic Astrophysical Flows|year=1990|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=981-02-0204-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such flows also have shocks very close to the black holes.

The outflows or jets from young stellar objects or disks around black holes can also be transonic since they start subsonically and at a far distance they are invariably supersonic. Supernovae explosions are accompanied by supersonic flows and shock waves. Bow shocks formed in [[solar wind]]s are a direct result of transonic winds from a star. It has been long thought that a bow shock was present around the heliosphere of our solar system. This was recently found not to be the case according to [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120510141957.htm | title = NASA ‚Äì IBEX Reveals a Missing Boundary At the Edge of the Solar System | newspaper = Science daily | date = 2012-05-10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28808">[[File:OM Power PA running 3kW.jpg|thumb|right|Shortwave amplifier with tube GU-78B]]

A '''valve RF amplifier''' ([[British English|UK]] and [[Australian English|Aus.]]) or '''tube amplifier''' ([[American English|U.S.]]), is a device for electrically [[amplifier|amplifying]] the power of an electrical radio frequency [[Wiktionary:signal|signal]].

Low to medium power valve amplifiers for frequencies below the microwaves were largely replaced by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] amplifiers during the 1960s and 1970s, initially for receivers and low power stages of transmitters, transmitter output stages switching to transistors somewhat later. Specially constructed valves are still in use for very high power transmitters, although rarely in new designs.

== Valve characteristics ==
Valves are high voltage/low current devices in comparison with [[transistor]]s. Tetrode and pentode valves have very flat [[anode]] current vs. anode voltage indicating high anode output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s.  Triodes show a stronger relationship between anode voltage and anode current.

The high working voltage makes them well suited for [[radio transmitter]]s and valves remain in use today for very high power short wave radio transmitters, where solid state techniques would require many devices in parallel, and very high DC supply currents. High power solid state transmitters also require complex combining and tuning networks, whereas a valve-based transmitter would use a single relatively simple tuned network. Thus while solid state high power short wave transmitters are technically possible, economic considerations still favor valves above 3&amp;nbsp;MHz and 10,000  watts. Amateurs also use valve amplifiers in the 500-1500 watt range mainly for economic reasons.

=== Audio vs. RF amplifiers ===

[[Valve audio amplifiers]] typically amplify the entire audio range between 20&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;kHz or higher. They use an iron core transformer to provide a suitable high impedance load to the valve(s) while driving a speaker, which is typically 8&amp;nbsp;Ohms. Audio amplifiers normally use a single valve in [[Amplifier#Class_A|class A]], or a pair in [[Electronic amplifier#Class B and AB|class B]] or [[class AB]].

An RF power amplifier is tuned to a single frequency as low as 18&amp;nbsp;kHz and as high as the [[UHF]] range of frequencies, for the purpose of radio transmission or industrial heating. They use a narrow tuned circuit to provide the valve with a suitably high load impedance and feed a load that is typically 50 or 75&amp;nbsp;Ohms. RF amplifiers normally operate [[Electronic amplifier#Class C|Class C]] or [[Class AB]].

Although the frequency ranges for audio amplifiers and RF amplifiers overlap, the class of operation, method of output coupling and percent operational bandwidth will differ. Power valves are capable of high frequency response, up to at least 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. Indeed, many of the Directly Heated Single Ended [[Triode]] (DH-SET) audio amplifiers use radio transmitting valves originally designed to operate as RF amplifiers in the high frequency range.

=== Circuit advantages of valves ===
*Very linear (especially triodes) making it viable to use them in low distortion linear circuits with little or no negative feedback{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
*High input impedance,  comparable to that of FETs, higher than in bipolar transistors, which is beneficial in certain signal amplification applications.
*Valves are high voltage devices, inherently suitable for higher voltage circuits than most semiconductors.
*Valves can be constructed on a scale that can dissipate large amounts of heat, with very high power models designed for water or vapor cooling. For this reason valves remained the only viable technology for very high power, and especially high power/high voltage applications such as Radio &amp; TV transmitters long into the age when transistors had displaced valves in most other applications. However today these also are increasingly obsolete.
*Lower investment cost in applications like RF amplifiers above the kilowatt power range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ARRL Handbook 2013|year=2013|publisher=The American Radio Relay League, Inc.|isbn=978-0-87259-663-4|url=http://www.arrl.org/arrl-handbook-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, large, high value power valves can to some extent be remanufactured to extend residual life.
*Electrically very robust, they can tolerate overloads which would destroy [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]] systems in [[millisecond]]s (of particular significance in military and other "strategically important" systems).
*Indefinite shelf life.  Even 60-year-old tubes can be perfectly functional, and many types are available for purchase as  "new-old-stock". Thus, despite known reliability issues (see below), it is still perfectly possible to run most very old vacuum tube equipment.
*Comparative ease of replacement.  Being known to be subject to a number of common failure modes, most tubes were designed and installed as plug-in devices, not soldered into a circuit. A failed tube can simply be unplugged and replaced by a user, while the failure of a soldered-in semiconductor may imply damage beyond economic repair for a whole product or subassembly.

=== Disadvantages of valves ===
*Cost. For most applications, tubes require both greater initial outlay and  running expense per amplification stage, requiring more attentive budgeting of the number of stages for a given application compared to semiconductors. 
*Short operational life. In the most common applications, valves have a working life of just a few thousand hours, much shorter than solid state parts. This is due various commonplace failure mechanisms: cathode depletion, open  or shorts circuits‚Äînotably of the heater and grid structures, cathode poisoning, and physical breakage of the glass envelope. Heater failure most often happens due to the mechanical stress of a cold start.  Only, in certain always-on professional applications such as specialized [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|computing]]  and [[TAT-1|undersea cables]], specially designed valves in carefully designed circuits and well cooled environments reached operational lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of hours. 
*[[Hot cathode|Heater]] supplies are required for the [[cathode]]s. Beside the investment cost, the share of the power budget that goes into heating the cathode without contributing to output can range from few percent points of anode dissipation (in high power applications at full output),&lt;ref&gt;http://tubedata.tubes.se/sheets/140/4/4CV35000A.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  to broadly comparable to anode dissipation in small signal applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datasheetarchive.com/12AT7*-datasheet.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Large circuit temperature swings in on/off cycles. Massive stray heat from cathode heaters in common low power tubes means that adjoining circuits experience changes in temperature that can exceed 100&amp;nbsp;¬∞C / 200&amp;nbsp;¬∞F. This requires heat resistant components. In RF applications this also means that all frequency-determining components may have to heat to thermal equilibrium before frequency stability is reached. While at AM broadcast (medium wave) receivers and in loosely tuned TV sets this was not a problem, in typical radio receivers and transmitters with free-running oscillators at HF frequencies this thermal stabilization required about one hour. On the other hand, [[Nuvistor|miniature]] ultra-low power direct-heated valves do not produce much heat in absolute terms, cause more modest temperature swings, and allow equipment that contains few of them to stabilize sooner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qsl.net/ik1xpv/r326/r326.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telefunken-elektroakustik.com/products/show_product.php?item=12 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808210826/http://www.telefunken-elektroakustik.com/products/show_product.php?item=12 |archive-date=2014-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*No "instant on" from a cold start. Valve cathodes need to heat to a glow to start conducting. In indirect-heating cathodes this could take up to 20 seconds. Apart from temperature-related instability, this meant that valves would not work instantly when powered. This led to development of always-on [[Instant-on#Consumer electronics|preheating systems]] for vacuum tube appliances that shortened the wait and may have reduced valve failures from thermal shock, but at the price of a continuous power drain, and an increased fire hazard. On the other hand, very small, ultra low power direct-heated valves turn on in tenths of a second from a cold start.
*Anodes may require dangerously high voltages.
*High impedance / low current output unsuitable for direct drive of many real world loads, notably various forms of electric motor
*Compared to transistors, valves have the disadvantage of being available in a single polarity only.  In most processes transistors are available in complementary polarities (e.g., NPN/PNP), making possible many circuit configurations that cannot be realized with valves.

=== Distortion ===
The most efficient valve-based RF amplifiers operate [[Electronic amplifier#Class C|Class C]]. If used with no tuned circuit in the output, this would distort the input signal, producing harmonics. However, class&amp;nbsp;C amplifiers normally use a high Q output network which removes the harmonics, leaving an undistorted sine wave identical to the input waveform. Class&amp;nbsp;C is suitable only for amplifying signals with a constant amplitude, such as [[Frequency modulation|FM]], [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]], and some CW ([[Morse code]]) signals. Where the amplitude of the input signal to the amplifier varies as with [[single sideband modulation]], [[amplitude modulation]], video and complex digital signals, the amplifier must operate class&amp;nbsp;A or AB, to preserve the envelope of the driving signal in an undistorted form.  Such amplifiers are referred to as [[linear amplifier]]s.[[Image:Two Siemens 20 Kw PEP Linear Amplifiers.jpg|thumb |175px|left| 20&amp;nbsp;kW PEP linear amplifiers used by short wave radio station HCJB in both SSB and [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] broadcasts]]

It is also common to modify the gain of an amplifier operating class&amp;nbsp;C so as to produce [[amplitude modulation]]. If done in a linear manner, this modulated amplifier is capable of low distortion. The output signal can be viewed as a product of the input RF signal and the modulating signal.

The development of FM broadcasting improved fidelity by using a greater bandwidth which was available in the VHF range, and where atmospheric noise was absent. FM also has an inherent ability to reject noise, which is mostly amplitude modulated. Valve technology suffers high-frequency limitations due to cathode-anode transit time. However, tetrodes are successfully used into the VHF range and triodes into the low GHz range. Modern FM broadcast transmitters use both valve and solid state devices, with valves tending to be more used at the highest power levels. FM transmitters operate class&amp;nbsp;C with very low distortion.

Today‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital‚Äù radio that carries coded data over various phase modulations (such as GMSK, QPSK etc.) and also the increasing demand for spectrum have forced a dramatic change in the way radio is used, e.g. the cellular radio concept. Today‚Äôs cellular radio and digital broadcast standards are extremely demanding in terms of the spectral envelope and out of band emissions that are acceptable (in the case of GSM for example, &amp;minus;70&amp;nbsp;dB or better just a few hundred kilohertz from center frequency). Digital transmitters must therefore operate in the linear modes, with much attention given to achieving low distortion.

== Applications ==

=== Historic transmitters and receivers ===
(High voltage / High power)
Valve stages were used to amplify the received radio frequency signals, the intermediate frequencies, the video signal and the audio signals at the various points in the receiver. Historically (pre WWII) "transmitting tubes" were among the most powerful tubes available, were usually direct heated by thoriated filaments that glowed like light bulbs. Some tubes were built to be very rugged, capable of being driven so hard that the anode would itself glow cherry red, the anodes being machined from solid material (rather than fabricated from thin sheet) to be able to withstand this without distorting when heated. Notable tubes of this type are the [[845 (vacuum tube)|845]] and 211. Later beam power tubes such as the 807 and (direct heated) 813 were also used in large numbers in (especially military) radio transmitters.

=== Bandwidth of valve vs solid state amplifiers ===
Today, radio transmitters are overwhelmingly solid state, even at microwave frequencies (cellular radio base stations). Depending on the application, a fair number of radio frequency amplifiers continue to have valve construction, due to their  simplicity, where as, it takes several output transistors with complex splitting and combining circuits to equal the same amount of output power of a single valve.

Valve amplifier circuits are significantly different from broadband solid state circuits. Solid state devices have a very low output impedance which allows matching via a broadband transformer covering a large range of frequencies, for example 1.8 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. With either class C or AB operation, these must include low pass filters to remove harmonics. While the proper low pass filter must be switch selected for the frequency range of interest, the result is considered to be a "no tune" design. Valve amplifiers have a tuned network that serves as both the low pass harmonic filter and impedance matching to the output load. In either case, both solid state and valve devices need such filtering networks before the RF signal is output to the load.

== Radio circuits ==

Unlike audio amplifiers, in which the analog output signal is of the same form and frequency as the input signal, RF circuits may modulate low frequency information (audio, video, or data) onto a carrier (at a much higher frequency), and the circuitry comprises several distinct stages. For example, a radio transmitter may contain:

*an audio frequency (AF) stage (typically using conventional broadband small signal circuitry as described in [[Valve audio amplifier]],
*one or more [[oscillator]] stages that generate the [[carrier wave]],
*one or more [[Frequency mixer|mixer]] stages that modulate the carrier signal from the oscillator,
*the amplifier stage itself operating at (typically) high frequency. the [[Transmitter]] power amp itself is the only high power stage in a radio system, and operates at the [[carrier frequency]]. In AM, the modulation (frequency mixing) usually takes place in the final amplifier itself.

=== Transmitter anode circuits ===
The most common anode circuit is a tuned LC circuit where the anodes are connected at a [[voltage]] [[Node (circuits)|node]]. This circuit is often known as the anode [[tank circuit]].

=== Active (or tuned grid) amplifier ===
[[Image:tunedgrid.png|thumb|300px|left|Simple [[tetrode]]-based design using a tuned grid input]]

An example of this used at VHF/[[UHF]] include the 4CX250B, an example of a twin [[tetrode]] is the QQV06/40A.

Neutralization is a term used in TGTP (tuned grid tuned plate) amplifiers for the methods and circuits used for stabilization against unwanted oscillations at the operating frequency caused by the inadvertent introduction of some of the output signal back into the input circuits.  This mainly occurs via the grid to plate capacity, but can also come via other paths, making circuit layout important. To cancel the unwanted feedback signal, a portion of the output signal is deliberately introduced into the input circuit  with the same amplitude but opposite phase.

When using a tuned circuit in the input, the network must match the driving source to the input impedance of the grid.  This impedance will be determined by the grid current in Class C or AB2 operation.  In AB1 operation,  the grid circuit should be designed to avoid excessive step up voltage, which although it might provide more stage gain, as in audio designs, it will increase instability and make neutralization more critical.

In common with all three basic designs shown here, the anode of the valve is connected to a resonant LC circuit which has another inductive link which allows the RF signal to be passed to the output.
The circuit shown has been largely replaced by a [[Pi network]] which allows simpler adjustment and adds low pass filtering.

==== Operation ====
The anode current is controlled by the electrical potential (voltage) of the first grid. A [[Direct current|DC]] bias is applied to the valve to ensure that the part of the transfer equation which is most suitable to the required application is used. The input signal is able to perturb (change) the potential of the grid, this in turn will change the [[anode]] [[Electric current|current]] (also known as the plate current).

In the [[Radio frequency|RF]] designs shown on this page, a [[tuned circuit]] is between the anode and the high voltage supply. This tuned circuit is brought to resonance presenting an inductive load that is well matched to the valve and thus results in an efficient power transfer.

As the current flowing through the anode connection is controlled by the grid, then the current flowing through the load is also controlled by the grid.

One of the disadvantages of a tuned grid compared to other RF designs is that neutralization is required.

=== Passive grid amplifier ===
[[Image:passivegrid.png|thumb|300px|right|Simple [[tetrode]]-based amplifier using a passive grid input]]

A passive grid circuit used at VHF/[[UHF]] frequencies might use the 4CX250B tetrode. An example of a twin tetrode would be the QQV06/40A. The tetrode has a screen grid which is between the anode and the first grid, which being grounded for RF, acts as a shield to reducing the effective capacitance between the first grid and the anode. The combination of the effects of the screen grid and the grid damping resistor often allow the use of this design without neutralization. The screen found in tetrodes and pentodes, greatly increases the valve's gain by reducing the effect of anode voltage on anode current.

The input signal is applied to the valve's first grid via a capacitor. The value of the grid resistor determines the gain of the amplifier stage. The higher the resistor the greater the gain, the lower the damping effect and the greater the risk of instability. With this type of stage good layout is less vital.

==== Advantages ====
*Stable, no neutralizing required normally
*Constant load on the exciting stage

==== Disadvantages ====
*Low gain, more input power is required
*Less gain than tuned grid
*Less filtering than tuned grid (more broadband), hence the amplification of out of band spurious signals, such as harmonics, from an exciter is greater

=== Grounded grid amplifier ===
[[Image:groundedgrid.png|thumb|300px|left|Simple [[triode]]-based design using a passive grid input]]

This design normally uses a triode so valves such as the 4CX250B are not suitable for this circuit, unless the screen and control grids are joined, effectively converting the tetrode into a triode. This circuit design has been used at 1296&amp;nbsp;MHz using disk seal [[triode]] [[valves]] such as the 2C39A.

The grid is grounded and the drive is applied to the cathode through a capacitor. The heater supply must be isolated from the cathode as unlike the other designs the cathode is not connected to RF ground. Some valves, such as the 811A, are designed for "zero bias" operation and the cathode can be at ground potential for DC. Valves that require a negative grid bias can be used by putting a positive DC voltage on the cathode.  This can be achieved by putting a zener diode between the cathode and ground or using a separate bias supply.

==== Advantages ====
*Stable, no neutralizing required normally
*Some of the power from exciting stage appears in the output

==== Disadvantages ====
*Relatively  low gain, typically about 10 dB.
*The heater must be isolated from ground with chokes.

=== Neutralization ===
The valve interelectrode capacitance which exists between the input and output of the amplifier and other stray coupling may allow enough energy to feed back into input so as to cause self oscillation in an amplifier stage. For the higher gain designs this effect must be counteracted. Various methods exist for introducing an out of phase signal from the output back to the input so that the effect is cancelled.  Even when the feed back is not sufficient to cause oscillation it can produce other effects, such as difficult tuning.  Therefore, neutralization can be helpful, even for an amplifier that does not oscillate. Many grounded grid amplifiers use no neutralization, but at 30&amp;nbsp;MHz adding it can smooth out the tuning.

An important part of the neutralization of a tetrode or pentode is the design of the screen grid circuit.  To provide the greatest shielding effect, the screen must be well grounded at the frequency of operation.  Many valves will have a "self neutralizing" frequency somewhere in the VHF range. This results from a series resonance consisting of the screen capacity and the inductance of the screen lead thus providing a very low impedance path to ground.

=== UHF ===
Transit time effects are important at these frequencies, so feedback is not normally usable and for performance critical applications alternative linearisation techniques have to be used such as degeneration and feedforward.

=== Tube noise and noise figure ===

Noise figure is not usually an issue for power amplifier valves, however, in receivers using valves it can be important. While such uses are obsolete, this information is included for historical interest.

Like any amplifying device, valves add noise to the signal to be amplified. Even with a hypothetical perfect amplifier, however, noise is unavoidably present due to thermal fluctuations in the signal source (usually assumed to be at room temperature, ''T'' = 295 K). Such fluctuations cause an electrical noise power of &lt;math&gt;k_B T B&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the Boltzmann constant and ''B'' the bandwidth. Correspondingly, the voltage noise of a resistance ''R'' into an open circuit is &lt;math&gt;4*k_B*T*B*R)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; and the current noise into a short circuit is &lt;math&gt;4*k_B*T*B/R)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The noise figure is defined as the ratio of the noise power at the output of the amplifier relative to the noise power that would be present at the output if the amplifier were noiseless (due to amplification of thermal noise of the signal source). An equivalent definition is: noise figure is the factor by which insertion of the amplifier degrades the signal to noise ratio. It is often expressed in decibels (dB). An amplifier with a 0 dB noise figure would be perfect.

The noise properties of tubes at audio frequencies can be modeled well by a perfect noiseless tube having a source of voltage noise in series with the grid. For the EF86 tube, for example, this voltage noise is specified (see e.g., the Valvo, Telefunken or Philips data sheets) as 2 microvolts integrated over a frequency range of approximately 25&amp;nbsp;Hz to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. (This refers to the integrated noise, see below for the frequency dependence of the noise spectral density.) This equals the voltage noise of a 25 kŒ© resistor. Thus, if the signal source has an impedance of 25 kŒ© or more, the noise of the tube is actually smaller than the noise of the source. For a source of 25 kŒ©, the noise generated by tube and source are the same, so the total noise power at the output of the amplifier is twice the noise power at the output of the perfect amplifier. The noise figure is then two, or 3 dB. For higher impedances, such as 250 kŒ©, the EF86's voltage noise is &lt;math&gt;1/10^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; lower than the sources's own noise. It therefore adds 1/10 of the noise power caused by the source, and the noise figure is 0.4 dB. For a low-impedance source of 250 Œ©, on the other hand, the noise voltage contribution of the tube is 10 times larger than the signal source, so that the noise power is one hundred times larger than that caused by the source. The noise figure in this case is 20 dB.

To obtain low noise figure the impedance of the source can be increased by a transformer. This is eventually limited by the input capacity of the tube, which sets a limit on how high the signal impedance can be made if a certain bandwidth is desired.

The noise voltage density of a given tube is a function of frequency. At frequencies above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or so, it is basically constant ("white noise"). White noise is often expressed by an equivalent noise resistance, which is defined as the resistance which produces the same voltage noise as present at the tube input. For triodes, it is approximately (2-4)/''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the transconductivity. For pentodes, it is higher, about (5-7)/''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. Tubes with high ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; thus tend to have lower noise at high frequencies. For example, it is 300 Œ© for one half of the ECC88, 250 Œ© for an E188CC (both have ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.5 mA/V) and as low as 65 Œ© for a tride-connected D3a (''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 40 mA/V).

In the audio frequency range (below 1‚Äì100&amp;nbsp;kHz), "1/''f''" noise becomes dominant, which rises like 1/''f''. (This is the reason for the relatively high noise resistamnce of the EF86 in the above example.) Thus, tubes with low noise at high frequency do not necessarily have low noise in the audio frequency range. For special low noise audio tubes, the frequency at which 1/''f'' noise takes over is reduced as far as possible, maybe to something like a kilohertz. It can be reduced by choosing very pure materials for the cathode nickel, and running the tube at an optimized (generally low) anode current.

At radio frequencies, things are more complicated: (i) The input impedance of a tube has a real component that goes down like 1/''f''¬≤ (due to cathode lead inductance and transit time effects). This means the input impedance can no longer be increased arbitrarily in order to reduce the noise figure. (ii) This input resistance has its own thermal noise, just like any resistor. (The "temperature" of this resistor for noise purposes is more close to the cathode temperature than to room temperature). Thus, the noise figure of tube amplifiers increases with frequency. At 200&amp;nbsp;MHz, a noise figure of 2.5 (or 4 dB) can be reached with the ECC2000 tube in an optimized "cascode"-circuit with an optimized source impedance. At 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, tubes like EC8010 have noise figures of about 10 dB or more. Planar triodes are better, but very early, transistors have reached noise figures substantially lower than tubes at UHF. Thus, the tuners of television sets were among the first parts of consumer electronics were transistors were used.

== Decline ==
Semiconductor amplifiers have overwhelmingly displaced valve amplifiers for low and medium power applications at all frequencies.

Valves continue to be used in some high-power, high-frequency amplifiers used for short wave broadcasting, VHF and UHF TV and (VHF) FM radio, also in existing "radar, countermeasures equipment, or communications equipment" (p.&amp;nbsp;56, Symons .. a reference now a decade old) using specially designed valves, such as the [[klystron]], [[gyrotron]], [[traveling-wave tube]], and [[crossed-field amplifier]]; however, new designs for such products are now invariably semiconductor-based.

'''Yorktown Refinery''' was an [[oil refinery]] located alongside of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] built in 1956.  It is now used by Plains All American Pipeline LP as a rail and water oil terminal.

The refinery used to be operated by Giant Industries and earlier operated by BP/Amoco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giant.com/refining/index.asp|title=Giant Industry refining|accessdate=2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Giant Industries was acquired by [[Western Refining]] in 2007.  The refinery could run high [[Total Acid Number|TAN]] crude oil (crude oil with a high content of [[naphthenic acid]]s). The refining operations were shut down in the fall of 2010 and the refinery was later demolished.
