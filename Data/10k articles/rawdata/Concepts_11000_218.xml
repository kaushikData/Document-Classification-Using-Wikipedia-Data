{{DISPLAYTITLE:"''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''" trial in Russia}}
[[Image:Bhagavad-Gita As It Is (Russian).jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Color image of the Russian edition of Bhagavad Gita As It Is front cover|The Russian edition of ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'', which was put on trial in [[Tomsk]].]]
The '''''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''''' '''trial in Russia''' was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book, ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'' (1968), a translation and commentary of the [[Hindu]] holy text, ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', on charges of [[religious extremism]]. It contains a translation and commentary by [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.

The trial was initiated in June 2011 in [[Tomsk, Russia]], based on an assessment of the book by scholars of [[Tomsk State University]], which concluded that Prabhupada's translations and commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as "patently absurd" undertaking of "ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Premier [[Vladimir Putin]] for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for [[India-Russia relations]] and for Russia's international reputation.

In December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was included in the 2011 annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]]  of the [[U.S. Department of State]] among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.

The court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' commissioned by the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]].&lt;ref name=US-DS /&gt; Its authors, three professors of [[Tomsk State University]],  Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]]'s commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' contain "signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction",&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest&gt;{{Cite web|title=Перевод священного писания кришнаитов проверят на экстремизм|trans-title=Translation of the sacred Krishna scriptures to be tried for extremism|url=http://www.ria.ru/inquest/20110831/427685043.html|author=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; and foster "social discord", "gender, race, nationality, and language" discrimination.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; In addition to this, it was alleged to contain "calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups".&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Первый зам генпрокурора, высказавшийся по суду над "Бхагавад-гитой", недостаточно информирован, считают юристы, участвовавшие в процессе|trans-title=Lawyers: First Deputy Prosecutor General insufficiently informed to comment on the trial of the "Bhagavad-gita"|url=http://www.newsru.com/religy/17feb2012/bhagavad.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=17 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-tomsk&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска подала апелляцию на решение суда о "Бхагавад-гите"|trans-title=The Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal of Tomsk court's decision on the "Bhagavad Gita"|url=http://newsru.com/religy/26jan2012/tomsk.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=26 January 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска настаивает на экстремистском характере "Бхагавад-гиты" и подала апелляцию|trans-title=The prosecutor's office in Tomsk insists on an extremist nature "Bhagavad Gita" and filed an appeal"|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2012/01/26/n_2180377.shtml|newspaper=[[Gazeta.ru]]|date=January 26, 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First, second, and third hearings (August 2011)===

In the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt; According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security]] officer Dmitry Velikotsky.&lt;ref name=F18&gt;{{cite news|last=Corley|first=Felix|title=RUSSIA: Has "madness" of banning religious publications been stopped?|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1652|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[Forum 18]]|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite news|last=Попова|first=Анна|title=На поле дхармы|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/12/21/bhagavadgita/|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' did not contain any extremist statements.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the [[Bible]], like: "Don't throw [[wikt:cast pearls before swine|pearls before swine]]".&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

The judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of [[Kemerovo State University]], including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov.&lt;ref name=lenta /&gt; They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not.&lt;ref name=F18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS&gt;{{cite news|author=[[ITAR-TASS]]|script-title=ru:Томский суд отказался признать "Бхагавад-гиту" экстремистской|trans-title=Tomsk court refused to recognize the "Bhagavad Gita" as extremist|date=28 December 2011|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/c9/308329.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.&lt;ref name=TOI-SPD&gt;{{cite news|title=As Hindus rally, Russia court defers Gita verdict|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111230042909/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2011|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=20 December 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal (March 2012)===
On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned,&lt;ref name=TOI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/europe/30666187_1_gita-verdict-social-discord-and-hatred-appeal|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-APP&gt;{{cite news |title=Ban Only Russian Comment in Hindu Holy Book – Prosecutors |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120216/171341942.html |accessdate=16 February 2012 |date=16 February 2012 |agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asking for more time.&lt;ref name=ET-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian prosecutors to move higher court seeking Gita ban |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/russian-prosecutors-to-move-higher-court-seeking-gita-ban/articleshow/11640077.cms|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=26 January 2012}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as "extremist literature."&lt;ref name=firstpost1&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/gita-verdict-russian-prosecutors-planning-to-file-appeal-194858.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The First Post]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and "semantic distortions."&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt;

The prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, "When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond".&lt;ref name=RASPI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor's office appeals adverse judgment in Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120126/259796779.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=1 February 2012|agency=RASPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal in Bhagavad Gita case to be heard in March|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120214/260191734.html|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=RAPSI (Russian Legal Information Agency)|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later rescheduled for March 20.&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

On February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, "it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason." Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, "That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court".&lt;ref name=RIA-APP /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-proc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/religy/16feb2012/bhagavad.html|script-title=ru:В Генпрокуратуре считают, что дело "Бхагавад-гиты" представляется в обществе искаженно|trans-title=The prosecutor's office believes that the "Bhagavad Gita" case is distorted in the community|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=16 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the [[Interfax]] office in Tomsk, [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult]] activist [[Alexander Dvorkin]] stated that the "manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors' complaints in Bhagavad Gita book case legitimate – expert|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9088|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the appeal, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), along with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), stated that they would fight "internationally" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Iskcon to fight against ban attempt on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-23/bhubaneswar/31090291_1_bhagavad-gita-ban-attempts|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dismissal of appeal (March 2012)===
Representative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of "extremism" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred.&lt;ref name=Echo-Moskvy&gt;{{cite news|title=Томский суд вновь отказал прокуратуре в запрете книги "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[Echo Moskvy]]|url=http://echo.msk.ru/news/870830-echo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Суд в Томске вновь отказался признать экстремистской книгу "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[NEWSru]]|url=http://newsru.com/religy/21mar2012/bhagavad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition.&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS-2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDTVxx&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian court dismisses plea seeking ban on Gita|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/russian-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-ban-on-gita-188254|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=21 March 2012|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' extremist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors won't contest court refusal to declare 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' extremist|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120529/263289348.html|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Russian Legal Information Agency|date=29 May 2012|agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, [[Sushma Swaraj]], leader of the largest opposition party [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] demanded that the Indian government declare the ''Bhagavad Gita'' a "national book".&lt;ref name=HT-NB&gt;{{cite news|title=Declare Bhagavad Gita as national book, demands BJP|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220143222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, [[Tarun Vijay]], who asked rhetorically  "Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?"&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; Members across party lines voiced their support.&lt;ref name=HT-NB/&gt;  [[Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha]] [[K.

On December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief [[Vijay Jolly]] met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's "pain and anguish" at the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial and demand that "suitable measures" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that "[[India–Russia relations]] is of paramount importance to both countries". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy  a copy of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' to [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of "sublime thoughts" that "preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties".&lt;ref name=Outlook-BJP&gt;{{cite news|title=Take Steps to Withdraw Gita Case: BJP to Russia|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616082341/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|archive-date=16 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in [[Kolkata]], holding up copies of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|last=Prusty|first=Nigam|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/uk-india-russia-idUKTRE7BI0W620111219|title=Hold India uproar at call in Russia to ban Hindu holy book|work=[[Reuters]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protest marches were held in [[New Delhi]]&lt;ref name=HT-GKG&gt;{{cite news|last=Arora|first=Rajat|title=ISKCON: If Gita is banned, we’ll intensify protest|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=20 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221010708/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|archive-date=21 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Chandigarh]].&lt;ref name=TOI-On&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/chandigarh/30537527_1_bhagawad-gita-signatures-petition|title=Bhagawad Gita on trial gathers online support|last=Negi|first=Himanshi|date=December 20, 2011|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]], ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]]er for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, "I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court".&lt;ref name=HT-GKG /&gt;

On December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he  condemned  "Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Manjari|title=Darul Uloom Deoband urges Hindus, Muslims to unite on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/india/30546086_1_darul-uloom-deoband-hindus-muslims|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism "totally baseless and highly objectionable",&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt; maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience "enshrined" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the "Russian highhandedness".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;
Maulana Khalid Rashid,  head of [[Firangi Mahal]], another Islamic center of higher education in [[Lucknow]],  also condemned what he called "Russian arrogance" and called on Muslims to support  Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government "to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;

On December 22, 2011,  [[Isai Mahasangh]] organization representing  Christians in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] addressed the [[President of India]] [[Pratibha Patil]] and the [[Pope Benedict XVI]], asking for their intervention in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor [[Ram Naresh Yadav]], and to the Pope through the [[Holy See]] embassy in [[New Delhi]]. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that  "the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians".&lt;ref name=Hindu-Chr&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Mahim Pratap|title=Christians in MP oppose proposed Russian ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2738302.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent Hindu teacher [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]] in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia "an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia" and, countering accusations of the book of "extremism" and "intolerance"  opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings.&lt;ref name=DB-NET&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita ban: Outrage grows as sales soar|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/NAT-TOP-bhagvad-gita-ban-outrage-grows-as-sales-soar-2660886.html?HT4=|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu activists====
On December 20, 2011, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)]] threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary [[Pravin Togadia]] said in a statement that the ''Bhagavad Gita'' is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and "touch humanity so very deeply", citing [[Albert Einstein]]'s fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia.&lt;ref name=AA-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP threatens Russian establishments with retaliation if Gita is banned|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/vhp-threatens-russian-establishments-retaliation-if-gita-banned-632|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Asian Age]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the [[Russian consulate in Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Kates|first=Glenn|title=In Russia, the Bhagavad Gita has a date in court|url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/in-russia-the-bhagavad-gita-has-a-date-in-court/|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VHP and [[Bajrang Dal]] activists also staged protest in [[Chandigarh]], calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of [[Hindus in Russia]] and denouncing the proposed ban.&lt;ref name=DB-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Bajrang Dal protest against bid to ban Bhagwad Gita|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/PUN-NEWS-vhp-bajrang-dal-protest-against-bid-to-ban-bhagwad-gita-2657671.html?LHS-|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, dozens of activists of [[Rashtrawadi Sena]], a hardline Hindu group,  burned a [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in [[New Delhi]] over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the ''Gita'' "the most pious book of the nation" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the ''Bhagavad Gita''  a "national scripture" in order to prevent such insults in the future.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion or extremism?

====Atheists and rationalists====
[[Sanal Edamaruku]], the president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the [[Tarksheel Society]], also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.&lt;ref name=atheist/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Dalit]] [[Marxist]] scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.&lt;ref name=atheist&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheists, rationalists oppose ban on Bhagwat Gita|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-12-23/news/30550973_1_ban-iskon-bhagwat-gita|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian community in Goa====

On December 21, 2011,  the Russian community in [[Goa]] has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa [[Vikram Varma]] stated: "The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians in Goa flay possibility of ban on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/goa/30545829_1_russian-consulate-russian-city-goa|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Society====
The trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from  all over the world, mostly from India.&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;

The topic has gone viral on social networks, with the [[hashtag]] #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; Noted poet and lyricist [[Javed Akhtar]], for instance, twitted: "Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;&lt;ref name=Link&gt;{{cite news|title=Should Bhagavad Gita be India’s National Book?|url=http://thelinkpaper.ca/?p=12828|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=The Link|date=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member of Parilament [[Naveen Jindal]] wrote in his blog, "I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the ''Bhagavad Gita'' controversy".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; [[Janata Dal]] party leader [[Subramanian Swamy]] wrote on Twitter: "Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?"&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; and  Bollywood celebrity [[Farah Khan]] suggested in a retweet: "The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;

Prominent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3&gt;{{cite news|last=Nanjappa|first=Vicky|title=Bhagavad Gita ban:Three views, three solutions|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-debate-bhagavad-gita-ban/20111223.htm|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Rediff News|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A vocal anti-fundamentalist [[Ram Puniyani]] of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita'' translation "irrational",&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;  Former president of the [[Students Islamic Movement of India]] Shahid Badr Falahi said he was "completely against"&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; this or any other bans of religious books, calling on  "equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; [[Ram Madhav]], national executive member of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]  termed the attempted ban "a shameful act"  planned by some "fundamentalist groups in Russia" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a "terror manual".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;

===In Russia===
The Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like "Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

====Indian diaspora and ISKCON====
Hare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; On November 1, ISKCON leader in India [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]] appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;  Hindu followers in Russia from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nepal]] and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the [[Hindu Council of Russia]] meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected [[Sadhu Priya Das]], and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman.  Das said that  they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that "finally the truth will prevail".&lt;ref name=STAT-BAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Statesman /&gt;

ISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTx/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNLx /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-reject&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court rejects bid to ban "Bhagavad-Gita"|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/28/tomsk_court_rejects_the_bid_to_ban_bhagavad-gita_14108.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-bilateral&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita in court: Overcoming unexpected roadblock to relationship|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/10/bhagavad_gita_in_court_overcoming_unexpected_roadblock_to_bilateral_14141.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholars====
[[Islamic studies]] scholar [[Roman Silantyev]] opined that  Prabhupada's interpretation "has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.&lt;ref name=Interfax-MID&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper&amp;nbsp;– ministry|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8941|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=23 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'', scientists and members of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, "there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations."&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

Sergey Serebryanny, the head of the [[Institute of High Humanitarian Studies]] at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers "have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation".&lt;ref name=RT /&gt;

Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the ''Bhagavad Gita'', which "is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was "admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, "nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism  against Prabhupada's "copious" commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are fallacious and based on a "primitive" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as "fool," "enemy," "demon, "kill"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when  "specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards "a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy  book to ''Mein Kampf'', should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, "people will again start being burned alive".&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

Historian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the ''Gita'' was "contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, "one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' Volodin replied that "all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world".&lt;ref name=RIR-Volodin&gt;{{cite news|last=Volodin|first=Andrei|title=Gita row: A test of Russian toleration|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/gita_row_a_test_of_russian_toleration_14077.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government====
In an interview by ''[[CNN-IBN]]'', Russia's ambassador to India [[Alexander Kadakin]] called ''Bhagavad Gita'' "the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world."

He assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the ''Bhagavad Gita'' scandal and added that he thought it "categorically inadmissible" to take any sacred scriptures "for examination to ignorant people" to the courts  rather than to academic forums&lt;ref name=IE-RU&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia expresses sadness over Bhagwad Gita controversy|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/russia-expresses-sadness-over-bhagwad-gita-controversy/889960/0|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=KadTOI /&gt; Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still "can do something" and called the instigators of the trial "madmen", whose "madness should be stopped."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it "has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;

On December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban.&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK&gt;{{cite news|title=Krishna discusses Bhagavad Gita row with Russian ambassador|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-27/india/30560871_1_court-in-tomsk-city-bhagavad-gita-nerpa|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 December 2011|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia "to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that "no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court".&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK /&gt;

According to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also "expressed regrets" about the situation.&lt;ref name=Hindu-LS /&gt;

Russian [[Ombudsman|Chief Director]] for [[Human rights in Russia|Human Rights]] [[Vladimir Lukin]] stated that the attempt to ban ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' amounted to "infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness"&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=India asks Russia to drop the case against Gita translation|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2731900.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was "unacceptable" to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a "globally respected book".&lt;ref name=Statesman&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita ban: Russian court suspends verdict till 28 Dec|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108011714/http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|archivedate=8 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.&lt;ref name=TheHindu-MID&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Gita ban: Russia rejects India's complaints|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2741599.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a December 22, 2011 press briefing, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]] spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: "In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C.

The book was translated into Russian in 1984.

Nelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial "absurd". Speaking on the ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'' radio station, she said, "This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years."  She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to "violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith." &lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

The court case  evoked protests by US-based [[Hindu]] activists, who called the trial "an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire [[Hindu]] community."&lt;ref name=YahooNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/hindus-upset-bhagavad-gita-ban-attempt-russian-city-095924009.html|title=Hindus upset at Bhagavad Gita ban attempt by Russian city|work= [[Asian News International|ANI]]|publisher = [[Yahoo!

Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors "indefensible" and "a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia".
Shukla added that, "[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society".&lt;ref name=HAF /&gt; HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government "to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens". They also warned that "Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world".&lt;ref name=HAF&gt;{{cite news|last=Jha|first=Lalit K.|title=Hindus in US outraged at attempts to ban Gita in Russia|url=http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5694646|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=[[MSN News]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, [[Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal]], condemned the proposed ban, urging the [[Politics of Nepal|government]] and the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Parliament]] to support the ''Bhagavad Gita''. Chairman of the Dharma Sabha [[Madhav Bhattarai]] also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal.&lt;ref name=HimTimes1&gt;{{cite news|title=Dharma Sabha Nepal denounces ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Dharma+Sabha+Nepal+denounces+ban+on+Gita&amp;NewsID=313585|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the ''Gita'' "guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban.&lt;ref name=HimTimes2&gt;{{cite news|title='Bhagwat Gita is not extremist literature'|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline='Bhagwat+Gita+is+not+extremist+literature'&amp;NewsID=313597&amp;a=3|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] in its annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]] for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of  "selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom" by the Russian government. The report quoted the Russian Ombudsperson for Human Rights Vladimil Lukin as saying that  "the struggle with terrorism is a struggle with real terrorist planning and creation of groups, not with the interpretation of ancient holy books, of whatever faith".&lt;ref name=US-DS&gt;{{cite web|last=[[United States Department of State]]|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2011|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193067.pdf|publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholars===
{{Wikinews|Russian scholars call on Medvedev and Putin to defend Bhagavad Gita}}
On February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference ''Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society'' at the Tomsk State University.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita case perplex scientists|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120224/260445972.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=RAPSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said they were "perplexed" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the ''Bhagavad Gita as It Is'' declared extremist. [[Chief researcher]] of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], indologist [[Irina Glushkova]] said in an interview with ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' that there are various schools of Hinduism "and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary", adding that "from this point of view ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office".&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt; She also stated it was "impermissible" to subject the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' to a criminal court trial, because "it is inseparable from the original ''Bhagavad Gita'', both being parts of the same culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Рассматривать "Бхагавад-гиту как она есть" с точки зрения Уголовного кодекса - недопустимо, утверждают ученые|trans-title=Scholars: It's impermissible to view the Bhagavad Gita As It Is via the Criminal Code|url=http://www.interfax-russia.ru/Siberia/report.asp?id=295556|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosopher [[Tatyana Lyubimova]], chief researcher of the [[Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], said that most ancient scriptures, including the ''Bhagavad Gita'', were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

On March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[Oriental studies|orientologists]], and [[philology|philologists]] published an open letter addressing both [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] and [[President-elect]] [[Vladimir Putin]], with copies sent to Russia's [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Presecutor General]], [[Ministry of Justice of Russia|Ministry of Justice]], and [[Public Chamber]], urging the ruling tandem to take the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' court case under their "personal control".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Russian scholars' plea on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2999643.ece|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 March 2012|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsru-20&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Российские ученые просят Медведева и Путина взять процесс над "Бхагавад-гитой" под личный контроль|trans-title=Russian scholars ask Medvedev and Putin to take "Bhagavad Gita" court case under their personal control|url=http://newsru.com/religy/15mar2012/bhagavad.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=15 March 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as "untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Bengali Vaishnavism]], "one of the most popular branches of Hinduism",&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; and "did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial "discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

===ISKCON===
Maxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]], said that the commentary to ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' is "a precise and clear reflection" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-[[acharya]] of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us", said [[Ajai Malhotra]], Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name=RIR-Mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court dismisses Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/03/21/tomsk_court_dismisses_bhagavad_gita_case_15204.html|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible. This demonstrates yet again that the people of India and Russia have a deep understanding of each other’s cultures and will always reject any attempt to belittle our common civilizational values", said Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTx /&gt;

====Human Rights Commissioner====
{{expand section|date=April 2012}}
On April 11, 2012 [[Vladimir Lukin]], the [[Human Rights]] [[Commissioner]] of Russia, "warned against court decisions on ''Bhagavad Gita'' texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations." Lukin stated that the "Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to [[theologian]]s and [[historian]]s." Lukin noted that "[[Winston Churchill]] once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it."&lt;ref name=dailymail-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns Gita rulings should be up to experts|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2128403/Russian-ombudsman-warns-Gita-rulings-experts.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 April 2012|location=London|first=Dadan|last=Upadhyay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns on Gita rulings|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/russian-ombudsman-warns-on-gita-rulings/1/184131.html|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita Texts Up for Experts to Judge - Russian Ombudsman|url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20120411/172744774.html|newspaper=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religions====
On December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council [[Roman Silantyev]] said that the examination of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' as extremist was accurate, and that "it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism."

He also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with "extremely nasty reputation" and condemned their [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|charitable food distribution programs]] saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.&lt;ref name=IFSil&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court didn't find "Bhagavad Gita" translation extremist|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8953|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=28 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a "destructive cult" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It''.  [[Mufti]] Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, 
"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to "pay the debt" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable  food distribution by "delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites".&lt;ref name=IF-Mus&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Muslims believe Krishnaites a sect and ready to deliver them Halal meat|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8986|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=18 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Siberian prosecutors make another attempt to ban Prabhupada’s Gita interpretation|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/26/siberian_prosecutors_make_another_attempt_to_ban_prabhupadas_gita_in_14630.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as "fortunately" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal /&gt;

On January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', which they called an "anti-Russian … disgraceful act" and "one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orthodox believers conveyed a batch of tinned stewed meat to Moscow Krishnaites in protest against burning Russian flag|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9015|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is "misinformed" and "exerting pressure" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because "there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet".&lt;ref name=IF-Bud&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:В буддийской общине РФ выступают против строительства храма кришнаитов в Москве|trans-title=The Buddhist community of Russia spoke against the construction of Krishna temple in Moscow|url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=44000|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=31 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born on July 24, 1871, as '''Abby Pearce Scott''' in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to Robert Nicholson Scott (1838&amp;ndash;1887) and Elizabeth Goodale Casey (1844&amp;ndash;1912). Her father and grandfather were Army officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2BJygCeSLQC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=Abby+Scott+Baker+sons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7p7GiaPQAhVDfiYKHQbXBCkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Abby%20Scott%20Baker%20sons&amp;f=false|title=American Feminism: Key Source Documents, 1848-1920|last=Beer|first=Janet|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415219457|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated at the Norwood Institute.

She married Robert Walker Baker (1863&amp;ndash;1956) around 1893.  The couple had three sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Suffrage activist ==
Bakers was one of [[Alice Paul]]’s earliest associates. She helped Alice Paul and [[Lucy Burns]] plan their first major event–the March 3, 1913, national suffrage parade on the eve of Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

In 1914 she served as treasurer of the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/selected-leaders-of-the-national-womans-party/lobbyists.html |title=Abby Scott Baker (1871-1944) |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23 |quote= |publisher= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker traveled the country as part of the Congressional Union’s “Suffrage Special” train tour of western states in April–May 1916. Baker was in charge of handling the press for the tour. The support that she helped raise from women in states that had already granted women’s suffrage.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;  On April 29, Baker wrote to ''The Suffragist'' on how the tour was received '[Men] invariably call out, 'Here come the Suffragettes,' but very soon they are saying, 'She's all right,' and 'That's straight lady,' or some such approving phrase..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030480556/cu31924030480556_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The story of the Woman's Party"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tour culminated in a June 1916 meeting in Chicago to form what was at first called the Woman’s Party of Western Voters, or Woman’s Party, for short (NWP). When the NWP was more formally organized in relation to the CU in March 1917, Baker was elected to the NWP executive committee and served as its press chairman (1917-18) and political chairman (1917; 1919-21).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Baker was among the first demonstrators to picket the White House; she was arrested in September 1917 and sentenced to 60 days in the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]]. In February–March 1919, she served as publicity manager and speaker for the “Prison Special,” a three-week lecture tour by NWP activists who spoke to packed audiences about their jail experiences in an effort to generate support for the suffrage cause.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; The other speakers included [[Lillian Ascough]], [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] and [[Lucy Burns]]. They spoke publicly, distributed literature, and sold the [[The Suffragist|''Suffragist''.]] This tour was credited with arousing interest in federal suffrage among, prospective, voting age women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/archive/suffragists/SuffragistsSpeak/1916.html|title=Suffragists Timeline: 1916|website=groups.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the NWP’s patriotism was challenged, she reminded critics that her three sons were fighting in World War I.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Baker maintained an intense travel schedule before and during the campaign season for the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], shuttling between the campaign headquarters of [[Warren G. Harding]] in Ohio and [[James M. Cox]] in Tennessee, building close relationships with both candidates. Baker's indefatigable efforts drew a great deal of media attention, and helped to normalize the presence of women in the political sphere in the public imagination.&lt;ref name="milcit" /&gt;

== Later life ==
After suffrage was achieved, Baker became a member of the NWP’s Committee on International Relations and the Women’s Consultative Committee of the League of Nations. She also represented the NWP at the League’s 1935 international conferences in Geneva where the issue of equal rights was discussed.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

She died on May 13, 1944, in [[Washington, DC]].

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was one of the first countries in the Balkans to adopt the  Freedom of Access to Information Act, at the State level in 2000, and then in 2001 in both of its entities, namely the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]]. However, according to some experts the law requires changes to address a series of shortcomings that have been identified over the years.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher=Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |issue=|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Analitika&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=December 2013 |title=Towards Proactive Transparency in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=http://www.analitika.ba/sites/default/files/publikacije/proaktivna_transparentnost_policy_memo_eng_4juni_web.pdf  |publisher=Analitika. Centre for Social Research |issue= Policy Memo |access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Due to the specific circumstances and the way in which it was created, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, annex IV of [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Agreement]] did not pay much attention to the right to information.&lt;ref name=Internews&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mehmed HALILOVIĆ and Amer DŽIHANA |date=2012 |title=Media Law in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=http://www.internews.ba/sites/default/files/attachments/Media%20law%20in%20BiH%20eng.pdf |publisher=Internews in Bosnia and Herzegovina |access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of freedom of information legislation was initiated with a decision of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] in 1999. The Decision asked the State and the Entities to adopt such a legislation. The consultation process for drafting the law involved the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)]]’s legal experts and extensive public discussions with citizens and civil society groups. The Act was adopted by the Bosnia and Herzegovina State Government in October 2000, and the Republika Srpska Government in May 2001.&lt;ref name=OSCE2001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/bih/53670 |title=Freedom of Access to information Law fully adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina  |last= |first= |date=26 June 2001 |website=Osce.org |publisher= Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
The laws establish a general right of the public to access the information held by public authorities/organs “to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest”. Therefore, the laws establish a general obligation of making all relevant information public, except for some cases falling under the exceptions defined by the law.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Access to public information applies to information held by all public organs (legislative, judiciary, executive and administrative) and regardless of their format (written documents, digital data, audio or video records, etc.) as well as to legal persons owner or controlled by public bodies, such as public enterprises, public schools, universities, state agencies, etc. On the contrary, it does not apply to private organisations, private companies and the commercial sector.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The laws entitle every person, regardless of his or her citizenship, nationality, ethnicity, or place of residence, the right to access to public information. Journalists and media outlet do not have more rights compared with other requesters.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The prescribed period of time for obtaining the requested information is 15 days from the submission of the request.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Under the FOI laws, public authorities are both obliged to provide access to documents and records and to publish the most important information without a request ([[proactive disclosure]]). Rules for proactive publication apply to information on institutions’ budget, regular activities and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

===Exceptions===
In line with international standards, access to information laws in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Republika Srpska establish that in some cases public information can be withheld on a legal basis. Specifically, three cases of exceptions are foreseen: first, when there is the possibility that disclosing information can cause a significant damage to legitimate functions of the government (national security, defence, monetary policy issues, prevention of crime, etc.); second, the exceptions can be applied to protect commercial interests; and, third, to protect personal interests and privacy of a third party.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The application of these exceptions is not automatic: in effect, in order to reject the application on the basis of the exceptions established in the law, authorities have to make the [[public interest test]], meaning considering whether and how the disclosure of information is harming other protected interests.The public interest test is inspired by the most advanced international standards on the right of access to public information. Compared with similar laws in the [[Western Balkans]], only the laws of [[Access to public information in Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Access to public information in Croatia|Croatia]] prescribe such a test.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Exceptions are applied only after a case-by-case analysis of every case and specific circumstances related to each request. Labeling a whole category of information as exemption is forbidden.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

In Bosnia and Herzegovina some NGOs contribute to enforce the law on access to public information as well as to monitor its application and collect relevant data through the submission of FOI requests and the start of appeal procedures. This is the case, for instance, of the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), [[Transparency International]] (Bosnia and Herzegovina), or the Sarajevo-based [[Center for Investigative Journalism (CIN)]].&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Il-difficile-accesso-alle-informazioni-in-Bosnia-Erzegovina-177818 |title=Il difficile accesso alle informazioni in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last=Mišeljić |first=Ljupko |date=16 February 2017|website=Balcanicaucaso.org|publisher= Media Centar Sarajevo/Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|access-date=16 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report prepared by the [[Association of journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the country’s Press Council, the vast majority of Bosnians (around 93%) believe that there are several limitations to the right of access to public information in practice.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13562/  |title=Media Freedom in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last= |first= |date=2016 |website=Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Programme South East Europe |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same, public opinion in Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely not fully aware of their rights with regard to access to public information.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

When it comes to the application of the law, problems range from inconsistent interpretation of the law by different public bodies, unwillingness to apply it, to non-harmonisation of FOI laws with other laws.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;

Specifically, one of the major deficiency of freedom of information laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the weakness of the provisions concerning the appeal procedures in case the request is rejected. The FOI law of the Republika Srpska does not stipulate an appeal procedure at all.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Another problem concerns the lack of compliance with other existing laws that exclude or significantly reduce the right to free access to information in practice both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Also, experts have identified among the shortcomings hindering the application of FOI laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina the lack of an effective system for monitoring their application. Only a small number of public bodies comply with the obligation to publish the information on the number of received questions related to freedom of information on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

In 2013-16 in order to test the implementation of FOI laws, the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN) submitted a series of requests for accessing documents to different public bodies in the country at all level. Half of BIRN’s requests for information were rejected, while the remaining 50 per cent were only partially granted.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

Also, according to [[Transparency International]] - Bosnia and Herzegovina only 40% of public enterprises in Republika Srpska and 27% in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides the requested information within the timeframe established by the law. In 37% of cases examined by Transparency International the fulfillment of the procedure lasts more than one month, even if the law stipulates that the information requested must be provided in maximum 15 days.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

      <comment>I changed the definition. It now states that (1)⇔(2)⇔(3). This is a stronger statement that what was previously given. (2) and (3) consequently belong into the definition. A side effect is that no preference is given to any of the 3 conditions, as should be the case since they are equivalent.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[multilinear algebra]], an '''alternating multilinear map''' is a [[multilinear map]] with all arguments belonging to the same space (e.g., a [[bilinear form]] or a [[multilinear form]]) that is zero whenever any two adjacent arguments are equal.

The notion of '''alternatization''' (or '''alternatisation''' in [[British English]]) is used to derive an alternating multilinear map from any multilinear map with all arguments belonging to the same space.

== Definition ==

A multilinear map of the form &lt;math&gt;f\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''alternating''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
# if there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lang-2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|pages=511–512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|2007|p=A III.80, §4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# if there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1 \leq i \neq j \leq n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lang-2002"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dummit-Foote-2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Dummit|Foote|2004|p=436}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# if &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly dependent]] then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==

* In a [[Lie algebra]], the [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]] is an alternating bilinear map.

* The [[determinant]] of a matrix is a multilinear alternating map of the rows or columns of the matrix.

== Properties ==

* If any component ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an alternating multilinear map is replaced by {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''c x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for any {{nowrap|''j'' ≠ ''i''}} and ''c'' in the base ring ''R'', then the value of that map is not changed.&lt;ref name="Dummit-Foote-2004"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every alternating multilinear map is antisymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotman|1995|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''n''! is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] in the base ring ''R'', then every antisymmetric ''n''-multilinear form is alternating.

== Alternatization ==

Given a multilinear map of the form &lt;math&gt;f\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt;, the alternating multilinear map &lt;math&gt;g\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;g(x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma)f(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(n)})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the '''alternatization''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

; Properties

* The alternatization of an ''n''-multilinear alternating map is ''n''! times itself.
* The alternatization of a [[symmetric map]] is zero.
* The alternatization of a [[bilinear map]] is bilinear. Most notably, the alternatization of any [[Chain complex|cocycle]] is bilinear. This fact plays a crucial role in identifying the second [[Cohomology|cohomology group]] of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with the group of alternating [[bilinear form]]s on a lattice.

An '''alternative lifestyle''' is a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] diverse in respect to [[mainstream]] ones, or generally perceived to be outside the cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]. ''Lifestyle'' is a [[media culture]] term derived from the concept of [[style in art]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. ''Introduction'', in [[Adorno]] ''[[Culture industry]]'' p.35 quotation: {{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and ‘different’ commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative ‘life-styles’.&lt;br&gt;
‘Life-styles’, the culture industry’s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, but not always, it implies an affinity or identification within some matching [[subculture]] (e.g. [[hippies]], [[Goth subculture|goths]] and [[Punk subculture|punks]]). Some people with alternative lifestyles mix elements from various subcultures ([[grunge]] musicians were often influenced by a mixture of the [[punk subculture|punk]], [[acid rock|hippie]], [[emo]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subcultures).

Not all minority lifestyles are held{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to be "alternative", so the term tends to apply to newer forms of lifestyle, often based upon enlarged freedoms (especially in the sphere of social styles), or a decision to substitute another approach, or to not follow the usual expected path in most societies.

== History ==
Alternative lifestyles and subcultures originated in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=f5rLCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+flapper+women&amp;ots=kv9L6jn-h-&amp;sig=8djPjwlb-1GHEYp_SKWp-gpfLsE#v=snippet&amp;q=flapper&amp;f=false|title=Modern women on trial: Sexual transgression in the age of the flapper|last=Bland|first=Lucy|date=2013-09-30|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781847798961|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} with the "[[flapper]]" movement, when women cut their hair and skirts short (as a symbol of freedom from oppression and the old way of living). Women in the flapper age were the first large group of females to practice pre-marital sex, dancing, cursing, and driving in modern America without scandal following them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A [[Stanford University]] cooperative house, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160730005004/http://web.stanford.edu/group/synergy/ Synergy], was founded in 1972 with the theme of "exploring alternative lifestyles."

'''Anne Fausto-Sterling''' (born July 30, 1944) is the [[Nancy Duke Lewis]] Professor of Biology and Gender Studies at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|title=Anne Fausto-Sterling|url=https://brown.edu/Faculty/COSTS/people/facultypage.php?id=1100924089|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She participates actively in the field of [[sexology]] and has written extensively on the fields of [[Sex differences in humans|biology of gender]], [[sexual identity]], [[gender identity]], and [[gender role]]s.

==Life and career==

Fausto-Sterling received her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[zoology]] from [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1965 and her Ph.D. in [[developmental genetics]] from [[Brown University]] in 1970. She has taught at Brown since earning her Ph.D. and is the Nancy Duke Lewis Professor of Biology and Gender Studies in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry there.

She has written two books intended for the general audience.  The second edition of the first of those books, ''Myths of Gender'', was published in 1992.&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-04792-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fausto-Sterling, Anne |title=Myths of gender: biological theories about women and men |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-465-04792-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second book for the general public is ''[[Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality]]'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-07714-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fausto-Sterling, Anne |title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-465-07714-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She stated that in it she sets out to "convince readers of the need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development."

This thought experiment was interpreted by some as a serious proposal or even a theory; advocates for [[intersex]] people stated that this theory was wrong, confusing and unhelpful to the interests of intersex people. In a later paper ("The Five Sexes, Revisited"&lt;ref name="pmid12569934"/&gt;), she has acknowledged these objections.

Fausto-Sterling serves on the editorial board of the journal ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'' and on the advisory board of the feminist academic journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/perspectives-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board|title=Editorial Board {{!}} JHU Press|website=www.press.jhu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fausto-Sterling is married to [[Paula Vogel]], a Yale professor and [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer-winning playwright]]. Fausto-Sterling's mother, [[Dorothy Sterling]], was a noted writer and historian while her father was also a published writer.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite web |title=Paula Vogel, Anne Fausto-Sterling |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-09-26 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/fashion/weddings/26VOGE.html?ex=1185163200&amp;en=74206651722ac22b&amp;ei=5070   |accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===Naturalism===
"Of Gender and Genitals" is the third chapter of ''Sexing the Body'' by Fausto-Sterling. The chapter starts with a case study description of [[sickle cell anemia]], including [[hemoglobin]] and the risk of having hemoglobin-S crystallize, which leads to intense pain and potential paralysis in times of stress. The lecture on sickle cell anemia ends with two simple conclusions: the first is that a slight alteration to a DNA sequence will leave major changes to the DNA on the whole; the second is that traits and defects cannot be easily predicted. Fausto-Sterling's data goes on to state that genes alone do not decide phenotypes; phenotypes are instead decided by the environmental and developmental history of the person, in addition to their total genetic endowment. In the same regard, behavior is not solely decided by only genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theories of Gender Development (4)|url=http://ckbooks.com/psychology/gender-issues-in-psychology/theories-of-gender-development-4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data further goes on to state that while the number of nerves is decided in the former half of pregnancy, cellular interconnection continues to multiply and grow throughout the first four years of life. In addition, the mind and temperament of an adult is shaped by the environment he or she is raised in. Factors included, physical fitness, nutrition, and interpersonal relations with other people. Through these studies and analytical work, the following four gender development theories of biological determinist, psychoanalytic, social learning, and cognitive development have been devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 3: Of Gender and Genitals |title=Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality |location=New York, NY |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |pages=44–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender development theory===
Following a summary of the prior, Fausto-Sterling shows her points on the gender development theories by noting how XY and XX chromosomes stay identical up until the 6th week of development in the womb. During these six weeks, the XY/XX embryos develop an indifferent gonad, an extra layer that isn't affected by the chromosome embryo due to their indistinguishable similarity at the time. This external process develops in a similar manner to the various male and female reproductive organs that later develop within the body. By the end of the first month and a half, all embryos would've developed, regardless of gender. In addition, the chromosomes within the cells will have developed different sets of [[Mesonephric duct|mesonephric ducts]] that are indifferent to gender. A set of ducts ultimately becomes the aforementioned reproductive organs based on the sex of the fetus. Once the Y chromosome in the XY embryo triggers, an extensive and lengthy process is detailed on the development of male fetuses. Conversely, far less is known on the development of XX fetuses. What is known about the female XX is that the fetuses produce approximately the same amount of estrogen in comparison to the testosterone production in the male XY. Later down the line of fetus growth, the originally identical genitalia of the two types of fetus will differentiate on the eighth week. In some cases the XY fetus will initially begin to develop female genitals instead of the male penis and scrotum due to a deficiency in [[dihydrotestosterone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contribution of dihydrotestosterone to male sexual behaviour|url=http://bmj.com/content/310/6990/1289}}&lt;/ref&gt; After detailing the opinions of John Money and Julianne Imperato-McGuinely on gender identity, Fausto-Sterling concludes with the three influences that affect gender – genetic regulatory information, intrusion from outside the womb, and "chance variation" in development – and two points on sexual development."

===The Standard Model===&lt;!--Linked from 'Biological determinism''--&gt;
Sex and gender are two separate characterizations of people and a standard model exists for both sex and gender.  Biology characterizes sex by dimorphism.  In other words, people are either male or female and nothing in between.  Surgical procedures ensure that people are assigned to one of the two accepted sexes.  Gender, separate from sex, is socially constructed by culture.  People determine the definition of gender by assigning roles to each gender.  For example, generally, males are expected to work and women are expected to stay home and care for their family.  By assigning a specific role to a gender, we have created a standard model of what it means to be male or female.  In essence, the standard model characterizes by masculinity and femininity and separates nature and nurture.

In chapter three of ''Sexing the Body'', "Of Gender and Genitals", Fausto-Sterling criticizes the standard model and the way it impacts those both neither male nor female.  She explains that doctors surgically assign infants male or female when they are not born with “normal” genitals.  Fausto-Sterling believes that as children grow and become either more masculine or feminine “[[nurture]] matters a great deal more than nature” because it affects the child's inclinations towards becoming hetero- or homo- sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body, Of Gender and Genitals|year=2000|location=New York, NY|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; When doctors studied the spectrum of genders, Sterling criticized that “they never questioned the fundamental assumptions that there are only two sexes, because their goal in studying intersexual was to find out more about normal development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-07714-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctors’ motives for the research of intersexual show that they promote the standard model for sex and are unwilling to accept the fact that there are different variations of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexuality|url=http://www.annefaustosterling.com/fields-of-inquiry/sexuality/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sterling strongly believes that doctors are unethical in that they do not allow variations of sex and immediately assign a sex within a few hours of birth because there is not a way of telling whether the infant will be content with their assigned gender. Furthermore, “whatever treatment they choose…physicians… decide how to manage [[Intersex|intersexuality]] act out of…deeply held beliefs about male and female sexuality [and] gender roles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-07714-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling argues that the consequence of performing sexual reassignment surgery on intersex infants “[develops] a language that reinforces the idea that lurking inside the mixed-sex child is a real male or female body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-07714-5|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that this is unacceptable because now that society vehemently believes that only males or females should exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | title = The five sexes: why male and female are not enough | journal = [[The Sciences]] | pages = 20&amp;ndash;24 | publisher = [[New York Academy of Sciences]] via [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x | date = March–April 1993 | url = http://capone.mtsu.edu/phollowa/5sexes.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.fd.unl.pt/docentes_docs/ma/TPB_MA_5937.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; a window to a spectrum of genders closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Ann|title=The Five Sexes Revisited|url=http://www.neiu.edu/~lsfuller/5sexesrevisited.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121131920/http://www.neiu.edu/~lsfuller/5sexesrevisited.htm|archivedate=November 21, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even more so, those who are born intersex are forced to live unhappy lives full of surgery and scrutiny because they did not fit the standard model.  In order to change the standard model, Sterling suggests that we should question, “should there be only two sexes?”

===''Sexing the Body''===
In chapter three of the book ''Sexing The Body'', titled "Of Gender and Genitals", Fausto-Sterling details the sexing of the human body.
When an intersex child is first born, a "medical emergency" is called. Gender reassignment surgery is relied upon in order to "fix the problem" because the body must have a specific sex. Deciding whether to call a child a boy or a girl, then, employs social definitions of the essential components of gender.  Fausto-Sterling describes the "Phall-o-metrics", the measurement technique used to determine medically acceptable penis or clitoris. Fausto-Sterling implies that the body is sexed and this sexing comes from the standards that society has placed on what a male and a female are supposed to look like and be. These definitions are primarily cultural, not biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|pages=44–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Josef Stanislaus Berson''' (6 August 1859 &amp;ndash; 3 December 1942) was a [[Germans|German]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/3876507/berson-artur.html Encyklopedia PWN - Berson Artur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=encyclopedia+of+climate&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V4TgUdLYB8WROKbFgZAC&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=berson&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 July 2013 |year=2011 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-976532-4 |page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[meteorologist]] and pioneer of [[aerology]] who was a native of Neu Sandez, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now [[Nowy Sącz]], [[Poland]]).

After visiting the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Neu Sandez, Berson studied [[philology]] in [[University of Vienna|Vienna]]. He then studied [[meteorology]] and [[geography]] in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where he had as instructors [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Wilhelm von Bezold]]. In 1890 he was an assistant to meteorologist [[Richard Assmann|Richard Aßmann]] at the Meteorological Institute in Berlin. During this period of time he was also secretary of the ''Deutschen Verein zur Förderung der Luftschiffahrt'', the first [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] organization in Germany. In 1900 he became ''Hauptobservator'' at the newly founded Aeronautics Observatory in Berlin-[[Tegel]], and was later stationed at the Lindenberg Aeronautical Observatory in [[Beeskow]]. From 1896 to 1899 Berson was editor of the magazine ''Zeitschrift für Luftfahrt und Physik der Atmosphäre'' (Magazine for Aviation and Physics of the Atmosphere).

== Scientific research ==
Berson is largely known for his scientific hot-air balloon expeditions. On 4 December 1894, he ascended to a then-record altitude of 9,155 meters aboard the hydrogen balloon ''Phoenix''. On 10 January 1901, with artillery officer Alfred Hildebrandt (1870–1949), he travelled from Berlin to [[Markaryd]], [[Sweden]] in a balloon, thus being the first to cross the [[Baltic Sea]] by air. On 10 January 1902, with balloonist Hermann Elias (1876–1955), he set the German long-distance ballooning record, as the two men journeyed from Berlin to [[Poltava]] in the central [[Ukraine]] (1,470 kilometers in 30 hours).

During the 1890s, he was involved in international "simultaneous ascents" with balloonists from other nations. These ascents were performed in order to study variances of [[climate|climatic]] conditions above different locations in Europe, to work to bring about uniformity in methods of observation, and to create increased cooperation among nations in the new science of [[aerology]].
[[File:Assmann Berson.jpg|right|thumb|With Richard Aßmann; Berson at the right]] 
On 31 July 1901, with meteorologist [[Reinhard Süring]], he took his most celebrated ascent. Starting from Berlin-[[Tempelhof]] aboard the ''Preussen'', Berson and Süring ultimately reached a height of 10,800 meters above [[sea level]]. At 6000 m. they required compressed oxygen, at 10,000 m. both scientists were rendered unconscious, and after regaining consciousness were able to land their balloon near [[Briesen, Oder-Spree|Briesen]], 7.5 hours after their flight began. Their record ascent had significant scientific importance. Climatic data taken from simultaneously released unmanned [[Atmospheric sounding|sounding]] balloons agreed with the information gathered from the Berson/Süring ascent. Now scientists such as Richard Aßmann no longer had any reason to distrust temperature readings taken from unmanned balloons, an important factor that led to the discovery of the [[stratosphere]] by Aßmann and [[Teisserenc de Bort]] in 1902.

Another important aspect of high-altitude flight involved [[physiology|physiological]] problems that balloonists could experience when exposed to conditions at great heights. Here, Berson assisted physiologists [[Hermann von Schrötter]] and [[Nathan Zuntz]] with pioneer experiments in the field of [[aviation medicine]]. He undertook high-altitude balloon ascents with the two physiologists, and conducted studies of [[decompression sickness]] with a [[decompression chamber|pneumatic chamber]] located at the ''Jüdischen Krankenhaus'' (Jewish Hospital) in Berlin.

Other significant accomplishments by Berson include climatic studies with weather kites off of [[Svalbard]], pioneer meteorological observations from [[German East Africa]], and aerological research over the [[Amazon Basin]].

[[File:Dunedin recycling bins 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue box recycling bins]]

The '''blue box recycling system''' (BBRS) was initially a [[waste management]] system used by [[Canada|Canadian]] municipalities to collect source separated [[Municipal solid waste|household waste]] materials for the purpose of recycling. The first full-scale community wide BBRS was implemented in 1983 by the waste management contractor Ontario Total Recycling Systems Ltd. (a subsidiary of [[Laidlaw]] Waste Systems) for the [[Kitchener, Ontario|City of Kitchener]], Ontario. The blue box recycling system was implemented as part of the city's waste management procedures. The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.

==Overview==
Today, many municipalities operate blue box programs that accept all forms of paper materials, most plastic packaging, glass containers, [[aluminum can]]s and [[Tin can|steel cans]]. For example, the City of Greater Napanee accepts:
* [[Glass Bottles|Glass bottles]] and jars, including all glass containers which previously contained a food or beverage product.
* Metal food and beverage cans, including all hard shell steel or [[aluminum]] containers which previously contained a food or beverage product.
* [[Aluminium foil|Aluminum foil]], meaning food wrap, food packaging and kitchenware such as pie plates made from a thin sheet of aluminum.
* Rigid-shell plastic containers, including [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PETE#I), high-density polyethylene (HDPE #2), [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE #4), polypropylene (PP #5) and polystyrene (PS #6), which previously contained a non-hazardous [[consumer product]].
* Rigid foam plastic containers.
* Newspapers, magazines, flyers and household papers.
* Old boxboard and old cardboard (non-waxed, flattened &amp; bundled no larger than 30"x30"x8").
* Bundled [[plastic bag]]s (LDPE).
* Other material as designated by the town from time to time.

The municipality provides the blue boxes to residents in areas serviced by the recycling program. This usually includes all [[single-family home]]s and townhouse units receiving [[Waste collection|garbage collection]]. Tenants of [[apartment building]]s typically do not use blue boxes but rather deposit their household recyclable materials in larger containers made available.

==History==

===Early stages===
An organization called Pollution Probe was formed in 1969 by students and faculty at the [[University of Toronto]] and in 1971, members published a report stressing the need for recycling. Also in 1971, the Canadian Federal Government first established a national Department of the Environment, known as [[Environment Canada]], with Environmental protection as one of its priorities. The Ontario government followed suit with a Ministry of the Environment in 1972.

Jack McGinnis of Toronto helped form a community-based non-profit organization called "Is Five" Foundation in 1974. Named for a book of poetry by [[e.e. cummings]], Is Five organized Canada’s first multi-material curbside pickup of recyclable material for 80,000 households of [[The Beaches]] neighbourhood of east [[Toronto]]. In 1977, Jack McGinnis and Derek Stephenson created a private consulting company, Resource Integration Systems (RIS) to advise governments in the field of recycling and waste management.

That same year, in response to the [[1973 energy crisis]], Rick Findlay was hired by Environment Canada’s Federal Facilities Program to develop and coordinate a resource conservation program primarily for federal government facilities in Ontario. The program was expected to improve environmental quality and reduce energy demand. The Federal Facilities Program sought advice on a recycling pilot program for [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] and eventually made contact with RIS. RIS experimented with a variety of techniques to improve the performance recycling and found that participation rates were significantly higher when residents could simply drop their recycling in a plastic box. Initially, the project at CFB Borden used milk crates borrowed from a local grocery store. Participation was likely encouraged by a standing order from the Base Commander to recycle.

Meanwhile, a student and a volunteer at a [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]/[[Waterloo, Ontario]] office of Pollution Probe, Eric Hellman organized "Garbage Fest 77" in Kitchener to raise awareness about the consequences of garbage production. McGinnis was invited to speak about his experiences with the CFB Borden program. Hellman also requested a representative from Superior Sanitation (later to be Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd), the local garbage collection contractor, and an employee named Nyle Ludolph attended Garbage Fest. After meeting McGinnis at the festival, Ludolph became an enthusiastic recycler at his own home and helped increase Laidlaw’s presence in recycling. Nyle managed "Total Recycling Systems", a subsidiary of Superior Sanitation/Laidlaw.

In 1978, Jack McGinnis and Eric Hellman and others met in the basement of the Trinity United Church on Yonge Street in Toronto and created the Recycling Council of Ontario.

===Implementation===
In 1981, after close cooperation with Nyle Ludolph, RIS submitted a proposal to Laidlaw to collect and recycle materials at the curbside for a pilot project in Kitchener, Ontario. Lillian and Ken Croal of Kitchener were the first to use and receive a blue box.  RIS designed the program, and Total Recycling had the responsibility to handle all operations. The Kitchener project included 1,500 households and was tested with four different approaches to recycling:
* Curbside pick-up without providing blue boxes;
* Curbside pick-up with blue boxes;
* Curbside pick-up with blue boxes, including knocking on doors to inform residents; and,
* Composting with composters provided by Laidlaw, free of charge.

The blue box recycling system was proposed to be included as an included “extra” to the regular waste management contract. Laidlaw was successful in obtaining the waste management contract for Kitchener, and the blue box system had its commercial launch. RIS came up with the slogan “We Recycle”, which was applied to every box that went out in Kitchener. Various reasons why the boxes were coloured blue, as opposed to some other colour have been posited: the facts are that RIS felt they looked best and were most visible in blue. It was also a colour that was suitable in terms of withstanding damage from ultraviolet light.

The four recycling approaches were monitored by RIS for one year and the blue box was decided as the most effective. The “test project” continued to run however, and people who did not have the blue boxes began requesting them. Laidlaw received many letters from residents expressing support for the program and for it to continue. The blue box program was implemented citywide in 1983, with Laidlaw providing the extra investment in additional boxes and trucks and handling equipment even though it was not required by their waste management contract with the City. Participation rates ran at 85 percent, and the program was regarded as a success.

In 1984 the Citywide contract for Kitchener went out to public bid, as previously scheduled. City staff simply followed previous procedures – i.e., no specific requirement to offer recycling services was included in bid documents. Laidlaw chose to submit a bid that included continuation of the blue box service while their competitors, mainly large US-based firms, did not. One such competitor submitted a bid that was about $400,000 lower than the one from Laidlaw. The Council meeting where the decision was made was filled with local citizens, especially students, asking their City to support the blue box. The City did, voting to take the blue box bid, not the low bid.

In 1985, Laidlaw won the bid for recycling in the City of Mississauga and introduced the second commercial blue box program in Ontario in June 1986, the largest recycling effort in North America.

Between 1997 and 1999, Laidlaw, Inc. exited the solid waste business after incurring heavy losses through its investments in [[Safety-Kleen]] and Greyhound Lines. After almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001.
 
Currently in Ontario, Canada industry compensates municipalities for approximately 50% of the net costs to operate the blue box program.&lt;ref name=Mueller2013/&gt;

The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.

{{main|Amhara people}}
The social stratification of the [[Amhara people]] of [[Ethiopia]] includes castes. According to [[Donald N. Levine|Donald Levine]] – a professor of Sociology specializing in Ethiopian society, the Amhara society has consisted of high-ranking clans, low-ranking clans, caste groups (artisans), and slaves. The Amhara caste system was hierarchically higher than its lowest slaves strata.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p56"/&gt;

===Borana people===
The [[Borana people]] are found in southern Ethiopia, Somalia and northeastern Kenya. They have historically had castes, among which the hunters and artisans have constituted the depressed strata.&lt;ref name=Lewis504/&gt; These are endogamous castes each with a specialized inherited occupation, and include a strata that constitutes outcastes. They are found in virtually every Cushitic or Semitic community of this region. These castes are neither [[Negro]]id nor Bushmanoid by physical features or their first language.&lt;ref name=Lewis504&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=Herbert S. | title=Historical Problems in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=96 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=504–511 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1962.tb50145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower castes of the Borana people, states [[Herbert S. Lewis|Herbert Lewis]] – a professor of Anthropology specializing on East African societies, show no physical differences from the noble castes of Somalia and Somalilands. Other than endogamy and occupational differences between the castes, their ritual, social and political positions are different, as are the beliefs held by each about the nature of the other.&lt;ref name=Lewis510/&gt; For example, the castes have long considered each other as ritually impure, and food prepared by either nobles or artisans castes is considered a taboo to others. Similarly, traditionally, the craftsman and the noble are ritually forbidden to enter the house of the other. Low caste people are expected not to handle farm equipment or cattle.&lt;ref name=Lewis510&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=Herbert S. | title=Historical Problems in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=96 | issue=2 | year=2006 | pages=510–511 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1962.tb50145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the ''Borana'', below them were the ''Gabbaro'' (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts refer them as the ''dhalatta''). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Abbink (1985), Review: Oromo Religion.

The ''Yebir'', also members of the Saab caste, were responsible for crafting amulets (hardas), prayer mats, and saddles, and for performing rituals designed to protect nomads from snakes and scorpions, illnesses and harm during marriage and childbirth".&lt;/ref&gt; Below the castes have been the Somali [[Bantu people|Bantu]] ''Jareer'' community, and these have been descendants of former slaves, including those who were runaway and emancipated slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), ''Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia'', Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 93-94, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mohamed Eno and Abdi Kusow, the Somali caste communities are ethnically indistinguishable from each other, but upper castes have stigmatized the lower ones with mythical narratives such as they being of unholy origins or being engaged in dirty occupations.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), ''Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia'', Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, page 95, Quote: "Unlike that of the Somali Jareer Bantu, the history, social, and ethnic formation of the Somali caste communities is hardly distinguishable from that of other Somalis. The difference is that these communities are stigmatized because mythical narratives claim that (a) they are of unholy origin, and (b) they engage in denigrated occupations."&lt;/ref&gt; The four strata social system – high lineage, low lineage, caste groups and slaves – found among the Somalis has been common in the Horn of Africa region, states [[Donald N. Levine|Donald Levine]], and is also found among ethnic groups such as Afar, Amhara, Borana, Leqa, Sidamo, Kefa, Janjero and other peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N.

According to Catherine Besteman - a professor of Anthropology, the widespread purchase of non-Somali African slaves during the medieval age helped structure the complex status hierarchy among the Somalis.&lt;ref name="Besteman2014p52"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Besteman|title=Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bce7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|year=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-9016-5|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Besteman, the Somali people from the upper strata have also been egalitarian in matters of clan leadership, while they have included concepts of social status, inferiority and exclusion of ''Sáb'' and slaves.&lt;ref name=besteman123/&gt; In the northern regions where Somalis are traditionally found, states Iaon Lewis, Somali communities have traditionally distinguished between the artisanal Somali castes and their slaves, but in the south they have blurred these distinctions.&lt;ref name=besteman123&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Besteman|title=Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bce7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|year=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-9016-5|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I.

The castes among Somali people have also existed in other east and northeast African ethnic groups. In east African ethnic groups, such as the [[Oromo people]] for example, cognates to Somali castes have been recorded in 16th century texts, states Cornelius Jaenen.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius J. Jaenen (1956), ''The Galla or Oromo of East Africa'', Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Vol. 12, No. 2 (Summer, 1956), pages 171-190&lt;/ref&gt; The table below illustrate some alternate terms for castes mirroring the Somali [[Madhiban]] in other ethnic groups that share this region with the Somali people.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p196"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N.

==North Africa==
===Moors===
The Muslim Moors society in the Maghreb parts of the [[North Africa]] was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified. According to Rebecca Popenoe – a professor of Anthropology, while the Islamic scriptures do not dictate a caste system, and while caste systems are not divinely ordained, the Moors believe that castes are "fundamentally different sorts of people" and find the root of the caste system in early Islam.&lt;ref name="Popenoe2004p114"/&gt; The slave caste in the Moors' belief system have descended from Bilal, the slave of Muhammad, while the artisan castes are descendants of those "who refused to accept Allah".&lt;ref name="Popenoe2004p114"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Popenoe|title=Feeding Desire: Fatness, Beauty, and Sexuality Among a Saharan People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJcg11g9yRYC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-28095-2|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mauritanian context, the Kafa'a doctrine has been developed as a justification for considering family status before marriage, annulment of marriages between unequal people, and endogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marinos Diamantides|author2=Adam Gearey|title=Islam, Law and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WG-pAgAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-67565-2|pages=138–139, 155–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moors have owned slaves for centuries. The slaves are traditionally called [[Haratin]] and ''`Abid'', and they were the lowest status endogamous castes, largely segregated [[oasis]]-dwelling [[Black African|black]] people, in the Moors society.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p549"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC&amp;pg=PA549 |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=549}}, Quote: "Haratine.

The Haratin of [[Mauritania]], states Joseph Hellweg – a professor of Anthropology specializing on West African studies, were part of a social caste-like hierarchy that likely developed between 1300 to 1500 CE because of a [[Bedouin]] legacy. The "Hassan" monopolized the occupations related to war and politics, the "Zwaya" ([[Zawāyā|Zawaya]]) the religious roles, the "Bidan" (White Moors) owned property and held slaves (Haratins, Black Moors), and the slaves constituted the lowest of the social strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph R Hellweg|editor=Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA761|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these were castes, endogamous, with hereditary occupations and where the upper strata collected tribute (''horma'') from the lower strata of Mauritanian society, considered them socially inferior, and denied them the right to own land or weapons thereby creating a socio-economically closed system.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony G. Pazzanita (1999), Middle East Journal, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4329283 Political Transition in Mauritania: Problems and Prospects], Volume 53, Number 1 (Winter, 1999), pages 44-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Ann Wiley (2016), Making People Bigger: Wedding Exchange and the Creation of Social Value in Rural Mauritania, Africa Today, Johns Hopkins University Press, Volume 62, Number 3, pages 48-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melinda Smale (1980), [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ464.pdf Women in Mauritania], USAID: Mauritania, Office of Women in Development, Agency for International Development, OICD Washington DC, page viii-ix, xviii-xix, 12-17, 35-36, 43; Quote: "Caste is the most specific of these crucial concepts. When applied to West African societies, it is used in the very general meaning of the division of societies into hierarchically rank-endogamous-occupational groups; the relation between these groups having ritual as well as economic significance. (...) To understand Mauritanian society, one must understand its ethnic groups, its tribes, socio-economic classes and its castes. The Hassaniya speakers who predominate over the majority of the country except along the river are divisible into two crucial subgroups - the Bidan or white Moors and the Haratin or black Moors.

Among [[Hassaniya Arabic]] speakers in southern [[Morocco]] and Mauritania, states Sean Hanretta – a professor of African History, the term ''Bidan'' is a "caste synecdoche" that refers to ''Hassani'' (warrior) and ''Zwaya'' (clerical) clans. In the slave castes, they recognized two layers, the ''`Abid'' (slaves) and ''Haratins'' (freed slaves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Hanretta|title=Islam and Social Change in French West Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Fj79QbyRJUC |year=2009| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89971-0|pages=46–48 with footnote 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Remco Ensel – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Maghreb studies, the word "Haratin" in Moroccan is a pejorative that connotes "subordination, disrepute" and in contemporary literature, it is often replaced with "Drawi", "Drawa", "Sahrawi", "Sahrawa" or other regional terms.&lt;ref name="Ensel1999p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Remco Ensel|title=Saints and Servants in Southern Morocco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dgt8geqUzoC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11429-7|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamel2014p4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Haratins'' historically lived segregated from the main society, in a rural isolation.&lt;ref name=hamel112/&gt; Their subjugation regardless of their religion was sometimes ideologically justified by nobles and some Islamic scholars, even though some scholars took a more nuanced view that Muslims can only enslave non-Muslims and they should not enslave other Muslims, states Hamel – a professor of History specializing in African Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=112–113, 172–173}}, Quote: "This new meaning was an ideological construct to justify the subjugation of the free/freed blacks [Haratin] and was buttressed by documents that sought to advance the Makhzan's agenda by demonstrating that the Haratin were of slave origin, therefore creating a racialized caste".&lt;/ref&gt; They along with ''Swasin'' in Morocco and other northern fringe societies of the Sahara, were a part of a social hierarchy that included the upper strata of nobles, religious specialists and literati, followed by freemen, nomadic pastoral strata and slaves.

===Tuareg people===
The [[Tuareg people]] are a large [[Berbers|Berber]] ethnic confederation found in North Africa.

In Tuareg hierarchical caste system, the nobles constitute the highest caste.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}} They are known in the Tuareg language as ''imúšaɣ'' (''Imajaghan'', "the proud and free" in Arabic&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt;). The nobles had a monopoly on carrying arms and camels, were the warriors of the Tuareg regions.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warror nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called ''amanokal'', whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}}&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; The chietain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=20}}

The vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} They are known as ''ímɣad'' (''Imghad'', singular ''Amghid'') in the Tuareg language.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual ''tiwse'', or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who is traveling through their territory.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} In late medieval era, states Prasse, this weapon monopoly broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the start of the French colonial rule which dislodged the nobles from their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead warrior or intellectual work.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}

A semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the ''[[marabout]]s'' (Tuareg: ''Ineslemen'', a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the adoption of Islam, they became integral to the Tuareg social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stewart | first=C.

Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}

According to the anthropologist Jeffrey Heath, Tuareg artisans belong to separate endogamous castes known as the ''Inhædˤæn'' (''Inadan'').&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt;{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}} These have included the blacksmith, jewelers, wood workers and leather artisan castes.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; They produced and repaired the saddles, tools, household items and other items for the Tuareg community. In Niger and Mali, where the largest Tuareg populations are found, the artisan castes were attached as clients to a family of nobles or vassals, and carried messages over distances for their patron family. They also are the ones who traditionally sacrifice animals during Islamic festivals.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

These social strata, like caste systems found in many parts of West Africa, included singers, musicians and story tellers of the Tuareg, who kept their [[oral tradition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David C.

Known to the Tuareg as agguta, they typically entertain at weddings (...)"&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the artisanal castes are unclear. One theory posits a Jewish derivation, a proposal that Prasse calls "a much vexed question".{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}} Their association with fire, iron and precious metals and their reputation for being cunning tradesman has led others to treat them with a mix of admiration and distrust.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

According to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. On this point, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is endogamy among castes among Tuareg in Niger. The smith explained, "Nobles are like rice, Smiths are like millet, Slaves are like corn."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3630236 Matters of Taste: Food, Eating, and Reflections on "The Body Politic" in Tuareg Society], Journal of Anthropological Research, University of Chicago Press, Volume 52, Number 1 (Spring, 1996), page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tuareg areas of Algeria, a distinct tenant-peasant strata lives around oases known as ''izeggaghan'' (or ''hartani'' in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}}&lt;ref name="Iliffe1987p65"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Iliffe|title=The African Poor: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3AqWzsQW8AC|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-34877-5|pages=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants' origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic. In contemporary times, these peasant strata have blended in with freed black slaves and farm arable lands together.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}}

According to the historian Starratt, the Tuareg evolved a system of slavery that was highly differentiated. They established strata among their slaves, which determined rules as to the slave's expected behavior, marriageability, inheritance rights if any, and occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Starratt | first=Priscilla Ellen | title=Tuareg slavery and slave trade | journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition | publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=2 | issue=2 | year=1981 | pages=83–113 | doi=10.1080/01440398108574825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ikelan'' later became a bonded caste within Tuareg society.&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicolaisen|first1=Johannes|title=Ecology and Culture of the Pastoral Tuareg: With Particular Reference to the Tuareg of Ahaggar and Ayr|date=1963|publisher=National Museum of Copenhagen| page=16| url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hLUbAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heath, the ''Bella'' in the Tuareg society were the slave caste whose occupation was rearing and herding livestock such as sheep and goats.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt;

All criteria retained by specialists to defìne a caste group (Berreman, Pitt-Rivers, Vaughan), may be applied to them. This is true even today in spite of their sedentarization and the conversion of certain of them to sculpture. The second part of this study raises the question of the conditions underlying the creation of artisan castes, drawing upon examples taken from agricultural societies, certain of which are state-based (Fulani, Serer of Sine), others of which are more or less acephalous (Marghi, [[Senufo people|Senufo]], Cangin Serer)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fulani castes are endogamous in nature, meaning individuals marry only within their caste. This caste system, however, wasn't as elaborate in places like northern [[Nigeria]], Eastern [[Niger]] or [[Cameroon]]. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Fulɓe-ruled [[Adamawa Emirate]], where they were referred to as ''jeyaɓe'' (singular ''jeyado'').

=== Igbo people ===
The [[Igbo culture#Osu caste system|Osu caste system]] in [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] of the [[Igbo people]] can be traced back to [[Odinani]], the traditional Igbo religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zg-CdmGkK4YC "The Osu Caste Discrimination in Igboland: Impact on Igbo Culture and Civilization"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of many Igbo traditionalists that the Osus are people historically owned by deities, and are therefore considered to be a 'living sacrifice', an outcast, untouchable and sub-human (similar to the Roman practice of ''[[homo sacer]]''). This system received literary attention when it became a key plot point in ''[[No Longer at Ease]]'' by [[Chinua Achebe]].

People regarded as modern-day Osu in [[Igboland]] are descendants of individuals who volunteered and were sacrificed to the various gods. These fore-fathers pledged themselves and their descendants to these gods. They enjoyed protection and privileges but were segregated from ordinary folks. These Osu people married, fraternized and socialized among themselves. The practice continued to this day. An ordinary Igbo person would not marry or permit any of his relations to marry an Osu person. In a few instances where that has happened, every member of that non-Osu who married an Osu became infested and were regarded as Osu.

It can be said that the only aspect of Igbo life that keeps the Osu segregation intact is marriage. An Osu could and could only marry a fellow Osu, and no more. It is a taboo and abhorent for an Osu to marry a non-Osu - love or lust being immaterial.

Some suggest that due to the introduction of modernization, the Osu system is gradually leaving [[Igboland]] and tradition. The influence of [[Christianity]] (specifically [[Roman Catholicism]]) has caused [[Odinani]] to start slowly disappearing from [[Igboland]]. Obinna, in 2012, reports that in the Igbo community - especially in [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Delta state|Delta]] states - Osu caste system remains a social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into the Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=Obinna1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contesting identity: the Osu caste system among Igbo of Nigeria|author=Elijah Obinna|pages=111–121|journal=African Identities|volume=10|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1080/14725843.2011.614412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mande people ===
Among the [[Mande people|Mande]] societies in [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[the Gambia]], [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Ghana]], people are divided by occupation and ethnic ties. The highest hierarchy in the Mande caste system, the Horon (nobles/freeborn), are traditionally farmers, fisherman, warriors and animal breeders, the lowest caste are the Jonow, a "slave" caste, made up of people whose ancestors were enslaved by other Africans during tribal wars. An important feature of this system are castes based on trade, such as [[blacksmith]]s and [[griot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande", by Barbara G. Hoffman, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes – a professor of West African Studies and African Politics, has been "divided into three endogamous castes – the freeborn (''foro''), slaves (''jongo''), and artisans and praise singers (''nyamolo'').&lt;ref name=hughesstrata&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold Hughes|author2=Harry Gailey|title=Historical Dictionary of the Gambia, 3rd Edition|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=M9MUAQAAIAAJ |year=1999| publisher=Scarecrow|isbn=978-0-8108-3660-0|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeborn castes are primarily farmers, while the slave strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, metal smiths, griots and others.&lt;ref name=gatesmandinka/&gt; The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been a separate endogamous occupational caste called ''[[Jakhanke people|Jakhanke]]'', with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zachary Valentine Wright|title=Living Knowledge in West African Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2h2oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2015|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-28946-8|pages=63–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elisabeth Boesen|author2=Laurence Marfaing|title=Les nouveaux urbains dans l'espace Sahara-Sahel: un cosmopolitisme par le bas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO6dACLQPaMC&amp;pg=PA243|year=2007|publisher=Paris: KARTHALA|isbn=978-2-84586-951-6|pages=243 with footnote 7}}, Quote: "The Jakhanke, who now primarily speak Mandinka, have formed a specialized caste of Muslim clerics and educators since approximately the 13th century".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanneh1976p49"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sanneh | first=Lamin | title=The Origins of Clericalism in West African Islam | journal=The Journal of African History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=17 | issue=01 | year=1976 | pages=49–72 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700014766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serer people===
{{Factual accuracy|section|date=July 2018}}
The [[Serer people]] are a West African ethnoreligious group found in Senegal making up 15% of the Senegalese population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html Senegal], CIA Factsheet&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in northern Gambia and southern Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=GM] Ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Serer society, like other ethnic groups in Senegal, has had social stratification featuring endogamous castes and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

For example, the Wolof, '''Serer''', and Pulaar-speaking Toucouleur are all caste societies."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elizabeth Berg, Ruth Wan and Ruth Lau, Serer people in Senegal did not have a caste system before the [[Mandinka people|Malinka]] rulers conquered them and introduced a caste system.&lt;ref name="BergWan2009p73"/&gt; In other regions where Serer people are found, state JD Fage, Richard Gray and Roland Oliver, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Toucouleur people]]s introduced the caste system among the Serer people.&lt;ref name="FageGray1975p283"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

The social stratification historically evidenced among the Serer people has been, except for one difference, very similar to those found among Wolof, Fulbe, Toucouleur and [[Mandinka people]]s found in [[Senegambia]]. They all have had strata of free nobles and peasants, artisan castes, and slaves. The difference is that the Serer people have retained a matrilineal inheritance system.&lt;ref name=Klein8&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A. Klein|title=Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPSrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=1968|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0621-6|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin Klein – a professor of History specializing in African Studies, the caste systems among the Serer emerged as a consequence of the Mandinka people's Sine-Saloum guelowar conquest, and when the Serer people sought to adapt and participate in the new Senegambian state system.&lt;ref name=Klein8/&gt;

The third status, and the largest strata came to be the ''jambur'', or free peasants who lacked the power of the nobles. Below the ''jambur'' were the artisan castes, who inherited their occupation. These castes included blacksmiths, weavers, jewelers, leatherworkers, carpenters, griots who kept the [[oral tradition]] through songs and music. Of these all castes had a taboo in marrying a griot, and they could not be buried like others. Below the artisan castes in social status have been the slaves, who were either bought at slave markets, seized as captives, or born to a slave parent.&lt;ref name=klein11&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

The Susu are a patrilineal society, predominantly Muslim, who favor endogamous cross-cousin marriages with polygynous households common.&lt;ref name=britsusu/&gt; They have a caste system like all Manding-speaking peoples of West Africa, where the artisans such as smiths, carpenters, musicians, jewelers and leatherworkers are separate castes, and believed to have descended from the medieval era slavery.&lt;ref name=britsusu/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt;

The Susu people, like other Manding-speaking peoples, have a caste system regionally referred to by terms such as ''Nyamakala'', ''Naxamala'' and ''Galabbolalauba''. According to David Conrad and Barbara Frank, the terms and social categories in this caste-based social stratification system of Susu people shows cases of borrowing from Arabic only, but the likelihood is that these terms are linked to Latin, Greek or Aramaic.&lt;ref name="ConradFrank1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David C.

Toucouleur society is divided into strict and rigid caste [[hierarchy|hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Hélène Le Divelec (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41231043 Les "nouvelles" classes sociales en milieu urbain : le cas du Sénégal et celui du Nigéria du Nord], ''Civilisations'', Institut de Sociologie de l'Université de Bruxelles, Vol. 17, No. 3 (1967), pages 240-253; Quote: "In Senegal too the social structure is based on a rigid system of castes, each having a specific political, economic or ritual function. Caste antagonisms are much more important than tribal differences."&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest status among the five Toucouleur [[caste]]s is of the aristocratic leaders and Islamic scholars called ''Torobe''. Below them are the ''Rimbe'', or the administrators, traders and farmers. The ''Nyenbe'' are the artisan castes of the Toucouleur society. The fourth caste strata is called the ''Gallunkobe'' or the slaves or descendants of slaves "who have been freed".

The hierarchical social stratification has been an economically closed system, which historically has meant a marked inequality. Property and land has been exclusively owned by the upper caste members.&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tzeutschler | first=Gregory G.

The religious leaders were not necessarily endogamous nor an inherited post in Toucouleur people's long history, but it has been rare for lower caste people to become religious specialist, states Rüdiger Seesemann, as they were viewed as not sufficiently adhering to the "clerical standards of piety".&lt;ref name=seesemann154/&gt;

=== Wolof people ===
The [[Wolof people]] are a West African Muslim ethnic group found in northwestern [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and southwestern coastal [[Mauritania]]. In Senegal, the Wolof are the largest ethnic group (~ 39%), and their combined population exceeds 6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html|title=The World Factbook: Senegal|publisher=CIA, State Department, United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson1996wol"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Levinson|title=Encyclopedia of World Culture, Volume 9: Africa and the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcDMrQEACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-0-8161-1808-3|chapter=Wolof}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wolof people, like other West African ethnic groups, have historically maintained a rigid, endogamous social stratification that included nobility, clerics, castes and slaves.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996wol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A.

The castes have also been hierarchal, with lowest level being those of griots.&lt;ref name=leonardo54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Irvine (1989), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/645001 When Talk Isn't Cheap: Language and Political Economy], American Ethnologist, Vol. 16, No. 2 (May, 1989), pages 253-254&lt;/ref&gt; Their inherited inferiority has been culturally stated to be close to those of slaves (''jaams'' or ''kaals'').&lt;ref name=leonardo54&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonardo A.

Slaves have historically been a separate, endogamous group in the Wolof society.&lt;ref name=thiaw98/&gt; Slavery was either inherited by birth in the Wolof society, or were kidnapped, purchased as children from desperate parents during difficult times such as a famine, or slavery was imposed by the village elders as a punishment for offenses. By the early 18th-century, all sorts of charges and petty crimes resulted in the accused being punished to the slave strata. Slaves acquired by kidnapping, purchase or as captives of war were called ''jaam sayor'' in the Wolof society.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 343-344&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''geer'' or "freeborn" too had a hierarchical structure. At the top were the royal rulers, below them were the regionally or locally powerful noble lineages who controlled territories and collected tribute, and below them were commoner freeborn called the ''baadoolo'' or "lacking power".&lt;ref name=gamble16&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=15–17 |oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different strata of the Zarma-Songhai people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit.&lt;ref name="Sardan1984p56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haour2013"/&gt; Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class.&lt;ref name=shoup265/&gt; The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations.

===Toubou people===
The [[Toubou people]] are an Islamic ethnic group inhabiting northern [[Chad]], southern [[Libya]], northeastern [[Niger]], and northwestern [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=britteda&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Teda Teda people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C  |title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|last=Olson |first=James Stuart|year=1996 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing|isbn=978-0313279188 |pages=47, 141, 550–551 (see Aza, Daza, Tebu, Teda) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toubou people, states Jean Chapelle – a professor of History specializing on Chadian ethnic groups, have been socially stratified with an embedded caste system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP_S1Jx1C7QC|title=Nomades noirs du Sahara: les Toubous|last=Chapelle|first=Jean|year=1982 |publisher=Editions L'Harmattan|isbn=978-2858022212|pages=7–8, 343–344| language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cabot104&gt;Jean Cabot (1965), Trois ouvrages sur les populations du Nord du Tchad de Jean Chapelle, Annie Lebeuf et Albert Le Rouvreur, [[Annales de Géographie]], Volume 74, Numéro 401, pages 104-107, Quote: "des castes particulières: Azza (forgerons, chasseurs, tanneurs), les Kamadjas (...)"&lt;/ref&gt; The three strata have consisted of the freemen with a right to own property, the artisanal castes and the slaves.&lt;ref name="Smith2005p135"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan|author2=Mahamam Tidjani Alou|title=Les pouvoirs locaux au Niger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWxO2cohbfYC&amp;pg=PA280|year=2009|publisher=Paris: KARTHALA Editions|isbn=978-2-8111-0306-4|pages=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The endogamous caste of ''Azza'' (or ''Aza'') among Toubou have the artisanal occupations, such as metal work, leather work, pottery and tailoring, and they have traditionally been despised and segregated by other strata of the Toubou, much like the ''Hadahid'' caste in southeastern Chad among the [[Zaghawa people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.A.

===Zaghawa people===

The Zaghawa society has been socially stratified and has included castes. The upper strata has been of nobles and warriors, below them have been the traders and merchants, below whom have been the artisan castes called the ''Hadaheed'' (or ''Hadahid'').&lt;ref name="PeekYankah2004p59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. D. Klingender (1942), Gericault as Seen in 1848, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 81, No. 475 (Oct., 1942), pages 254-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samer Abdelnour (2011), Forging Through Adversity: The Blacksmiths of North Darfur and Practical Action, United Nations Development Programme, pages 1-2, Quote: "Although the blacksmiths refer to themselves as ‘Zaghawa’ – a dominant group in Darfur – the blacksmiths are from a traditionally neglected and marginalized group associated with Darfur’s lower castes. They form a sub-group of the Zaghawa known as ‘Hadaheed’ (plural of ‘Hadadi’, which means ‘blacksmith’, and derived from ‘Hadeed’ which means ‘iron’).3 Within the Hadaheed, men practice traditional forms of iron work and women pottery. They have done so as long as their history recalls, inheriting their knowledge and skills from generation to generation. Centuries ago, this group is thought to have been thralled by the Zaghawa, who had entered and settled into their territory. As slaves they were dispersed among Zaghawa families to perform primarily their iron and pottery work."&lt;/ref&gt; These castes have been endogamous, and their inherited occupations have included iron work, hunters, pottery, leatherwork and musicians such as drummers. The artisan work has traditionally been viewed within the Zaghawa society as dirty and of inferior status, being people from different pagan and Jewish roots who slowly assimilated into the Islamic society.&lt;ref name="PeekYankah2004p59"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip M.

The term "blacksmith" has been a derogatory term in Zaghawa culture, states Anne Haour – a professor of African Studies and Medieval Archaeology, and "if born a blacksmith one will always be a blacksmith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Haour|title=Outsiders and Strangers: An Archaeology of Liminality in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYBpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-166779-4|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-blacksmith castes of Zaghawa neither eat nor associate with the blacksmith castes.&lt;ref name=macmichael89&gt;{{cite book|author=H.A.

(...) As is usual in north-central Africa from east to west they are held in general contempt and the rest of the population do not intermarry with them. This feeling of aversion towards the workers in iron is strongest among the Zaghawa, who so far from intermarrying with them would not eat or associate with them. They are a hereditary caste and are called Miro by the [[Fur people|Fur]]."&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest strata has been the slaves. The social stratification and castes such as for the leatherworker strata within the Zaghawa people is similar to those found in nearby [[Fur people]].&lt;ref name=macmichael89/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul R.

The nineteenth century records show that ''Andevo'' or slaves were imported black Africans, and they constituted about a third of the Merina society. The Merina society sold highland slaves to both Muslim and European slave traders on Madagascar coast, as well as bought East African and Mozambique-sourced slaves from them for their own plantations between 1795 and 1895.

==Chronology: when did caste systems develop?==
The caste systems in Africa have been linked to the a pre-developed trading network, invasions from North Africa and the Middle East after the 7th century, followed by a slavery system that targeted the pagans. According to Susan McIntosh – a professor of Anthropology specializing in African societies, archeological evidence shows that Arabs and Berbers had expanded and established an integrated sub-Saharan trade and transport network with West Africa, building upon the pre-existing trade routes through Western Sudan.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R. DeCorse|title=West Africa During the Atlantic Slave Trade: Archaeological Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Fcr1HSZXNgC |year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-7185-0247-8|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade by 9th to 10th centuries, states McIntosh, included commodities and slaves. The reach of slave trading had extended into [[Ghana]] and the western Atlantic coast by the 11th century, and the slave raiding, capture, holding and trading systems became increasingly sophisticated in 13th and 14th century Mali Empire and 16th century Songhai Empire.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;

As the practice of slavery grew, so did the caste system. Tamari suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among numerous ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"/&gt; McIntosh concurs with Tamari's reasoning approach, but disagrees with the dating. McIntosh states that the emergence of caste systems likely occurred much earlier in the West African societies such as Soninke, Mande, Malinke, Wolof, Serer, and others.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt; She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th-century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding by elite families was an established institution in West Africa by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt;

The linguistic evidence suggests that stratification structure and words relating to caste system and slavery likely were shared between the many ethnic groups, and possibly some others such as the [[Dogon people]] of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Tamari|editor=David C. Conrad and Barbara E.

==Comparison between castes of Africa and South Asia==
[[Louis Dumont]], the 20th-century author famous for his classic ''Homo Hierarchicus'', recognized the social stratification among the ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system.&lt;ref name="Haour2013"/&gt; Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont's system, including economic, ritual, spiritual, endogamous, elements of pollution, segregative and spread over a large region.&lt;ref name="Haour2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Haour|title=Outsiders and Strangers: An Archaeology of Liminality in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rx2vfGFGtQgC&amp;pg=PA95 |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969774-8|pages=95–97, 100–101, 90–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Declan Quigley|title=The character of kingship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbKAAAAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-290-3|pages=20, 49–50, 115–117, 121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2011p15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25682">'''Cellular manufacturing''' is a process of manufacturing which is a subsection of [[just-in-time manufacturing]] and [[lean manufacturing]] encompassing group technology. The goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as possible, make a wide variety of similar products, while making as little waste as possible. Cellular manufacturing involves the use of multiple "cells" in an [[assembly line]] fashion. Each of these cells is composed of one or multiple different machines which accomplish a certain task. The product moves from one cell to the next, each station completing part of the manufacturing process.  Often the cells are arranged in a "U-shape" design because this allows for the overseer to move less and have the ability to more readily watch over the entire process. One of the biggest advantages of cellular manufacturing is the amount of flexibility that it has. Since most of the machines are automatic, simple changes can be made very rapidly. This allows for a variety of scaling for a product, minor changes to the overall design, and in extreme cases, entirely changing the overall design. These changes, although tedious, can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Toyota Way|last = Liker|first = Jeffery|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2004|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 31, 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output, such as a part or a set of instructions. These cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output, and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly. Once implemented, cellular manufacturing has been said to ''reliably'' create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory, space and lead time required to create a product. It is for this reason that the one-piece-flow cell has been called "the ultimate in lean production."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Cellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology, which were proposed by [[Ralph Flanders|Flanders]] in 1925&lt;ref&gt;5.	Flanders, R.E. 1925. Design, manufacture, and production control of a standard machine. ''Transactions of ASME'', Vol. 26, 691-738.&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted in Russia by [[Sergei Petrovich Mitrofanov|Mitrofanov]] in 1933 (whose book&lt;ref&gt;6.	Mitrofanov, S.P. 1959. ''The scientific principles of group technology''. Leningrad (trans. By J.L. Grayson, Birmingham University).&lt;/ref&gt; was translated into English in 1959). Burbidge actively promoted group technology in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;4.	Burbidge, J.L. 1975. ''The Introduction to Group Technology''. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; "Apparently, Japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the 1970s," and in the 1980s cells migrated to the United States as an element of just-in-time (JIT) production.&lt;ref&gt;Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit. p 20&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first English-language books to discuss cellular manufacturing, that of Hall in 1983, referred to a cell as a “U-line,” for the common, or ideal, U-shaped configuration of a cell&lt;ref&gt;7.	Hall, Robert W. 1983. ''Zero Inventories''. Homewood, Ill., Dow Jones-Irwin. pp 120-126&lt;/ref&gt;—ideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster, affording high visibility and contact. By 1990 cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in JIT manufacturing, so much so that Harmon and Peterson, in their book, ''Reinventing the Factory'', included a section entitled, "Cell: Fundamental Factory of the Future".&lt;ref&gt;8.	Harmon, R.L., and L.D. Peterson. 1990. ''Reinventing the Factory: Productivity Breakthroughs in Manufacturing Today''. New York: Free Press. pp 118-123&lt;/ref&gt; Cellular manufacturing was carried forward in the 1990s, when just-in-time was renamed lean manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;2.	Black, J. T., and Steve L. Hunter. 2003. op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, when JIT/lean became widely attractive in the service sector, cellular concepts found their way into that realm; for example, Hyer and Wemmerlöv’s final chapter is devoted to office cells.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 573-617&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell design==
Cells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow. This is accomplished by bringing together operations (or machines, or people) involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another, distinct from other groups. This grouping is called a cell. These cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing ''one-piece flow'' to occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Toyota Product Development System|last = Morgan|first = J.M.|publisher = Productivity Press|year = 2006|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one-piece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces, requiring assembly. First, the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell, where they would be welded together, then polished, then coated, and finally packaged. All of these steps would be completed in a single cell, so as to minimize various factors (called [[No value added|non-value-added]] processes/steps) such as time required to transport materials between steps. Some common formats of single cells are: the U-shape (good for communication and quick movement of workers), the straight line, or the L-shape. The number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production. For example, if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled, four workers should be placed in the cell. Similarly, if demand halves, one worker will occupy the cell. Since cells have a variety of differing equipment, it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Figure 8-4 from The Toyota Way.png|thumb|This figure from The Toyota Way shows the design of a U-shaped cell, graphing the paths of two employees through it.|188x188px]]While there exist many advantages to forming cells, there are some obvious benefits. It is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie, such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive. Resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above 100% in many cases. In addition to this, formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturing/assembly environment (by having inventory only where it is absolutely required), improves safety in the work environment (due to smaller quantities of product/inventory being handled), improves morale (by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees), reduces cost of inventory, and reducing inventory obsolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When formation of a cell would be too difficult, a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow, that is, to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand (this rate is called the ''[[Takt time|takt]]'' [[Takt time|time]]). This is referred to as the Pacemaker Process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the advantages of designing for one-piece-flow, the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation. Use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|"A cell is a small organizational unit...designed to exploit similarities in how you process information, make products, and serve customers. Manufacturing cells [closely locate] people and equipment required for processing families of like products. [Prior to cellularization, parts] may have traveled miles to visit all the equipment and labor needed for their fabrication... After reorganization, families of similar parts are produced together within the physical confines of cells that house most or all of the required resources,...facilitating the rapid flow and efficient processing of material and information... Furthermore, cell operators can be cross-trained in several machines, engage in job rotation, and assume responsibilities for tasks [that] previously belonged to supervisors and support staff [including] activities such as planning and scheduling, quality control, trouble-shooting, parts ordering, interfacing with customers and suppliers, and record-keeping."&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit. p 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows. Moreover, the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow build-ups of inventory between cell stations. To formalize that advantage, cells often have designed-in rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations. Such a rule is known, in JIT/lean parlance, as [[kanban]] (from the Japanese), which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station. (Discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 332-338&lt;/ref&gt;) The simplest form, kanban squares, are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations. The rule, applied to the producing station: "If all squares are full, stop. If not, fill them up."&lt;ref&gt;3.	Hall, Robert W. 1987. op. cit., p 92&lt;/ref&gt;

An office cell applies the same ideas: clusters of broadly trained cell-team members that, in concert, quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space. In a virtual cell, as in the standard model, team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services. Although people and equipment are physically dispersed, as in a job shop, their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput, with all its advantages, just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 27, 136, 585-586&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking the visibility of physical cells, virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process.

A simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a 1985 booklet of 96 pages by Kone Corp. in Finland, producer of elevators, escalators, and the like. Excerpts follow: 
{{quote|"The first step involved creating cells in the assembly, electrical and chemical testing departments. In April 1984 six cells, identified by different colors, were established... All devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cell's color, and all feed-back from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned... The second step, in summer, 1984, was to "cellularize" manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies [that are] needed in the analyzer cells, and to test them if necessary. Production of the five sub-assembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer sub-units. The parts and materials are located in the cells... Material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand. In the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each (roughly 25 different) sub-unit. When one piece is taken into assembly, a new one is ordered from the corresponding unit-cell. The order is made [using] a magnetic [kanban] button, which identifies the ordering cell (by color), unit (by code), and order date... When the manufacturing cell has completed the order, the unit is taken with the [kanban] button to its place on the ordering cell shelf. Orders from the unit cells to the sub-cells are based on the same principle. The only difference is that the buffer size is six sub-units. This [procedure] was implemented in August, 1984."&lt;ref&gt;"JIT-Production." Hyvinkaa, Finland: Kone Corporation/ATF&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Implementation process ==
In order to implement cellular manufacturing, a number of steps must be performed. First, the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity (in design or manufacturing requirements) into families.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Management|last=Inman|first=R. Anthony|last2=Helm|first2=Marilyn|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7876-6556-2|location=Detroit, MI|pages=72–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed; typically in the form of [[production flow analysis]] (PFA) for manufacturing families, or in the examination of design/product data for design families.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This analysis can be time consuming and costly, but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts. Clustering of machines and parts is one of the most popular production flow analysis methods. The algorithms for machine part grouping include Rank Order Clustering, Modified Rank Order Clustering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|title=Modified Rank Order Clustering Algorithm Approach by Including Manufacturing Data|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405896316302993|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|volume=49|issue=5|pages=138–142|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.103|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Similarity coefficients. 

There are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center, which take into account a variety of important variables such as, "multiple plant locations, multi-market allocations with production planning and various part mix."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aalaei|first=Amin|last2=Davoudpour|first2=Hamid|title=A robust optimization model for cellular manufacturing system into supply chain management|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527316000153|journal=International Journal of Production Economics|volume=183|pages=667–679|doi=10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.01.014|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty, optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as, "total cost of holding, inter-cell material handling, external transportation, fixed cost for producing each part in each plant, machine and labor salaries."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Difficulties in creating flow ==
The key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes. Upon implementation of cellular manufacturing, management commonly "encounters strong resistance from production workers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually.

It is also difficult to fight the desire to have some [[inventory]] on hand. It is tempting, since it would be easier to recover from an [[employee]] suddenly having to take [[sick leave]]. Unfortunately, in cellular manufacturing, it is important to remember the main tenants: "You sink or swim together as a unit" and that "Inventory hides problems and inefficiencies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved, the process will not improve.

Another common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations. These problems include, "exceptional elements, number of voids, machine distances, bottleneck machines and parts, machine location and relocation, part routing, cell load variation, inter and intracellular material transferring, cell reconfiguring, dynamic part demands, and operation and completion times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delgoshaei|first=Aidin|last2=Ariffin|first2=Mohd Khairol Anuar Mohd|last3=Leman|first3=Zulkiflle|last4=Baharudin|first4=B. T. Hang Tuah Bin|last5=Gomes|first5=Chandima|date=2016-01-12|title=Review of evolution of cellular manufacturing system's approaches: Material transferring models|journal=International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=131–149|doi=10.1007/s12541-016-0017-9|issn=2234-7593}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing.

==Benefits and costs==
Cellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short, focused paths in concentrated physical space. So constructed, by logic a cell reduces flow time, flow distance, floor space, inventory, handling, scheduling transactions, and scrap and rework (the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities). Moreover, cells lead to simplified, higher validity costing, since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather than scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit. Chapter 10: Cost Accounting and Cellular Manufacturing, pp 281-310)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frecka, Thomas J. Accounting for Manufacturing Productivity: A Set of Papers from an AME Meeting--Problems and Directions in Cost Accounting. Association for Manufacturing Excellence, 2nd Printing. Several of the 11 articles in this report pertain to changes in cost accounting stemming from JIT production, and cells in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement. The segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem.

There are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing. The small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more self-motivated to propose changes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management, so over time overhead costs can be reduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell, which offers variety in their work. This can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Case studies in just-in-time and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines. For example, BAE Systems, Platform Solutions (Fort Wayne, Ind.), producing aircraft engine monitors and controls, implemented cells for 80 percent of production, reducing customer lead time 90 percent, work-in-process inventory 70 percent, space for one product family from 6,000 square feet to 1,200 square feet, while increasing product reliability 300 percent, multi-skilling the union-shop work force, and being designated an ''Industry Week'' Best Plant for the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;9.	Sheridan, John L. 2000. “Lean Sigma synergy,” ''Industry Week'' (October 16) pp 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; By five years later, rework and scrap had been cut 50 percent, new product introduction cycles 60 percent, and transactions 90 percent, while also increasing inventory turns three-fold and service turn times 30 percent, and being awarded a Shingo Prize for the year 2005.&lt;ref&gt;10.	2005 Shingo Prize website.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself; among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits. One exception is the contention, at Steward, Inc. (Chattanooga, Tenn.), producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression. According to case study authors, cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from 14 to 2 days, work-in-process inventories by 80 percent, finished inventories by 60 percent, lateness by 96 percent, and space by 56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;11.	Levasseur, Gerls A., Marilyn M. Helms, and Aleisha A. Zink. 1995. “A Conversion from a functional to a cellular manufacturing layout at Steward, Inc. ''Production and Inventory Management''. 3rd quarter, pp 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a "WIP chart system" by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01&lt;ref&gt;Tonkin, Lea A.P. 1992. Hughes Ground Systems Group Takes Aim at Defects, Delays. Target (May–June). pp 25-27&lt;/ref&gt; Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 225-232&lt;/ref&gt; When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op cit., pp 519-521&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of possible limitations to implementing cellular manufacturing. Some argue that cellular manufacturing can lead to a decrease in production flexibility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cells are typically designed to maintain a specific flow volume of parts being produced. Should the demand or necessary quantity decrease, the cells may have to be realigned to match the new requirements, which is a costly operation, and one not typically required in other manufacturing setups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''cigar box guitar''' is a simple [[chordophone]] that uses an empty [[cigar box]] as a [[resonator]]. The earliest had one or two strings; modern models typically have three or more. Generally, the strings are connected to the end of a broomstick or a 1 x 3 inch wood slate and to the cigar box resonator.

== History ==
Cigars were packed in boxes, crates, and barrels as early as 1800, but the small boxes that we are familiar with today did not exist prior to around 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyman |first=Tony |title= Handbook of Cigar Boxes |year=1972 |publisher= Arnot Art Museum |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, cigars were shipped in larger crates containing 100 or more per case. After 1840, cigar manufacturers started using smaller, more portable boxes with 20–50 cigars per box.

Trace evidence of cigar box instruments exists from 1840 to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Jehle 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last= Jehle |first= William |title= One Man's Trash: A History of the Cigar Box Guitar |year= 2010 |isbn= 1-4538-0239-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known illustration of a cigar box instrument is an etching copyrighted in 1876 of two [[American Civil War]] soldiers at a campsite, one of whom is playing a cigar box [[fiddle]]. The etching was created by illustrator and artist Edwin Forbes, who, under the banner of ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'', worked for the [[Union Army]]. The etching was included in Forbes's work ''[[Life Stories of the Great Army]]''. In the etching, the fiddle clearly shows the brand "Figaro" on the cigar box.

In addition to the etching, plans for a cigar box [[banjo]] were published by [[Daniel Carter Beard]], co-founder of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], in 1884 as part of ''Christmas Eve with Uncle Enos''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cigarboxguitar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/UncleEnos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The plans, retitled "How to Build an Uncle Enos Banjo", were included in the 1890 edition of Beard's ''[[American Boy's Handy Book]]'' as supplementary material at the back of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beard |first= Daniel Carter |title= The American Boy's Handy Book |year= 1882 |publisher= Scribner |location= New York |isbn= 0-87923-449-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans omitted the story but still showed a step-by-step description of a playable five-string fretless banjo made from a cigar box.

It would seem that the earliest cigar box instruments would be crude and primitive, but this is not always the case. According to William Jehle, curator of The Cigar Box Guitar Museum and the author of ''[[One Man's Trash: A History of the Cigar Box Guitar]]'',&lt;ref name="Jehle 2010"/&gt; the museum acquired two cigar box fiddles built in 1886 and 1889 that seem very playable and well built. The 1886 fiddle was made for an 8-year-old boy and is certainly playable, but the 1889 fiddle has a well-carved neck and slotted violin headstock. The latter instrument was made for serious playing.

Cigar box guitars and fiddles were also important in the rise of [[jug band]]s and [[blues]]. As most of these performers were black Americans living in poverty, many could not afford a "real" instrument. Using these, along with the [[washtub bass]] (similar to the cigar box guitar), jug, [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]], and harmonica, black musicians performed blues during socializations.

[[The Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a resurgence of homemade [[musical instrument]]s. Times were hard in the American South, and sitting on the front porch singing away the blues was a popular pastime. Musical instruments were beyond the means of most people, but with an old cigar box, a piece of broom handle and a couple of wires from the screen door, a guitar was born.

== Modern revival ==
[[File:Cigar box instruments.jpg|thumb|Cigar box guitars at [[Maker Faire]] 2011]]
A modern revival of these instruments (also known as the Cigar Box Guitar Revolution) has been gathering momentum with an increase in the number of cigar box guitar builders and performers. A loose-knit group of underground musicians tour the East Coast of the United States each summer under the banner "Masters of the Cigar Box Guitar Tour." These musicians include Doctor Oakroot, Johnny Lowebow, Tomi-O and many others. A growing number of primitive [[luthier]]s are adding cigar box guitars to their items for sale. The Top cigar box guitar builders of today are [[Shane Speal]], [[Mike Snowden]] and Peter Lake of [[Heavy Fog Guitars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theovercast.ca/heavy-fog-guitars-rising-from-an-empty-box/], The Overcast.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival is sometimes due to interest in jug bands and the [[DIY culture]], as a cigar box is inexpensive in comparison with other factors, such as strings and construction time. Many modern cigar box guitar makers can be seen as practitioners of a type of [[Luthier|lutherie]] and implement various personal touches, such as the addition of [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] and resonator cones.
[[File:Electric cigar box fiddle.jpg|thumb|A superior modern fiddle]]

The modern revival of cigar box guitars is documented in the 2008 film "Songs Inside the Box", which was shot primarily at the Cigar Box Guitar Extravaganza, an annual event held in Huntsville, Alabama.

The Cigar Box Guitar Museum, a free display dedicated to cigar box guitars, is located in Speal's Tavern, a small blues club in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania. It is curated by cigar box guitarist Shane Speal and contains over 60 antique and modern cigar box guitars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spealstavern.com/cigar-box-guitar-museum],&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3320">'''''Clemons v. Department of Commerce''''' (see also [[United States congressional apportionment#Controversy and history]]) was a lawsuit filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi]] on September 17, 2009, and unsuccessfully appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], that challenged the constitutionality of the [[Public Law 62-5|law]] setting membership in the [[United States House of Representatives]] at 435 members.

== The case ==
The case, in brief, asked the court to decide three major points:
# Does the Constitution’s requirement of [[One man, one vote|one person, one-vote]] [see also ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]''] apply to the interstate apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives?
# Does the current level of inequality violate this standard?
# Does Congress need to increase the size of the House to remediate this inequality?&lt;ref&gt;Jurisdictional Statement, August 26, 2010, http://apportionment.us/JurisdictionalStatement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the principle of [[One man, one vote|one person, one-vote]], the suit cited a lack of compliance with [[Article I of the United States Constitution#Section 2: House of Representatives|Article I, Section 2]] and [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution#Apportionment of Representatives|Amendment XIV, Section 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]] that "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers" and asked that the court declare the current apportionment system to be unconstitutional.

== History of the case and current status ==
On July 7, 2010, the three-judge panel in the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi]] ruled that Congress has discretion to set the size of the [[United States House of Representatives]], even if significant voter inequality results. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] on August 26, 2010.  On November 17, 2010, the government filed a motion to dismiss the case or affirm the lower court decision (against the plaintiffs).  The appellants' Reply Brief was filed November 22, 2010, completing the cycle of filings.  The court considered the case in the conference of December 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court docket for the case https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-291.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2010, the complaint was vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court orders for December 13, 2010 https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121310zor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This essentially leaves the case as if it never occurred, leaving open the possibility of a future lawsuit to the same effect, but also throwing out the extensive legal analysis done by both parties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''Cooper pair''' or '''BCS pair''' is a pair of electrons (or other [[fermion]]s) bound together at low temperatures in a certain manner first described in 1956 by American physicist [[Leon Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

In conventional [[Superconductivity|superconductors]], this attraction is due to the [[electron]]–[[phonon]] interaction. The Cooper pair state is responsible for superconductivity, as described in the [[BCS theory]] developed by [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]], and [[John Schrieffer]] for which they shared the 1972 [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;

Although Cooper pairing is a quantum effect, the reason for the pairing can be seen from a simplified classical explanation.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative [[charge (physics)|charge]], but it also attracts the positive [[ion]]s that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to [[electron]]–[[phonon]] interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volt|eV]], and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons in Cooper pairs.

The electrons in a pair are not necessarily close together; because the interaction is long range, paired electrons may still be many hundreds of [[nanometre|nanometers]] apart. This distance is usually greater than the average interelectron distance so that many Cooper pairs can occupy the same space.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons have [[Spin-½|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], so they are [[fermion]]s, but the total spin of a Cooper pair is integer (0 or 1) so it is a [[composite boson]]. This means the [[wave function]]s are symmetric under particle interchange.  Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the same quantum state, which is responsible for the phenomena of superconductivity.

The BCS theory is also applicable to other fermion systems, such as [[helium-3]]. Indeed, Cooper pairing is responsible for the [[superfluidity]] of helium-3 at low temperatures. It has also been recently demonstrated that a Cooper pair can comprise two bosons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optical-lattice.com/index.php?lattice-site=cooper-pairs Cooper Pairs of Bosons]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the pairing is supported by [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] in an optical lattice.

== Relationship to superconductivity ==
The tendency for all the Cooper pairs in a body to "[[Bose–Einstein condensation|condense]]" into the same [[Ground state|ground quantum state]] is responsible for the peculiar properties of superconductivity.

Cooper originally considered only the case of an isolated pair's formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of allowed energy states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy. This ''gap to excitations'' leads to superconductivity, since small excitations such as scattering of electrons are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;

The gap appears due to many-body effects between electrons feeling the attraction.

R. A. Ogg, Jr., was first to suggest that electrons might act as pairs coupled by lattice vibrations in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg Jr, R.A., "Bose-Einstein Condensation of Trapped Electron Pairs. Phase
Separation and Superconductivity of Metal-Ammonia Solutions," ''Phys. Rev.'' 69, 243-244, (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Poole Jr, Charles P, "Encyclopedic dictionary of condensed matter physics", (Academic Press, 2004), p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; This was indicated by the [[isotope]] effect observed in superconductors. The isotope effect showed that materials with heavier ions (different [[isotope|nuclear isotopes]]) had lower superconducting transition temperatures. This can be explained by the theory of Cooper pairing: heavier ions are harder for the electrons to attract and move (how Cooper pairs are formed), which results in smaller binding energy for the pairs.

The theory of Cooper pairs is quite general and does not depend on the specific electron-phonon interaction.  Condensed matter theorists have proposed pairing mechanisms based on other attractive interactions such as electron–[[exciton]] interactions or electron–[[plasmon]] interactions. Currently, none of these other pairing interactions has been observed in any material.

It should be mentioned that Cooper pairing does not involve individual electrons pairing up to form "quasi-bosons". The paired states are energetically favored, and electrons go in and out of those states preferentially. This is a fine distinction that John Bardeen makes:

:''"The idea of paired electrons, though not fully accurate, captures the sense of it." &lt;ref&gt;J. Bardeen, "Electron-Phonon Interactions and Superconductivity", in Cooperative Phenomena, eds. H. Haken and M. Wagner (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1973), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The mathematical description of the second-order coherence involved here is given by Yang.&lt;ref&gt;C. N. Yang, "Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order." ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 34, 694 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist]] thought consistently rejects the notion of a [[creator deity]].{{sfn|Taliaferro|2013|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Anne M.|last2=Samuels|first2=Jeffrey|title=Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC|year=2003|publisher=Pariyatti|isbn=978-1-928706-19-9|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC&amp;pg=PA128dq=god#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 128–146]|chapter=II. Denial of God in Buddhism and the Reasons Behind It|chapterurl=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC&amp;pg=PA128dq=god#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It teaches the concept of gods, heavens and rebirths in its [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Saṃsāra]] doctrine, but it considers none of these gods as a creator. Buddhism posits that mundane deities such as [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Mahabrahma]] are misconstrued to be a creator.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-8}} Buddhist ontology follows the doctrine of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent Origination]], whereby all phenomena arise in dependence on other phenomena, hence no primal unmoved mover could be acknowledged or discerned.

== Early Buddhist texts ==
According to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god "primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, "while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God."&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issaranimmāṇa ==
In the [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html Tittha sutta] (A.N. 3.61), the Buddha while describing the three heretical doctrines, mentions Issaranimmāṇavada (doctrine of the divine creation)  as one of those three: 
{{Quote|text='There are brahmans &amp; contemplatives who hold this teaching, hold this view: 'Whatever a person experiences — pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful — that is all caused by a supreme being's (Issara) act of creation.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html Tittha Sutta: Sectarians
]&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Buddha further explains this doctrine and refutes it as a false belief:
{{Quote|text=Having approached the brahmans &amp; contemplatives who hold that... 'Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by Issara's (supreme being) act of creation,' I said to them: 'Is it true that you hold that... "Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by Issara's (supreme being) act of creation?"' Thus asked by me, they admitted, 'Yes.' Then I said to them, 'Then, in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of Issara's (supreme being) act of creation. A person is a thief... unchaste... a liar... a divisive speaker... a harsh speaker... an idle chatterer... greedy... malicious... a holder of wrong views because of Issara's (supreme being) act of creation.' When one falls back on creation by a supreme being as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html Tittha Sutta: Sectarians]&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Mahabrahma as a false creator==
{{further|Saṃsāra (Buddhism)}}
According to Peter Harvey, Buddhism assumes that the universe has no ultimate beginning to it, and thus sees no need for a creator God. In the early texts of Buddhism, the nearest term to this concept is "Great Brahma" (''MahaBrahma'') such as in ''Digha Nikaya'' 1.18.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-8}} However "[w]hile being kind and compassionate, none of the ''brahmās'' are world-creators."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=37}}

According to Harvey, "[a]fter a long period, the [[Buddhist_cosmology_of_the_Theravada_school#Brahm.C4.81_Planes|three lowest form heavens]] appear, and a [[Buddhist cosmology of the Theravada school#.C4.80bh.C4.81svara Planes|Streaming Radiance]] god dies and is reborn there as a Great Brahmā."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36}} Then "other Streaming Radiance gods die and happen to be reborn, due to their karma, as his ministers and retinue."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-7}} The retinue erroneously believes Mahabrahma created them.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-7}} When one of these ministers "eventually dies and is reborn as a human, he develops the power to remember his previous life, and consequently teaches that Great Brahmā is the eternal creator of all beings."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=37}}

==Medieval philosophers==
===Vasubandhu===
The 5th-century Buddhist philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] argued that a creator's singular identity is incompatible with creating the world in his [[Abhidharmakosha]].&lt;ref name="unm.edu"&gt;Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar.) pg 11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]] (fl. c. 602–664) studied Buddhism in India during the seventh century, staying at [[Nalanda]]. There, he studied the [[Yogacara]] teachings passed down from [[Asanga]] and Vasubandhu and taught to him by the abbot [[Śīlabhadra]]. In his work ''[[Cheng Weishi Lun]]'' (Skt. ''Vijñāptimātratāsiddhi śāstra''), Xuanzang refutes a "Great Lord" or Great Brahmā doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Francis, Chʿeng Wei Shih Lun (''Three Texts on Consciousness Only''), Numata Center, Berkeley, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1886439047}}, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|According to one doctrine, there is a great, self-existent deity whose substance is real and who is all-pervading, eternal, and the producer of all phenomena. This doctrine is unreasonable. If something produces something, it is not eternal, the non-eternal is not all-pervading, and what is not all-pervading is not real. If the deity's substance is all-pervading and eternal, it must contain all powers and be able to produce all [[dharma]]s everywhere, at all times, and simultaneously. If he produces dharma when a desire arises, or according to conditions, this contradicts the doctrine of a single cause. Or else, desires and conditions would arise spontaneously since the cause is eternal. Other doctrines claim that there is a great Brahma, a Time, a Space, a Starting Point, a Nature, an Ether, a Self, etc., that is eternal and really exists, is endowed with all powers, and is able to produce all dharmas. We refute all these in the same way we did the concept of the Great Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research|title=Chʿeng Wei Shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjDYAAAAMAAJ|date=January 1999|publisher=仏教伝道協会|isbn=978-1-886439-04-7|pages=20-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Others===
The 7th-century Buddhist scholar [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]] advances a number of arguments against the existence of a creator god in his ''Pramāṇavārtika'', following in the footsteps of Vasubandhu.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition," ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar.) pg 12&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mahayana scholars such as Śāntarakṣita  and Kamalaśīla continued this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition," ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar.) pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century Buddhist philosopher [[Ratnakīrti]] at the then university at Vikramashila (now Bhagalpur, [[Bihar]]) criticized the arguments for the existence of God-like being called [[Ishvara|Isvara]], that emerged in the [[Nyaya#Nyaya on God and salvation|Navya-Nyaya sub-school of Hinduism]], in his “Refutation of Arguments Establishing Īśvara” (Īśvara-sādhana-dūṣaṇa). These arguments are similar to those used by other sub-schools of Hinduism and Jainism that questioned the Navya-Nyaya theory of dualistic creator.&lt;ref&gt;Parimal G. Patil. Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India. New York: Columbia University Press, 2009. pp. 3-4, 61-66 with footnotes, {{ISBN|978-0-231-14222-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In standard [[mathematics]], propositions can typically be considered unambiguously true or false. For instance, the proposition ''zero belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply false; while the proposition ''one belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply true. However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be ''more or less'' true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider ''My coffee is hot''.

In [[mathematics]], this idea can be developed in terms of [[fuzzy logic]]. In [[computer science]], it has found application in [[artificial intelligence]]. In [[philosophy]], the idea has proved particularly appealing in the case of [[vagueness]]. Degrees of truth is an important concept in law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12095">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''derived scheme''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{O})&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a [[topological space]] ''X'' and a [[sheaf of spectra|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; of [[commutative ring spectrum|commutative ring spectra]] &lt;ref&gt;also often called &lt;math&gt;E_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-ring spectra&lt;/ref&gt; on ''X'' such that (1) the pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \pi_0 \mathcal{O})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] and (2) &lt;math&gt;\pi_k \mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_0 \mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;-[[module (mathematics)|module]]. The notion gives a [[homotopy]]-theoretic generalization of a scheme.

A [[derived stack]] is a stacky generalization of a derived scheme.

==Differential graded scheme==
Over a field of characteristic zero, the theory is equivalent to that of a differential graded scheme. By definition, a '''differential graded scheme''' is obtained by gluing affine differential graded schemes, with respect to [[étale topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differential Graded Schemes I: Perfect Resolving Algebras|journal =  |arxiv = math/0212225|date = 2002-12-16|first = Kai|last = Behrend|bibcode = 2002math.....12225B}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |title = Enumeration of rational curves via torus actions |arxiv = hep-th/9405035|date = 1994-05-05|first = M.|last = Kontsevich}}&lt;/ref&gt; "as the first approach to derived algebraic geometry."&lt;ref&gt;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dg-scheme&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed further by Mikhail Kapranov and Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine.

===Connection with differential graded rings and examples===
Just as [[Affine space|affine]] algebraic geometry is equivalent (in [[Category theory|categorical sense]]) to the theory of [[commutative ring]]s (commonly called [[commutative algebra]]), affine [[derived algebraic geometry]] over characteristic zero is equivalent to the theory of [[differential graded algebra|commutative differential graded rings]]. One of the main example of derived schemes comes from the derived intersection of subschemes of a scheme, giving the [[Koszul complex]]. For example, let &lt;math&gt;f_1, \ldots, f_k \in \mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots, x_n] = R&lt;/math&gt;, then we can get a derived scheme &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_\bullet) = \mathbf{RSpec}(R/(f_1) \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} \cdots \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} R/(f_k))&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{RSpec}:(\textbf{dga}_\mathbb{C})^{op} \to \textbf{DerSch}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[étale spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Since we can construct a resolution
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
0 \to &amp; R &amp; \xrightarrow{\cdot f_i} &amp; R &amp;\to 0 \\
&amp;\downarrow&amp;&amp;\downarrow&amp; \\
0\to &amp;0&amp; \to&amp;R/(f_i) &amp; \to 0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
the [[derived tensor product|derived ring]] &lt;math&gt;R/(f_1) \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} \cdots \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} R/(f_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the koszul complex &lt;math&gt;K_R(f_1,\ldots, f_k)&lt;/math&gt;. The truncation of this derived scheme to amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt; provides a classical model motivating derived algebraic geometry. Notice that if we have a projective scheme
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{Proj}\left( \frac{\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1,\ldots, f_k)} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\text{deg}(f_i) = d_i&lt;/math&gt; we can construct the derived scheme &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathcal{E}^\bullet,(f_1,\ldots, f_k))&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^\bullet = [\mathcal{O}(-d_1)\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathcal{O}(-d_k) \xrightarrow{(\cdot f_1,\ldots,\cdot f_k)} \mathcal{O}]&lt;/math&gt;
with amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;

==Cotangent Complex==
&lt;!-- Cite manetti for this section, also, are there any universal properties the cotangent complex satisfies? --&gt;

=== Construction ===
Let &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a fixed differential graded algebra defined over a field of characteristic &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then a &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet&lt;/math&gt;-differential graded algebra &lt;math&gt;(R_\bullet,d_R)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''semi-free''' if the following conditions hold:
# The underlying graded algebra &lt;math&gt;R_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial algebra over &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet&lt;/math&gt;, meaning it is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet[\{x_i \}_{i \in I}]&lt;/math&gt;
# There exists a filtration &lt;math&gt;\varnothing = I_0 \subseteq I_1 \subseteq \cdots&lt;/math&gt; on the indexing set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n = I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s(x_i) \in A_\bullet[\{x_j\}_{j \in I_n}]&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x_i \in I_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
It turns out that every &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; differential graded algebra admits a surjective quasi-isomorphism from a semi-free &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet,d)&lt;/math&gt; differential graded algebra, called a semi-free resolution. These are unique up to homotopy equivalence in a suitable model category. The (relative) '''cotangent complex''' of an &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet,d)&lt;/math&gt;-differential graded algebra &lt;math&gt;(B_\bullet, d_B)&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed using a semi-free resolution &lt;math&gt;(R_\bullet,d_R) \to (B_\bullet, d_B)&lt;/math&gt;: it is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{L}_{B_\bullet/A_\bullet} := \Omega_{R_\bullet/A_\bullet}\otimes_{R_\bullet} B_\bullet
&lt;/math&gt;
Many examples can be constructed by taking the algebra &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; representing a variety over a field of characteristic 0, finding a presentation of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as a quotient of a polynomial algebra and taking the Koszul complex associated to this presentation. The Koszul complex acts as a semi-free resolution of the differential graded algebra &lt;math&gt;(B_\bullet,0)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;B_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is the graded algebra with the non-trivial graded piece in degree 0.

===Examples===
The cotangent complex of a hypersurface &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{V}(f) \subset \mathbb{A}^n_\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; can easily be computed: since we have the dga &lt;math&gt;K_R(f)&lt;/math&gt; representing the '''derived enhancement''' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we can compute the cotangent complex as
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to R\cdot ds \xrightarrow{\Phi} \oplus_i R \cdot dx_i \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi(gds) = g\cdot df&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the usual universal derivation. If we take a complete intersection, then the koszul complex
:&lt;math&gt;R^\bullet = \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1)} \otimes^\mathbf{L}_{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]} \cdots \otimes^\mathbf{L}_{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]} \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_k)} &lt;/math&gt;
is quasi-isomorphic to the complex
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1,\ldots,f_k)}[+0]&lt;/math&gt;
This implies we can construct the cotangent complex of the derived ring &lt;math&gt;R^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; as the tensor product of the cotangent complex above for each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Remarks===
Please note that the cotangent complex in the context of derived geometry differs from the cotangent complex of classical schemes. Namely, if there was a singularity in the hypersurface defined by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; then the cotangent complex would have infinite amplitude. These observations provide motivation for the '''hidden smoothness''' philosophy of derived geometry since we are now working with a complex of finite length.

==Tangent Complexes==

===Polynomial Functions===
Given a polynomial function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{A}^n \to \mathbb{A}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then consider the (homotopy) pullback diagram
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
Z &amp; \to &amp; \mathbb{A}^n \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
\{ pt \} &amp; \xrightarrow{0} &amp; \mathbb{A}^m
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the bottom arrow is the inclusion of a point at the origin. Then, the derived scheme &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; has tangent complex at &lt;math&gt;x\in Z&lt;/math&gt; is given by the morphism
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}_x = T_x\mathbb{A}^n \xrightarrow{df_x} T_0\mathbb{A}^m&lt;/math&gt;
where the complex is of amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the tangent space can be recovered using &lt;math&gt;H^0&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; measures how far away &lt;math&gt;x \in Z&lt;/math&gt; is from being a smooth point.
&lt;!-- should discuss the L^\infty structure with explicit examples!. look at the top of page 9 --&gt;

===Stack Quotients===
Given a stack &lt;math&gt;[X/G]&lt;/math&gt; there is a nice description for the tangent complex:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}_x = \mathfrak{g}_x \to T_xX &lt;/math&gt;
If the morphism is not injective, the &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; measures again how singular the space is. In addition, the euler characteristic of this complex yields the correct (virtual) dimension of the quotient stack.
&lt;!-- should discuss the L^\infty structure... --&gt;
In particular, if we look at the moduli stack of principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles, then the tangent complex is just &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}[+1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derived Schemes in Complex Morse Theory==
Derived schemes can be used for analyzing topological properties of affine varieties. For example, consider a smooth affine variety &lt;math&gt;M \subset \mathbb{A}^n&lt;/math&gt;. If we take a regular function &lt;math&gt;f:M \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and consider the section of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_M&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{df}: M \to \Omega_M&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (x,df(x))&lt;/math&gt;
Then, we can take the derived pullback diagram
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
X &amp; \to &amp; M \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow 0 \\
M &amp; \xrightarrow{\Gamma_{df}} &amp; \Omega_M
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the zero section, constructing a '''derived critical locus''' of the regular function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Consider the affine variety
:&lt;math&gt;M = \text{Spec}\left( \mathbb{C}[x,y] \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the regular function given by &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{df}(a,b) = (a,b,2a,3b^2)&lt;/math&gt; 
where we treat the last two coordinates as &lt;math&gt;dx,dy&lt;/math&gt;. The derived critical locus is then the derived scheme
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{RSpec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}{(dx,dy)} \otimes_{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}^{\mathbf{L}} \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}{(2x - dx, 3y^2 - dy)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that since the left term in the derived intersection is a complete intersection, we can compute a complex representing the derived ring as
:&lt;math&gt;K_{dx,dy}^\bullet(\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy])\otimes_{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]} \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}{(2 - dx, 3y^2 - dy)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K_{dx,dy}^\bullet(\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy])&lt;/math&gt; is the koszul complex.
&lt;!-- The previous computation gave the derived intersection of the cotangent bundle of the hypersurface with the zero section of the embedded space... --&gt;

==Derived Critical Locus==
Consider a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f:M \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is smooth. The derived enhancement of &lt;math&gt;\text{Crit}(f)&lt;/math&gt;, the '''derived critical locus''', is given by the differential graded scheme &lt;math&gt;(M,\mathcal{A}^\bullet, Q)&lt;/math&gt; where the underlying graded ring are the polyvector fields
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^{-i} = \wedge^i T_M&lt;/math&gt;
and the differential &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is defined by contraction by &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
For example, if &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3&lt;/math&gt; we have the complex
:&lt;math&gt; R\cdot \partial x\wedge \partial y \xrightarrow{2xdx + 3y^2dy} R \cdot \partial x \oplus R \cdot \partial y \xrightarrow{2xdx + 3y^2dy} R&lt;/math&gt;
representing the derived enhancement of &lt;math&gt;\text{Crit}(f)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Disarmament''' is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing [[weapons]]. Disarmament generally refers to a country's [[military]] or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of [[weapons of mass destruction]], such as [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]. General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security.”&lt;ref name="UN First Special Session on Disarmament"&gt;UN General Assembly, [https://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/SSOD/A-S-10-4.pdf Final Document of the First Special Session on Disarmament] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117222949/http://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/SSOD/A-S-10-4.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}, para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before [[World War I]] at the Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907 government delegations debated about disarmament and the creation of an international court with binding powers. The court was considered necessary because it was understood that nation-states could not disarm into a vacuum.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} After the war revulsion at the futility and tremendous cost of the war was widespread. A commonly held belief was that the cause of the war had been the escalating buildup of armaments in the previous half century among the [[great power]]s (see [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]). Although the [[Treaty of Versailles]] effectively disarmed Germany, a clause was inserted that called on all the great powers to likewise progressively disarm over a period of time. The newly formed [[League of Nations]] made this an explicit goal in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|covenant of the league]], which committed its signatories to reduce armaments ‘to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations’.

[[File:Martin Kobler addresses a ceremony.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Kobler]] addresses attendees at a disarmament ceremony in [[Goma]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]]]
One of the earliest successful achievements in disarmament was obtained with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, it prevented the continued construction of [[capital ship]]s and limited ships of other classification to under 10,000 tons displacement. The size of the three country's navies (the [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]) was set at the ratio 5-5-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marriott|first=Leo|title=Treaty Cruisers: The First International Warship Building Competition|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword|place=Barnsley|year=2005|ISBN=1-84415-188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments was set up by the League of Nations to explore possibilities for disarmament.  Proposals ranged from abolishing [[chemical warfare]] and [[strategic bombing]] to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks.  A draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by the British, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police the [[British Empire|empire]].
 
A further commission in 1926, set up to explore the possibilities for the reduction of army size, met similar difficulties, prompting the French [[Foreign Minister]] [[Aristide Briand]] and US [[Secretary of State]] [[Frank Kellogg]] to draft a treaty known as the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], which denounced war of aggression. Although there were 65 signatories to the pact, it achieved nothing, as it set out no guidelines for action in the event of a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm|title=Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928|publisher=[[Yale University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509201753/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final attempt was made at the [[Geneva Disarmament Conference]] from 1932–37, chaired by former British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Henderson]]. Germany demanded the revision of the Versailles Treaty and the granting of military parity with the other powers, while France was determined to keep Germany demilitarised for its own security. Meanwhile, the British and Americans were not willing to offer France security commitments in exchange for conciliation with Germany. The talks broke down in 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] withdrew Germany from the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations4_disarmament.htm|title= The League And Disarmament: A Story Of Failure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear disarmament===
{{Main article|Nuclear disarmament}} 
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb| [[United States]] and [[USSR]]/[[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945-2006. These numbers include warheads not actively deployed, including those on reserve status or scheduled for dismantlement. Stockpile totals do not necessarily reflect nuclear capabilities since they ignore size, range, type, and delivery mode.]]

Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapons]] and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.) ''The CND Story'', Alison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention. The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] was organised by the CND and took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.

In 1961, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] gave a speech before the UN General Assembly where he announced the US "intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved." He went on to call for a global general and complete disarmament, offering a rough outline for how this could be accomplished:
{{cquote|&lt;blockquote&gt;The program to be presented to this assembly - for general and complete disarmament under effective international control - moves to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement. It would create machinery to keep the peace as it destroys the machinery of war. It would proceed through balanced and safeguarded stages designed to give no state a military advantage over another. It would place the final responsibility for verification and control where it belongs, not with the big powers alone, not with one's adversary or one's self, but in an international organization within the framework of the United Nations. It would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament - true inspection - and apply it in stages proportionate to the stage of disarmament. It would cover delivery systems as well as weapons. It would ultimately halt their production as well as their testing, their transfer as well as their possession. It would achieve under the eyes of an international disarmament organization, a steady reduction in force, both nuclear and conventional, until it has abolished all armies and all weapons except those needed for internal order and a new United Nations Peace Force. And it starts that process now, today, even as the talks begin. In short, general and complete disarmament must no longer be a slogan, used to resist the first steps. It is no longer to be a goal without means of achieving it, without means of verifying its progress, without means of keeping the peace. It is now a realistic plan, and a test - a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/io/potusunga/207241.htm|title=Address by President John F.

Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|nuclear disarmament groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Greenpeace]] and [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapons]] and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Schell.

==Definitions of disarmament==
In his definition of "disarmament", [[David Carlton]] writes in the Oxford University Press Political dictionary, "But confidence in such measures of arms control, especially when unaccompanied by extensive means of verification, has not been strengthened by the revelation that [[Soviet program of biological weapons|the Soviet Union in its last years successfully concealed]] consistent and systematic cheating on its obligations under the [[Biological Weapons Convention]]."  He also notes, "Now a freeze or a mutually agreed increase is not strictly speaking disarmament at all. And such measures may not even be intended to be a first step towards any kind of reduction or abolition. For the aim may simply be to promote stability in force structures. Hence a new term to cover such cases has become fashionable since the 1960s, namely, arms control."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/disarmament?cat=technology disarmament: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book by [[Seymour Melman]], ''[[Inspection for Disarmament]]'', addresses various problems related to the problem of inspection for disarmament, evasion teams, and capabilities and limitations of aerial inspection. Gradually, as the idea of arms control displaced the idea of disarmament, the weaknesses of the present arms control paradigm have created problems for the idea of disarmament itself. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''[[Ecological]] [[goods and services]]''' ('''EG&amp;S''') are the benefits arising from the ecological functions of [[ecosystems]]. Such benefits accrue to all [[Organism|living organisms]], including animals and plants, rather than to humans alone. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance to society that ecological goods and services provide for health, social, cultural, and economic needs. 

==Introduction==
Examples of ecological goods include [[Air pollution|clean air]], and abundant [[fresh water]]. Examples of ecological services include purification of air and water, maintenance of biodiversity, decomposition of wastes, soil and vegetation generation and renewal, pollination of crops and natural vegetation, groundwater recharge through wetlands, [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation, and aesthetically pleasing landscapes. The products and processes of ecological goods and services are complex and occur over long periods of time. They are a sub-category of [[public goods]].

The concern over ecological goods and services arises because we are losing them at an unsustainable rate, and therefore [[land use]] managers must devise a host of tools to encourage the provision of more ecological goods and services. Rural and suburban settings are especially important, as lands that are developed and converted from their natural state lose their ecological functions. Therefore, ecological goods and services provided by privately held lands become increasingly important.

==Markets==
A market may be created wherein ecological goods and services are demanded by society and supplied by public and private landowners.  Some believe that [[public land]]s alone are not adequate to supply this market, and that privately held lands are needed to close this gap. What has emerged is the notion that rural landowners who provide ecological goods and services to society through good stewardship practices on their land should be duly compensated. The main tool to accomplish this to date has been to pay farmers directly to set-aside portions of their land that would otherwise be in production. This exemplifies a shift in thinking from the "polluter pays" to the "beneficiary pays". 

Financial incentives to landowners is one approach, but provision of EG&amp;S can also be achieved through regulation, stewardship incentives under existing programs such Environmental Farm Plans, [[market-based instruments]], and tax rebates.

==Biodiversity and EGS==
According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423003943/http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx Millennium Ecosystem Assessment] project, [[biodiversity]] is a necessary underlying component of ecological goods and services.  Biodiversity supports ecological goods and services such as [[biological control]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Costanza|Costanza, R.]], d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Naeem, S., O'Neill, R., Paruelo, J., Raskin, R.G., Sutton, P. &amp; van den Belt, M. (1997). The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''387''':253-260&lt;/ref&gt;  However, biodiversity is also sometimes referred to as an actual ecological good or service which can be confusing.  

==Policy tools==
The following policy tools can be used to ensure production of ecological goods and services:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Quebec)|Agriculture, Pêcheries et Alimentation]], Quebec. (2005). Remuneration for ecological goods and services produced by agriculture: Elements for a Quebec analysis.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in French)

*Regulations
*Cross compliance programs
*Environmental marketing schemes (e.g. [[ecolabel|eco-labeling]])
*Voluntary participation programs
*Market based approaches (e.g. offset credits{{Clarify|date=January 2012}})
*One time direct payments

'''Falling on a grenade''' refers to the deliberate act of using one's body to cover a live [[fuse (explosives)|time-fused]] [[hand grenade]], absorbing the explosion and fragmentation in an effort to save the lives of others nearby. Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the [[Medal of Honor]] have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act.

Such an act can be survivable: In [[World War II]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Jacklyn H. Lucas|Jack Lucas]], in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], placed two grenades under his steel [[M1 Helmet]] and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near [[Sangin]] in [[Afghanistan]] British [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] [[Matthew Croucher]] used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor, and that and his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in  [[Marjah]], [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], US Marine [[Lance Corporal]] [[Kyle Carpenter]] threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim.

"Falling on a grenade" is also used colloquially in non-military contexts to indicate individual acceptance of a personally harmful or sacrificial task in an effort to protect a larger group; during a scandal, corporate leaders or politicians who attempt to draw negative attention away from their company or party by pleading guilt, publicly admitting culpability and drawing condemnation on themselves (at the cost of their freedom or career) are often said to have "fallen on a grenade". 

==Examples==
*On July 1, 1916, at the [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge]] in [[World War I]], British Army Private [[William McFadzean]] of the 14th Battalion, the Royal Irish Rifles threw himself on top of a box of [[Mills bomb]]s after the pin came loose on two of them whilst he was attempting to load the bombs into a bandolier. As a result of his action only one other man in the trench was injured in the resulting explosion. McFadzean was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].
* On December 19, 1941, at the [[Battle of Hong Kong]], [[Canadian Army]] [[Company Sergeant Major]] [[John Robert Osborn]] jumped on a grenade, sacrificing himself to save his men. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.
* On November 7, 1943, at [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Sergeant]] [[Herbert Joseph Thomas|Herbert J. Thomas, Jr]] deliberately fell on a grenade, sacrificing himself to protect nearby Marines. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On April 3, 1945, [[Walter C. Wetzel]], threw himself on two grenades thrown by attacking Germans, suffering wounds from which he died. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On September 1, 1950, near [[Yongsan]], [[South Korea]], U.S. Army [[Private First Class]] [[David M. Smith]] noticed an enemy grenade lobbed into his company's emplacement. Smith shouted a warning to his comrades and flung himself upon it. Although he was mortally wounded, his act saved five men from injury or death. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On November 26, 1950, during the Korean war, U.S. Army [[Sergeant]] [[John A. Pittman]] threw himself on the grenade, which was thrown in the midst of his squad, and absorbed the burst with his body. Pittman survived and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
* On February 11, 1954, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Private [[Nathan Elbaz]] was disarming grenades when he noticed one of the grenade's safeties had slipped. He grabbed the grenade and ran from the tent but realized he would not be able to throw the grenade away without harming some of his friends, so he smothered the explosion with his body. He was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Distinguished Service]].
* On November 1, 1956, during [[Suez Crisis]], [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Officer [[Ovad Ladijinski]] threw a grenade towards the opening of a high Egyptian station. The grenade fell back towards him and his group. He pressed the closest soldier to a rock and protected him using his body, facing the grenade. He was posthumously awarded a Chief of General Staff Citation (later changed to [[Medal of Courage]]), which was his second one.
* On February 25, 1966, [[Peter S. Connor]] held a grenade against his body after realizing the fuse was burning despite his holding the safety pin, and he did not have time to throw it safely away from his comrades. He died eleven days later and was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On August 16, 1966, during a cave search and destroy mission in the Vietnam War, [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps]] Captain Lee In-Ho smothered a grenade to save his men around him. He was posthumously awarded the highest South Korean military honor, the Taegeuk Cordon of Military Merit.
* On February 28, 1967, [[James Anderson, Jr.]] sacrificed his life by smothering a grenade with his body in the [[Vietnam War]] and was awarded a Medal of Honor.
* On September 6, 1967, Sgt. Rodney Maxwell Davis, USMC, threw himself on an enemy grenade in the Quang Nam Province of Vietnam during Operation Swift while under attack from Vietnamese forces.  He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
* On February 23, 1971, a [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck]] was ambushed by a squad of [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) soldiers near [[An Khê]]. At one point during the firefight, an NVA soldier threw a fragmentation grenade into the truck's compartment. 21-year-old [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Four]] [[Larry G. Dahl]] was the only occupant who heard the grenade land in the truck. Realizing that there was not sufficient time to toss it out, he immediately threw himself on top of the grenade, saving his comrades' lives at the cost of his own. Dahl was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On May 25, 1971, [[Michael Willetts]] smothered an explosive device planted at Springfield Road Police Station, Belfast, by a member of the [[Provisional IRA]]. In doing so, he saved the lives of several civilians, including two children. He was posthumously awarded the [[George Cross]] for his actions.
* On April 14, 2004, near [[Husaybah]], [[Iraq]], [[Jason Dunham]] used his body and helmet to shield others from a grenade explosion - but died shortly afterward from his injuries. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Whos_Who/Dunham_JL.htm|title=Corporal Jason L.

* On September 3, 2004, in [[Beslan]], [[Russia]], Lt. [[Andrey Turkin]], a member of a Russian counter-terrorist unit "Vympel", smothered a grenade, which was thrown by a terrorist in the school canteen, with his own body in order to shield hostages from the explosion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23338">{{For|the sport of soaring in gliders (sailplanes)|Gliding}}

'''Gliding flight''' is heavier-than-air [[flight]] without the use of [[thrust]]; the term '''volplaning''' also refers to this mode of flight in animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/volplane volplane]. The Free Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is employed by [[flying and gliding animals|gliding animals]] and by aircraft such as [[glider (aircraft)|gliders]]. This mode of flight involves flying a significant distance horizontally compared to its descent and therefore can be distinguished from a mostly straight downward descent like with a round parachute.

Although the human application of gliding flight usually refers to aircraft designed for this purpose, most powered aircraft are capable of gliding without engine power. As with sustained flight, gliding generally requires the application of an [[airfoil]], such as the [[wing]]s on aircraft or birds, or the [[Patagium|gliding membrane]] of a [[gliding possum]]. However, gliding can be achieved with a flat ([[Camber (aerodynamics)|uncambered]]) wing, as with a simple [[paper plane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Ken|title=Paper Plane Aerodynamics|url=http://paperplane.org/paero.htm|publisher=Ken Blackburn's Paper Airplanes|accessdate=8 October 2012|quote=Section 4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even with [[card-throwing]]. However, some aircraft with [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] and animals such as the [[flying snake]] can achieve gliding flight without any wings by creating a flattened surface underneath.

==Aircraft ("gliders")==
{{main|Glider aircraft}}
Most winged aircraft can glide to some extent, but there are several types of aircraft designed to glide:
* [[Glider (sailplane)|Glider]], also known as a sailplane
* [[Hang glider]]
* [[Paraglider]]
* [[Speed glider]]
* [[Ram-air parachute]]
* [[Rotor kite]], if untethered, known as a rotary glider, or gyroglider.
* [[Military glider]]
* [[Paper aeroplane]]
* [[Radio-controlled glider]]
* [[Rocket glider]]
* [[Wingsuit]]

The main human application is currently recreational, though during the [[Second World War]] [[military glider]]s were used for carrying troops and equipment into battle. The types of aircraft that are used for sport and recreation are classified as [[glider (sailplane)|gliders (sailplanes)]], [[hang glider]]s and [[paraglider]]s. These two latter types are often foot-launched. The design of all three types enables them to repeatedly climb using rising air and then to glide before finding the next source of lift.  When done in gliders (sailplanes), the sport is known as [[gliding]] and sometimes as soaring. For foot-launched aircraft, it is known as [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]]. [[Radio-controlled glider]]s with fixed wings are also soared by enthusiasts.

In addition to [[motor glider]]s, some powered aircraft are designed for routine glides during part of their flight; usually when landing after a period of a powered flight. These include:
* [[Experimental aircraft]] such as the [[North American X-15]], which glided back having used their fuel
* [[Spacecraft]] such as the [[Space Shuttle]]s, [[SpaceShipOne]] and the Russian [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]]

Some aircraft are not designed to glide except in an emergency, such as engine failure. See [[List of airline flights that required gliding|list of airline flights that required gliding flight]]. Gliding in a helicopter is called [[autorotation]].

==Gliding animals==
{{further|Flying and gliding animals|List of soaring birds}}

===Birds===
A number of [[animal]]s have [[Convergent evolution|separately evolved]] gliding many times, without any single ancestor. Birds in particular use gliding flight to minimise their use of energy. Large birds are notably adept at gliding, including:
* [[Albatross]]
* [[Condor]]
* [[Vulture]]
* [[Eagle]]
* [[Stork]]
* [[Frigatebird]]

Like recreational aircraft, birds can alternate periods of gliding with periods of soaring in [[lift (soaring)|rising air]], and so spend a considerable time airborne with a minimal expenditure of energy. The [[great frigatebird]] in particular is capable of continuous flights up to several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/30/484164544/non-stop-flight-how-the-frigatebird-can-soar-for-months-without-stopping|title=Nonstop Flight: How The Frigatebird Can Soar For Weeks Without Stopping|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
[[File:Patagium-flying squirrel-psf.png|thumb|Patagium on a flying squirrel]]
To assist gliding, some mammals have evolved a structure called the [[patagium]]. This is a membranous structure found stretched between a range of body parts. It is most highly developed in bats. For similar reasons to birds, [[bat]]s can glide efficiently. In bats, the [[skin]] forming the surface of the wing is an extension of the skin of the abdomen that runs to the tip of each digit, uniting the forelimb with the body.  The patagium of a bat has four distinct parts:
# Propatagium: the patagium present from the neck to the first digit
# Dactylopatagium: the portion found within the digits
# Plagiopatagium: the portion found between the last digit and the hindlimbs
# [[Interfemoral membrane|Uropatagium]]: the posterior portion of the body between the two hindlimbs

Other mammals such as [[gliding possum]]s and [[flying squirrel]]s also glide using a patagium, but with much poorer efficiency than bats. They cannot gain height. The animal launches itself from a tree, spreading its limbs to expose the gliding membranes, usually to get from tree to tree in [[rainforest]]s as an efficient means of both locating food and evading predators. This form of [[arboreal locomotion]], is common in tropical regions such as [[Borneo]] and Australia, where the [[tree]]s are tall and widely spaced.

In flying squirrels, the patagium stretches from the fore- to the hind-limbs along the length of each side of the torso.  In the [[sugar glider]], the patagia extend between the fifth finger of each hand to the first toe of each foot.  This creates an [[aerofoil]] enabling them to glide 50 metres or more.&lt;ref name="Strahan-1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strahan|first=the Australian Museum|editor=Ronald|title=Complete Book of Australian Mammals: The National Photographic Index of Australian Wildlife|year=1983|publisher=[[Angus &amp; Robertson]]|location=Sydney|isbn=0207144540|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gliding flight is regulated by changing the curvature of the membrane or moving the legs and tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=799 |title=Sugar Glider Fun Facts |publisher=Drsfostersmith.com |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish, reptiles, amphibians and other gliding animals===
In addition to mammals and birds, other animals notably [[flying fish]], [[flying snake]]s, [[flying frog]]s and [[flying squid]] also glide.

Gliding flight has evolved independently among 3,400 species of frogs&lt;ref name="numerous"&gt;Emerson, S.B., &amp; Koehl, M.A.R. (1990).

Characteristics of the [[Old World]] species include "enlarged hands and feet, full webbing between all fingers and toes, lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs

==Forces==
[[File:GliderForces.gif|thumb|right|Forces on a gliding animal or aircraft in flight]]
Three principal forces act on aircraft and animals when gliding:&lt;ref name=nasaforces&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/glider.html NASA: Three forces on a glider or gliding animal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* weight – gravity acts in the downwards direction
* lift – acts perpendicularly to the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] representing airspeed
* drag – acts parallel to the vector representing the airspeed

As the aircraft or animal descends, the air moving over the wings generates [[lift force|lift]]. The lift force acts slightly forward of vertical because it is created at right angles to the airflow which comes from slightly below as the glider descends, see [[angle of attack]]. This horizontal component of lift is enough to overcome [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and allows the glider to accelerate forward. Even though the weight causes the aircraft to descend, if the air is rising faster than the sink rate, there will be a gain of altitude.

==Lift to drag ratio==
{{main|Lift to drag ratio}}
[[File:Polar Curve 2.png|thumb|Polar curve showing glide angle for best glide]]
The lift-to-drag ratio, or ''L/D ratio'', is the amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]] generated by a [[wing]] or vehicle, divided by the [[drag (physics)|drag]] it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favourable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's needed lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better fuel economy and climb performance.

The effect of [[airspeed]] on the rate of descent can be depicted by a [[polar curve (aviation)|polar curve]]. These curves show the airspeed where minimum sink can be achieved and the airspeed with the best L/D ratio. The curve is an inverted U-shape. As speeds reduce the amount of lift falls rapidly around the stalling speed. The peak of the 'U' is at minimum drag.

As lift and drag are both proportional to the coefficient of Lift and Drag respectively multiplied by the same factor (1/2 ρ&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S), the L/D ratio can be simplified to  the Coefficient of lift divided by the coefficient of drag or Cl/Cd, and since both are proportional to the airspeed, the ratio of L/D or Cl/Cd is then typically plotted against angle of attack.

==Drag==

[[Induced drag]] is caused by the generation of lift by the wing. Lift generated by a wing is perpendicular to the relative wind, but since wings typically fly at some small [[angle of attack]], this means that a component of the force is directed to the rear. The rearward component of this force (parallel with the relative wind) is seen as drag. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher angle of attack, thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the drag graph, the left side of the U.

[[Profile drag]] is caused by air hitting the wing, and other parts of the aircraft. This form of drag, also known as [[wind resistance]], varies with the square of speed (see [[drag equation]]). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming the right side of the drag graph's U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by reducing cross section and streamlining.

[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|right|The drag curve]]
As lift increases steadily until the critical angle, it is normally the point where the combined drag is at its lowest, that the wing or aircraft is performing at its best L/D.

Designers will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen [[cruising speed]] for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in [[aeronautical engineering]], the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at high [[angle of attack]] and a gentle [[Stall (flight)|stall]] are also important.

Minimising drag is of particular interest in the design and operation of high performance [[glider (sailplane)]]s, the largest of which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1, though many others have a lower performance; 25:1 being considered adequate for training use.

==Glide ratio==
When flown at a constant speed in still air a glider moves forwards a certain distance for a certain distance downwards. The ratio of the distance forwards to downwards is called the ''glide ratio''. The glide ratio (E) is numerically equal to the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] under these conditions; but is not necessarily equal during other manoeuvres, especially if speed is not constant. A glider's glide ratio varies with airspeed, but there is a maximum value which is frequently quoted. Glide ratio usually varies little with vehicle loading; a heavier vehicle glides faster, but nearly maintains its glide ratio.&lt;ref&gt;''Glider Flying Handbook'', FAA Publication 8083-13, Page 3-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glide ratio.gif|300px|right]]
Glide ratio (or "finesse") is the [[cotangent]] of the downward angle, the ''glide angle'' (γ).  Alternatively it is also the forward speed divided by sink speed (unpowered aircraft):

:&lt;math&gt;{L \over D}={{\Delta s} \over {\Delta h}}={v_{\text{forward}} \over v_{\text{down}}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Glide number'' (ε) is the reciprocal of glide ratio but sometime it's confused.

==Examples==

{{Glide ratio examples}}

==Importance of the glide ratio in gliding flight==

Although the best glide ratio is important when measuring the performance of a gliding aircraft, its glide ratio at a range of speeds also determines its success (see article on [[gliding]]).

Pilots sometimes fly at the aircraft's best L/D by precisely controlling airspeed and smoothly operating the controls to reduce drag. However the strength of the likely next lift, minimising the time spent in strongly sinking air and the strength of the wind also affects the optimal [[speed to fly]]. Pilots fly faster to get quickly through sinking air, and when heading into wind to optimise the glide angle relative to the ground. To achieve higher speed across country, [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders (sailplanes)]] are often loaded with water [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] to increase the airspeed and so reach the next area of lift sooner. This has little effect on the glide angle since the increases in the rate of sink and in the airspeed remain in proportion and thus the heavier aircraft achieves optimal L/D at a higher airspeed. If the areas of lift are strong on the day, the benefits of ballast outweigh the slower rate of climb.

If the air is rising faster than the rate of sink, the aircraft will climb. At lower speeds an aircraft may have a worse glide ratio but it will also have a lower rate of sink. A low airspeed also improves its ability to turn tightly in centre of the [[lift (soaring)|rising air]] where the rate of ascent is greatest. A sink rate of approximately 1.0&amp;nbsp;m/s is the most that a practical hang glider or paraglider could have before it would limit the occasions that a climb was possible to only when there was strongly rising air. Gliders (sailplanes) have minimum sink rates of between 0.4 and 0.6&amp;nbsp;m/s depending on the [[Glider Competition Classes|class]]. Aircraft such as airliners may have a better glide ratio than a hang glider, but would rarely be able to thermal because of their much higher forward speed and their much higher sink rate. (Note that the [[Boeing 767]] in the [[Gimli Glider]] incident achieved a glide ratio of only 12:1.)

The loss of height can be measured at several speeds and plotted on a "[[polar curve (aviation)|polar curve]]" to calculate the best speed to fly in various conditions, such as when flying into wind or when in sinking air.   Other polar curves can be measured after loading the glider with water ballast.  As mass increases, the best glide ratio is achieved at higher speeds. (The glide ratio is not increased.)

==Soaring==
{{main|Lift (soaring)}}
Soaring animals and aircraft may alternate glides with periods of soaring in [[lift (soaring)|rising air]]. Five principal types of lift are used:&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{cite book | last = Welch | first = John | title = Van Sickle's Modern Airmanship | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] | location = City | year = 1999 | pages = 856–858 | isbn = 0-07-069633-0 | quote = There are four main kinds of lift which the soaring pilot may use....}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thermal]]s, [[ridge lift]], [[lee waves]], [[Convergence zone|convergences]] and [[dynamic soaring]]. Dynamic soaring is used predominately by birds, and some model aircraft, though it has also been achieved on rare occasions by piloted aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last= Reichmann |first= Helmut |title= Streckensegelflug |publisher= Motorbuch Verlag |year= 2005 |isbn = 3-613-02479-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of soaring flight by birds are the use of:
* Thermals and convergences by [[bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[vulture]]s
* Ridge lift by [[gull]]s near cliffs
* Wave lift by migrating birds&lt;ref&gt;[Report of use of wave lift by birds by Netherlands Institute for Ecology]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic effects near the surface of the sea by [[albatross]]es

For humans, soaring is the basis for three [[air sports]]: [[gliding]], [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]].

'''Hans Martin Sutermeister''' (29 September 1907  – 4 May 1977 pen name: Hans Moehrlen) was a [[Swiss]] [[physician]] and [[medical writer]], [[politician]], and activist against [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]].

==Life==

===Early years===
Hans Martin was born to Freidrich Sutermeister (1873-1934) and Maria Hunziker (1875-1947). His brothers include the writer [[Peter Sutermeister|Peter]] and composer [[Heinrich Sutermeister|Heinrich]].  His grandfather was the folklorist [[Otto Sutermeister]]. A minister's son, Hans Martin studied [[theology]] in Germany, changing to medicine at [[University of Basel]] just before completing his degree.&lt;ref name=Mauz&gt;Gerhard Mauz. [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46272426.html “Schuldig, weil wir keinen anderen haben: SPIEGEL-Reporter Gerhard Mauz über die Fehlurteilsjäger Hans Martin Sutermeister und Gustav Adolf Neumann.”] In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 18/28, April 1965, p. 116 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[Doctorate|promotion]] with his uncle [[Hans Hunziker]] in 1941, Sutermeister published, under the pseudonym “Hans Moehrlen” (following the surname of his great-grandfather [[Christophe Moehrlen]]), an autobiographical novella about his life as a [[bachelor]]. The novella describes his philosophical change of direction towards a [[monism|monist]] view of love and happiness, inspired by natural science; remarkably is its heartedness in times of [[World War II|war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Sutermeister published a series on [[neopositivism|neopositivist]] medical thought. He was especially interested in [[psychosomatic]] medicine and [[music psychology]]. For example, according to him, “[[swing music]] is restful” because &lt;blockquote&gt;the brain becomes fatigued when it is worked too hard, as in acquiring knowledge of new facts. Both students and business men can benefit by such music … the best way to rest the brain after such fatigue is to “[[Regression (psychology)|regress]]” to more basic or primitive forms of thought and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=efUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=%22Dr.+H+M+Sutermeister%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NgZNnKKMrS&amp;sig=CZX48jDsCLA85cDWrtf2CTnK3wA&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=tNzBTKzPE8KaOtT9yMoL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dr.%20H%20M%20Sutermeister%22&amp;f=false “Swiss Says Swing Smoothly Soothes.”] In: ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', January 17, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During [[World War II]], he worked for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] in Germany, [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], as well as a physician at the Swiss border. After the war he wrote for medical journals and was an instructor in [[psychophysiology]] at the [[Volkshochschule]] (Folk high school) in [[Bern]]. In 1945, he opened his first a [[family medicine|family medical]] practice in Bern.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In order to get a [[venia legendi]] in [[History of Medicine]] and [[Medical Psychology]] (Psychosomatics), Sutermeister successively deposited, at the beginning of the 1950s, three [[Habilitation|post-doctoral theses]] at the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Berne]]:&lt;ref name="klaesi"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/JakobKlaesiToBernhardWalthard6.9.1954 ''Betrifft Habilitationsgesuch des Dr. med.

Sutermeister was in contact with the medical historian [[Erich Hintzsche]] particularly because of his work ''Schiller as physician'', and he participated in a seminar on medical history 1953 in Lugano. In a letter to Hintzsche, [[Henry E. Sigerist]] described Sutermeister's review, published in 1955 as Volume 13 of the ''Berne contributions to the history of medicine and natural sciences'', as “a very nice work … that is interesting even to [[literary historian]]s.”&lt;ref name="bickel"&gt;[[Marcel H.

===Politics===

He joined the [[Ring of Independents]] political party and began his political career in the [[Grand Council of Bern|legislature of the Canton of Bern]]. From 1967 to 1971 he served as a member of the municipal [[Executive (government)|executive]], as well as director of the city's schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bähler |first=Anna |author2=Bühler, Susanna |author3=Erne, Emil |author4=Lüthi, Christian |editor=Barth, Robert |title=Bern - die Geschichte der Stadt im 19. und 20.

Although he had a reputation as a progressive within his party, he also stirred some concern both inside and outside the party&lt;ref name=anneepolitique&gt;[http://www.anneepolitique.ch/APS/fr/APS_1971/APS1971_I_1_e.html Élections communales, année politique Suisse 1971], University of Bern (French - password required): ''A Berne, lors des élections à l'exécutif communal, les radicaux, grâce à A.

Thiele-Dohrmann, [http://www.zeit.de/1970/30/Ruhestoerung-in-Bern?page=all “Ruhestörung in Bern.”]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Die Zeit]]'' July 24, 1970 (German): ''in einem kleinen Privatkrieg heftig attackiert''.&lt;/ref&gt; an educational manifesto deriving from the [[Protests of 1968|1968 student protest movement]] that urged students to reject societal norms. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' quoted his warning to all educators: &lt;blockquote&gt;We will not permit our youth, who are today still healthy, and our freedom-based Western culture, to be undermined by such softening-up tactics, which are clearly controlled from the East, and made 'Ready for conquest' by Communism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44943670.html “Der SPIEGEL berichtete: Schüler-Lehrerbeziehung.”] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 28/1970, July 6, 1970: ''Wir lassen uns unsre heute noch gesunde Jugend und unsre freiheitliche westliche Kultur nicht durch solche eindeutig vom Osten gesteuerte Aufweichungstaktik unterminieren und “sturmreif” für den Kommunismus machen.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and added that some schools banned the book; Radio Bern canceled a broadcast on it; and bookstores canceled orders; the city authorities determined that the book was not seditious, but with police assurance that they had the power to do so, banned it as posing a danger to minors. His actions revealed latent attitudinal and generational divisions within the party, and he was not re-elected in 1971.&lt;ref name=anneepolitique/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.memoriav.ch/memobase/search/detail.aspx?docid=RJSFDRS_93077691&amp;startrank=1&amp;rankcount=9726 see also]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he opened his new family medical practice in Basel.

===Activism against miscarriages of justice===

[[File:Hans Martin Sutermeister 1971.jpg|thumb|upright|Of the [[Swiss Posters Collection]]: Sutermeister's election poster for the Bernese [[Gemeinderat (Bern)|Gemeinderat]], 1971.]]

In the 1960s, Sutermeister became interested in [[forensic pathology]], and began to involve himself in investigating and attempting to right miscarriages of justice. He traveled widely and wrote analyses on false recognition, intimidation by prison inmates, uncritical acceptance of expert testimony, suggestibility and emotionalism in jurors and psychological errors by judges. His book ''Summa Iniuria'', which treats hundreds of cases, is one of the most thorough German-language works in the field. He concerned himself particularly with the case of [[Jaccoud case|Pierre Jaccoud]], whom he was convinced had been wrongly convicted of murdering Charles Zumbach based on faulty forensic work. At one point Pierre Hegg, the head of the police criminological laboratory, sued him for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43067286.html "Ein gewisses Lächeln"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 45/1960, 2 November 1960, p. 71 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts on behalf of Jaccoud made him a prominent and effective opponent of courtroom injustice,&lt;ref name=Mauz/&gt; and he went so far as to assemble the funds to hire Horace Mastronardi and other lawyers to appeal Jaccoud's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Thorwald]], ''Blutiges Geheimnis'', Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1969, {{OCLC|159809005}}, pp. 257-58 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his efforts, the case was never reopened.

The criminal law expert [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]] puts Sutermeister's ''Summa iniuria'' in the context of the earlier works of [[Erich Sello]], [[Max Alsberg]], [[Albert Hellwig]], [[Max Hirschberg]] and [[Heinrich Jagusch]] and considers him as a "committed fighters for a constitutionally protected Criminal Justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]].

== Bibliography ==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=totally exagerrated list of published items|date=December 2016}} 
The '''bibliography of Hans Martin Sutermeister''' includes a fictional novel and around 150 scientific articles, essays and books, some of them [[Investigative journalism]] written by the Swiss writer Hans Martin Sutermeister, pen name Hans Moehrlen (1907–1977). Sutermeister was a prolific writer on topics related to [[psychosomatic medicine]], [[music psychology]] and [[history of medicine]] as well as contemporary Swiss society and cultural criticism, whom [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]] in 2008 declared "a fierce fighter for justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Peters | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Peters (jurist) | title = Justiz als Schicksal: ein Plädoyer für die andere Seite | publisher = [[De Gruyter]] | year = 1979 | location = Berlin | pages = 192 | language = German | isbn =978-2-01-005712-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutermeister is best remembered for his contradictory political as a both-left-and-rightwing libertarian-authoritarian presence in local media. Every line of work that he has written since 1942 seeming, directly or indirectly, in favour of a [[monism|monist]] [[Weltanschauung|worldview]]. To that end, Sutermeister used his scientific writing to defend his political convictions, as shown in several book reviews. He first achieved acclaim with his non–fictional books from ''Psychologie und Weltanschauung'' (1944) to ''Schiller als Arzt'' (1955) and cemented his place in local history as one of the greatest Swiss pamphletists with the publication of ''[[Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer]]'' shortly before his death.

Sutermeister wrote non-fiction—including book reviews, editorials, and investigative journalism—for a variety of Swiss periodicals, mainly [[Public health journal|medical journals]]. He particularly wrote a book-length investigation of [[comprehensive school]]s in Switzerland and another of [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in the form of ''[[Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer]]'', a retrospective of criminal justice mainly in Switzerland and Germany.

No attempts have been made until now to comprehensively collect the entirety of his miscellany.

=== Books ===
Sutermeister composed one novel, ''Zwischen zwei Welten'', which is autobiographical; it was inspired by his period working as a student during [[Second World War|wartime]]; it records his experiences living and [[wikt:tramping|tramping]] in a town where he later finished his medical studies; the names are partially fictionalized:

=== Articles ===
Sutermeister wrote dozens of essays and book reviews. His insights into [[history of medicine]], literature, and politics (defending in particular [[anti-fascist]], [[liberal socialist]], [[freethought]] and somehow [[anti-communist]] ideas) during the following years. Since his death, many essays have disappeared, with the first attempt at a comprehensive collection being this list. Some of his essays, mainly during his time as member of the [[Ring of Independents]] political party, took the form of [[pamphlet]]s and were published and distributed (by himself) independently.

The following list contains the articles which are both registered in [[PubMed]] and can be considered as outstanding because of their scope, theme range or length:

It is perhaps not so much the erotic element in the movies which is dangerous, but rather the illusions which they foster of social ascension without effort, and the glorification of idleness and of the easy life.“&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cultural manifestation===

As a member of the so–called bernese [[nonconformist]]s, Sutermeister spoke in the [[Junkere 37]] (sometimes called [[Speakers' Corner]] of [[Bern]]). Some fragments of these manifestations are traceable in the ''Nonkonformismus Archiv Fredi Lerch''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas Dettwiler (creator of the inventary): [http://ead.nb.admin.ch/images/lerch/Personen.xml Short biography of Hans Martin Sutermeister] in the „Nonkonformismus Archiv [[Fredi Lerch]].“ [[Swiss Literary Archives]], 2011, with links to the ''Junkere 37'' sources.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Schulreform: Beobachtungen des städtischen Schuldirektors im Ausland.'' Bernese newspaper article, spring 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Sutermeister was not known for his [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] work, he did compose two “little [[waltz]]” and a poem:

* Hans Möhrlen (pseudonym): [https://www.e-helvetica.nb.admin.ch/directAccess?callnumber=nbdig-16265 ''Kleiner Walzer für Violine und Piano.''] 1949. Published by the [[Swiss National Library]], 2011.

A significant difference exists between data and information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Data_vs_Information] Data vs. Information&lt;/ref&gt; Information Oriented Software Development relies on data structures specifically designed to hold information, and relies on frameworks that support those data structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InformationOriented] Information Oriented&lt;/ref&gt; Information oriented software development focuses on the conceptual needs of users and customers rather than the data storage models and object models.

==Information data structures==
Information data structures are data structures specifically intended to support information inside a computer program. Two common ones are as follows:
* Data structures to support [[Fuzzy logic]].
* Data structures to support concept combinations&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gzb4-EqD76cC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=%22combinations+of+concepts%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZUUJhexYzo&amp;sig=qn-BN8YhOaU-y1-HpWgX6MONIfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtteuvqYDOAhXBOj4KHSuzBtUQ6AEIdTAR#v=onepage&amp;q=%22combinations%20of%20concepts%22&amp;f=false] An Ontological and Epistemological Perspective of Fuzzy Set Theory&lt;/ref&gt; and concept [[Permutations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wordpress.com/post/thisstack.wordpress.com/1449] Endemes are an Information Structure&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10812">'''Irenicism''' in [[Christian theology]] refers to attempts to unify Christian [[apologetical]] systems by using [[reason]] as an essential attribute. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ειρήνη (eirene)'' meaning [[peace]]. It is a concept related to [[natural theology]] and opposed to [[polemicism]] (war-like argumentation) being rooted in the ideals of [[pacifism]]{{fact|date=June 2017}}. Those who affiliate themselves with irenicism identify the importance of unity in the Christian church, and declare the common bond between all Christians under [[Christ]].

==Erasmus and his influence==

[[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a [[Christian humanist]] and reformer, in the sense of checking clerical abuses, honoring inner [[piety]], considering reason as meaningful in theology as in other ways. He also promoted the notion that  Christianity must remain under one church, both theologically and literally; under the body of the [[Catholic Church]]. Since his time, irenicism has postulated removing conflicts between different Christian creeds by way of mediation and gradual amalgamation of theological differences. Erasmus wrote extensively on topics related generally to peace, and an irenic approach is part of the texture of his thought, both on theology and in relation to politics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the frequency and severity of polemics directed against him, Erasmus continued ... to practice a kind of discourse that is critical and ironic, yet modest and irenic.&lt;ref&gt;Terence J. Martin, ''Living Words: Studies in Dialogues about Religion'' (1998), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Certain important irenic contributions from Erasmus helped to further the humanist consideration of themes of peace and religious conciliation; these included the ''Inquisitio de fide'' (1524), arguing against the papal opinion that [[Martin Luther]] was a heretic, and ''De sarcienda ecclesiae concordia'' (1533). Erasmus had close associates sharing his views ([[Julius von Pflug]], [[Christoph von Stadion]], and [[Jakob Ziegler]]), and was followed on the Catholic side by [[George Cassander]] and [[Georg Witzel]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation'' (2003), p. 78, p. 275 and p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/archives/win2008/entries/erasmus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Thompson, ''The Long Reach of Reformation Irenicism: the Considerationes Modestae et Pacificae of William Forbes (1585–1634).'' pp. 124–147 in ''Reforming the Reformation'' (2004); [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~wad005/documents/forbes.pdf PDF] (at p. 2 and p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influence of Erasmus was, however, limited, by the virtual exclusion of his works from countries such as France, from 1525, at least in the open; though they did appear in numerous forms and translations. James Hutton speaks of "the surreptitious manner in which Erasmus' peace propaganda reached the French public."&lt;ref&gt;James Hutton, ''Themes of Peace in Renaissance Poetry'' (1984), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]] published in 1593 ''Le paisible Chrestien'' arguing for [[religious tolerance]] and [[Ecumenism]]. He addressed [[Philip II of Spain]], using arguments taken from the French ''[[politique]]'' statesman [[Michel de l'Hôpital]] and reformer [[Sebastian Castellio]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Gelderen, ''The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555–1590'' (2002), p. 83; [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXK2fxzn2lAC&amp;pg=PA83 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: Catholics and Protestants==
Irenic movements were influential in the 17th century, and irenicism, for example in the form of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s efforts to reunite Catholics and Protestants, is in some ways a forerunner to the more modern [[ecumenical]] movements.

The 1589 ''Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots'' by [[Henry Constable]] proved influential, for example on [[Christopher Potter]] and [[William Forbes (bishop)|William Forbes]]. [[Richard Montagu]] admired Cassander and [[Andreas Fricius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640'' (2002), pp. 248–9; [https://books.google.com/books?id=stwluHDJsQgC&amp;pg=PA248 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; The 1628 ''Syllabus aliquot synodorum'' was a bibliography of the literature of religious concord, compiled by [[Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul]] decades earlier, and seen into print by [[Hugo Grotius]] using the pseudonym "Theodosius Irenaeus," with a preface by [[Matthias Bernegger]].&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (2000), p. 149; [https://books.google.com/books?id=zYK_Czpa1WwC&amp;pg=PA149 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was typical enough, however, for moderate and even irenical writers on the Catholic side to find in this period that their arguments were turned back against Catholicism. This style of arguing developed in England from [[Thomas Bell (priest)|Thomas Bell]] and particularly [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]]. It led to [[Thomas James]] mining [[Marcantonio de Dominis]] and [[Paolo Sarpi]], and making efforts to claim Witzel for the Protestant tradition; to the arguments of [[Gallicanism]] being welcomed but also treated as particularly insidious; and an irenist such as [[Francis a Sancta Clara]] being attacked strongly by firm [[Calvinist]]s. The handful of Protestant writers who were convinced in their irenic approach to Catholics included [[William Covell]] and [[Thomas Dove (theologian)|Thomas Dove]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640'' (2002), pp. 233–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: Protestant divisions==
[[James I of England]] thought that the Bible translation he commissioned might effect some reconciliation between the English Protestant religious factions, and prove an ''irenicon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Nicolson |title=God's Secretaries |year=2003 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ἐιρηνικόν (''eirenikon'') or peace proposal is also seen as ''irenicum'' in its Latin version.

An irenic literature developed, relating to divisions within Protestantism, particularly in the twenty years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Examples marked out by title are:

*[[David Pareus]], ''Irenicum sive de unione et synodo Evangelicorum'' (1614)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc11/htm/old/0238=218.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes]], ''Irenicum Amatoribus Veritatis et Pacis in Ecclesia Scotiana'' (Aberdeen, 1629)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc04/htm/0356=340.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jeremiah Burroughs]], ''Irenicum'' (1653)
*[[John Dury]], ''Irenicum: in quo casus conscientiæ inter ecclesias evangelicas pacis, breviter proponuntur &amp; decidunter'' (1654)
*[[Daniel Zwicker]], ''Irenicum irenicorum'' (1658)
*[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Irenicum: A Weapon Salve for the Church's Wounds'' (1659 and 1661)

*[[Samuel Mather (minister)|Samuel Mather]], ''Irenicum: or an Essay for Union'' (1680)

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote an ''Irenicum'' (unpublished manuscript); it supported a [[latitudinarian]] position in theology, derived from a review of church history.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, [[Richard Henry Popkin]], ''Newton and Religion: Context, Nature, and Influence'' (1999), p. 146 and p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of early modern irenicism==
Anthony Milton writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ecumenical historians] have tended to assume the existence of an irenical 'essentialism' in which the association of Christian unity with peace, toleration and ecumenism is presupposed. [...] In fact, most thinkers of this period accepted that religious unity was a good idea, in the same way that they believed that sin was a bad idea. The problem was that, of course, different people wanted irenicism on different terms. [...] Different interpretations of irenicism could have direct political implications, making the rhetoric of Christian unity an important tool in the political conflicts of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''’The Unchanged Peacemaker’? John Dury and the politics of Irenicism in England, 1628–1643'', p. 96 in Mark Greengrass (editor), ''Samuel Hartlib and Universal Reformation: Studies in Intellectual Communication'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is in that light that he comments on the irenists' succession: Erasmus, Cassander, [[Jacob Acontius]], Grotius, then John Dury, who spent much time on a proposed reconciliation of Lutherans and Calvinists.

==Modern usage==

''Irenical'' has become a commonly used adjective to design an idealist and pacific conception, such as the [[democratic peace theory]]. 

''False irenicism'' or ''false eirenism'' is an expression used in certain 20th-century documents of the Catholic Church to criticize attempts at ecumenism that would allow Catholic doctrine to be distorted or clouded. Documents using the term include the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'', promulgated by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950, the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s 1964 Decree on [[Ecumenism]], ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]],'' and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1984 post-synodal apostolic exhortation, ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]''.

In [[psychology]], '''''jamais vu''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|æ|m|eɪ|_|ˈ|v|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒa.mɛ.vy}}), a [[French language|French]] borrowing meaning "never seen", refers to the [[phenomenon]] of experiencing a situation that one recognizes in some fashion, but nonetheless seems very unfamiliar.

==Overview==
Often described as the opposite of ''[[déjà vu]]'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

''Jamais vu'' is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that he or she knows.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing [[Semantic satiation|or saying a specific word out loud]]. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if "there's no way it is an actual word".

The phenomenon is often grouped with ''[[déjà vu]]'' and [[tip of the tongue|''presque vu'', or ''tip of the tongue'']].

Theoretically, as seen below, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a person known by him or her for a false [[Look-alike|double]] or impostor. If the impostor is the sufferer himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]]; hence, ''jamais vus'' of oneself, or of the very "reality of reality", are termed [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]], respectively.

===Experiment===
A study by [[Chris Moulin]] of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of ''jamais vu'', such as beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic ''jamais vu''.&lt;ref name ="study" /&gt;

==Causes==
''Jamais vu'' can be caused by [[epileptic seizure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epilepsy.com/Epilepsy/seizure_simplepartial "Epilepsy and seizure information for patients and health professionals — Simple Partial Seizures", retrieved 2011-09-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==
*''[[Déjà vu]]'': having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced, has already been experienced in the past, whether it has actually happened or not. In French, this literally means 'already seen', though in usage it is basically equivalent to ''déjà vécu'', "already lived".
* ''[[Tip of the tongue|Presque vu]]'': almost, but not quite, remembering something. It is also referred to as ''tip of the tongue''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38472">In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], [[archetype]]s are highly developed elements of the [[collective unconscious]]. The existence of archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by using story, art, myths, religions, or dreams. [[Carl Jung]] understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from the collective unconscious and are the psychic counterpart of [[instinct]].&lt;ref name="FeistFeist"&gt;Feist J, Feist GJ, (2009) ''Theories of Personality'', New York New York; McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; They are inherited potentials which are actualized when they enter consciousness as images or manifest in behavior on interaction with the outside world.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"/&gt; They are autonomous and hidden forms which are transformed once they enter consciousness and are given particular expression by individuals and their cultures.

In theory, '''Jungian archetypes''' refer to unclear underlying forms or the ''archetypes-as-such'' from which emerge images and motifs such as the [[mother]], the child, the [[trickster]], and [[Flood myth|the flood]] among others. History, culture and personal context shape these manifest representations thereby giving them their specific content. These images and motifs are more precisely called ''archetypal images''. However it is common for the term ''archetype'' to be used interchangeably to refer to both ''archetypes-as-such'' and ''archetypal images''.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"&gt;Stevens, Anthony in "The archetypes" (Chapter 3.) Ed. Papadopoulos, Renos. The Handbook of Jungian Psychology (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:D369-platon.-L2-Ch8.png|thumb|150px|frameless|right|Jung's ideas on archetypes were based in part on Plato's Forms]]
Jung rejected the ''[[tabula rasa]]'' theory of human psychological development, believing instead that evolutionary pressures have individual predestinations manifested in archetypes. Jung first used the term ''primordial images'' to refer to what he would later term  "archetypes". Jung's idea of archetypes was based on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s categories, [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;Jung and the Post-Jungians, Andrew Samuels, Routledge (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  For Jung, "the archetype is the introspectively recognizable form of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' psychic orderedness".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Synchronicity'' (London 1985) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; "These images must be thought of as lacking in solid content, hence as unconscious. They only acquire solidity, influence, and eventual consciousness in the encounter with empirical facts."&lt;ref&gt;Jung 1928:Par. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The archetypes form a dynamic substratum common to all humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his own experience of life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events. Thus, while archetypes themselves may be conceived as a relative few innate nebulous forms, from these may arise innumerable images, symbols and patterns of behavior. While the emerging images and forms are apprehended consciously, the archetypes which inform them are elementary structures which are unconscious and impossible to apprehend.

Jung was fond of comparing the form of the archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given ''a priori''. The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.&lt;ref&gt;(CW 9, pt 1, para. 155)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early development==
[[File:Jung 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|left|200px|Carl Jung standing in front of Burghölzli clinic, Zurich 1909]]
The intuition that there was more to the psyche than individual experience possibly began in Jung's childhood. The very first dream he could remember was that of an underground phallic [[god]]. Later in life his research on [[psychotic]] patients in Burgholzli Hospital and his own self-analysis later supported his early intuition about the existence of universal psychic structures that underlie all human experience and behavior. Jung first referred to these as "primordial images" – a term he borrowed from [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Later in 1917 Jung called them "dominants of the collective unconscious."

It was not until 1919 that he first used the term "archetypes" in an essay titled "Instinct and the Unconscious". The first element in Greek `arche' signifies 'beginning, origin, cause, primal source principle', but it also signifies 'position of a leader, supreme rule and government' (in other words a kind of 'dominant'): the second element 'type' means 'blow and what is produced by a blow, the imprint of a coin ...form, image, prototype, model, order, and norm', ...in the figurative, modern sense, 'pattern underlying form, primordial form'.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Anthony Archetype Revisited: an Updated Natural History of the Self. Toronto, ON.: Inner City Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years Jung revised and broadened the concept of archetypes even further, conceiving of them as psycho-physical patterns existing in the universe, given specific expression by human consciousness and culture. Jung proposed that the archetype had a dual nature: it exists both in the psyche and in the world at large. He called this non-psychic aspect of the archetype the "psychoid" archetype.

Jung drew an analogy between the psyche and [[light]] on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The center of the visible light spectrum (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, which grades into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red end of the spectrum corresponds to the influence of biological [[instinct]], which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet.&lt;ref name=JungVol8par420&gt;Jung, C.G. (1947/1954/1960), ''Collected Works'' vol. 8, ''The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche'', pp. 187, 211–216 (¶384, 414–420). "Just as the 'psychic infra-red,' the biological instinctual psyche, gradually passes over into the physiology of the organism and thus merges with its chemical and physical conditions, so the 'psychic ultra-violet,' the archetype, describes a field which exhibits none of the peculiarities of the physiological and yet, in the last analysis, can no longer be regarded as psychic, although it manifests itself psychically."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of inorganic matter as well.

The archetype was not merely a psychic entity, but more fundamentally, a bridge to matter in general.&lt;ref name=JungVol8par420 /&gt; Jung used the term ''[[unus mundus]]'' to describe the unitary reality which he believed underlay all manifest [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]. He conceived archetypes to be the mediators of the ''unus mundus'', organizing not only ideas in the psyche, but also the fundamental principles of matter and energy in the physical world.

It was this psychoid aspect of the archetype that so impressed Nobel laureate physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Embracing Jung's concept, Pauli believed that the archetype provided a link between [[Event (philosophy)|physical events]] and the mind of the [[scientist]] who studied them. In doing so he echoed the position adopted by German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]]. Thus the archetypes that ordered our perceptions and ideas are themselves the product of an objective order that transcends both the human mind and the external world.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Processed SAM loki.jpg|thumb|The Norse trickster god [[Loki]] as depicted on an 18th-century [[Icelandic Manuscript, SÁM 66|Icelandic manuscript]]]]
Jung described '''archetypal events''': birth, death, separation from parents, initiation, marriage, the union of opposites; '''archetypal figures''': great mother, father, [[Child (archetype)|child]], [[devil]], [[god]], [[wise old man]], [[Wise Old Woman/Man|wise old woman]], the [[trickster]], the [[hero]]; and '''archetypal motifs''': the apocalypse, the deluge, the creation. Although the number of archetypes is limitless, there are a few particularly notable, recurring archetypal images, "the chief among them being" (according to Jung) "the ''shadow'', the ''wise old man'', the ''child'', the ''mother'' ... and her counterpart, the ''maiden'', and lastly the ''anima'' in man and the ''animus'' in woman".&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively he would speak of "the emergence of certain definite archetypes ... the shadow, the animal, the wise old man, the anima, the animus, the mother, the child".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Self in Jungian psychology|Self]] designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole.

The [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] is a representation of the personal unconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held by the conscious personality. Thus, the shadow often represents one's dark side, those aspects of oneself that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which one does not identify.&lt;ref name="Fordham 1985"&gt;Fordham, Michael Explorations Into the Self (library of Analytical Psychology) Karnac Books, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anima and animus|anima]] archetype appears in men and is his primordial image of woman. It represents the man's sexual expectation of women, but also is a symbol of a man's possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies. The [[Anima and animus|animus]] archetype is the analogous image of the masculine that occurs in women.

Any attempt to give an exhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.&lt;ref name="Fordham 1985"/&gt;

==Conceptual difficulties==
[[File:Usnisavijaya.jpg|thumb|left| Strictly speaking the goddess archetype is more properly called an archetypal image]]
Popular and new-age uses have often condensed the concept of archetypes into an enumeration of archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess, the wise man and so on. Such enumeration falls short of apprehending the fluid core concept. Strictly speaking, archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess and the wise man are not archetypes, but archetypal images which have crystallized out of the ''archetypes-as-such'': as Jung put it, "definite mythological images of motifs ... are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited", as opposed to their deeper, instinctual sources – "the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images'".&lt;ref name="Jung p. 57"&gt;Jung, "Approaching the Unconscious" in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the precise relationships between images such as, for example, "the fish" and its archetype were not adequately explained by Jung. Here the image of the fish is not strictly speaking an archetype. The "archetype of the fish" points to the ubiquitous existence of an innate "fish archetype" which gives rise to the fish image. In clarifying the contentious statement that fish archetypes are universal, [[Anthony Stevens (Jungian analyst)|Anthony Stevens]] explains that the ''archetype-as-such'' is at once an innate predisposition to form such an image and a preparation to encounter and respond appropriately to the creature ''per se''. This would explain the existence of snake and spider phobias, for example, in people living in urban environments where they have never encountered either creature.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"/&gt;

The confusion about the essential quality of archetypes can partly be attributed to Jung's own evolving ideas about them in his writings and his interchangeable use of the term "archetype" and "primordial image". Jung was also intent on retaining the raw and vital quality of archetypes as spontaneous outpourings of the unconscious and not to give their specific individual and cultural expressions a dry, rigorous, intellectually formulated meaning.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "Science and the unconscious", in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 386 and p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actualization and complexes==
Archetypes seek actualization within the context of an individual's environment and determine the degree of [[individuation]]. Jung also used the terms "evocation" and "constellation" to explain the process of actualization. Thus for example, the mother archetype is actualized in the mind of the child by the evoking of innate anticipations of the maternal archetype when the child is in the proximity of a maternal figure who corresponds closely enough to its archetypal template. This mother archetype is built into the personal unconscious of the child as a mother ''complex''. Complexes are functional units of the personal unconscious, in the same way that archetypes are units for the collective unconscious.

==Stages of life==
[[File:Sepik River initiation PNG 1975.JPG|right|thumb|150px| An initiation ceremony in Papua New Guinea]]
Archetypes are innate universal pre-conscious psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. The archetypes are components of the [[collective unconscious]] and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. Archetypes hold control of the human life cycle.

As we mature the archetypal plan unfolds through a programmed sequence which Jung called the stages of life. Each stage of life is mediated through a new set of archetypal imperatives which seek fulfillment in action. These may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.&lt;ref&gt;Papadopoulos, Renos ''The Handbook of Jungian Psychology'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"The archetype is a tendency to form such representations of a motif – representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern ... They are indeed an instinctive ''trend''".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, "Approaching the Unconscious" in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "the archetype of initiation is strongly activated to provide a meaningful transition ... with a '[[rite of passage]]' from one stage of life to the next":&lt;ref name="Rancour"&gt;Rancour, P. (2008). Using archetypes and transitions theory to help patients move from active treatment to survivorship. [[Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing]]., 12(6), 935-940. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson, "Ancient Myths and Modern Man", in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; such stages may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Anthony in "The Archetypes" (Chapter 3). Papadopoulos, Renos ed. (2006). The Handbook of Jungian Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General developments===
[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was an advocate of [[structuralism]] in [[anthropology]]. In his approach to the structure and meaning of myth, Levi-Strauss concluded that present phenomena are transformations of earlier structures or infrastructures: 'the structure of primitive thoughts is present in our minds'.

The concept of "social instincts" proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], the "faculties" of [[Henri Bergson]] and the [[isomorph]]s of gestalt psychologist [[Wolfgang Kohler]] are also arguably related to archetypes.

In his work in psycholinguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]] describes an unvarying pattern of language acquisition in children and termed it the [[language acquisition device]]. He refers to 'universals' and a distinction is drawn between 'formal' and 'substantive' universals similar to that between archetype as such (structure) and archetypal image.

[[Jean Piaget]] writes of 'schemata' which are innate and underpin perceptuo-motor activity and the acquisition of knowledge, and are able to draw the perceived environment into their orbit. They resemble archetypes by virtue of their innateness, their activity and their need for environmental correspondence.

===Ethology and attachment theory===
In ''Biological theory and the concept of archetypes'', [[Michael Fordham]] considered that innate release mechanisms in animals may be applicable to humans, especially in infancy. The stimuli which produce instinctive behaviour are selected from a wide field by an innate perceptual system and the behaviour is 'released'. Fordham drew a parallel between some of Lorenz's ethological observations on the hierarchical behaviour of wolves and the functioning of archetypes in infancy.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"&gt;Andrew Samuels, Jung and the Post-Jungians {{ISBN|0415059046}}, Routledge (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens (1982) suggests that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology shows us that each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour is taking place in the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Biology===
Stevens suggests that DNA itself can be inspected for the location and transmission of archetypes. As they are co-terminous with natural life they should be expected wherever life is found. He suggests that DNA is the replicable archetype of the species.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

Stein points out that all the various terms used to delineate the messengers – 'templates, genes, enzymes, hormones, catalysts, pheromones, social hormones' – are concepts similar to archetypes. He mentions archetypal figures which represent messengers such as Hermes, Prometheus or Christ. Continuing to base his arguments on a consideration of biological defence systems he says that it must operate in a whole range of specific circumstances, its agents must be able to go everywhere, the distribution of the agents must not upset the somatic status quo, and, in predisposed persons, the agents will attack the self.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
[[File:Melanie Klein 1952.jpg|thumb|140px|Melanie Klein]]
'''[[Melanie Klein]]:''' Melanie Klein's idea of [[Object relations theory#Unconscious Phantasy|unconscious phantasy]] is closely related to Jung's archetype, as both are composed of image and affect and are [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] patternings of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] whose contents are built from experience.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Lacan2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Jacques Lacan]] --&gt;
'''[[Jacques Lacan]]:''' Lacan went beyond the proposition that the unconscious is a structure that lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns the contents of the Imaginary in the same way that archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. If we take the example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt; Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;
[[File:WRBion.jpg|thumb|140px|Wilfred Bion]]
'''[[Wilfred Bion]]''': According to Bion, thoughts precede a thinking capacity. Thoughts in a small infant are indistinguishable from sensory data or unorganised emotion. Bion uses the term proto-thoughts for these early phenomena. Because of their connection to sensory data, proto-thoughts are concrete and self-contained (thoughts-in-themselves), not yet capable of symbolic representations or object relations. The thoughts then function as preconceptions – predisposing psychosomatic entities similar to archetypes. Support for this connection comes from the Kleinian analyst Money-Kyrle's observation that Bion's notion of preconceptions is the direct descendant of [[Theory of Forms|Plato's Ideas]].&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;
[[File:Sigmund Freud 1926.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Sigmund Freud]]
'''[[Sigmund Freud]]''': In the Introductory ''Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (1916-1917) Freud wrote: "There can be no doubt that the source [of the fantasies] lie in the instincts; but it still has to be explained why the same fantasies with the same content are created on every occasion. I am prepared with an answer that I know will seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] endowment". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that "like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child".&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

'''[[Robert Langs]]''': More recently, adaptive psychotherapist and psychoanalyst Robert Langs has used archetypal theory as a way of understanding the functioning of what he calls the "deep unconscious system".&lt;ref&gt;R Langs. ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. (London 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Langs' use of archetypes particularly pertains to issues associated with [[death anxiety (psychology)|death anxiety]], which Langs takes to be the root of psychic conflict. Like Jung, Langs thinks of archetypes as species-wide, deep unconscious factors.&lt;ref&gt;R Langs. ''Freud on a Precipice. How Freud's Fate pushed Psychoanalysis over the Edge''. (Lanham MD: 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
Rossi (1977) suggests that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, and that of the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

Henry (1977) alluded to Maclean's model of the tripartite brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older part of the brain and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion is that there was a time when emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There is an obvious parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Literary criticism===
[[Archetypal literary criticism]] argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works, and therefore, that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or concretized in recurring images, symbols, or patterns which may include motifs such as the quest or the heavenly ascent, recognizable character types such as the trickster or the hero, symbols such as the apple or snake, or images such as crucifixion (as in King Kong, or Bride of Frankenstein) are all already laden with meaning when employed in a particular work.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Psychology===
[[Archetypal psychology]] was developed by [[James Hillman]] in the second half of the 20th century.  Hillman trained at the Jung Institute and was its Director after graduation.  Archetypal psychology is in the Jungian tradition and most directly related to analytical [[psychology]] and [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory, yet departs radically. Archetypal [[psychology]] relativizes and deliteralizes the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and focuses on the psyche, or [[soul]], itself and the ''archai'', the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, "the fundamental fantasies that animate all life".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, in Hillman, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Archetypal psychology is a [[polytheistic]] [[psychology]], in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and [[myths]], [[gods]], [[goddesses]], [[demigods]], [[mortals]] and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. The ego is but one psychological [[fantasy]] within an assemblage of fantasies.

The main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Renaissance]], and Romantic ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers, alchemists, and psychologists include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the psyche – the soul.
Many archetypes have been used in treatment of psychological [[illnesses]].  Jung's first research was done with schizophrenics.    A current example is teaching young men or boys archetypes through using picture books to help with the development.&lt;ref&gt;Zambo, D. (2007). Using Picture Books to Provide Archetypes to Young Boys: Extending the Ideas of William Brozo. Reading Teacher, 61(2), 124. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.t.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition nurses treat patients through the use of archetypes.&lt;ref name="Rancour"/&gt; Archetype therapy offers a wide range of uses if applied correctly, and it is still being expanded in Jungian schools today.  With the list of archetypes being endless the healing possibilities are vast.

===Pedagogy===
[[Archetypal pedagogy]] was developed by [[Clifford Mayes]]. Mayes' work also aims at promoting what he calls [[archetypal reflectivity]] in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their [[pedagogical]] practices. More recently the [[Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator]] (PMAI), based on Jung's theories of both archetypes and personality types, has been used for pedagogical applications (not unlike the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]]).

==In popular culture==
Archetypes abound in contemporary films and literature as they have in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the collective unconscious that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart VoytiUa, Myth and the Movies, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In national trauma==
A contemporary definition is given by O'Brien (2017) as follows: "Archetypes are universal organizing themes or patterns that appear regardless of space, time, or person. Appearing in all existential realms and at all levels of systematic recursion, they are organized as themes in the unus mundus, which Jung (1970 Vol. 14. Mysterium coniunctionis. (1970), p. 505) described as “the potential world outside of time,” and are detectable through synchronicities".&lt;ref&gt;The Healing of Nations, Psychological Perspectives,2017, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[File:Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca trailer.jpg|thumb|200px|Hero: Rick Blaine in ''Casablanca'']]
|[[File:Jekyll-mansfield.jpg|thumb|120px|Shadow and Shapeshifter: Jekyll / Hyde]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
Contemporary cinema is a rich source of archetypal images, most commonly evidenced for instance in the hero archetype: the one who saves the day and is young and naive, like [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', or older and cynical, like [[Rick Blaine]] in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. The mentor archetype is a common character in all types of films. They can appear and disappear as needed, usually helping the hero in the beginning, and then letting them do the hard part on their own.  The mentor helps train, prepare, encourage and guide the hero. They are obvious in some films: [[Mr. Miyagi]] in ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Jiminy Cricket]] in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', [[Obi-Wan]], and later [[Yoda]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Shadow, one's darker side, often associated with the villain of numerous films and books, but can be internal as in ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''. The shapeshifter is the person who misleads the hero or who changes frequently and can be depicted quite literally e.g. The T-1000 robot in ''[[Terminator II]]''. The Trickster creates disruptions of the status quo, maybe childlike and help us see the absurdity in situations, provide comic relief; e.g. [[Yoda]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Brer Rabbit]]. The Child often innocent; could be someone childlike who needs protecting but may be imbued with special powers (e.g. E.T.). The Bad Father – often seen as a dictator type, or evil and cruel (e.g. Darth Vader in ''Star Wars''). The Bad Mother (e.g. ''[[Mommie Dearest]]''), along with evil stepmothers and wicked witches. The Bad Child; e.g., ''[[The Bad Seed]]'', ''[[The Omen]]''.

Jungian archetypes are heavily integrated into the personalities of the characters in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series of games. In ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]'', the characters with whom you form relationships, (in the game called "Social Links") which are each based on a particular archetype. They are formally differentiated by different [[tarot]] [[major arcana|arcana]], however the primary basis of the game's characterization originates from archetypes.

In marketing, an archetype is a genre to a brand, based upon symbolism. The idea behind using brand archetypes in marketing is to anchor the brand against an icon already embedded within the conscience and subconscious of humanity. In the minds of both the brand owner and the public, aligning with a brand archetype makes the brand easier to identify. Twelve archetypes have been proposed for use with branding: Sage, Innocent, Explorer, Ruler, Creator, Caregiver, Magician, Hero, Outlaw, Lover, Jester, and Regular Guy/Girl.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, M., &amp; Pearson, C. S. (2001). The hero and the outlaw: Building extraordinary brands through the power of archetypes. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Jung's staunchest critics have accused him of either mystical or metaphysical [[essentialism]]. Since archetypes are defined so vaguely and since archetypal images have been observed by many Jungians in a wide and essentially infinite variety of everyday phenomena, they are neither generalizable nor specific in a way that may be researched or demarcated with any kind of rigor. Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains of knowledge that seek to understand complex systems in an integrated manner.

Feminist critiques have focused on aspects of archetypal theory that are seen as being reductionistic and providing a stereotyped view of femininity and masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Toni Reed, Demon-Lovers and Their Victims in British Fiction, The University Press of Kentucky (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of archetypes is that seeing myths as universals tends to abstract them from the history of their actual creation, and their cultural context.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas|last2=Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title=Cultural Strategy |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics state that archetypes reduce cultural expressions to generic decontextualized concepts, stripped bare of their unique cultural context, reducing a complex reality into something "simple and easy to grasp".&lt;ref name=CultStrat /&gt; Other critics respond that archetypes do nothing more than to solidify the cultural prejudices of the myths interpreter – namely modern Westerners. Modern scholarship with its emphasis on power and politics have seen archetypes as a colonial device to level the specifics of individual cultures and their stories in the service of grand abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Frank, The Constant Fire: Beyond the Science vs. Religion Debate, 1st edition, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have accused him of a romanticised and prejudicial promotion of 'primitivism' through the medium of archetypal theory. Archetypal theory has been posited as being scientifically unfalsifiable and even questioned as to being a suitable domain of psychological and scientific enquiry. Jung mentions the demarcation between experimental and descriptive psychological study, seeing archetypal psychology as rooted by necessity in the latter camp, grounded as it was (to a degree) in clinical case-work.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. ShelburneMythos and Logos in the Thought of Carl Jung: The Theory of the Collective Unconscious in Scientific Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Jung's viewpoint was essentially subjectivist, he displayed a somewhat Neo-Kantian perspective of a skepticism for knowing things in themselves and a preference of inner experience over empirical data. This skepticism opened Jung up to the charge of countering materialism with another kind of reductionism, one that reduces everything to subjective psychological explanation and wooly quasi-mystical assertions.&lt;ref&gt;2006, English, Book, Illustrated edition:Beyond psyche : symbol and transcendence in C.G. Jung / Mark R. Gundry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Jungian criticism seeks to contextualise, expand and modify Jung's original discourse on archetypes. Michael Fordham is critical of tendencies to relate imagery produced by patients to historical parallels only, e.g. from alchemy, mythology or folklore. A patient who produces archetypal material with striking alchemical parallels runs the risk of becoming more divorced than before from his setting in contemporary life.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

'''Laws of [[Robotics]]''' are a set of laws, rules, or principles, which are intended as a fundamental framework to underpin the behavior of [[robot]]s designed to have a degree of [[autonomy]]. Robots of this degree of complexity do not yet exist, but they have been widely anticipated in [[science fiction]], [[movie|films]] and are a topic of active [[research and development]] in the fields of [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

The best known set of laws are [[Three Laws of Robotics|those written]] by [[Isaac Asimov]] in the 1940s, or based upon them, but other sets of laws have been proposed by researchers in the decades since then.

==Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics" ==

{{main|Three Laws of Robotics}}
The best known set of laws are [[Isaac Asimov]]'s "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]". These were introduced in his 1942 short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]", although they were foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws are:

# A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# A robot must obey the orders &lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt;{{sic|given it|expected=given to it|hide=y}}&lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt; by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=I, Robot|date=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his book ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', a zeroth law was introduced:
:0. A robot may not injure humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

Adaptations and extensions exist based upon this framework. As of 2011 they remain a "[[fictional device]]".&lt;ref name="revolution"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Jon|title=Ready for the robot revolution?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15146053|accessdate=2011-10-03|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPSRC / AHRC principles of robotics ==
In 2011, the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC) of [[Great Britain]] jointly published a set of five ethical "principles for designers, builders and users of robots" in the [[wikt:real world|real world]], along with seven "high-level messages" intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop:&lt;ref name="revolution" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of robotics:  Regulating Robots in the Real World|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/|publisher=[[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]]|accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winfield|first=Alan|title=Five roboethical principles – for humans|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028111.100-five-roboethical-principles--for-humans.htm|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans.
# Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.
# Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.
# Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.
# It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot.

The messages intended to be conveyed were:
# We believe robots have the potential to provide immense positive impact to society. We want to encourage responsible robot research.
# Bad practice hurts us all.
# Addressing obvious public concerns will help us all make progress.
# It is important to demonstrate that we, as roboticists, are committed to the best possible standards of practice.
# To understand the context and consequences of our research, we should work with experts from other disciplines, including: social sciences, law, philosophy and the arts.
# We should consider the ethics of transparency: are there limits to what should be openly available?
# When we see erroneous accounts in the press, we commit to take the time to contact the reporting journalists.
The EPSRC principles are broadly recognised as a useful starting point. In 2016 Tony Prescott organised workshop to revise these principles, e.g. to differentiate ethical from legal principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|last2=|first2=|date=2017|year=|title=Legal vs. ethical obligations – a comment on the EPSRC’s principles for robotics|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MLLLVE|journal=Connection Science|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1080/09540091.2016.1276516|via=|author=Müller, Vincent C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial development==
Another  comprehensive terminological codification for the legal assessment of the technological developments in the robotics industry has already begun mainly in Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;bcc.co.uk: Robot age poses ethical dilemma. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6425927.stm Link]&lt;/ref&gt; This progress represents a contemporary reinterpretation of the law (and ethics) in the field of robotics, an interpretation that assumes a rethinking of traditional legal constellations. These include primarily legal liability issues in civil and criminal law.

== Satya Nadella's laws ==
In June 2016, [[Satya Nadella]], a CEO of [[Microsoft Corporation]] at the time, had an interview with the ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine and roughly sketched five rules for artificial intelligences to be observed by their designers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/06/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_humans_and_a_i_can_work_together_to_solve_society.html|title=The Partnership of the Future|last=Nadella|first=Satya|date=2016-06-28|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/29/12057516/satya-nadella-ai-robot-laws|title=Satya Nadella's rules for AI are more boring (and relevant) than Asimov's Three Laws|last=Vincent|first=James|date=2016-06-29|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "A.I. must be designed to assist humanity" meaning human autonomy needs to be respected.
# "A.I. must be transparent" meaning that humans should know and be able to understand how they work.
# "A.I. must maximize efficiencies without destroying the dignity of people".
# "A.I. must be designed for intelligent privacy" meaning that it earns trust through guarding their information.
# "A.I. must have algorithmic accountability so that humans can undo unintended harm".
# "A.I. must guard against bias" so that they must not discriminate against people.

==Tilden's "Laws of Robotics" ==
[[Mark W. Tilden]] is a robotics physicist who was a pioneer in developing simple robotics.&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.09/tilden.html?pg=1&amp;topic= | work=Wired | first=Fred | last=Hapgood | title=Chaotic Robotics | issue = 2.09 | date = September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; His three guiding principles/rules for robots are:&lt;ref name=wired1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Dunn. "[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/0605surf.html Machine Intelligence, Part II: From Bumper Cars to Electronic Minds]" ''[[The New York Times]]'' 5 June 1996. Retrieved 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://makezine.com/06/beam/ makezine.com: A Beginner's Guide to BEAM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] (Most of the article is subscription-only content.)&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''A robot must protect its existence at all costs.''
# ''A robot must obtain and maintain access to its own power source.''
# ''A robot must continually search for better power sources.''

What is notable in these three rules is that these are basically rules for "wild" life, so in essence what Tilden stated is that what he wanted was "proctoring a silicon species into sentience, but with full control over the specs. Not plant. Not animal. Something else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.09/tilden.html?pg=2&amp;topic= | work=Wired | first=Fred | last=Hapgood | title=Chaotic Robotics (continued) | issue = 2.09 | date = September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in an online music scene who rearrange spliced parts of musical pieces form '''mashup culture'''. The audio-files are normally in [[MP3]] format and spliced with audio-editing software online. The new, edited song is called mashup.&lt;ref name=Shiga&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiga |first=J. |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |title=Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture. |url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/courses/2011/488/1-Readings/Shiga%20Logic%20of%20Mash-up%20culture.pdf |journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication |publisher= |volume= 24|issue= 2|pages= 93–114|doi=10.1080/07393180701262685 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression mashup culture is also strongly connected to [[Mashup (music)|mashup in music]]. Even though it is originally not a political community, the producer of mash-up music are related to the issue of [[copyright]]. Mashup Culture is even regarded as "a response to larger technological, institutional, and social contexts".&lt;ref name=Serazio&gt;{{cite journal |last=Serazio|first=Michael  |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=The Apolitical Irony of Generation Mash-Up: A Cultural Case Study in Popular Music |url=http://mediaediting.wikispaces.asu.edu/file/view/28552270.pdf |journal=Popular Music and Society |publisher= |volume= 31|issue= 1|pages= |doi=10.1080/03007760701214815 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of mashup culture in general can be dated back to the beginnings of [[dada]] and [[conceptual art]]. Artists such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] were the first to introduce already existing objects, which they rearranged and combined in [[collage]]s, to the world of higher art.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/22/from-artistic-to-technological-mash-up/ |title=Temixing Culture And Why The Art Of The Mash-Up Matters |last1=Murray |first1=Ben. |last2= |first2= |date= 22 March 2015|website=Tech Crunch |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These artists believed that even though certain [[cultural artifact|artifacts]] were ascribed a certain meaning, this meaning could be altered through rearranging them and putting them into a new context. However, it was still quite a long way to the beginning of mashup culture in music. From the early 2000s on, music was more and more distributed through the internet. With the introduction of MP3 audio files, it became much easier to access and download music. Not only could music be accessed easier, it could also be transformed and mixed in ways that were not possible before. Especially for younger people, this new gained freedom when it came to the accessibility of [[audio file format|audio files]] lead to the development of a new form of cult around the transformation of musical pieces.&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt; This "reworking MP3 recordings pulled from the Internet" was turning into more than just a fashion just as "the Internet is more than just a means of distribution, it becomes a ''raison d’eˆtre'' for a culture based on audio data’’ states Alistair Riddell in 2001.&lt;ref name=Riddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddell|first=Michael  |last2=Alistair  |first2= |date=2001|title=Data Culture Generation. After Content, Process as Aesthetic |url=http://www.rem.ufpr.br/_REM/REMv6/Riddell/Riddell.htm |journal=Leonardo |publisher= |volume= 34|issue= 4|pages=337–343 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, the first versions of mashup music were published, sometimes not under the term ''mashup'' but under the name of "[[bootleg recording|creative bootleg]]" or "[[bastard pop]]".&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt;&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt; Even though the creation of a new song by combining at least two samples of different songs was also used in other music styles such as [[Hip Hop]] before,&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt; it was only with the rise of the MP3 audio file along with easy-to-use computer mash-up programs that mash-up was transformed into an own culture as such. Especially [[peer-to-peer]] sharing was contributing to this phenomenon: People who create mashup music can easily distribute it and share it with other people through online programs.&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt;

== Forms of mashup culture ==

Mashup culture is motivated by a number of different factors.

=== Statement of art ===
Mashup culture is sometimes regarded as a cultural movement against common, existing music that is published by the music industry. In 2002, a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article described the mashup of songs as a strategy of Londoner [[disc jockey|DJs]] to transform music they considered bad into something they could appreciate and were willing to listen to.&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt; Even though mashup culture has its origin in online communities, it entered a more art-related realm. It is art used as a statement against the content music industry provides.&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt;

=== Political statement ===
It can even be considered as a political statement against copyright laws and restrictions imposed by the [[government]] as well. "Reframing of the original narrative" is regarded as a way to create a new and unique product which leads to a "fresh perspective" of the original.&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt;
Murray states "there’s the question of the kind of Internet we want moving forward – one increasingly controlled by corporate [[gatekeepers]] who get to sanction what creative expression looks like, or one in which the freedom of this expression is valued above share price". Copyright issues have always been limiting the possibilities of mashup culture. Those implications by law have led to the problem of [[copyright infringement|online piracy]].&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt; Mashups are often created with illegally acquired content. This closeness to illegality has become part of this culture. "In some cases, the illegality of piracy contributes to the appeal of unauthorized copies online" states Shiga in her article [https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/courses/2011/488/1-Readings/Shiga%20Logic%20of%20Mash-up%20culture.pdf Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture]. Even though copyright laws were intentionally supposed to stop illegal downloads, they contributed to the appeal of mashup and to the culture existing around it.

=== Do-it-yourself culture ===
Another important aspect of the success of mashup culture nowadays lies in the [[do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] or DIY trend. Consumers are turning into producers as well, especially due to the simplification of online tools that help creating personalized content.

{{cquote|The audience is taking on a DIY spirit, each masher becoming a mini-Burroughs, cutting the music and pasting it on a blank sheet of MP3|author=Serazio&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt;}}

== Mashup in current literature ==

=== DJ Spooky ===

Paul D. Miller, also known as [[DJ Spooky]], published a book about how mashup culture transforms our society. In ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'', he investigates "the nature of that transformation" stating that "rapid advances in technology [that] have transformed art and communication".&lt;ref name=Weidenbaum&gt;Weidenbaum 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He describes [[sample (music)|sampling]] as an essential part of our society. The book was published by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Press and highly recognized by scholars such as [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref name=Weidenbaum /&gt;

'''Microscopic traffic flow models''' are a class of [[Scientific modeling|scientific models]] of [[traffic flow|vehicular traffic dynamics]].

In contrast to [[Macroscopic traffic flow model|macroscopic models]], microscopic traffic flow models simulate single vehicle-driver units, so the dynamic variables of the models represent microscopic properties like the position and velocity of single vehicles.

==Car-following models==
Also known as ''time-continuous models'', all car-following models have in common that they are defined by [[ordinary differential equations]] describing the complete dynamics of the vehicles' positions &lt;math&gt;x_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and velocities &lt;math&gt;v_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. It is assumed that the input stimuli of the drivers are restricted to their own velocity &lt;math&gt;v_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the net distance (bumper-to-bumper distance) &lt;math&gt;s_\alpha = x_{\alpha-1} - x_\alpha - l_{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the leading vehicle &lt;math&gt;\alpha-1&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;l_{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vehicle length), and the velocity &lt;math&gt;v_{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; of the leading vehicle. The [[equation of motion]] of each vehicle is characterized by an acceleration function that depends on those input stimuli:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_\alpha(t) = \dot{v}_\alpha(t) = F(v_\alpha(t), s_\alpha(t), v_{\alpha-1}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the driving behavior of a single driver-vehicle unit &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; might not merely depend on the immediate leader &lt;math&gt;\alpha-1&lt;/math&gt; but on the &lt;math&gt;n_a&lt;/math&gt; vehicles in front. The equation of motion in this more generalized form reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v}_\alpha(t) = f(x_\alpha(t), v_\alpha(t), x_{\alpha-1}(t), v_{\alpha-1}(t), \ldots, x_{\alpha-n_a}(t), v_{\alpha-n_a}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples of car-following models===
* [[Optimal velocity model]] (OVM)
* [[Velocity difference model]] (VDIFF)
* [[VISSIM|Wiedemann model]] (1974)
* [[Intelligent driver model]] (IDM, 1999)
** [http://volkhin.com/RoadTrafficSimulator/ RoadTrafficSimulator - visualization of the model]
* [[Gipps' model]] (Gipps, 1981)

==Cellular automaton models==
[[Cellular automaton]] (CA) models use integer variables to describe the dynamical properties of the system. The road is divided into sections of a certain length &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and the time is [[discretization|discretized]] to steps of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. Each road section can either be occupied by a vehicle or empty and the dynamics are given by update rules of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\alpha^{t+1} = f(s_\alpha^t, v_\alpha^t, v_{\alpha-1}^t, \ldots)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_\alpha^{t+1} = x_\alpha^t + v_\alpha^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;

(the simulation time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is measured in units of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and the vehicle positions &lt;math&gt;x_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in units of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;).

The time scale is typically given by the reaction time of a human driver, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = 1 \text{s}&lt;/math&gt;. With &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; fixed, the length of the road sections determines the granularity of the model. At a complete standstill, the average road length occupied by one vehicle is approximately 7.5 meters. Setting &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; to this value leads to a model where one vehicle always occupies exactly one section of the road and a velocity of 5 corresponds to &lt;math&gt;5 \Delta x/\Delta t = 135 \text{km/h}&lt;/math&gt;, which is then set to be the maximum velocity a driver wants to drive at. However, in such a model, the smallest possible acceleration would be &lt;math&gt;\Delta x/(\Delta t)^2 = 7.5 \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt; which is unrealistic. Therefore, many modern CA models use a finer spatial discretization, for example &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1.5 \text{m}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a smallest possible acceleration of &lt;math&gt;1.5 \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Although cellular automaton models lack the accuracy of the time-continuous car-following models, they still have the ability to reproduce a wide range of traffic phenomena. Due to the simplicity of the models, they are numerically very efficient and can be used to simulate large road networks in realtime or even faster.

===Examples of CA models===
* [[Rule 184]]
* [[Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model]]
* [[Nagel–Schreckenberg model]] (NaSch, 1992)

'''Moralism''' is a philosophy that arose in the 19th century that concerns itself with imbuing society with a certain set of [[moral]]s, usually traditional behaviour, but also "justice, freedom, and equality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theissen |first1=Gerd |title=The Bible And Contemporary Culture |date=2007 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=9781451408607 |page=147 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has strongly affected American and British culture, concerning private issues such as the family unit and sexuality, as well as issues that carry over into the public square, such as the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref name="KingemannFuchsZielonka2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klingemann |first1=Hans-Dieter |last2=Fuchs |first2=Dieter |last3=Zielonka |first3=Jan |title=Democracy and Political Culture in Eastern Europe |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134170418 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In tracing the origins of moralism, sociologist Malcolm Waters writes that "Moralism emerged from a clash between the unrestrained character of frontier expansionism, a middle-class, Protestant emphasis on respectability cultivated in small-town America and an egalitarian and anti-intellectual evangelism among splinter Protestant groups."&lt;ref name="Walters2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Malcolm |title=Daniel Bell |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134845576 |page=73 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the issues of [[Abolitionism|abolition]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] formed the "twin pillars" of moralism, becoming popular through Christian Churches in the United States, both [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="Welter2011"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Welter |first1=Brian |title=Philosophy professor finds both Christians, secularists lacking |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2011/philosophy-professor-finds-both-christians-secularists-lacking.cfm |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |language=English|date=6 May 2011|quote=In many essays, Taylor shows how this excessive moralism in both the Protestant and Catholic churches from the 17th century onward led to a "polite" Christian society where being polite was more important than being Christian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robins |first1=R. G. |title=A. J. Tomlinson: Plainfolk Modernist |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199883172 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moralism as promoted by some Christian denominations, such as the [[Quakers]], manifested in wide support for [[abolitionism]] and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=James Emmett |title=Imaginary Friends: Representing Quakers in American Culture, 1650-1950 |date=2009 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299231743 |pages=51 |language=English|quote=Still operating at the margins of American religious discourse, Quaker civic moralism would see its legitimacy in the public sphere grow as increasing numbers of American citizens grew sympathetic with the Unionist and abolitionist causes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rise of [[postmillennialism]] in the 19th century "encouraged a general culture of Protestant moralism and pushed it toward a series of social reform movements, from antislavery and abolitionism (freedom for the slaves now), to protests against Indian Removal, to antiwar and peace efforts, to women's rights, to temperance work before and after the Civil War."&lt;ref name="BrekusGilpin2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brekus |first1=Catherine A. |first2=W. Clark | last2 =Gilpin |title=American Christianities: A History of Dominance and Diversity |date=2011 |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |isbn=9780807869147 |page=50 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the campaign for [[women's suffrage]], evidenced by the ethos of organisations such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), was highly driven by the moralism of that era.&lt;ref name="Delany2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delany |first1=Sheila |title=Writing Woman: Sex, Class and Literature, Medieval and Modern |date=2007 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781556354434 |pages=11 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of 20th century, as well as the 21st century, moralists in the United States turned their attention to championing the [[pro-life movement]].&lt;ref name="KingemannFuchsZielonka2006"/&gt; Moralists have also focused their efforts in maintaining [[blue laws]], such as those that discourage [[Sunday shopping]], in accordance with [[first-day Sabbatarian]] beliefs that resonate with the sensibilities of labourers and trade unions.&lt;ref name="Steinfels2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinfels |first1=Peter |title=The Neoconservatives: The Origins of a Movement: With a New Foreword, From Dissent to Political Power |date=2013 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781476729701 |page=37 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phubbing''' is a term coined as part of a campaign by ''Macquarie Dictionary'' to describe the habit of snubbing someone in favour of a [[mobile phone]]. In May 2012, the advertising agency behind the campaign, McCann, had invited a number of lexicographers, authors, and poets to coin a [[neologism]] to describe the behaviour. The word "phubbing" was first described by McCann Group Account Director Adrian Mills, who was working with [[David Astle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4FLTM82VcI |title= The first use of the word phubbing |publisher= YouTube |date= 2017-01-03 |accessdate= 2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has appeared in media around the world and was popularized by the Stop Phubbing campaign created by McCann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stopphubbing.com/ |title=Stop Phubbing |publisher= Stop Phubbing |date= |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stop Phubbing campaign==
The Stop Phubbing campaign site, and related [[Facebook]] page, was part of an elaborate public relations effort designed to promote the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pathak |first= Shareen |url= http://adage.com/article/news/mccann-melbourne-made-a-word-sell-a-dictionary/244595/ |title= McCann Melbourne Made Up a Word to Sell a Dictionary &amp;#124; News - Advertising Age |publisher= Adage.com |date= 2013-10-07 |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the media, the website was originally credited by an Australian college student named Alex Haigh, who had been interning at McCann and was subsequently hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Chatfield |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/the-rise-of-phubbing--aka-phone-snubbing-8747229.html |title= The rise of phubbing - aka phone snubbing - Features - Gadgets &amp; Tech |publisher= The Independent |date= 2013-08-05 |accessdate= 2013-10-12 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film, titled ''A Word is Born'', describes the entire process and serves as an advertisement for the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSOfuUYCV_0 |title= Phubbing: A Word is Born |publisher= YouTube |date= 2013-10-08 |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phubbing in the media==
The campaign was picked up by numerous media outlets, notably those in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mexico]], and [[Germany]]. The press reported on surveys showing statistics of the number of the people "phubbing", and published [[etiquette]] guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10304653/The-15-most-annoying-things-about-iPhones.html |title=The 15 most annoying things about iPhones |publisher=Telegraph |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-10-12 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |url=http://techland.time.com/2013/08/06/why-the-stop-phubbing-campaign-is-going-viral/#ixzz2d3mMXCFM |title=Why the ‘Stop Phubbing’ Campaign Is Going Viral &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Techland.time.com |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In October 2015, media outlets (such as [[Today (U.S. TV program)|TODAY]]&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/health/does-he-love-his-cellphone-more-you-survey-t47046|title=Does your partner love his cellphone more than you?

Roberts, professor of marketing at [[Baylor University]] Hankamer School of Business, that was published in the journal "Computers In Human Behavior". The study consisted of two separate surveys of more than 450 U.S. adults to learn the relational effects of "phubbing" or partner phubbing. The survey found that 46.3 percent of respondents said their partners phubbed them, and 22.6 percent said it caused issues in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; In an interview with [[Yahoo!]] Health, Roberts said, "We found that the ones that reported higher partner phubbing fought more with their partner and were less satisfied with their relationship than those who reported less phubbing."&lt;ref name="Digital"/&gt;

'''Powergaming''' (or '''power gaming''') is a style of interacting with [[game]]s or game-like systems, particularly [[video game]]s, [[boardgame]]s, and [[role-playing game|role-playing games]], with the aim of maximising progress towards a specific goal, to the exclusion of other considerations such as  storytelling, atmosphere and camaraderie.  Due to its focus on the letter of the rules over the spirit of the rules, it is often seen as [[sportsmanship|unsporting]], un-fun, or unsociable. This behaviour is most often found in games with a wide range of game features, lengthy campaigns or prize tournaments such as [[mmorpg|massively multiplayer]] or [[collectible card games|collectible]] games.&lt;ref name="taylor-fun" /&gt; Those wishing to discuss the behavior without pejorative connotation may use the neutral term '''optimization'''.

== Description ==
Powergaming in roleplaying games can take several forms.  One form is the deliberate creation of optimal [[player characters]] (PCs), with the aim of maximising the power the player wields in the game world.  This is known as [[min-maxing]], due to the practice of maximising desirable or "powerful" traits while minimising underpowered or unuseful traits.  Such characters often draw criticism for not fitting the theme and tone of the game world or for being difficult to challenge.  Another form of powergaming involves a focus on acquiring power during game progression, often by acquiring powerful equipment or unusual abilities.  This lends itself to gameplay which is materialistic (and often, in the context of the game world, arguably amoral) and can frustrate other players who are looking to interact with the game world, score points, and not merely acquire game resources.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Simbalist &amp; [[Wilf Backhaus]] ''Chivalry and Sorcery'' (1983) p.10 ''3.03 Power Gaming''&lt;/ref&gt;  Another term for a powergamer is a '''munchkin''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Games' Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Players, Pawns, and Power-Ups|last1=Rome|first1=Ben H.|last2=Hussey|first2=Chris|publisher=[[Potomac Books]]|year=2013|isbn=9781597977234|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkzIlfDpclkC&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt; who may be differentiated from normal powergamers to describe players who seek to acquire power and loot at the expense their teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leaving Mundania|last=Stark|first=Lizzie|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9781613740675|page=238|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMqY7X322W8C&amp;pg=PA238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[online text-based role-playing game]]s that emphasize collaborative [[role-play]] over acquiring levels or skills, a player can be described as a powergamer if he or she presumes or declares that his or her own action against another player character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on his or her own prerogative. They may also be a player who tries to force others to participate in unwanted role-playing.  For instance, a player who unilaterally describes his character as doing something with (or to) another character that would usually require the other to play along &amp;mdash; such as having a fight or a sexual encounter &amp;mdash; is considered to be powergaming.&lt;ref name="benediktciskowski" /&gt; In such games, in which a sense of community and rapport between players is seen as crucial and conducive to the game's overall well-being, powergaming is generally regarded as extremely offensive behaviour if it is not stated in the rules as being a bannable offense. It is often seen as synonymous with [[twinking]] or ''godmoding''.

In video games, powergamers enjoy being at the bleeding edge of progression of their selected game, taking part in every activity that yields the fastest progression, and bypassing the "lesser" activities or any other secondary job/trait/skill.&lt;ref name="taylor-play" /&gt; This is a wide generalization however. A gamer that likes to maximise all aspects of the game and do so in an expedient manner is also classified as a powergamer, often seeing more of the world than the "average" player would.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4554">'''Reservation''' (or '''reserve''') '''price''' is a limit on the [[price]] of a [[good (economics)|good]] or a [[service (economics)|service]]. On the [[demand]] side, it is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay; on the [[supply (economics)|supply]] side, it is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a good or service. Reservation prices are commonly used in [[auction]]s, but the concept is extended beyond.

== Description ==
In [[microeconomics]], consumers set their reservation price as the highest price that they are willing to pay for goods or [[service (economics)|a service]], while seller set the smallest price at which they would sell. Similarly, in [[finance]], the reservation price—also called the [[indifference price]]—is the value at which an investor would be willing to buy (or sell) a [[security (finance)|financial security]] given his or her particular [[utility function]].

Reservation prices are commonly used in [[auction]]s, where the seller may or may not make it known what the lowest acceptable price is. Buyers—especially if by proxy—may have their own reservation price at which they are unwilling to further bid. This can be seen as the "walk away" point for either party, in [[negotiation]] where the reservation price is the point beyond which a negotiator is ready to walk away from a negotiated agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negotiations.com/definition/reservation-price/|title=Reservation Price|work=negotiations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A seller may produce a '''reservation demand''', which is a schedule of reservation prices at which a seller would be willing to sell different quantities of a particular good.

== Analysis ==
Reservation prices vary for the buyers and sellers according to their [[disposable income]], their desire for—or to sell—the good, and knowledge of information about [[substitute good]]s. A reservation price can be used to help calculate the [[consumer surplus]] or the [[producer surplus]] with reference to the [[equilibrium price]].

== Auction theory ==
In the basic model of optimal auction design developed by [[Roger Myerson]] (1981), the optimal reservation price (i.e., the smallest admissible bid) is independent of the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B.|date=1981|title=Optimal Auction Design|url=https://doi.org/10.1287/moor.6.1.58|journal=Mathematics of Operations Research|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=58–73|doi=10.1287/moor.6.1.58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myerson assumes that the bidders have private independent values (i.e., each bidder’s valuation of the object to be auctioned off is a realization of a random variable observed only by the bidder, and the random variables are stochastically independent). For example, if every bidder’s valuation is drawn independently from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,100], then the optimal reservation price is 50. According to traditional economic theory, the optimal reservation price results from balancing two opposing effects. First, a higher reservation price is desirable for the seller since it deters bidders from falsely claiming that they have only a small valuation. Second, a higher reservation price is undesirable for the seller since it deters bidders with truly small valuations from participating in the auction. According to behavioral economic theory, a reservation price may also have additional effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kőszegi|first=Botond|date=2014|title=Behavioral Contract Theory|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.52.4.1075|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1075–1118|doi=10.1257/jel.52.4.1075|issn=0022-0515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have argued that a reservation price can serve as a reference point when bidders have preferences as studied in [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2007|title=Reserve Prices in Auctions as Reference Points|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02044.x|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=117|issue=520|pages=637–653|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02044.x|issn=1468-0297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Julius Herrnstein''' (May 20, 1930 – September 13, 1994) was an American psychologist and sociologist. He was an active researcher in animal learning in the [[BF Skinner|Skinnerian]] tradition. He was one of the founders of the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].

==Early life and education==
Richard Herrnstein was born on 20 May 1930, in New York City, to a family of Jewish Hungarian immigrants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Ohles|editor-first1=Frederik |editor-last2=Ohles|editor-first2=Shirley M.  |editor-last3= Ramsay |editor-first3= John G. |title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern American Educators |place=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1997 |pages=154–155 |chapter=Herrnstein, Richard Julius |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PBj5-zHEMvoC&amp;pg=PA154 |isbn=9780313291333}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Flora Irene (née Friedman) and Rezso Herrnstein, a housepainter.&lt;ref name="SEAL"/&gt; He was educated at the [[High School of Music &amp; Art]] and the [[City College of New York]], receiving a B.A. from the latter in 1952. In 1955, Herrnstein obtained his Ph.D. at [[Harvard University]], with a thesis titled ''Behavioral Consequences of the Removal of a Discriminative Stimulus Associated with Variable-Interval Reinforcement''.&lt;ref name="SEAL"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Nancy M. |editor-last=Jackson |editor-first=Kenneth T. |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives |place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=2001 |pages=240–241 |chapter=Herrnstein, Richard Julius |chapter-url= https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herrnstein-richard-julius |volume=4|isbn=9780684806440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewprom.50webs.com/JewPromSite_files/sheet018.htm|title=Jewish Members of American Academy of Arts and Sciences|website=JewProm|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
His major research finding as an experimental psychologist is the [[matching law]], the tendency of animals to allocate their choices in direct proportion to the rewards they provide. To illustrate the phenomenon, if there are two sources of reward, one of which is twice as rich as the other, Herrnstein found that animals often chose at twice the frequency the alternative that was seemingly twice as valuable. That is known as  matching, both in quantitative analysis of behavior and [[mathematical psychology]]. He also developed [[melioration theory]] with William Vaughan, Jr.

He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] and worked with Skinner in the Harvard pigeon lab, where he did research on choice behavior and [[behavioral economics]]. In 1965, and with [[Edwin Boring]], Herrnstein wrote ''A Source Book in the History of Psychology''.

===Intelligence===
Herrnstein's research focused first on natural concepts and [[human intelligence]] in the 1970s, and peaked in prolificacy with the publication of his and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray's]] controversial best-selling book, ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Herrnstein died of cancer shortly before the book was released.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Five levels of classification capacities: discrimination, rote, open-ended categorization, concepts, and abstract relations (Herrnstein, 1990).

== Matching law ==
{{further|Matching law}}
Perhaps his most notable accomplishment was the formulation of the matching law: choices are distributed according to rates of reinforcement for making the choices. An instance for two choices can be stated mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_1 + r_2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are rates of response for two alternative responses, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are rates of reinforcement for the same two responses. Behavior conforming to this law is matching, and explanations of matching and of departures from matching are a large and important part of the literature on behavioral choice.

==Personal life==
Herrnstein married his first wife, Barbara Brodo, on 28 May 1951. The couple had a daughter together, Julia, before their divorce in February 1961. Through his second marriage to Susan Chalk Gouinlock, on 11 November 1961, he fathered two sons named Max and James.&lt;ref name="SEAL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/obituaries/richard-herrnstein-64-dies-backed-nature-over-nurture.html|title=Richard Herrnstein, 64, Dies; Backed Nature Over Nurture|work=The New York Times|date=16 September 1994|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolfing''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɔː|l|f|ɪ|ŋ|,_|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|-}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rolfing "Rolfing"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[alternative medicine]] originally developed by [[Ida Rolf]] (1896–1979) as '''Structural Integration'''.&lt;ref name=recipe1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherman KJ, Dixon MW, Thompson D, Cherkin DC |title=Development of a taxonomy to describe massage treatments for musculoskeletal pain |journal=BMC Complement Altern Med |volume=6 |issue= |pages=24 |year=2006 |pmid=16796753 |pmc=1544351 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-6-24 |type=Review |quote=Some massage styles with different names may be essentially the same (e.g., Structural Integration and Rolfing®)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically delivered as a series of ten hands-on physical manipulation sessions sometimes called "the recipe". It is based on Rolf's ideas about how the human body's "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy field]]" can benefit when aligned with the Earth's [[gravitational field]].&lt;ref name=gospel&gt;{{cite book|author=Ida P. Rolf, Ph.D.|title=Rolfing and Physical Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sndnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=1 November 1990|orig-year=1978|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-1-62055-338-1|page=31|quote="This is the gospel of Rolfing: When the body gets working appropriately, the force of gravity can flow through.

The principles of Rolfing contradict established medical knowledge,&lt;ref name=clow/&gt; and there is no good evidence Rolfing is effective for the treatment of any health condition.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; It is recognized as a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref name= "pop"&gt;{{citation |author=Cordón, LA |work=Popular Psychology: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uy1gmwcAgg4C&amp;pg=PA218 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-32457-4 |pages=217–218 |title=Rolfing }}: "The idea of vital energy... does not correspond to known facts of how the human body operates.  Similarly, there is absolutely no support in psychological literature for the idea of traumatic experiences being repressed in the form of muscle memory, and so the basic ideas of Rolfing certainly fall into the category of pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt; and has been characterized as [[quackery]].&lt;ref name="agin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2010"/&gt; It is not known whether Rolfing is safe or cost-effective.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;&lt;ref name=barden/&gt;

== Conceptual basis ==
[[Ida Rolf]] described the body as organized around an axis perpendicular to the earth, parallel to the pull of gravity, and she believed the function of the body was optimal when it was organized in that way. She saw the body as continually in a struggle with gravity; in her view, gravity tends to shorten [[fascia]], leading to disorder of the body's arrangement around its axis and creating imbalance, inefficiency in movement, and pain.&lt;ref name="Houglum"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Therapeutic Exercise for Musculoskeletal Injuries|last=Houglum|first=Peggy|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2016|isbn=9780736075954|edition=4th|location=|pages=432–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVcvDAAAQBAJ|quote=Dr. Rolf based her techniques on the realization that fascia surrounded all tissue and body structures, so it also influenced those tissues and structures when it is modified. She observed that the body centers on a vertical line of pull created by gravity. It was her theory that the body is most efficient and healthy when it can function in an aligned and balanced arrangement. With gravity's continuing pull, stresses and injuries occur to pull the body out of its normal alignment; imbalance occurs and causes the body to become painful, malaligned, and inefficient. Rolf's philosophy and techniques focus on improving the body's posture so all functions including breathing, flexibility, strength, and coordination are optimally efficient.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfers aim to lengthen the fascia in order to restore the body's arrangement around its axis and facilitate improved movement.&lt;ref name="Houglum"/&gt;  Rolf also discussed this in terms of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]" and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rolfers make a life study of relating bodies and their fields to the earth and its gravity field, and we so organize the body [so] that the gravity field can reinforce the body's energy field. This is our primary concept.&lt;ref name=rolf1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Rolf|first=Ida P.|title=Rolfing and Physical Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sndnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|year=1990|orig-year=1978|publisher=Healing Arts Press|isbn=978-1-62055-338-1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On its website as of August 2016, the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration described Rolfing as "a form of bodywork that reorganizes the connective tissues, called fascia, that permeate the entire body."&lt;ref name=broc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rolf.org/rolfingreg.php |title=What is Rolfing® Structural Integration? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Rolf Institute of Structural Integration |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160328160654/http://www.rolf.org/rolfingreg.php |archivedate=2016-03-28 |dead-url=no |access-date=2016-07-13|quote="Named after its founder, Dr. Ida P. Rolf, Rolfing Structural Integration is a form of bodywork that reorganizes the connective tissues, called fascia, that permeate the entire body."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manipulation is sometimes referred to as a type of [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], or as a type of [[massage]].&lt;ref name="Sherman"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Levine"&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 209–234 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Cassar"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cassar |first= Mario-Paul |year= 2004 |title= Handbook of Clinical Massage: A Complete Guide for Students and Practitioners |edition= 2nd |publisher= [[Churchill Livingstone]] |pages= 48–49 |isbn= 9780443073496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Mental"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://librarum.org/book/22665/154|title=The Gale Encyclopedia Of Mental Disorders|last=|first=|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|year=2003|isbn=9780787657697|editor1-last=Thackery|editor1-first=Ellyn|location=|page=[http://librarum.org/book/22665/154 153–7]|pages=|editor2-last=Harris|editor2-first=Madeline|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050455/http://librarum.org/book/22665/154|archive-date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some osteopaths were influenced by Rolf,&lt;ref name=riggs&gt;{{cite book |editor= Stillerman E |date= 2016 |edition= 2nd |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher=Elsevier |pages= 152 |isbn= 0323239315|author=Riggs A |chapter=Myofascial Release|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi9yBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of her students became teachers of massage, including one of the founders of [[myofascial release]].&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 195–208 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188,208}}

Rolf claimed to have found an association between emotions and the soft tissue, writing "although rolfing is not primarily a psychotherapeutic approach to the problems of humans", it does constitute an "approach to the personality through the myofascial collagen components of the physical body".&lt;ref name=ipr&gt;Ida Rolf ''quoted in'' {{cite book |editor=Rosemary Feitis |title=Rolfing and Physical Reality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7mtgps33gEC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1990 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-89281-380-3 |pages=26–27 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed Rolfing could balance the mental and emotional aspects of subjects, and that "the amazing psychological changes that appeared in Rolfed individuals were completely unexpected".&lt;ref name=ipr/&gt; Rolfers suggest their manipulations can cause the release of painful repressed memories.&lt;ref name="contro" /&gt; Rolfers also hold that by manipulating the body they can bring about changes in personality so, for example, teaching somebody to walk with confidence will make them a more confident person.&lt;ref name=elpsy&gt;{{cite book |author=Roeckelein JE |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA530 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-046064-2 |page=530 |chapter=Rolfing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between physical structure and psychology has not been proven by scientific studies.&lt;ref name=sd&gt;{{cite book |title= The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter= Rolfing |url= http://www.skepdic.com/rolfing |date= 22 January 2014 |last= Carroll |first= Robert Todd |authorlink= Robert Todd Carroll |edition= Online |accessdate= 2014-03-03 |isbn= 9780471272427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
Rolfers posit that they manipulate the body's fascial layers.&lt;ref name=broc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Daniels |editor1-first= Rick |editor2-last= Nicoll |editor2-first= Leslie |year= 2011 |chapter= Ch. 14: Complementary and Alternative Therapies |title= Contemporary Medical-Surgical Nursing |volume= 1  |edition= 2nd  |publisher= Cengage Learning |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=-tmHtnxutW4C&amp;pg=PA306 306] |isbn= 1439058660 |ref= {{SfnRef|Daniels &amp; Nicoll|2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfing also uses a combination of active and passive movement retraining.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book |last1= Schultz |first1= Richard Louis |last2= Feitis |first2= Rosemary |year= 1996 |title= The Endless Web: Fascial Anatomy and Physical Reality |publisher= [[North Atlantic Books]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BIKubGskvtsC&amp;pg=PA33 33] |isbn= 1556432283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolfing is typically performed in a progression of 10 sessions, sometimes called "the recipe".&lt;ref name=recipe1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Myers TW |title=Structural integration—developments in Ida Rolf's 'Recipe'—I |journal=Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=131–142 |issn=1360-8592 |doi=10.1016/S1360-8592(03)00088-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three sessions of the protocol focus on superficial tissues, the next four focus on deeper tissues and specifically the pelvis, and the final sessions address the whole body.&lt;ref name=Deutsch&gt;{{cite book |last= Deutsch |first= Judith E. |chapter= The Ida Rolf Method of Structural Integration |editor-first= Judith E. |editor-last= Deutsch |year= 2008 |title= Complementary Therapies for Physical Therapy: A Clinical Decision-Making Approach |publisher= [[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]] |pages= 266–7 |isbn= 0721601111 |ref= {{SfnRef|Deutsch|2008}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houglum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;

A session typically lasts between 60 and 90 minutes. The recipient wears undergarments.&lt;ref name="contro"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KGNwokGP20C&amp;pg=PA202|title=Controversies in the Practice of Medicine|last=|first=|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2001|isbn=978-0-313-31131-4|location=|page=202|pages=|quote=Practitioners suggest pent-up mental anguish tied to initial traumatic event or subsequent chronic pain is released as the fascias become more pliable.|via=|vauthors=Goldstein MC, Goldstein MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positions for the work include lying on a table, sitting, and standing.&lt;ref name="riggs" /&gt;{{rp|370}}

Rolfing treatments are sometimes painful.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; For adults, there may be moments of intense sensation during a treatment or soreness afterward.&lt;ref name=Knaster/&gt; However, the technique can be done gently enough for children and the elderly.&lt;ref name=Claire/&gt; Rolf believed fascia tightens as a protective mechanism, and therefore thought an aggressive approach could be counter-productive.&lt;ref name= Salvo&gt;{{cite book |last= Salvo |first= Susan G. |year= 2012 |title= Massage Therapy: Principles and Practice |edition= 4th |publisher= Elsevier Saunders |page= 423 |isbn= 1437719775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness and reception ==
In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published a review of 17 alternative therapies including Rolfing which concluded no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |pages=16, 19, 125–8 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly In 2017 the Australian government named Rolfing as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |year=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] says the deep soft tissue manipulations such as those used in Rolfing are a concern if practiced on people with cancer near tumor sites.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |page=170 |chapter=Bodywork |url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Complete-Complementary-Alternative-Therapies/dp/0944235719}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proponents of Rolfing claim it can be used to alleviate pain.&lt;ref name="Thompson2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Thompson|title=Counseling Techniques: Improving Relationships with Others, Ourselves, Our Families, and Our Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8JzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|date=27 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-61441-7|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Rolfing's focus on appropriate "alignment" of structures of the body does not reflect modern science about pain.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Edzard|last2=Pittler|first2=Max|last3=Wider|first3=Barbara|title=Complementary Therapies for Pain Management: An Evidence-Based Approach|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Moseby|isbn=978-0-7234-3400-9|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9oES85plfgC&amp;dq=complementary+therapies+for+pain+management&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moseley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=G.

In 2010 ''The New York Times'' reported that Rolfing was enjoying a "resurgence" following an endorsement from [[Mehmet Oz]] on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/fashion/07rolfing.html |title=Rolfing, Excruciatingly Helpful |date=6 October 2010 |author=Considine A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of its dependence on [[vitalistic]] concepts and its unevidenced propositions about the connection between physical manipulation and psychology, Rolfing is classified as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Medical historian Barbara Clow writes that, in common with many other types of alternative medicine, Rolfing takes a view of illness and of therapy which conflicts with mainstream medicine.&lt;ref name=clow&gt;{{cite book |title=Negotiating Disease: Power and Cancer Care, 1900-1950 |year=2001 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |page=63 |author=Clow B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFyee0XcIfoC&amp;pg=PA63 |quote=Before we explore medical reactions to therapeutic innovations in this era, we must stop to consider the meaning of 'alternative medicine' in this context.  Often scholars use the term to denote systems of healing that are philosophically as well as therapeutically distinct from regular medicine: homeopathy, reflexology, rolfing, macrobiotics, and spiritual healing, to name a few, embody interpretations of health, illness, and healing that are not only different from, but also at odds with conventional medical opinion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist and attorney [[Christopher Barden]] has numbered Rolfing among "dangerous and controversial" methods that pose a risk to the public.&lt;ref name=barden&gt;{{cite book|editors=Lorandos D, Bernet W, Sauber SR|title=Parental Alienation: The Handbook for Mental Health and Legal Professionals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNfCCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279|year=2013|publisher=Charles C Thomas |isbn=978-0-398-08750-0|page=279|chapter=Chapter 9: Protecting the Integrity of the Family Law System: Multidisciplinary Processes and Family Law Reform |author=Barden RC |authorlink=Christopher Barden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist Dan Agin has identified Rolfing as a popular kind of "quack medicine" in the "raucous bazaar" of the [[United States]]'s alternative medicine scene,&lt;ref name=agin&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Agin|title=Junk Science: How Politicians, Corporations, and Other Hucksters Betray Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4VzaPjTnxUC&amp;pg=PA114|date=27 November 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-3853-6|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health journalist [[Rose Shapiro]] lists Rolfing among the many popular "quack treatments" that rally today under the banner of [[integrative medicine]],&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rose Shapiro]]|title=[[Suckers (book)|Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All]]|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-5916-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]] has said the vague health claims made by Rolfers are characteristic of those made by "quacks".&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;

== History ==
[[Ida Rolf]] began working on clients in New York City in the 1940s with the premise that the human structure could be organized "in relation to gravity". She developed structural integration with one of her sons and by the 1950s she was teaching her work across the United States.&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; In the mid-1960s she began teaching at [[Esalen Institute]], where she gathered a loyal following of students and practitioners.&lt;ref name="stillerman2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riggs|first=Art|editor=Elaine Stillerman|title=Modalities for Massage and Bodywork|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi9yBgAAQBAJ|edition=2nd|date=18 December 2014|publisher=[[Mosby (publisher)|Mosby]]; |isbn=978-0-323-26079-4|page=153|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esalen was the epicenter of the [[Human Potential Movement]], allowing Rolf to exchange ideas with many of their leaders, including [[Fritz Perls]].&lt;ref name=Claire /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perls|first1=Frederick|title=In and Out of the Garbage Pail|date=1969|publisher=Real People Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux4pAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Esalen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolf incorporated a number of ideas from other areas including [[osteopathic manipulative treatment|osteopathic manipulation]], [[cranial osteopathy]], [[hatha yoga]], and the [[general semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobson E |title=Structural integration: origins and development |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=775–80 |year=2011 |pmid=21875349 |pmc=3162380 |doi=10.1089/acm.2011.0001 |type=Historical article}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 she founded the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kepler.sos.ca.gov |title= Business Search (search for 'Rolf Institute') |publisher= Secretary of State, CA |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150315010639/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/ |archivedate= 2015-03-15 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been based in Boulder, Colorado since 1972, and as of 2010 included five institutes worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Therapeutic Exercise for Musculoskeletal Injuries|last=Houglum|first=Peggy|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2010|isbn=9780736075954|edition=3rd|location=|pages=174–175|quote=She eventually opened a school in Boulder, Colorado, The Rolf Institute; there are now five institutes around the world teaching what is now known as Rolfing.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The sacking was revenge for the killing of [[District Inspector]] Burke and his brother [[Sergeant]] Burke, who were shot dead by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] while in Smyth’s pub, Balbriggan earlier in the day.

== Sacking ==
The sack started around 11pm when lorries carrying around 100 to 150 Tans arrived in the town from [[Gormanston Camp|Gormanston military barracks]] and proceeded to loot the town.

On Clonard Street, 20 houses were destroyed. Several pubs were looted and burned including Derham’s Pub and McGowan’s Pub on George’s Hill. Overall a factory, 49 houses and four pubs were burnt down.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt;

Two men, Sean Gibbons and Seamus Lawless, were taken to Quay Street and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=BxLb0aZOFOMC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=burning+of+balbriggan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinl4D2oeHWAhWKfFAKHZbNARcQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=burning%20of%20balbriggan&amp;f=false|title=Guerrilla Warfare in the Irish War of Independence, 1919–1921|last=McKenna|first=Joseph|date=2011-01-31|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786485192|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The event caused debate in the British Parliament and [[H. H. Asquith]], the former Prime Minister and then [[leader of the opposition]] compared Balbriggan to a Belgian town on the frontier during [[World War 1|World War I]].&lt;ref name=coogan&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=zWgfwHuOCHYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=burning+of+balbriggan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinl4D2oeHWAhWKfFAKHZbNARcQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=burning%20of%20balbriggan&amp;f=false|title=Ireland In The 20th Century|last=Coogan|first=Tim Pat|date=2009-12-01|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781407097213|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sal Restivo''' (born 1940) is a sociologist/anthropologist. 

==Work==
Restivo is a leading contributor to [[science studies]] and in particular to the [[sociology]] of mathematical knowledge. His current work focuses on the sociology of mind and brain, and the sociology of god and religion.  He has also done work in the sociology of social and sociable robotics. He helped launch the ethnographic study of science in the 1970s, and is a founding member (1975) and former president (1994/95) of the Society for Social Studies of Science. He was a founding member of the Association for Humanist Sociology, and was also involved with Science for the People in its formative years and active in the Radical Science Movement.  His pioneering work in the sociology of mathematics has been a key factor in bringing [[social constructionism]] into mathematics education and the philosophy of mathematics education. He also helped to develop the [[science and technology studies]] curriculum which has become a popular major at universities throughout the US and the world. He is based in the USA and worked as a professor for many years at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Troy, NY]]. He has been awarded multiple NSF and NEH grants and fellowships as well as support from other agencies.  He has been a Nordisk Forskerutdanningsakademi Professor simultaneously at Roskilde University (Denmark) and the University of Gothenburg (Sweden); a Belgian National Research Foundation Professor, Free University of Brussels (Belgium); and a Special Professor of Mathematics Education at Nottingham University (United Kingdom). He is a former Hixon/Riggs Professor of Science, Technology, and Society at Harvey Mudd College, and currently holds the title of Special Lecture Professor at the Research Institute for the Philosophy of Science and Technology at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China.  At RPI, he was Professor of Sociology, Science Studies, and Information Technology. He retired from RPI on June 30, 2012 and then spent six months as a Senior Fellow at the University of Ghent in Belgium. He is now living in Ridgewood, NY and taught in the Department of Technology, Culture, and Society at [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]] in Brooklyn NY from 2015-2017.  He attended and graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] with honors in electrical engineering &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bths.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=228863&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=444385&lt;/ref&gt;; earned his BA with honors at the [[City College of New York]]. He has a PhD earned with distinction from [[Michigan State University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.rpi.edu/node/36079{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Social Progress Index''''' ('''''SPI''''') measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-four indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of well-being, and opportunity to progress show the relative performance of nations. The index is published by the nonprofit [[Social Progress Imperative]], and is based on the writings of [[Amartya Sen]], [[Douglass North]], and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond GDP|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/04/social-progress|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2 August 2013|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPI measures the well-being of a society by observing social and environmental outcomes directly rather than the economic factors. The social and environmental factors include wellness (including health, shelter and sanitation), equality, inclusion, sustainability and personal freedom and safety.&lt;ref name="own-website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Progress Imperitive Website|url=https://www.socialprogressimperative.org/|publisher=Social Progress Imperitive|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction and methodology ==
The index combines three dimensions
# [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Basic human needs]]
# Foundations of [[well-being]]
#[[Business opportunity|Opportunity]]

Each dimension includes four components, which are each composed of between three and five specific outcome indicators. The included indicators are selected because they are measured appropriately, with a consistent methodology, by the same organization across all (or essentially all) of the countries in the sample. Together, this framework aims to capture a broad range of interrelated factors revealed by the scholarly literature and practitioner experience as underpinning social progress. 

Two key features of the ''Social Progress Index'' are:&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;
# the exclusion of economic variables
# the use of outcome measures rather than inputs

Social Progress Imperative evaluated hundreds of possible indicators while developing the ''Social Progress Index'', including engaging researchers at MIT to determine what indicators best differentiated the performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there are sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;

==History==
In 2010, a group of global leaders from the social sector sought to develop a better measure of a country's level of development and, by extension, better understand its development priorities. Funded by private foundations and under the technical guidance of Professors [[Michael Porter]] from [[Harvard Business School]] and Scott Stern from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the group formed Social Progress Imperative and launched a beta version of the ''Social Progress Index'' for 50 countries in 2013 to measure a comprehensive array of components of social and environmental performance and aggregate them into an overall framework.

This work was influenced by the contributions of [[Amartya Sen]] on social development, as well as by the recent call for action in the report ''Mismeasuring Our Lives'' by the [[Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond GDP|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/04/social-progress|work=The Economist|accessdate=2 August 2013|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Social Progress Index'' was released in 2014 for 133 countries with a second version in 2015.&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;

On 11 July 2013, Social Progress Imperative's chairman and professor at [[Harvard Business School]], [[Michael Porter]], addressed the [[United Nations]] 6th Ministerial Forum for Development and discussed the Social Progress Index.&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;

In addition to the global ''Social Progress Index'', the methodology used to create it has been adapted to measure social and environmental performance in smaller areas, such as the Amazon region of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/140823/conservation-amazon-threatened-poor-social-conditions-its-peopl|title=Conservation of Amazon threatened by poor social conditions of its people: study|work=Global Post|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects include a ''Social Progress Index'' for the Municipality of Guatemala City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progresosocial.org/news/indice-de-progreso-social-de-la-ciudad-de-guatemala/|title=ÍNDICE DE PROGRESO SOCIAL DE LA CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA - Progreso Social|work=progresosocial.org|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundacion Paraguaya has integrated elements of the ''Social Progress Index'' into its [[Poverty Stoplight]] tool. The national government of Paraguay is setting a target for ''Social Progress Index'' performance alongside GDP targets.

''The Guardian'' reported that the European Commission had agreed to partner with Social Progress Imperative to create a [[EU Social Progress Index|social progress index for the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/09/social-progress-gdp-economic-growth-european-commission|title=European Commission agrees to investigate using social progress tool alongside GDP|author=Jo Confino|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The EU Social Progress Index was published in October, 2016.

A similar index, although with some differences compared to the nation list (and therefore not directly comparable), has been published for the individual [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Social Progress Index: US States – Methodology Summary | year=2018 | publisher=Social Progress Imperative | url=http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Methodology-brief-Final.pdf | accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=State Progress Reports | year=2018 | publisher=Social Progress Imperative | url=http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/state-progress-reports/ | accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
From an econometric stand point, the Index appears to be similar to other efforts aimed at overcoming the limitation of traditional economic measure such as the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). One major criticism is that although the Social Progress Index can be seen as a superset of indicators used by earlier econometric models such as [[Gross National Well-being]] Index 2005, Bhutan [[Gross National Happiness]] Index of 2012, and [[World Happiness Report]] of 2012, Yet, unlike them, it ignores measures of subjective life satisfaction and psychological well-being. Other critics point out that "there remain certain dimensions that are currently not included in the SPI. These are the concentration of wealth in the top 1 percent of the population, efficiency of the judicial system, and quality of the transportation infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt; http://opinion.inquirer.net/80526/social-progress-index&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that "we must be wary. Though words such as “inclusive capitalism” are bandied around increasingly these days to signal a new age, free from ideological battlegrounds between public and private, much of what the organization’s founders say about it confirms that the index is more about being “business inclusive” than “inclusive capitalism.”&lt;ref&gt; http://www.humanosphere.org/social-business/2016/05/a-new-index-to-measure-social-progress-but-what-is-it-really-telling-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social constructionism''' is  a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] in [[sociology]] and [[communication theory]] that examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about reality. The theory centers on the notion that meanings are developed in coordination with others rather than separately within each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2009). Social construction of reality. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 891). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959384.n344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social constructionism questions what is defined by humans and society to be reality. Therefore, social constructs can be different based on the society and the events surrounding the time period in which they exist.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mr. Sinn|title=Theoretical Perspectives: Social Constructionism|date=2016-02-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UrDIfdTRpo|accessdate=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a social construct is money or the concept of currency, as people in society have agreed to give it importance/ value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Citation|last=khanacademymedicine|title=Social constructionism {{!}} Society and Culture {{!}} MCAT {{!}} Khan Academy|date=2013-09-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U2XAJNazik|accessdate=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a social construction is the concept of self/ self-identity. [[Charles Cooley]] stated based on his [[Looking-glass self|Looking-Glass-Self]] theory: "I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This demonstrates how people in society construct ideas or concepts that may not exist without the existence of people or language to validate those concepts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lc23548.wordpress.com/social-constructionism/|title=Social constructionism|date=2017-12-04|work=Study Journal|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are weak and strong social constructs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Weak social constructs rely on [[brute fact]]s (which are fundamental facts that are difficult to explain or understand, such as [[quark]]s) or institutional facts (which are formed from social conventions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Strong social constructs rely on the human perspective and knowledge that doesn't just exist, but is rather constructed by society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definition ==
A social construct or construction concerns the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In that respect, a social construct as an idea would be widely accepted as natural by the society.

A major focus of social constructionism is to uncover the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the construction of their perceived social reality. It involves looking at the ways [[social phenomena]] are developed, [[Institutionalization (disambiguation)|institutionalized]], known, and made into [[tradition]] by humans.

== Origins ==
In terms of background, social constructionism is rooted in "[[symbolic interactionism]]" and "phenomenology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/phenomenology/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=David Woodruff|last=Smith|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=29 May 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Construction of Leadership: A Sailing Guide|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/24/2/171|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|date = 2010-05-01|issn = 0893-3189|pages = 171–210|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0893318909359697|language = en|first = Gail T.|last = Fairhurst|first2 = David|last2 = Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Berger and Luckmann's ''The Social Construction of Reality'' published in 1966, this concept found its hold. More than four decades later, a sizable number of theory and research pledged to the basic tenet that people "make their social and cultural worlds at the same time these worlds make them."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It is a viewpoint that uproots social processes "simultaneously playful and serious, by which reality is both revealed and concealed, created and destroyed by our activities."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It provides a substitute to the "Western intellectual tradition" where the researcher "earnestly seeks certainty in a representation of reality by means of propositions."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In social constructionist terms, "taken-for-granted realities" are cultivated from "interactions between and among social agents;" furthermore, reality is not some objective truth "waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather, there can be "multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Social constructionism understands the "fundamental role of language and communication" and this understanding has "contributed to the linguistic turn" and more recently the "turn to [[discourse]] theory."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/janettie/discourse-theory|title=Discourse Theory|last=Janet Tibaldo|date=19 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of social constructionists abide by the belief that "language does not mirror reality; rather, it constitutes [creates] it."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

A broad definition of social constructionism has its supporters and critics in the organizational sciences.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; A constructionist approach to various organizational and managerial phenomena appear to be more commonplace and on the rise.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Andy Lock and Tomj Strong trace some of the fundamental tenets of social constructionism back to the work of the 18th century Italian political philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lock and Tom Strong.2010. ''Social Constructionism: Sources and Stirrings in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger and Luckmann give credit to [[Max Scheler]] as a large influence as he created the idea of [[Sociology of knowledge]] which influenced social construction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2009). Social construction of reality. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 8-9).

===Personal construct psychology===
Since its appearance in the 1950s, [[personal construct psychology]] (PCP) has mainly developed as a constructivist theory of personality and a system of transforming individual [[meaning-making]] processes, largely in therapeutic contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, D., &amp; Mair, M.M. (1968) ''The evaluation of personal constructs''. London, UK: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kelly (psychologist)|Kelly, G.A.]] (1955), ''The psychology of personal constructs''. New York, NY: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mair, J.M. (1977), ''The community of self''. In D. Bannister (Ed.), ''New perspectives in personal construct theory'' (pp. 125–149).

Harvey (Ed.), Loss and trauma (pp. 401–412). Philadelphia, PA: Brunner Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Procter, H.G. (1981), ''Family construct psychology''. In S. Walrond-Skinner (Ed.), ''Family therapy and approaches'' (pp. 350–367). London, UK: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stojnov, D., &amp; Butt, T.

Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; It was based around the notion of persons as scientists who form and test theories about their worlds. Therefore, it represented one of the first attempts to appreciate the constructive nature of experience and the meaning persons give to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;Harré, R., &amp; Gillett, D. (1994). The discursive mind. London, UK: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism (SC), on the other hand, mainly developed as a form of a critique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shotter | first1 = J. | last2 = Lannamann | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = The situation of social constructionism: Its imprisonment within the ritual of theory-criticism-and-debate | url = | journal = [[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 577–609 | doi=10.1177/0959354302012005894}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to transform the oppressing effects of the social meaning-making processes. Over the years, it has grown into a cluster of different approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harré | first1 = R | year = 2002 | title = Public sources of the personal mind: Social constructionism in context | url = | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 611–623 | doi=10.1177/0959354302012005895}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no single SC position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stam | first1 = H.J. | year = 2001 | title = Introduction: Social constructionism and its critiques | url = | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 291–296 | doi=10.1177/0959354301113001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different approaches under the generic term of SC are loosely linked by some shared assumptions about language, knowledge, and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, V.

A usual way of thinking about the relationship between PCP and SC is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This way of conceptualizing this relationship is a logical result of the circumstantial differences of their emergence. In subsequent analyses these differences between PCP and SC were framed around several points of tension, formulated as binary oppositions: personal/social; individualist/relational; agency/structure; constructivist/constructionist.&lt;ref&gt;Botella, L.

(2011). Personal construct psychology and social constructionism are not incompatible: Implications of a reframing Theory &amp; Psychology 21: 396–411&lt;/ref&gt;

Reframing the relationship between PCP and SC may be of use in both the PCP and the SC communities. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP “toolkit” in constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, the reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlović, J. (2011). Personal construct psychology and social constructionism are not incompatible: Implications of a reframing Theory &amp; Psychology 21: 396–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Like social constructionism, [[social constructivism]] states that people work together to construct [[Social artifact|artifacts]]. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.

Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] and A. Sullivan Palincsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = von Glasersfeld | first1 = Ernst | year = 1995 | title = Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning|location= London|publisher= Routledge }}; {{cite journal | last1=Palincsar|first1= A.S. |year=1998|title= Social constructivist perspectives on teaching and learning | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.345 |pmid= 15012472 | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 345–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic therapy===
[[Systemic therapy]] is a form of psychotherapy which seeks to address people as people in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups and their interactional patterns and dynamics.

===Communication studies===
A bibliographic review of social constructionism as used within [[communication studies]] was published in 2016. It features a good overview of resources from that disciplinary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2016). "Social construction". In P. Moy (Ed.), ''Oxford bibliographies in communication''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teleology of social construction ==
The concepts of ''weak'' and '''strong''' as applied to opposing [[philosophical position]]s, "isms", inform a [[teleology]]{{spaced ndash}}the goal-oriented, meaningful or "final end" of an interpretation of reality. "Isms" are not personal opinions, but the extreme, modal, formulations that actual persons, individuals, can then consider, and take a position between. There are opposing philosophical positions concerning the feasibility of co-creating a common, shared, social reality, called ''weak'' and '''strong'''.

[[John R. Searle]] does not elucidate the terms '''strong''' and ''weak'' in his book ''The Construction of Social Reality'',&lt;ref name="cosr"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Construction of Social Reality |last=Searle |first=John |year=1995 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-83179-4 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he clearly uses them in his [[Chinese room]] argument, where he debates the feasibility of creating a computing machine with a sharable understanding of reality, and he adds [[Chinese room#Computers vs. machines vs. brains|"We are precisely such machines."]] '''Strong''' artificial intelligence ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]) is the bet that computer programmers will somehow eventually achieve a computing machine with a mind of its own, and that it will eventually be more powerful than a human mind. Weak AI bets they won't.

[[David Deutsch]] in his book ''[[The Fabric of Reality#The Church–Turing thesis|The Fabric of Reality]]'' uses a form of '''strong''' [[Turing principle]] to share [[Frank Tipler]]'s view of the final state of the universe as an omnipotent (but not [[Omniscience|omniscient]]), [[Omega point]], computer. ''But this computer is a society of creative thinkers, or people'' (albeit posthuman transhuman persons), having debates in order to generate information, in the never-ending attempt to attain omniscience of this physics{{mdash}}its evolutionary forms, its computational abilities, and the methods of its epistemology{{mdash}}having an eternity to do so. (p.&amp;nbsp;356)

Because both the Chinese room argument and the construction of social reality deal with Searle and his debates, and because they both use ''weak'' and '''strong''' to denote a philosophical position, and because both debate the programmability of "the other", it is worth noting the correspondence that "strong AI" is '''strong''' social constructionism, and "weak AI" is weak social constructivism.

Strong social constructiv''ism'' says "none are able to ''communicate'' either a full reality or an accurate ontology, therefore my position must impose, by a sort of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], my observer-relative epistemology", whereas weak social constructiv''ism'' says "none are able to ''know'' a full reality, therefore ''we must'' cooperate, informing and conveying an objective ontology as best we can."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (New York: Free Press, 1997) The Constructions of Social Reality (p. 365)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak teleology {{anchor|Weak}}===
''Weak social constructionism'' sees the underlying, objective, "[[brute fact]]" elements of the class of languages and functional assignments of human, metaphysical, reality. Brute facts are all facts that are not institutional facts (e.g., metaphysical, social agreement). The skeptic portrays the ''weak'' aspect of social constructivism, and wants to spend effort debating the institutional realities.

Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven (Penguin Books, 2002) The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature (p. 202)&lt;/ref&gt; writes that "some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States."

In a similar vein, [[Stanley Fish]]&lt;ref&gt;Fish, Stanley (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that baseball's "balls and strikes" are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1999) (pp. 29-31)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

Both Fish and Pinker agree that the sorts of [[object (philosophy)|object]]s indicated here can be described as part of what [[John Searle]] calls "social reality."&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1999)(p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} In particular, they are, in Searle's terms, [[Ontology|ontologically]] [[Subjectivity|subjective]] but [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]].&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|63}} "Social facts" are temporally, ontologically, and logically dependent on "brute facts." For example, "money" in the form of its raw materials (rag, pulp, ink) as constituted socially for barter (for example by a banking system) is a social fact of "money" by virtue of (i) collectively willing and intending (ii) to impose some particular function (purpose for which), (iii) by constitutive rules atop the "brute facts." "Social facts have the remarkable feature of having no analogue among physical brute facts" (34). The existence of language is itself constitutive of the social fact (37), which natural or brute facts do not require. Natural or "brute" facts exist independently of language; thus a "mountain" is a mountain in every language and in no language; it simply is what it is.&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|29, et seq}}

Searle illustrates the evolution of social facts from brute facts by the constitutive rule: X counts as Y in C. "The Y terms has to assign a new ''status'' that the object does not already have just in virtue of satisfying the Y term; and there has to be collective agreement, or at least acceptance, both in the imposition of that status on the stuff referred to by the X term and about the function that goes with that status. Furthermore, because the physical features brute facts specified by the X term are insufficient by themselves to guarantee the fulfillment of the assigned function specified by the Y term, the new status and its attendant functions have to be the sort of things that can be constituted by collective agreement or acceptance."&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|44}}

It is true or false that language is not a "brute fact," that it is an institutional fact, a human convention, a metaphysical reality (that happens to be physically uttered), but Searle points out that there are language-independent thoughts "noninstitutional, primitive, biological inclinations and cognitions not requiring any linguistic devices," and that there are many "brute facts" amongst both humans and animals that are truths that should not be altered in the social constructs because language does not truly constitute them, despite the attempt to institute them for any [[Group think|group's gain]]: money and property are language dependent, but desires (thirst, hunger) and emotions (fear, rage) are not.&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|62}} ([[Meditations on First Philosophy|Descartes]] describes the difference between imagination as a sort of vision, or image, and intellect as conceptualizing things by symbolic manipulation.) Therefore, there is doubt that society or a computer can be completely programmed by language and images, (because there is a programmable, emotive effect of images that derives from the language of judgment towards images).

Finally, against the strong theory and for the weak theory, Searle insists, "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] facts, that there are no brute facts, because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] would produce an infinite regress or circularity in the account of institutional facts. In order that some facts are institutional, there must be other facts that are brute [i.e., physical, biological, natural]. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.".&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

[[Ian Hacking]], [[Canadians|Canadian]] philosopher of science, insists, "the notion that everything is socially constructed has been going the rounds. John Searle [1995] argues vehemently (and in my opinion cogently) against universal constructionism."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"&gt;Hacking, Ian. ''The Social Construction of What? ''. Harvard University Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-674-00412-4}}, Numbering begins with 0 for consistency with Hacking's usage.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} "Universal social constructionism is descended from the doctrine that I once named linguistic idealism and attributed, only half in jest, to Richard Nixon [Hacking, 1975, p. 182]. Linguistic idealism is the doctrine that only what is talked about exists, nothing has reality until it is spoken of, or written about. This extravagant notion is descended from Berkeley's idea-ism, which we call idealism: the doctrine that all that exists is mental."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|24}} "They are a part of what John Searle [1995] calls social reality. His book is titled the ''Construction of Social Reality,'' and as I explained elsewhere [Hacking, 1996], that is not a ''social'' construction book at all."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Hacking observes, "the label 'social constructionism' is more code than description"&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|15}} of every Leftist, Marxist, Freudian, and Feminist PostModernist to call into question every moral, sex, gender, power, and deviant claim as just another essentialist claim—including the claim that members of the male and female sex are inherently different, rather than historically and socially constructed. Hacking observes that his 1995 simplistic dismissal of the concept actually revealed to many readers the outrageous implications of the theorists: Is child abuse a real evil, or a social construct, asked Hacking? His dismissive attitude, "gave some readers a way to see that there need be no clash between construction and reality,"&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|29}} inasmuch as "the metaphor of social construction once had excellent shock value, but now it has become tired."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Informally, they require human practices to sustain their existence, but they have an effect that is (basically) universally agreed upon. The disagreement lies in whether this category should be called "socially constructed." Ian Hacking&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it should not. Furthermore, it is not clear that authors who write "social construction" analyses ever mean "social construction" in Pinker's sense. ".&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Reality : A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge" (Anchor, 1967; {{ISBN|0-385-05898-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; If they never do, then Pinker (probably among others) has misunderstood the point of a social constructionist argument.

To understand how weak social constructionism can conclude that metaphysics (a human affair) is not the entire "reality," see the arguments [[Metaphysics#The value and future of metaphysics|against the study of metaphysics]]. This inability to accurately share the ''full'' reality, even given time for a rational conversation, is similarly proclaimed by ''weak artificial intelligence''.

== History and development ==
===Berger and Luckmann===
Constructionism became prominent in the U.S. with [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]]'s 1966 book, ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. Berger and Luckmann argue that all knowledge, including the most basic, taken-for-granted [[common sense]] knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by [[social interactions]]. When people interact, they do so with the understanding that their respective perceptions of reality are related, and as they act upon this understanding their common knowledge of reality becomes reinforced. Since this common sense knowledge is negotiated by people, human [[typification]]s, [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ifications and [[social institution|institution]]s come to be presented as part of an objective reality, particularly for future generations who were not involved in the original process of negotiation. For example, as parents negotiate rules for their children to follow, those rules confront the children as externally produced "givens" that they cannot change. Berger and Luckmann's social constructionism has its roots in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. It links to [[Heidegger]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] through the teaching of [[Alfred Schutz]], who was also Berger's PhD adviser.

===Narrative turn===
During the 1970s and 1980s, social constructionist theory underwent a transformation as constructionist sociologists engaged with the work of [[Michel Foucault]] and others as a [[narrative turn]] in the social sciences was worked out in practice. This particularly affected the emergent [[sociology of science]] and the growing field of [[science and technology studies]]. In particular, [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[Steve Woolgar]], and others used social constructionism to relate what science has typically characterized as objective facts to the processes of social construction, with the goal of showing that human [[subjectivity]] imposes itself on those facts we take to be objective, not solely the other way around. A particularly provocative title in this line of thought is [[Andrew Pickering]]'s ''Constructing Quarks: A Sociological History of Particle Physics''. At the same time, Social Constructionism shaped studies of technology – the Sofield, especially on the [[Social construction of technology]], or [[SCOT]], and authors as [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Maarten van Wesel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, T. J. (1996). The Social Construction of Technology: a Review. In R. Fox (Ed.), Technological Change; Methods and Themes in the History of Technology (pp. 17 – 35). Amsterdam: Harwood Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, M. v. (2006). Why we do not always get what we want; The power imbalance in the Social Shaping of Technology (final draft 29 June 2006). Unpublished Master Thesis, Universiteit Maastricht, Maastricht ([https://archive.is/20120914093955/http://www.personeel.unimaas.nl/maarten.wesel/index.htm Look for the latest version here]).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its common perception as objective, mathematics is not immune to social constructionist accounts. Sociologists such as [[Sal Restivo]] and [[Randall Collins]], mathematicians including [[Reuben Hersh]] and [[Philip J. Davis]], and philosophers including [[Paul Ernest]] have published social constructionist treatments of mathematics.

===Postmodernism===
Social constructionism can be seen as a source of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] movement, and has been influential in the field of [[cultural studies]]. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the [[cultural turn]]) to social constructionism. Within the social constructionist strand of postmodernism, the concept of socially constructed reality stresses the ongoing mass-building of [[worldview]]s by [[individual]]s in [[dialectic]]al interaction with society at a time. The numerous [[reality|realities]] so formed comprise, according to this view, the [[Imagined communities|imagined worlds]] of human social existence and activity, gradually crystallized by [[habituation|habit]] into institutions propped up by [[language]] conventions, given ongoing legitimacy by [[mythology]], religion and philosophy, maintained by therapies and [[socialization]], and subjectively [[internalisation (sociology)|internalized]] by upbringing and education to become part of the [[identity (social science)|identity]] of social citizens.

In the book ''The Reality of Social Construction'', the British sociologist Dave Elder-Vass places the development of social constructionism as one outcome of the legacy of postmodernism. He writes "Perhaps the most widespread and influential product of this process [coming to terms with the legacy of postmodernism] is social constructionism, which has been booming [within the domain of social theory] since the 1980s."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Dave Elder-Vass. 2012.''The Reality of Social Construction''. Cambridge University Press, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Social constructionism falls toward the nurture end of the spectrum of the larger [[nature and nurture]] debate. Consequently, critics have argued that it generally ignores biological influences on behaviour or culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, A., &amp; Bricmont, J. (1999). Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science. NY: Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The view of most psychologists and social scientists is that behaviour is a complex outcome of both biological and cultural influences.&lt;ref&gt;Francsis, D., &amp; Kaufer, D. (2011). [http://the-scientist.com/2011/10/01/beyond-nature-vs-nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture]. The Scientist. 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridly, M. (2004). The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture. NY: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines, such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[behaviour genetics]], [[behavioural neuroscience]], [[epigenetics]], etc., take a nature–nurture interactionism approach to understand behaviour or cultural phenomena.

In 1996, to illustrate what he believed to be the intellectual weaknesses of social constructionism and postmodernism, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] submitted an article to the academic journal ''[[Social Text]]'' deliberately written to be incomprehensible but including phrases and jargon typical of the articles published by the journal. The submission, which was published, was an experiment to see if the journal would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies |accessdate=3 April 2007 |last=Sokal |first=Alan D. |authorlink=Alan Sokal |work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Postmodernism Generator]] is a computer program that is designed to produce similarly incomprehensible text.&lt;ref&gt;A C Bulhak: On the simulation of postmodernism and mental debility using recursive transition networks, 96/264, Dept Computer Science Technical Reports, Dept Computer Science, Monash Univ, Melbourne Australia, 1–12, 12pp. Technical report CS 96/264&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Sokal, with coauthor Jean Bricmont published the book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', which criticized [[postmodernism]] and social constructionism.

Philosopher [[Paul Boghossian]] has also written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking's argument that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are the way that they are only because of our social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then it should be possible to change them into how we would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that we should refrain from making absolute judgements about what is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states:
{{quote|But it is hard to see how we might coherently follow this advice. Given that the propositions which make up epistemic systems are just very general propositions about what absolutely justifies what, it makes no sense to insist that we abandon making absolute ''particular'' judgements about what justifies what while allowing us to ''accept'' absolute ''general'' judgements about what justifies what. But in effect this is what the epistemic relativist is recommending.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Boghossian, ''Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Conmstructivism'', Oxford University Press, 2006, 152pp, hb/pb, {{ISBN|0-19-928718-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in the same work, Boghossian severely constrains the requirements of relativism. He states that instead of believing that any world view is just as true as any other ([[cultural relativism]]), we should believe that:
{{quote|If we were to encounter an ''actual'', coherent, fundamental, genuine alternative to our epistemic system, C2, whose track record was ''impressive'' enough to make us doubt the correctness of our own system, C1, we would not be able to justify C1 over C2 even by our own lights.}}

Following this point, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thibodeaux | first1 = Jarrett | year = 2014 | title = Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research | url = | journal = Sociology | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 829–837 | doi=10.1177/0038038513511560}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that constructionism can both separate and combine a subject and their effective environment. To resolve this he argued that objective conditions should be used when analyzing how perspectives are motivated.

Social constructionism has been criticized by psychologists such as University of Toronto Professor [[Jordan Peterson]] and evolutionary psychologists, including [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quarterlyconversation.com/against-steven-pinkers-the-blank-slate|title=Breaking the Code: Against Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate {{!}} Quarterly Conversation|website=quarterlyconversation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] used the term "[[standard social science model]]" to refer to social-science philosophies that they argue fail to take into account the evolved properties of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J., Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. 1992.

'''Spider mapping''' which is sometimes called Semantic map is a graphic organizer that can be used for [[brainstorming]] ideas, aspects, and thoughts of normally a single theme or topic. It gets its name because of the way it looks when drawn out. Typically done for [[Storytelling|writing stories]], papers, and research brainstorming.

== Main idea ==
The main idea starts in the center, or where ever you choose to place it; sub ideas, views, support for or against, major conflicts and so on stem off of it and they also get stemmed off of throughout the process of mapping out ideas. There are many types of charts&lt;ref&gt;Enchanted learning http://www.enchantedlearning.com/graphicorganizers/spider/&lt;/ref&gt; one can use, spider mapping is the most common.

=== How to plan it ===
A spider map is a [[planning]] tool however additional planning is needed before and after, not every idea can be turned into a story or something writing worthy. There can many steps to take before or after creating a spider map; one is outlining.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a plot outline. http://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/plot-outline.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getting started: outlining. http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/composition/brainstorm_outline.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How it helps ===
Normally one would draw these charts out, getting ideas on paper is the best first start and when it on paper it out of your head and you can think of how characters or ideas link together, what the conflict is, what plot twists could make to story or idea more successful.

== Subcategories ==
Aside from the main point the sub stems hold the important ideas, people, and views, conflicts to the main character or idea. Many sub characters; Minor characters&lt;ref&gt;what is a Minor character. http://www.writersdigest.com/whats-new/what-is-a-minor-character-understanding-the-minor-characters-role&lt;/ref&gt; play comic relief, supporting, weaker conflict, thought provoking roles.

{{About|the philosophical position|other uses of spiritualism|Spiritualism (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], '''spiritualism''' is the notion, shared by a wide variety of systems of thought, that there is an immaterial reality that cannot be perceived by the senses.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/560495/spiritualism "Spiritualism (in philosophy)"], britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt; This includes philosophies that postulate a [[personal God]], the [[immortality of the soul]], or the immortality of the intellect or will, as well as any systems of thought that assume a [[universal mind]] or cosmic forces lying beyond the reach of purely [[materialism|materialistic]] interpretations.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; Generally, any philosophical position, be it [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], [[monism]], [[atheism]], [[theism]], [[pantheism]], [[idealism]] or any other, is compatible with spiritualism as long as it allows for a reality beyond matter.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;&lt;ref name="James1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=William James|title=A pluralistic universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPuwCunFTFoC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=17 July 2010|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-67391-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theism is an example of a dualist spiritualist philosophy, while pantheism is an example of monist spiritualism.&lt;ref name="James1977" /&gt;

'''The Committee for Equal Justice''' (also known as the '''Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor''') was an organization founded with the goal of assisting black women reclaim their bodies against [[sexual violence]] and [[interracial rape]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielle L. McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance--a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power (New York: Vintage Books, 2011) 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recy Taylor]] and [[Rosa Parks]] founded the committee in 1944 after six white men kidnapped and raped Taylor, an [[African-American]] woman, as she left her [[Abbeville]], [[Alabama]] church.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Theoharis, The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks (Boston: Beacon Press, 2013) 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's case garnered heavy media coverage. With this attention came national support, which led to what the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' called the "strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 22. &lt;/ref&gt; Committee members formed eighteen chapters &lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 26. &lt;/ref&gt; across the United States, and included such figures as [[WEB DuBois]], [[Mary Church Terrell]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[John Sengstacke]] and [[Langston Hughes]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Close to midnight on September 3, 1944, six white male assailants stopped [[Recy Taylor]], Fannie Daniels, and West Daniels as they returned home from church in [[Abbeville, Alabama]]. The assailants claimed that they recognized Taylor, and that she was wanted for a crime. Taylor had been with the Daniels all day, and thus could not have been involved in the crime as they claimed. At gun and knife point, they kidnapped Taylor, drove her to a secluded area and raped her. Following the assault, they left Taylor to stumble home blindfolded. Taylor’s father and a deputy sheriff found her; she then described the car to the deputy. The Sheriff’s Department identified [[Hugo Wilson]] as the driver, and took him into custody. Wilson named the other men involved in the assault, and the Department released him. Taylor and her husband filed charges, but the all-white [[grand jury]] dismissed the case on October 4, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Atwater, "$600 To Rape Wife? Ala. Whites Make Offer To Recy Taylor Mate!: Victim of White Alabama Racists," The Chicago Defender (National edition) Jan 27, 1945; "Alabama Authorities Ignore White Gang's Rape of Negro Mother," The Worker, November 19, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[Rosa Parks]] traveled to Abbeville, Alabama after hearing about Taylor’s assault. The threat of police intervention prompted Parks to meet Recy Taylor, her husband, and her daughter in a secluded cabin. After Deputy Sheriff Lewey Corbitt ended their secret meeting, Parks recorded Taylor’s notes of the assault and brought them to African-American activists in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 5-6. &lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on years of activism in which she defended the [[Scottsboro Boys]], fought against the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and joined the [[NAACP]], Rosa Parks allied with the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]] to publicize Taylor’s case.
	
Rosa Parks gathered the support of E.D. Nixon (the Head of the Alabama [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]), Rufus A. Lewis (funeral home director and [[Alabama State]] football coach), and E.G. Jackson (editor of [[Alabama Tribune]]) and formed the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Danielle L. At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance- a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power. New York: Vintage Books, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1945, the case had gained national attention, and the Committee established branches established in New York, and expanded to Denver, Chicago and Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Atwater, "$600 To Rape Wife? Ala. Whites Make Offer To Recy Taylor Mate!: VICTIM OF WHITE ALABAMA RAPISTS," The Chicago Defender (National edition) Jan 27, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Leadership===

In her role as secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, Rosa Parks traveled throughout Alabama collecting testimonies and documenting racially motivated crimes, such as police brutality, unsolved murders, voter intimidation, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon coming across Taylor’s story, Parks and other prominent activists, supported by national labor unions, African-American organizations and women’s groups launched a defense team, initially called the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor. Many well-known activists at the time signed on to the committee, including E.D. Nixon, E.G. Jackson, W.E.B. DuBois, Mary Church Terrell, [[Charlotte Hawkins Brown]], Ira De A. Reid, [[John Sengstacke]], [[Countee Cullen]], Langston Hughes, Lillian Smith, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Henrietta Buckmaster.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions===

The Committee for Equal Justice spearheaded the campaign for securing justice for Recy Taylor. The Committee sent delegates to Abbeville, Alabama to investigate the crime. The Committee led a publicity campaign to illuminate the prevalence of white attacks on black women.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign targeted Alabama Governor [[Chauncey Sparks]], who previously supported laws that hindered Blacks’ from registering to vote. Letters and petitions poured into Sparks’ office demanding that he take action against Taylor’s assailants. Newspapers across the country covered the story of Recy Taylor’s assault.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Jury Won't Reopen Recy Taylor Case," The Chicago Defender, October 6, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; After a considerable amount of public pressure, Governor Sparks reluctantly agreed to launch a special grand jury investigation.&lt;ref&gt;"To Probe Attack on Ala. Woman," The Afro-American, December 23, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury acquitted all of the assailants.&lt;ref&gt;"Recy Taylor Group Seeks Indictment," The Afro American, February 3, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pushback/backlash===

[[J.B. Matthews]], a staffer for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] vilified The Committee for Equal Justice. Matthews claimed that communists led the committee, who were using the campaign to exploit the rape of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  While some members of the committee were communists, the Committee was a platform for civil rights and included many non-communists too. Additionally, some local whites claimed that Taylor was a prostitute whose true intent was to start a race war. Consequently, she received death threats and her house was firebombed.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gordy, "Recy Taylor: A Symbol of Jim Crow's Forgotten Horror," The Root, February 9, 2011, http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2011/02/recy_taylor_a_symbol_of_jim_crows_forgotten_horror.2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact===

Although there were no indictments in Recy Taylor’s case, the Committee for Equal Justice’s nonviolent activism created a foundation for the formal civil rights movement. [[Sikivu Hutchinson]], author of “White Nights, Black Paradise” assessed the significance of the Committee for Equal Justice and Recy Taylor by saying, “Her case became a major catalyst for black women’s civil rights resistance and the intersectional connection between sexual violence and state violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Sikivu Hutchison, “Recy Talyor and the Atrocious Legacy of All-White Juries.” The Huffington Post, 10 Nov. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars assert that this case illuminates the important roles African American women played during the civil rights movement, which is often eclipsed in history books by the contributions of male figures such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King]].

==Legacy==

The Committee for Equal Justice successfully brought national attention to sexual assault of black women that was widespread in the South. The Committee for Equal Justice empowered women to report acts of sexual violence directly to the NAACP, in addition to writing letters to the Justice Department.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Committee for Equal Justice like Rosa Parks and E. D. Nixon later went on to form the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]]. The activists who comprised the committee were responsible for the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycotts]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Rosa Parks described her activism in Montgomery as being inspired by her work with the Committee for Equal Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis, The Rebellious Life, 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Alabama governor Robert Bentley signed a resolution passed by the Alabama state legislature apologizing to Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gourdy, "Recy Taylor Speaks on Alabama Apology," The Root, May 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Packer]] on October 2, 1976, at the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] session of the 146th Semiannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The sermon is addressed to young men of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] (ages 12 to 18) and discusses issues of [[human sexuality]], [[puberty]], and morality. From 1980 to 2016, the sermon was published as a pamphlet by the LDS Church. It has been criticized on various grounds, such as that it encourages [[Violence against LGBT people|violence against homosexuals]]. In 2016, the church discontinued the pamphlet.&lt;ref name = 2016retired&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]], [http://www.sltrib.com/home/4584556-155/lds-church-retires-mormon-apostles-little "LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet"], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Packer described his remarks as matters that "fathers should discuss with their sons."&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; Packer stated that "because some young men do not have fathers and because some fathers (and some bishops) do not know how to proceed", he would be addressing sensitive subjects.&lt;ref name=TYMO&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon compares the [[male reproductive system]] to a "little factory" and teaches that [[masturbation]], use of [[pornography]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual activities]] are immoral and forbidden by God.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; It encourages young male Latter-day Saints to "vigorously resist" homosexual advances, even with violence, if necessary.&lt;ref name=Quote /&gt; Packer teaches that [[nocturnal emission]] is natural and designed by God and that young men "should not feel guilty" when it happens.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; The sermon also offers suggestions on how to control one's thoughts and resist temptation.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike most general conference sermons, "Message to Young Men" was not published in the church's official magazine, ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Report of the 146th Semiannual Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=November 1976|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/11?lang=eng|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|volume=6|issue=11|type=Magazine|access-date=2018-10-24}}. Note that the table of contents for this issue lacks any reference to this address.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the sermon was published in 1980 as a 14-page pamphlet, entitled "To Young Men Only", that was available for church leaders to distribute to members.&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;

In 2016, the pamphlet was discontinued and it was removed from the LDS Church's website.&lt;ref name="2016retired" /&gt; The video of the sermon remains available on the LDS Church's website.&lt;ref name="2016retired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;

One controversial part of the sermon states that some men entice others to join them in sexual behaviors and gives an example of a missionary who punched his companion to the floor for making sexual advances to which Packer responded, "Somebody had to do it".&lt;ref name=Quote&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015 |quote=There are some men who entice young men to join them in these immoral acts. If you are ever approached to participate in anything like that, it is time to vigorously resist. While I was in a mission on one occasion, a missionary said he had something to confess. I was very worried because he just could not get himself to tell me what he had done. After patient encouragement he finally blurted out, 'I hit my companion.' 'Oh, is that all,' I said in great relief. 'But I floored him,' he said. After learning a little more, my response was 'Well, thanks. Somebody had to do it, and it wouldn't be well for a General Authority to solve the problem that way.' I am not recommending that course to you, but I am not omitting it. You must protect yourself.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience is heard laughing after this statement in the original broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Packer, Boyd |date=October 1976 |title=Message to Young Men |time=11:21 |url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/media/session_5_talk_1/2680671857001?lang=eng |location=Salt Lake Tabernacle |publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, gay Mormon historian [[D. Michael Quinn]] described the sermon as "[t]he low point in the Mormon hierarchy's homophobia since the 1950s";&lt;ref name="Dynamics"&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], ''Same-sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-century Americans: A Mormon Example'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001) p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn argued that Packer's words constituted an endorsement of [[gay bashing]] and that the church itself endorsed such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech.&lt;ref name=dialogue&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], [https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N03_13.pdf "Prelude to the National 'Defense of Marriage' Campaign: Civil Discrimination Against Feared or Despised Minorities"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' vol. 33 no. 3 (Fall 2000) pp. 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000 and 2001, David E. Hardy, a [[Salt Lake City]] lawyer who is the father of a gay son, criticized the sermon for "demoniz[ing]" gays and implying that "[[homosexuality]] is a matter of choice".&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Groutage Smith, "Mormon Pamphlets on Gays Criticized", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2000-08-06, p. B2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David E. Hardy, "BYU's Dismissal of Gay Students Continues Confusion for Gays, Parents" [opinion], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', p. AA3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015 |quote=There is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind, with nothing they can do about it. They are just 'that way' and can only yield to those desires. That is a malicious and destructive lie. While it is a convincing idea to some, it is of the devil. No one is locked into that kind of life. From our premortal life we were directed into a physical body. There is no mismatching of bodies and spirits. Boys are to become men—masculine, manly men—ultimately to become husbands and fathers. No one is predestined to a perverted use of these powers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Samantha Allen, a columnist for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', wrote that the sermon "typifies organized religion’s approach to curtailing male masturbation", calling it "deeply paternalistic" and criticizing it for employing "a noxious mixture of condescension and euphemism".&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Allen, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/01/tim-ferriss-is-bro-culture-s-anti-masturbation-crusader.html "Tim Ferriss Is Bro Culture's Anti-Masturbation Crusader"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', August 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ultimate attribution error''' is a group-level [[Attribution bias|attribution error]] that offers an explanation for how one person views different causes of negative and positive behavior in [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup and outgroup]] members.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew (T.F)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=T. F.|title=The ultimate attribution error: Extending Allport's cognitive analysis of prejudice|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]|year=1979|volume=5|issue=4|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/014616727900500407}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Definition== 
Ultimate attribution error is the tendency to internally attribute negative outgroup and positive ingroup behaviour and to externally attribute positive outgroup and negative ingroup behaviour. So in other words, ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup's negative behaviour as flaws in their [[personality]], and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas, if an ingroup member behaves negatively (which is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors.&lt;ref name="Hewstone (1989)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewstone|first=M.|title=Causal attribution: From cognitive processes to collective beliefs|year=1989|publisher=Blackwell|location=Basil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew in his 1979 publication "The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice".&lt;ref name="Pettigrew (T.F)" /&gt; As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of [[Gordon Allport]]'s work in [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]].

The ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute an outgroup member's negative behaviors to dispositional, internal (possibly [[Genetics|genetically]] determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals are also more likely to attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) "exceptional case", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

In general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error. However, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and [[stereotype]]s toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice, as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other [[Race (human classification)|races]], [[religion]]s, cultures, or even [[social class]] as dispositionally inferior or flawed, while people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are seen as good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members, as any positive behaviors are downplayed and negative behaviors are highlighted.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Explaining away positive behavior of outgroup members==
[[File:UAE-EA.png|thumb|Explaining away positive behavior in outgroup members.]]
The attribution of outgroup members' positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories, created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low vs high) and perceived [[locus of control]] of act (internal vs external).{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Exceptional case===

The "exceptional case" explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes the particular outgroup member from the outgroup. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, disassociating them from the group. This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing the "good" member as an exceptional case, while the other members of their group are still seen as "bad".{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Luck or special advantage===

The "luck or special advantage" explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member's positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. "Special advantage" extends this by suggesting that their group affiliation offers some advantage, and therefore the positive outcome is again of little significance.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Highly motivated===

The "highly motivated" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member's positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member's positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low-achieving, negative-behavior outgroup member.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Similar to the "exceptional case" explanation, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them.

===Situational===

The "situational" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member's positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore, their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Evidence==
{{undue|date=February 2015}}
The ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies. Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=D. M|author2=Jaggi |title=Ethnocentrism and Causal attribution in a South Indian Context|journal=[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]|year=1974|volume=5|pages=162–171|doi=10.1177/002202217400500202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 [[between-group design]], [[Hindu]] or [[Muslim]] participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindus or Muslims. Hindus attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindus, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindus. While Pettigrew and many others to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear evidence that similar mechanisms are at play among religious groups.

Prior to Pettigrew's formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan (1976) found that [[White people|White]] participants viewed [[Black people|Black]] individuals as more violent than White individuals in an "ambiguous shove" situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person.&lt;ref name="Duncan 1976 75–93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first= B. L.|title= Differential social perception and attribution if intergroup violence: Testing the lower limits of stereotyping of Blacks|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|year= 1976|volume= 34|issue= 4|pages= 75–93|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.34.4.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim). In general, when a Black harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal). On the other hand, when a White harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was generally attributed to external constraints. The results suggested that the White students participating in the experiment possessed a lower threshold for labeling a behavior as violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm-doer is White (ingroup).

Morris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morris|first= Michael W.|last2= Peng|first2= Kaiping|date= 1994|title=Culture and cause: American and Chinese attributions for social and physical events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 67|issue= 6|pages= 949–971|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. Similarly, the Chinese participants attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect.

Together, these three studies (Taylor and Jaggi's, Duncan's, and Morris and Peng's) establish the foundation of the ultimate attribution error and support its general prediction that negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation.

Supporting this general statement, a meta-analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hewstone|first= Miles|year= 1990|title= The 'ultimate attribution error'? A review of the literature on intergroup causal attribution|journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]]|volume= 20|pages= 311–335|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420200404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error. Specifically, it finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error:
*more internal attribution for positive acts, and less internal attribution for negative acts, by ingroup than outgroup members;
*more attribution of outgroup members' failures to lack of ability, and more explaining away of outgroup members' successes;
*a preference for ingroup-serving versus outgroup-serving attributions for group differences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">In [[game theory]], the '''unscrupulous diner's dilemma''' (or just '''diner's dilemma''') is an [[n-player game|''n''-player]] [[prisoner's dilemma]]. The situation imagined is that several individuals go out to eat, and prior to ordering, they agree to split the check equally between all of them. Each individual must now choose whether to order the expensive or inexpensive dish. It is presupposed that the expensive dish is better than the cheaper, but not by enough to warrant paying the difference when eating alone. Each individual reasons that the expense s/he adds to their bill by ordering the more expensive item is very small, and thus the improved dining experience is worth the money. However, having all reasoned thus, they all end up paying for the cost of the more expensive meal, which by assumption, is worse for everyone than having ordered and paid for the cheaper meal.

==Formal definition and equilibrium analysis==
Let ''a'' represent the joy of eating the expensive meal, ''b'' the joy of eating the cheap meal, ''k'' is the cost of the expensive meal, ''l'' the cost of the cheap meal, and ''n'' the number of players.  From the description above we have the following ordering &lt;math&gt;k-l&gt;a-b&lt;/math&gt;.  Also, in order to make the game sufficiently similar to the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] we presume that one would prefer to order the expensive meal given others will help defray the cost, &lt;math&gt;a - \frac{1}{n}k &gt; b - \frac{1}{n}l&lt;/math&gt;

Consider an arbitrary set of strategies by a player's opponent.  Let the total cost of the other players' meals be ''x''.  The cost of ordering the cheap meal is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}x + \frac{1}{n}l&lt;/math&gt; and the cost of ordering the expensive meal is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}x + \frac{1}{n}k&lt;/math&gt;.  So the utilities for each meal are &lt;math&gt;a - \frac{1}{n}x - \frac{1}{n}k&lt;/math&gt; for the expensive meal and &lt;math&gt;b - \frac{1}{n}x - \frac{1}{n}l&lt;/math&gt; for the cheaper meal.  By assumption, the utility of ordering the expensive meal is higher.  Remember that the choice of opponents' strategies was arbitrary and that the situation is symmetric.  This proves that the expensive meal is [[dominance (game theory)|strictly dominant]] and thus the unique [[Nash equilibrium]].

If everyone orders the expensive meal all of the diners pay ''k'' and their total utility is &lt;math&gt;a-k&lt;/math&gt;.  On the other hand, if all the individuals had ordered the cheap meal, their utility would have been &lt;math&gt;b-l&lt;/math&gt;. Since by assumption &lt;math&gt;b-l&gt;a-k&lt;/math&gt;, everyone would be better off.  This demonstrates the similarity between the diner's dilemma and the prisoner's dilemma.  Like the prisoner's dilemma, everyone is worse off by playing the unique equilibrium than they would have been if they collectively pursued another strategy.&lt;ref name="glance"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glance |first=Natalie S. |last2=Huberman |first2=Bernardo A. |date=March 1994 |title=The dynamics of social dilemmas |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F76F506E-1A94-4FC6-A44B-C0F31E0F091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
Gneezy, Haruvy, and Yafe (2004) tested these results in a field experiment. Groups of six diners faced different billing arrangements. In one arrangement the diners pay individually, in the second they split the bill evenly between themselves and in the third the meal is paid entirely by the experimenter. As predicted, the consumption is the smallest when the payment is individually made, the largest when the meal is free and in-between for the even split. In a fourth arrangement, each participant pays only one sixth of their individual meal and the experimenter pay the rest, to account for possible unselfishness and social considerations. There was no difference between the amount consumed by these groups and those splitting the total cost of the meal equally. As the private cost of increased consumption is the same for both treatments but splitting the cost imposes a burden on other group members, this indicates that participants did not take the welfare of others into account when making their choices. This contrasts to a large number of laboratory experiments where subjects face analytically similar choices but the context is more abstract.&lt;ref name="gneezy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gneezy |first=Uri |first2=Ernan |last2=Haruvy |first3=Hadas |last3=Yafe |date=April 2004 |title=The inefficiency of splitting the bill |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=114 |issue=495 |pages=265–280 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00209.x |url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/splitting-bill.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8SQSbql?url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/splitting-bill.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-08 |access-date=2015-06-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Urdoxa''''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the German prefix ''ur-'' and the [[Ancient Greek]] δόξα (''doxa''), meaning "primary" or "first" doctrine. For [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], the notion of "doxa" meant "opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink1=Gilles Deleuze|first1=Gilles|last1=Deleuze|authorlink2=Félix Guattari|first2=Félix|last2=Guattari| title=What is Philosophy? |translator=Hugh Tomlinson |translator2=Graham Burchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term grew in popular usage in the work of [[Edmund Husserl]] whose phenomenological project was indexed on attempting, via the descriptive method, to ground the notion of a proto-doxa or ''urdoxa'' of experience. The term has since paled in poststructuralist discourse, and usually carries a negative connotation insofar as it assumes a transcendental subjectivity which overly privileges a humanistic conception of Being (see [[Michel Foucault]], ''The Order of Things''). Against such anthropocentricity, the term has fallen into relative disuse.

Two other notable uses of the term have appeared insince the year 2000:{{when|date=November 2015}} a progressive musical ensemble by the name of [[Thork]] produced an album entitled ''Urdoxa'' (2000), and a novel by the Canadian author [[Kane X. Faucher]] also has this term as its title (2004).

==Biography==
Playfair was born in 1759 in Scotland. He was the fourth son (named after his grandfather) of the [[Reverend]] James Playfair of the parish of Liff &amp; Benvie near the city of [[Dundee]] in Scotland; his notable brothers were architect [[James Playfair]] and mathematician [[John Playfair]]. His father died in 1772 when William was 13, leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family and his education. After his [[apprenticeship]] with [[Andrew Meikle]], the inventor of the threshing machine, Playfair became draftsman and personal assistant to [[James Watt]] at the [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine manufactory in [[Soho, West Midlands|Soho, Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="SW 1997"&gt;[[Ian Spence (psychologist)|Ian Spence]] and [[Howard Wainer]] (1997). "[http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/spence/Spence_Wainer_1997b.pdf Who Was Playfair?]". In: ''Chance'' 10, p. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playfair had a variety of careers. He was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. On leaving Watt's company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed. In 1787 he moved to [[Paris]], taking part in the [[storming of the Bastille]] two years later. After the French revolution, Playfair played a role in the [[Scioto Company|Scioto Land]] sale to French settlers in the [[Ohio River]] Valley.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Bruce|title=Playfair: The True Story of the British Secret Agent Who Changed How We See the World|date=2018|isbn=978-1-942695-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to London in 1793, where he opened a "security bank", which also failed. From 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work.&lt;ref name="SW 1997"/&gt; In the 1790s, Playfair informed the British government on events in France and proposed various clandestine operations to bring down the French government.

==Work==
[[Ian Spence (psychologist)|Ian Spence]] and [[Howard Wainer]] in 2001 describe Playfair as "engineer, political economist and scoundrel" while "Eminent Scotsmen" calls him an "ingenious mechanic and miscellaneous writer". It compares his career with the glorious one of his older brother [[John Playfair]], the distinguished Edinburgh mathematics professor, and draws a moral about the importance of "steadiness and consistency of plan" as well as of "genius".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Spence (psychologist)|Ian Spence]] and [[Howard Wainer]] (2001). "William Playfair". In: ''Statisticians of the Centuries''. C.C. Heyde and E. Seneta (eds.)  New York: Springer. pp. 105–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Berkowitz in 2018 provides a detailed portrait of Playfair as an "ambitious, audacious, and woefully imperfect British patriot" who undertook the "most complex covert operation anyone had ever conceived".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Bar chart===
Two decades before Playfair's first achievements, in 1765 [[Joseph Priestley]] had created the innovation of the first timeline charts, in which individual bars were used to visualise the life span of a person, and the whole can be used to compare the life spans of multiple persons. According to [[James R. Beniger]] and Robyn (1978) "Priestley's timelines proved a commercial success and a popular sensation, and went through dozens of editions".&lt;ref name="JRB78"&gt;[[James R. Beniger]] and Dorothy L. Robyn (1978). "Quantitative graphics in statistics: A brief history". In: ''The American Statistician''. 32: pp. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PriestleyChart.gif|center|500px]]

These timelines directly inspired Wiliam Playfair's invention of the [[bar chart]], which first appeared in his ''Commercial and Political Atlas'', published in 1786. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) "Playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. In his Atlas he had collected a series of 34 plates about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as [[line graph]]s or surface charts: line graphs shaded or tinted between abscissa and function. Because Playfair lacked the necessary series data for Scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year as a series of 34 bars, one for each of 17 trading partners".&lt;ref name="JRB78"/&gt;

[[File:1786 Playfair - Exports and Imports of Scotland to and from different parts for one Year from Christmas 1780 to Christmas 1781.jpg|center|500px]]

In this bar chart Scotland's imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. "This bar chart was the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates and tables, or time, as had Priestley's timelines. It constitutes a pure solution to the problem of discrete quantitative comparison".&lt;ref name="JRB78"/&gt;

The idea of representing data as a series of bars had earlier (14th century) been published by Jacobus de Sancto Martino and attributed to [[Nicole Oresme]].  Oresme used the bars to generate a graph of velocity against continuously varying time.  Playfair's use of bars was to generate a chart of discrete measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Der | first1 = Geoff | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Brian S. | title = A Handbook of Statistical Graphics Using SAS ODS | publisher = Chapman and Hall - CRC | year = 2014 | isbn = 1-584-88784-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kB8bBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|p=4|quote=William Playfair, for example, is often credited with inventing the ''bar chart'' (see Chapter 3) in the last part of the 18th century, although a Frenchman, Nicole Oresme, used a bar chart in a 14th century publication, ''The Latitude of Forms'' to plot the velocity of a constantly accelerating object against time. But it was Playfair who popularized the idea of graphic depiction of quantitative information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[area chart|area]], and [[pie chart]]s. His time-series plots are still presented as models of clarity.

Playfair first published ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'' in London in 1786. It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work. It has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs.

Playfair's ''[[Statistical Breviary]],'' published in London in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first [[pie chart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward R. Tufte]] (2001).

===Counterfeiting operation===
In 1793 Playfair as secret agent devised a clandestine plan that he  presented to Henry Dundas, who was Home Secretary soon to become Britain's Secretary of State for War. Playfair proposed to "fabricate one hundred millions of assignats (the French currency) and spread them in France by every means in my power." He saw the counterfeiting plan as the lessor of two evils: "That there are two ways of combatting the French nation the forces of which are measured by men and money. Their assignats are their money and it is better to destroy this paper founded upon an iniquitous extortion and a villainous deception than to shed the blood of men."  Playfair forged the assignats at Haughton Castle in Northumberland and distributed them according to an elaborate plan. The plan apparently worked: by 1795 the French assignat had became worthless and the ensuing chaos undermined the French government. Playfair never told anyone about the operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Playfair cycle===
The following quotation, known as the "Playfair cycle," has achieved notoriety as it pertains to the "[[Tytler cycle]]":
{{blockquote|:...wealth and power have never been long permanent in any place.
:...they travel over the face of the earth,
:something like a caravan of merchants.
:On their arrival, every thing is found green and fresh;
:while they remain all is bustle and abundance,
:and, when gone, all is left trampled down, barren, and bare.&lt;ref&gt;William Playfair (1807). [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=78&amp;fk_files=195753 ''An Inquiry into the Permanent Causes of the Decline and Fall of Powerful and Wealthy Nations''], p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
