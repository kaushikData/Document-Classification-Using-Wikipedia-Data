      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1749">Professor '''Algirdas Budrys''' (born March 3, 1939 in [[:lt:Vertimai|Vertimai]]) has, for several decades, been one of the most outstanding instrumentalists in [[Lithuania]] and is currently Head of the Wind department of the [[Lithuanian Music Academy]].

Primarily a [[clarinet]]ist, Budrys has recorded more than 50 LPs and has made over a hundred radio recordings with a repertoire that included all the principal classical and chamber ensemble works for clarinet from Mozart to contemporary composers.

Professor Budrys has given concerts in all former Soviet republics, as well as in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, Finland, France, Egypt, Great Britain and the United States.

For his efforts to improve Lithuanian culture and art, Budrys was awarded a fourth-degree [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projektai.vu.lt/universitetozurnalistas/site/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=79&amp;cntnt01origid=46&amp;cntnt01returnid=31|publisher=[[Vilnius University]]|title=Algirdas Budrys – klarnetininkas|date=2009-11-03|accessdate=2010-12-21|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">'''Bachelor of Arts and Science (B.A.S.''' or '''B.A.&amp;Sc.''' or '''B.A.Sc.)''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] conferred by a small number of [[United States|American]] universities and a fair number of universities in other English-speaking countries (including [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]). Generally, to receive a B.A.S. degree, a student would need to complete the general requirements for a bachelor's degree and also the requirements for two different [[academic major]]s (or [[academic minor]]s) — one that usually leads to a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree and one that usually leads to a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree. In the United States, the degree is meant to be a four-year degree, but many students will take five years to complete the program.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Technically speaking, it is not an example of a [[double degree]], as universities only confer a single degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/academicinfo/major.html UC Davis Registrar] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716235722/http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/academicinfo/major.html |date=2012-07-16 }} ''"A single degree is granted to students who graduate with multiple majors."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://registrar.stanford.edu/bulletin/4871.htm |title=Stanford University Registrar |access-date=2011-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507022714/http://registrar.stanford.edu/bulletin/4871.htm |archive-date=2011-05-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Behind the Scenes''''' was a 10-part television [[miniseries]] aimed towards 8- to 12-year-olds about various aspects of [[the arts]], that was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-12/entertainment/ca-1615_1_children-s-arts-series |title=PBS Slates Children's Arts Series : Television: Penn &amp; Teller will host 'Behind the Scenes,' aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds. It premieres in September. - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1992-02-12 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |first=Jane |last=Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was executive produced by [[Alice Stewart Trillin]] and [[Jane Garmey]], produced and directed by [[Ellen Hovde]] and [[Muffie Meyer]], and hosted by [[Penn &amp; Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlemarch.com/filmography/behind-the-scenes/ |title=Behind the Scenes &amp;#124; Middlemarch Films |publisher=Middlemarch.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to illuminate the creative process underlying the working of artists.

==Style==
The show used a wide variety of short films, computer animation, and music to illustrate certain abstractions associated with the artistic process. Each of Penn &amp; Teller's skits were specifically geared towards demonstrating an aspect of that episode's theme.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'To show rhythmic patterns in a song, we produce a mouse each time the pattern goes one way and when there is a variation, we produce a frog,' Teller said. 'This continues until there are quite a number of mice and frogs all over the place.'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Penn and Teller said they didn't want to talk down to the series' young viewers. 'Kids tend to be desperately curious,' Teller said. 'There is a certain element we are doing in this that is making the analogy between the arts and a magic trick. When you think of something like perspective in a painting, it really is a magic trick.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-06/news/tv-499_1_creative-skills |title=Tricks for Kids : Penn and Teller host PBS series aimed at boosting creative skills - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1992-09-06 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |first=Susan |last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''C. H. v. Oliva''''', 226 F.3d 198 (3d Cir. 2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=C. H. v. Oliva |vol=226 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=198 |pinpoint= |court=3rd Cir. |date=2000 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/226/198/540172/ |accessdate=2018-03-25 |quote=}} {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[religious freedom]] case in which mother Carol Hood sued Grace Oliva, her son Zachary's first grade teacher, and related administrators in the [[Medford Township Public Schools]] for not allowing the child to read a section of the Bible in class.  His kindergarten class had made Thanksgiving paintings the year prior, and his was taken down and subsequently reposted in a less noticeable place for its religious content.  The poster was called "I'm Thankful for Jesus."  Carol Hood met with Principal Gail Pratt, who defended the school's decisions.  She said that reading the story “was the equivalent of ‘praying’.” Noting that she had received complaints in the past, Ms. Pratt stated that the story “might upset Muslim, Hindu or Jewish students.” She added that there was “no place in the public school for the reading of the Bible” and advised: “ ‘[M]aybe you should consider taking your child out of public school, since you don't appear to be public school material.’ ” Ms. Pratt noted that “her position was fully supported by various legal authorities.”

The district court judge ruled that the teacher had exercised reasonable judgment in refusing to allow the book to be read in class.  He agreed with the lower court that a first grader would not be able to distinguish between a student reading the Bible as constitutionally-protected free expression, and the teacher endorsing a religion by interrupting class to allow him to read it.  Under the establishment clause, other students have a right to be free from religious endorsement by the government.

[[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Samuel Alito]], at the time an appeals court judge, agreed with the district court judge on the matter of the book.  However, he dissented that the replacement of the poster inhibited Zachary's right to free expression.

The appeals court, sitting ''en banc'', split 6-6.  The ruling defaulted to the district court, which had held against the Hoods.

The '''College-Industry Council on Material Handling Education''' (CICMHE) is an academic/industry council of the Material Handling Industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MHI - The Industry That Makes Supply Chains Work|url = http://www.mhi.org/|website = www.mhi.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (MHI) that promotes increased awareness of material handling and logistics through a variety of educational and research activities. CICMHE was founded in 1952 and has served to connect practitioners with academics that teach and do research in material handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = College Industry Council on Material Handling Education (CICMHE)|url = http://www.mhi.org/cicmhe|website = www.mhi.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullington|first=S.F. et al.|date=2000|title=Preparing Students for Careers in Material Handling|url=|journal=Journal of Engineering Education|volume=89 |issue=4|pages=439–441|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[File:CICMHE bubble.jpg|thumb|CICMHE membership structure.]]
The main body of the Council is composed of fifteen college and university educators that are elected to a four-year term and is governed by a four-member executive committee. Additional members are drawn from material handling equipment manufacturers, distributors, users and consultants, representatives of the business press, and professional staff members of organizations concerned with material handling education. CICMHE is organized into two working committees: 
* The '''Events Committee''' plans and executes structured events to facilitate learning and research, promote knowledge transfer, provide exposure to and awareness of the field, address current industry needs and trends, and strengthen the bridge between industry and academia. 
* The '''Projects Committee''' initiate and conduct projects to transform and modernize existing educational offerings, create and maintain new educational offerings, assess usage and effectiveness of offerings, identify, incubate, and foster research in material handling and related domains; and leverage connections between CICMHE and councils, product sections, and affiliated trade associations.

== Activities ==
CICMHE sponsors the following major activities for students, teachers, and researchers:

=== Material Handling and Logistics Classroom Day ===
In order to give students a unique opportunity to see the latest material handling and logistics solutions in person, CICMHE has partnered with the Material Handling Equipment Distributors Association (MHEDA) to offer a special program for students and professors in engineering, technology, manufacturing, operations, supply chain and logistics at the MODEX&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Material Handling &amp; Logistics Classroom Day|url = http://s354933259.onlinehome.us/mhi-blog/material-handling-logistics-classroom-day/|website = s354933259.onlinehome.us|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ProMat&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ProMat 2017 - supply chain, manufacturing, distribution trade show|url = http://www.promatshow.com/|website = www.promatshow.com|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; trade shows sponsored alternate years by MHI. Research has shown that "Classroom Day, as a targeted experiential learning event, increased student appreciation, knowledge, and interest in the field of material handling and logistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=L. et al.|year=2016|title=A Program to Engage College Students in the Material Handling and Logistics Industry|url=|journal=International Journal of Engineering Education|volume=32|pages=2543–2555|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material Handling Teachers Institute (MHTI) ===
CICMHE sponsors a Material Handling Teachers Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teacher's Institute|url = http://www.mhi.org/cicmhe/teachers-institute|website = www.mhi.org|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; every two years for current and future faculty members who engage in material handling education in four year colleges and universities. MHTI 2017 will be held on the campus of Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon in July 2017. The Material Handling Teachers Institute has been traditionally held in the summer of odd-numbered years at the following locations:

The '''Council for Interior Design Accreditation''' ('''CIDA''') is an independent, non-profit [[educational accreditation|accrediting]] organization for [[interior design]] education programs at colleges and universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. For more than 35 years, CIDA has pursued the enrichment of the interior design profession through identifying, developing and promoting quality standards for the education of entry-level interior designers, and then accrediting and supporting educational programs to aspire to those standards.

The Council for Interior Design Accreditation is recognized as a reliable authority on interior design education by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). The CHEA-recognized scope of accreditation is professional level programs in interior design.  The Council engages nearly 200 volunteers, all drawn from interior design practice and education, to carry out its work. Nearly 150 interior design programs are currently accredited by the CIDA, serving an estimated 20,000 students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5749">The '''dean of women''' at a college or university in the [[United States]] is the [[dean (education)|dean]] with responsibility for [[student affairs]] for female students. In early years, the position was also known by other names, including '''preceptress''', '''lady principal''', and '''adviser of women'''.{{sfn|Rosenberry|1915|p=1}} 

Deans of women were widespread in American institutions of higher education from the 1890s to the 1960s,{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=121}} sometimes paired with a "Dean of Men", and usually reporting directly to the president of the institution.  In the later 20th century, however, most Dean of Women positions were merged into the position of [[Dean of Students]]. &lt;!--Outdated? Title of office changed, just not email and URL:, although the role continues to exist at some schools, including [[Hampton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamptonu.edu/student_life/deanofwomen.cfm|title=Dean of Women|publisher=Hampton University|accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==History==
The Dean of Women position had its origins in the anxiety of the first generations of administrators of coeducational universities, who had themselves been educated in male-only schools, with the realities of coeducation.{{sfn|Schwartz|1997|p=419}}  The earliest precursor was the position of [[matron]], a woman charged with overseeing a female dormitory in the early years of coeducation in the 1870s and 1880s.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=121}}  As the numbers of women in higher education rose dramatically in the late 19th century, a more comprehensive administrative response was called for.{{sfn|Schwartz|1997|p=419}} The Deans of Women served both to maintain a protective separation between the male and female student populations, and to ensure that the academic offerings for women and academic work done by women were kept at a sufficiently high standard.{{sfn|Schwartz|1997|p=419}} 

In the initial years, the responsibilities of the dean of women were not standardized,{{sfn|Rosenberry|1915|p=2}} but in the early 20th century it quickly took on the trappings of a profession.  The first professional conference of deans and advisers of women was held in 1903.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=122}} In 1915, the first book dedicated to the profession was published, Lois Rosenberry's ''The Dean of Women''.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=122}} In 1916, the [[National Association of Deans of Women]] was formed at [[Teachers College]].{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=122}}  By 1925, there were at least 302 deans of women at American colleges and universities.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=123}}

In 1935, Lucy Diggs Slowe formed a separate organization for African-American deans of women, the [[Association of Deans of Women and Advisers to Girls in Negro Schools]], prompted by NADW's habit of holding conferences in racially restricted hotels.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=123}}

The trend toward the demotion and elimination of deans of women was first observed by Sarah Blanding in 1946, who noticed deans of women being subordinated to male administrators in charge of general student affairs.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=123}}  By 1962, only 30% of deans of women reported directly to the president of their institution,{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=124}} and by the 1970s the position itself had become rare.

Deans of Women were usually women, although this was not always the case.{{sfn|Rosenberry|1915|p=1}}  The elimination of deanships of women in the later 20th century thus had the effect of reducing the number of women in administrative positions in higher education, as most of the [[dean of students|deans of students]] who replaced them were male.{{sfn|Schwartz|1997}} In the late 1980s, less than 20% of deans of students were female.{{sfn|Nidiffer|1998|p=124}}

'''''Economics''''' is an introductory textbook by American economists [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[William Nordhaus]].  It was first published in 1948, and has appeared in nineteen different editions, the most recent in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Paul-Samuelson/dp/0073511293 Amazon's page on the book]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the best selling [[economics]] textbook for many decades and still remains popular, selling over 300,000 copies of each edition from 1961 through 1976.&lt;ref name="skousen"&gt;{{Citation|last=Skousen|first=Mark|year=1997|title=The Perseverance of Paul Samuelson's Economics|journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–152|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.11.2.137|doi=10.1257/jep.11.2.137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been translated into forty-one languages and in total has sold over four million copies.

''Economics'' was written entirely by Samuelson until the 1985 twelfth edition.  Newer editions have been revised by Nordhaus.

== Influence ==
''Economics'' has been called a "canonical textbook", and the development of mainstream economic thought has been traced by comparing the fourteen editions under Samuelson's editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | title = After the Revolution: Paul Samuelson and the Textbook Keynesian Model | first1 = Kerry A. | last1 = Pearce | first2 = Kevin D. | last2 = Hoover | journal = History of Political Economy | year = 1995 | pages = [http://econ.duke.edu/~kdh9/Source%20Materials/Research/After%20the%20Revolution.pdf 183–216] |  volume = 27 (Supplement) | doi = 10.1215/00182702-27-supplement-183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Economics'' coined the term "[[neoclassical synthesis]]" and popularized the concept,&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivier J. Blanchard|Blanchard, Olivier Jean]] (2008), "neoclassical synthesis," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000041&amp;q=neoclassical&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; bringing a mix of [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] and helping make this the leading school in [[mainstream economics]] in the United States and globally in the second half of the 20th century.

It popularized the term ''[[paradox of thrift]],'' and attributed the concept to Keynes, though [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] himself attributed it to earlier authors, and forms of the concept date to antiquity.

The 1958 text introduced a "family tree of economics", which by the 20th century consisted of only two groupings, "socialism," listing [[Marx]] and [[Lenin]], and the "neo-classical synthesis," listing [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and Keynes. This paralleled the then-extant [[Cold War]] economies of Soviet [[communism]] and American [[capitalism]]. This advanced a simplified view of the vying [[schools of economic thought]], subsuming schools which considered themselves distinct, and today many within and without economics equate "economics" with "neo-classical economics", following Samuelson.
Later editions provided expanded coverage of other schools, such as the [[Austrian school]], [[Institutional economics|Institutionalism]], and [[Marxian economics]].&lt;ref name="skousen" /&gt;

== Reception ==

''Economics'' was the second Keynesian textbook in the United States, following the 1947 ''The Elements of Economics,'' by [[Lorie Tarshis]]. Like Tarshis's work, ''Economics'' was attacked by [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] (as part of the [[Second Red Scare]], or [[McCarthyism]]), universities that adopted it were subject to "conservative business pressuring", and Samuelson was accused of [[Communism]]. Nonetheless, ''Economics'' proved successful and remained widely adopted. The success of Samuelson's text, compared with Tarshis's, which was subject to more "virulen[t]" attacks, is attributed to various factors, notably Samuelson's dispassionate, scientific style, in contrast to Tarshis's more engaged style, and subsequent texts have followed Samuelson's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Colander|Landreth|1998|loc = p. 11–13, especially p. 12, footnote 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations by conservatives of communist sympathies in ''Economics'' continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="bethell"&gt;{{Citation|title=Socialism by the Textbook|last=Bethell|first=Tom|date=1989-10-13|work=[[National Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edifi''', a name constructed from "education" and "finance", was a [[Student financial aid in the United States|college financial aid]] services company located in Albany, New York, which operated nationally. Its legal name was CFAS (College Financial Aid Systems), LLC.

Edifi was born at a time when the financial aid process was more difficult and opaque than it is today.

==Origins==
Edifi was founded by Larry Schechter in 1991; he remained its sole owner throughout (with a hiatus in 2002-2004). It started in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], but with Schechter's relocation to the [[Albany, New York]] area, it moved along with him, and operated first from a bare one-room office on Union Street in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]. Growth led it to move in 2001 to an office suite located at 409 New Karner Road in an unincorporated area of [[Albany County, New York|Albany county]] (mailing address Albany); further growth led it to move in 2003 to a larger office suite at 450 New Karner Road, where it ran a call center, with five clocks - Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, and Hawaii times - on the wall. When winding down operations it moved back to Union Street.

The company started when friends and neighbors of Schechter asked him for help in completing FAFSA forms. Sensing that money could be made, Schechter formed a company, which initially sold its services door-to-door. His primary collaborator and second-in-command, once the company had moved to Schenectady, was Maura Kastberg, who had a B.S. in mathematics. In order to grow the company, they decided to use a seminar method to make presentations to larger groups of people. This was very successful and the company had explosive growth; in the early 2000s it made the magazine [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'s list of the fastest-growing companies in the United States.

Edifi originally priced its services at about $495, and offered a money-back guarantee, if it could not get the family enough additional financial aid to cover its fee. It abandoned the guarantee after having to pay out on some cases.

==Organization==
Edifi was divided into five departments: Sales, Accounting, Reservations, which set up appointments for the seminars, Customer Service, which dealt with the clients and input data from client phone interviews and tax documents to the company's proprietary software (a customized "front end" for [[Microsoft Access]]), and Forms, which was in charge of completing financial aid forms, and whose new hires were tested for their printing ability.

==Marketing==
The company's services were hard to understand and marketing was expensive. In fact, its greatest single expense was postage for marketing materials. John Braat, who had previous experience in a variety of sales and management positions, was Chief Operating Officer and head of the sales department. The company had three teams of commissioned salespeople, many of whom made more than the employees who actually did the work. Braat spent a lot of effort analyzing where seminars (sales meetings) would best be held. It did not market in states with no clear centers of population, such as Montana. For large cities like New York, all three sales teams would work together. The seminars were scheduled so as to avoid hurricane season in the South, and winter storms in the North. Flying the salespeople all around the country was another large expense.

Names of prospects were purchased, from brokers who sold information on college prospects; most were students who had taken the [[College Board]] examinations. Edifi came up with the technique of sending invitations to students - rather than their probably more skeptical parents - to attend a free seminar where they could learn about opportunities for college grants and scholarships. The salespersons were not to lie to the families about what Edifi could do (although sometimes they apparently did). The original contracts were rewritten to say that Edifi had no special "connections" with college financial aid offices and did nothing that parents could not do for themselves, if they put in the time and effort.

==Services==

The first service Edifi offered families was to give estimates of the financial aid a family could expect to receive from whatever colleges it chose, and what the "bottom line" for each of those colleges would be. Behind this was Edifi's ability to find or calculate the true [[cost of attendance]] for each college — since 2011 posted on each college's Web site, by Federal law, but before that often hard to locate, if the figure was public at all. (In those cases Edifi calculated an estimate.) This was intended to help families make good decisions, at least from a financial point of view, of where the child should go to college.

When the student was a senior, Edifi completed the FAFSA, Profiles, state, and college need-based forms and made sure things were submitted at the best times. For example, the FAFSA should be submitted immediately after the applications open, estimating income rather than waiting months until taxes are done before applying. Edifi would submit a second, updating FAFSA once a family's taxes were completed.

When financial aid offers were received, if copies of those were sent to Edifi, it would prepare a written analysis of the offer to make it understandable. (A minority of financial aid award letters were easy to understand, but many were cryptic or outright deceptive, presenting unsubsidized loans as if they were really financial aid.) It would also indicate, based on published information and its own previous experience with the colleges, whether the offer was or was not "reasonable". Many families did not know, and still do not know, that financial aid offers can be appealed. Edifi looked for reasons that an appeal could be filed: because the offer was not in line with the college's offer history (it was not "reasonable"), the family had high medical expenses, loss of income, high debt, and so on. Edifi would write appeal letters which the parents would sign and send to the college. Edifi would analyze the revised offer, if any, and sometimes filed a second appeal if the results of the first were unsatisfactory.

Some clients clearly benefited from Edifi's services and expert advice, and there were a few spectacular successes. For example, a little-known fact that Edifi informed its clients about was that more expensive colleges could actually cost less, because these colleges often had so much financial aid to give out that it more than made up for the higher price. Some families, especially non-English-speaking ones, needed help with the financial aid process and forms. Edifi told the parents what they needed to do and when they needed to do it, and made sure, at least in theory, that things were done on time. However, a student who was going to a local community college, and whose high school would help with the paperwork, got little return on the parents' investment.

Because of the high cost of marketing in a seminar format, to ensure a reasonable return on investment, Edifi marketed its services on a "package" rather than a "menu" basis. One fixed price covered all the services and how many of them the family chose to use depended on which colleges the student applied to and the degree to which the family cooperated with Edifi, sending in needed documents like tax returns and financial aid offers. Not all did.

==Client dissatisfaction==

About one-third of the clients thought that they had made a great decision contracting with Edifi, enrolled their younger children, and got their friends to sign up, thereby receiving a discount on renewals of their service for the students' sophomore and later years. Another third was not as enthusiastic, but felt that they had at least gotten what they paid for. The last third felt they had been ripped off.

Edifi had to deal with a constant stream of charge-backs from credit card companies, complaints filed with [[Better Business Bureaus]] (which gave Edifi an "F" rating, because of its marketing), and whose investigations Edifi took seriously,&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Thomas, "Caution urged with contracts. PHS counselor wary of groups offering college assistance", ''Palatka Daily News", September 1, 2000, http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=180017309&amp;page_url=//www.palatkadailynews.com/pages/09012000/phs.html&amp;page_last_updated=2001-08-02T06:49:52&amp;firstName=John&amp;lastName=Braat, consulted 6/1/2015&lt;/ref&gt;  investigations by attorneys general, angry high school guidance counselors who said they did everything Edifi did, but for free (which most do not), and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Complaint Review: Edifi Financial Services, http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/edifi-financial-services/albany-new-york-12205/edifi-financial-services-ready-set-college-low-down-dirty-liars-riiippp-ooofff-high-sc-183125, retrieved 3/6/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also many "exposés" in newspapers and on television, most of which mistakenly believed Edifi was a "scholarship search" service, which it was not.&lt;ref&gt;"I-team Examines Offers for College Financial Aid", http://edumacation.com/EdifiCollegeFinancialAidServicesWrcb, retrieved 3/6/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edumacation.com/EdifiCollegeFinancialAidServicesAlertClayWv, retrieved 3/7/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edumacation.com/EdifiCollegeFinancialAidServicesAlertBostonLatin, retrieved 3/7/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"7NEWS Investigates: Promises Of Financial Aid", May 6, 2002, http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/7news-investigates-promises-of-financial-aid, retrieved 3/7/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edumacation.com/EdificCollegeFinancialAidServicesOpinion, retrieved 3/7/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Kormanik, "Financial aid service disappoints student. Little help comes despite hefty fee," (Jacksonville, Florida) ''[[The Florida Times-Union|Times-Union]]'', July 23, 2003, http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/072303/met_13092582.shtml#.VW7vCHD3arU, retrieved 6/1/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brianna Lange, "BBB: Be wary of college aid service. Company says it offers more than just filling out a free application," ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', May 9, 2008, http://archive.sltrib.com/printfriendly.php?id=9200413&amp;itype=ngpsid, retrieved 6/1/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Under New York State law, a three-day (later, five-day) "cooling-off period" was required when a contract was made, during which time the contract could be canceled without penalty. After this period, Edifi rarely made refunds. Compounding the problem was when Edifi sold its services to [[undocumented immigrants]] who were ineligible for federal student aid and in most states, state student aid. Some parents did not know English and did not understand the contract they signed; however, under New York law the contract was still valid.

==The Client Services Department==
The department which interacted with the clients - interviewing them, gathering and processing their documents - was the Client Services Department. It was also this department that analyzed financial aid offers (arguably Edifi's most important service) and wrote appeals when appropriate. Translating the information gathered and input by Client Services into filled-out FAFSAs, CSS Profiles, and college financial aid forms was done by a different and much quieter department, Forms. As a quality control and check against errors, all completed work had to be proofed by a different employee.

The workers who actually did the work were primarily college students paid an hourly wage ($9.00 to $10.00 an hour in 2003). Turnover was high and morale was low. Many quit when they learned what Edifi did and what its reputation was. Katzberg was universally perceived as an abrasive, unsupportive manager; a former, angry employee described her online as "Hitler in a ball gown", and her and Braat as "borderline con artists".&lt;ref&gt;http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/564250-is-edifi-college-financial-aid-services-a-scam.html, consulted 6/1/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The company was uninterested in retaining experienced workers, who would have improved service but would have had to have been given raises.
 	
While it was not a deliberate policy (though it had the side effect of increasing the owner's profit), the company had difficulty retaining enough workers to service all its clients, and some clients did not receive the services they paid for. Other families did not use all, or any, of the services, ignoring or not noticing the notices (sometimes in the form of newsletters) Edifi sent through the mail. If the parents sent in documents as requested and called the company regularly to be sure their file was being processed, the company did as good a job as it could. Unfortunately, while documents should have been processed rapidly and without parent phone calls, this was not always the case, and cases in which nothing was done were not rare. One year hundreds of financial aid offers never got analyzed nor appeal letters written (unless parents called to inquire) because Client Services did not have the staff needed. The company did make a full refund to one pair of parents who pursued the matter, for whom nothing had been done as late as April of the student's senior year, although all necessary documents were in the student's file. Many families simply forgot about Edifi, amid everything going on in the senior year.

Edifi did not have a philosophy of ripping people off, and complained bitterly and publicly&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Thomas, "Caution urged with contracts. PHS counselor wary of groups offering college assistance", ''Palatka Daily News", September 1, 2000, http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=180017309&amp;page_url=//www.palatkadailynews.com/pages/09012000/phs.html&amp;page_last_updated=2001-08-02T06:49:52&amp;firstName=John&amp;lastName=Braat, consulted 6/1/2015''&lt;/ref&gt; that it was being unfairly lumped in with out-and-out [[scams]], such as scholarship search services;&lt;ref&gt;"Common Scholarship Scams", http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/scams.phtml, consulted 6/1/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; it pointed out repeatedly that a sign of its good faith was that it did not guarantee any particular result. To the contrary, there was some pride in what was done (much or most of the time), in the many cases in which students were really helped.

==Extra-FAFSA services==
Edifi (Maura Kastberg and Larry Schechter) were constantly looking for additional services they could provide other than filling out the FAFSA and other financial aid forms. These included:

* Newsletters, whenever Kastberg found time to write one. These gave financial aid reminders and tips.
* Handbooks for each year in high school, with things to be thought of or worked on for each year.
* An on-line guidance counselor, who would respond to questions posted. Guidance counselor questions were answered by staff, there was no one guidance counselor.
* A college search engine (a leased service).
* Online SAT preparation and sample tests (also not an in-house product, acquired through a cooperative relationship with a major college prep company).

The reason behind the push for non-FAFSA services was in part for marketing purposes but also because so many students did not take the proper high school classes that would best prepare them, or were required, for college and result, in some cases, in greater financial aid eligibility.

== The end of Edifi==

Larry Schechter had dreams of enlarging the company: by partnering with financial planners, for example. In 2002 Schechter sold the company to two investors who hoped to make money by reselling it to the Princeton Review. This sale never took place and the investors returned the company to Schechter's care.

The price of services went from $495 to $595, then to $795, $995, $1095, $1195, $1295, and $1595 over a 20 year period. Additional students in the same family were first $150, then $195, $295, and $495. In 2011 Edifi was faced with a national recession, increased air fares because of oil price increases, inability to raise prices further (price resistance), and the impracticality of automating an online application, as opposed to a paper FAFSA that came out of the computer printer in seconds.  Maura Kastberg wanted to transfer FAFSA application data electronically, even before the FAFSA was put on line, but the Department of Education refused this.

Faced with this situation, the company ceased selling new contracts, terminated most employees, moved back to Schenectady, and limited its activities to servicing contracts which had already been sold. As of 2015 it is out of business, and no longer has a Web site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16494">'''Education in the [[Czech Republic]]''' includes [[elementary school]], [[secondary school]], and [[Higher education|post-secondary school]]. For students ages two to five, there are [[preschool]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that are generally not state-funded until the year before elementary school. After preschool, parents are not charged for tuition, but they must provide textbooks, stationery, and food for their children. A number of private schools exist across the country, but these schools are largely financially inaccessible for most children. There is an ongoing national discussion regarding the introduction of tuition fees for university education.

Elementary school is mandatory for children from ages six to fifteen. After that, some students leave formal education altogether, while other students attend a professional or vocational school. Enrolment in public schools is fairly high&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|title=Education at a Glance 2014: Czech Republic|date=2014|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/Czech%20Republic-EAG2014-Country-Note.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though these figures do not document active student engagement. Attendance among [[Romani people|Romani]] children is generally much lower than other Czech children due to their parents not sending them to school or not ability to speak in Czech language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Amnesty International|title=Must try harder: Ethnic discrimination of Romani children in Czech schools|date=2015|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR7113532015ENGLISH.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Czech's education system is governed by the [[Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports]] and had a budget of €4.6 billion in 2016.

== Elementary School ==
Elementary school ({{lang-cs|základní škola}}) consists of nine grades grouped into two stages.

=== First Stage ===
The first stage covers the first five years of formal education. Classes are taught by a single teacher, although there is sometimes a separate foreign language or physical education teacher. The subjects taught are Czech and include one foreign language (usually English), mathematics, computer science, history, geography, science, art, music, physical education, and handcrafts. There is usually a first stage school in every village; in small villages, several grades may be taught in one class.

=== Second Stage ===
The next four years of elementary school form the second stage, the last compulsory stage in education. Subjects taught at this stage include Czech, literature, two foreign languages, mathematics, computer science, history, geography, civics, physics, biology, chemistry, music, art, physical education, and handcrafts. Some of these subjects are only mandatory in grades eight and nine.

Students are either taught in the same elementary school as their first stage, at an eight-year academy ({{lang-cs|osmileté gymnázium}})''),'' or at a six-year academy ({{lang-cs|šestileté gymnázium}}). Continuing at an elementary school is the most popular option today, and six-year academies are quite rare. Some eight-year academies have a specific physical education emphasis, and some six-year academies have their later years almost entirely taught in a foreign language. Grade levels in the second stage are usually called by Latin numbers; year six is ''prima (the first'' in Latin), year seven is ''sekunda,'' and so on. 

== Secondary School ==
Since the 2016/2017 school year, secondary schools that distribute a matura degree upon graduation are required to set an entrance test in mathematics and the Czech language. This test is run by CERMAT, the government agency that also administers the matura. Individual schools can also institute their own separate tests.

=== Vocational School ===
Vocational certificates are given after a two- or three-year course and a final exam, though there are different types of qualifications depending on the profession. There are also two-year vocational courses that do not offer a certificate. Some vocational schools offer an academic matura qualification in addition to the vocational certificate allowing progression to university. These schools last four years like any other school offering the matura, and the student must pass both sets of exams to graduate.

=== Professional school and Lyceum ===
A professional school lasts four years and awards a matura qualification. There is a large variety of industrial and technical skills covered including technical chemistry, electrical engineering, agriculture, internet technology, or business. A lyceum is a professional high school that teaches a more general curriculum; academic subjects like history and geography are taught more thoroughly than in an ordinary professional school. Types of lyceum include technical, pedagogical, medical, scientific, and military (operated in cooperation with the [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Defense]]).

===  Gymnasium ===
Gymnasium is either a continuation of an eight- and six-year academy or part of a four-year grammar school for elementary school graduates. Four-year grammar schools are either generally oriented or focus on physical education. The generally oriented gymnasium schools can decide on a specialization. The subjects are the same as in elementary schools but are obligatory only in grade ten and eleven (mathematics also in grade twelve, Czech and two foreign languages until grade thirteen). Schools can make these subjects obligatory in the two last years of school, or the students can have more elective subjects than the legally required minimum. Gymnasium graduates have no qualification; the aim of this type of school is a preparation for university studies.

===Maturita Exam===
Maturita is the name of the universal leaving qualification of four-year secondary schools and is a requirement for university studies and higher professional schools. It is made up of a number of subjects. Every student must take Czech language and world literature, consisting of a reading and grammar exam, a writing exam, and a literature oral exam. The second subject must be either mathematics or a foreign language (English, German, French, Spanish or Russian, including writing, reading, speaking and listening, to B1 level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]]). The exams for these mandatory subjects are standardized and set by CERMAT. The other two or three exams taken by the student at this time are dictated by the school.

===Special and Practical Schools===
Special schools for developmentally disabled children unable to participate in mainstream elementary education were once common in the Czech Republic. The subjects taught were very limited, meaning that leavers were logistically unable to continue on to all types of secondary education. A student required a reference from an educational psychologist and the agreement of parents to enroll in a special school. However, many children of Romani heritage were made to study at these schools despite lack of disability; due to institutional and social discrimination, Romani students often failed to meet academic standards and were segregated from mainstream public schools&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This system was criticized by [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-83256#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-83256%22%5D%7D|title=CASE OF D.H. AND OTHERS v. THE CZECH REPUBLIC|last=|first=|date=2007-11-13|website=European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special schools were replaced by elementary and practical schools, though the problem of the over-representation of Romani pupils continues. There are elementary practical schools usually taught in the same institution. These teach the equivalent of the first and second stages and one- to two-year secondary courses after the age of fifteen. The education is mainly practical to teach students to be self-sufficient. Meanwhile, "integrated education" of under-performing or mentally handicapped children in ordinary schools with the support of a special teacher is becoming more common.

== Tertiary education ==
On April 7, 1348, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] founded the [[Charles University in Prague|first university in Central Europe]]. The second university in present-day Czech Republic was established in 1576 (see [[Palacký University, Olomouc]]) in an effort to counter weigh the influence of Protestants, who controlled the Prague University and who constituted about 90% of country's population. After the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–38)|Czechoslovak state was established]], a number of other universities were founded, such as [[Masaryk University]]-- the second largest university in the Czech Republic.

=== Higher professional schools ===
Higher professional schools (''vyšší odborná škola, VOŠ'') offer professional tertiary education and are usually connected with professional high schools. Before their graduation, students must take final exams (''absolutorium'') and write a final thesis. Graduates are entitled to use the [[honorific]] "DiS" (''diplomovaný specialista'', specialist with diploma) after their name.

===Universities===
[[File:Sčítání obyvatelstva 2011, 30 měst, vzdělání magisterské.svg|thumb|People with MA degree in the most populated Czech cities]]
{{see also|Academic ranks in the Czech Republic}}{{see also|List of universities in the Czech Republic}}Higher education in the Czech Republic consists of [[Public university|public]] and [[Private university|private universities]], as well as state-run [[Police academy|police]] and [[Military academy|military training academies]]. Czech-language study at public universities is unlimited and free for first-time attendants; however after the age of 26, the attendant will not receive student status from social services and the individual's health insurance will not be state-funded. Czech public universities also host international students, who have the choice of free instruction in Czech or paid instruction in English.

For private universities, annual tuition is between 2,000 and 3,000 euro and for [[Bachelor of Business Administration|BSBA]] and [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] (not accredited by Ministry of Education) study programs cost between 3,000 and 10,000 euro. The perceived quality of education at public  universities is higher than private institutions, as private universities have undergone many scandals in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

:''For an example of a Czech public university governance, see [[Governance of Palacký University]].''

University education takes from 2 to 6 years, depending on the degree of studies:
*'''Bachelor's degree programs''' - lasts usually 3 years, title Bc. (''bakalář'') or BcA. (''bakalář umění'') (only artistic fields of study), Maturita level is required. Students must pass final exam (''státní zkouška'', state exam - despite its name, this exam is not organized by state, but by universities themselves; at some universities required only if the student did not have good notes during his studies) and present their thesis.
*'''Master's degree programs''' - Bachelor's degree required, except of law, pharmacy and 1st stage teaching (5 years programs, maturita required) and medicine (6 years programs, maturita required). They are finished by final exam (''státní zkouška'', for medicine ''státní rigorózní zkouška'') and thesis presentation. Awarded titles:
**Mgr. (''magistr'')
**MgA. (''magistr umění'') - for artistic fields of study
**Ing. (''inženýr'') - for technical and economical fields of study
**Ing. arch. (''inženýr architekt'') - architecture
**MUDr. (''medicinae universalis doctor'') - medicine
**MVDr. (''medicinae veterinariae doctor'') - veterinal medicine
**MDDr. (''medicinae dentium doctor'') - dentist
*'''Doctor study programs''', Ph.D.  title
These titles are granted after a special exam (''rigorózní zkouška''), which contains a thesis presentation. A master's degree is required to write this exam. This a non-comprehensive list titles given to those with doctorate degrees: 
* PhDr. - ''philosophiae doctor'', for philosophy, literature, languages, pedagogic and similar subjects
* JUDr. - ''iuris utriusque doctor'', for law, formerly used also for security studies
* RNDr. - ''rerum naturalium doctor'', for natural sciences
* ThDr./ThLic. - ''theologiae doctor'' / ''theologiae licentiatus'', for theology
* PharmDr. - ''pharmaciae doctor'', for pharmacy
Formerly, also other titles were used:
* PhMr. - ''pharmaciae magister'', for pharmacy, replaced by Mgr. title

'''Emmi Pikler''' (born 9 January 1902 in Vienna; died 6 June 1984 in Budapest, birth name '''Emilie Madleine Reich''') was a Hungarian pediatrician who introduced new theories of [[infant education]], and put them into practice at an [[orphanage]] she ran.

==Life==

Emmi Pikler was born in 1902 and spent her early childhood in Vienna. She was the only child of a Viennese kindergarten teacher and a Hungarian craftsman. In 1908 her parents moved to Budapest. When Pikler was 12 years old, her mother died.

She returned to Vienna to study Medicine, where she received her medical degree in 1927. She received her pediatric training at the Vienna University Children's Hospital by [[Clemens von Pirquet]] and studied pediatric surgery by [[Hans Salzer]].

Pikler's third teacher was her own husband, a mathematician and educator through whose experiences she was confirmed in its development physiological considerations. They decided together, at the birth of her first child, to allow the child freedom of movement and to await her development patiently. At first they lived in Trieste and later in Budapest. In 1935 Pikler qualified as a pediatrician in Hungary. Their goal was to promote the healthy development of the child. From the experience with her daughter, she knew that a child must not be stimulated to movement and to games and that every detail in dealing with the child and their environment is important. Pikler wrote and gave lectures about the care and upbringing of infants and young children. She published her first book for parents in 1940 and it went through several editions in Hungary and other countries.   The ten years that she worked as a family doctor were difficult for them not only because the family was Jewish, but also because her husband was in prison for political reasons from 1936 to 1945. With the help of the parents of the children she cared for, she and her family survived the persecution of Jews during World War II.

After the war she gave birth to two more children. She did not open her private practice again, but worked for a national association for abandoned and malnourished children. In addition to other activities, she founded the [[Lóczy]] orphanage (named after the street where it was located) in 1946, which she headed until 1979. She sought to establish a comforting atmosphere, including careful selection of the staff, to allow children at the orphanage to grow up without the usual institutional damage.

[[Elsa Gindler]] and [[Henry Jacoby]] found in the 1920s that it was essential to understand the natural path of child development in order to allow the child's initial skills and powers to develop. Gindler and Jacoby explained that traditional infant and early childhood education damaged the initiative of children and stunted their development.

In 1946 Pikler founded the [[Lóczy Institute]] in Budapest. Under her leadership, and by the publication of books and scientific publications, an internationally known institution developed that is now managed by Pikler's daughter, child psychologist [[Anna Tardos]]. After Pikler retired in 1978, she continued her scientific and consultative work in Lóczy. In the last years of her life she received in Hungary and other countries. In 1984 Pikler died after a short but severe illness.

Pikler's methods of raising infants and young children have been popularized in the [[United States]] by her student [[Magda Gerber]].

== Project aims ==
'''e-Report''' is generally aimed at setting up a communitarian repertory of reference material with regard to the development of innovative methods in the field of e-learning system for distance learning in [[Vocational education|VET]]. It refers to activities of research, experimentation and analysis with regard to the development of innovative methods and contents in the field of [[e-learning]], aiming at setting up a method of distance learning system, combining the use of ICT with tutoring activities, learning groups and transnational virtual study circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ereport.unipa.it/website |title=The e-Report Official website |access-date=2007-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912062032/http://www.ereport.unipa.it/website/ |archive-date=2007-09-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The specific goals of the project are:
* to analyse the developmental trends of the introduction of the ICT for training/education systems of 4 European countries ([[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Sweden]]);
* to explore the relations between the training and educational supply of the partner countries and the main needs of the national VET systems in the field of e-learning and distance learning;
* to set up a repertory of shared educational and guidance materials and tools, useful for the transnational online education and training;
* to learn how to import standard compatible content in the existing e-learning platforms;
* to optimize a software platform [[Learning Management System|LMS]] for the management via intranet and Internet of the transnational virtual study circle, in which the repertory realised through the project activities will be placed;
* to use in experimental way the reference material for educational and guidance activities in the field of e-learning with students and teachers in order to develop standardized learning solutions in this field, taking account of individual differences in learning, and special needs in education;
* to test the validity of educational/training methods and tools of the  transnational virtual study circle;
* to promote cooperation between [[European Union|EU]] countries, private and public, universities and vocational centres in this field;
* to transfer the developed method to the field of vocational training.

== Description of the Project ==
Four work-packages are contributing to the achievement of the project goals.

=== Work Package 1 ===
'''Work-package 1 (''WP1 - context analysis'')''' is aimed at comparing and studying the developmental trends of online courses in the national VET systems of the partners, a preliminary study will be conducted. From the results of this study, the main needs of the national VET systems will be identified and compared between four European countries.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to accomplish these goals two main actions will be carried out.&lt;br /&gt;
Action 1: to assess the quantitative/qualitative features of the online courses provided by universities and vocational institutes (OB1) through an on-line questionnaire that will be administered to a sample of 60 universities and vocational centers (see table 1). Three kind of questionnaires (6 forms) have been developed:
* Qa (1 &amp; 2) for Responsibles of the online courses of Universities (Q1a) and Vocational Centers (Q2a). It has two sections (Section 1: General information about the U’s or VC’s e-learning policy; Section 2: General information about the on-line courses delivered by the U/VC).
* Qb (1 &amp; 2) for Teachers/Trainers of the online courses of Universities (Q1b) and Vocational Centers (Q2b). It has three sections (Section 1: General information about teacher/trainer; Section 2: Information about the main courses delivered on-line; Section 3: Opinions about on-line training).
* Qc (1 &amp; 2) for Students of the online courses of Universities (Q1c) and Vocational Centers (Q2c). It has three sections (Section 1: General information about student; Section 2: Information about the attended on-line courses; Section 3: Opinions about on-line training).
The questionnaires will be administered to a sample of 150 responsible and teachers/trainers and of 300 students belonging to the countries of the project (see table 2 and 3).
Action 2: to identify the main needs of the students attending Us and VCs with regard to the field of e-learning. A questionnaire will be developed, aimed at assessing: (a) their needs (e.g., enhancement of the use of ICT in their training or the improvement of occasions of virtual mobility), (b) their interests (e. g., the kind of courses they want to be enhanced); (c) their attitudes towards the use of ICT; (d) the influence of the lack of computer-based competencies (e.g. can’t be able to use PC) on attitude towards on-line courses. 
The questionnaire will be administered online and by post to a sample of 320 students selected from the sample of universities and vocational school indicated above, 80 students for each country (50 of universities, 30 of vocational schools) and will be composed in the same ratio of: students who never attended an online course (160) and students who attended an online course at least one time (160). 
Finally, phone interviews with administrators, experts, teachers and trainers (n=52) will be performed, aimed at recognizing some indicators of the need of enhancing the online courses supply of each country.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Work Package 2 ===
'''Work-package 2 (''WP2 - production of guidance and educational tools'')''' is aimed at producing educational, guidance and training materials in digital format, suitable for the distance learning via the Internet and combining methodologies such as e-tutoring, peer-tutoring, learning groups and transnational virtual study circles. This set of materials (4 videos and 10 online courses) will be produced on the basis of the international exchange and the dissemination of good practices for the development of methods and tools in the field of distance learning.&lt;br /&gt;
The video will be 20 minutes long and will introduce the University’ e-learning and Erasmus project offers. It will be divided in chapter and will be available through the Internet, using the webTV streaming television channel, developed by the University of Palermo, but also on DVD to be suitable for students in home players. The on-line streaming version of the video will be made available using Open Source file format to improve quality and shareability of the content itself.&lt;br /&gt;
Each University will produce two courses, built around the e-learning concept, to be used on a LMS platform stressing  on two main educational aspects:
# the development group will check the typology and the quality of the teaching files, according to the new media adopted;
# at the same time, the main stress will be on the interaction between users and activities that will be made on-line.
On the basis of what agreed by each partner, tutoring will be the key factor of each e-learning action developed during the project.&lt;br /&gt;
The University of Palermo has released a specialized version of its own LMS, named Tutorfad (based on the [[Moodle]] LMS), to let the E-report group has its own development and exchange platform and to test the courses developed during the project.

=== Work Package 3 ===
'''Work-package 3 (''WP3 - testing and evaluation'')''', the shared repertory of guidance and educational materials and methods will be tested with a sample of teachers and students through the use of the LMS (based on Moodle). Furthermore, the transferability of the repertory to the field of vocational training will be experienced.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to accomplish these goals two main actions will be carried out.
* Action 1: testing of the repertory with a sample of 120 students attending the courses of the universities of the partnership. For each course (8), a target group of 15 students (10 student belonging to the country that developed the course and 5 belonging to the other countries of the partnership - “virtual mobility students”). In order to enhance the motivation of the students towards the experimentation of these virtual mobility processes, the courses attended will be recognized through a system of credit transfer (e.g. ECTS). The results of the testing phase will contribute to define the final configuration of the LMS and of the repertory of the transnational virtual study circle.
* Action 2: the repertory will be experienced also with a sample of students attending online courses of vocational training centers. For this purpose, 5 among vocational centers, organizations (belonging to Italy, Austria, Spain, Romania and Sweden) will select a course from the repertory; the on-line course will be tested to a sample of 15 people belonging to the target group of centre (total sample n = 75). At the end of testing the results will be assessed in order to understand the opportunity to generalize and transfer the repertory to the vocational training field.

=== Work Package 4 ===
'''Work-package 4 (''Valorisation Plan'')'''. The project foresees a valorization plan during its entire life, composed by different activities of exploitation and dissemination of intermediate and final results. 
As regards Exploitation the following actions will be carried out: administration of questionnaires and evaluation schedules; analysis of the needs of the students, trainers/teachers, administrators (see WP1); realization of forum groups among teachers, experts and tutors; realization of forum groups among students; testing of the project’s repertory, the evaluation and the monitoring of the training methods in U &amp; VT; realization of focus groups with the end users; stakeholders involvement and consultation.&lt;br /&gt;
As regards Dissemination: Reports (local, national and transnational); Participation to conferences (local, national and international); Transnational meetings in each nation of the partnership; Web sites; Scientific publications (national and transnational), such as monograph, publications in reviews and journals; the realisation of guidance activities (e.g., guidance videos; guidance centre in the platform), aimed at promoting the project’s output too; the realisation of a biannual e-newsletter in English language (published in the web-site); The distribution of CD/DVDs (1 CD/DVD aimed at presenting the project, in English and in the partners languages; 4 guidance CD/DVDs aimed at presenting the online courses and international exchange programs of U).

'''Eugénie Luce''' (1804-1882) was a French educator, who she founded the first French/Arab school for Muslim girls the [[Luce Ben Aben School]] in [[Algiers]] in 1845.

==Biography==

Eugénie Luce moved to [[Algiers]] in the 1830s, where she became a governess. She left behind her husband and family in France.{{sfn|Rogers|2013|p=}}

===Luce Ben Aben School===
&lt;!-- The Wikipedia article [[Luce Ben Aben School]] redirects here. --&gt;

Eugénie Luce started the Luce Ben Aben School, in 1845.&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; It was the first Franco-Arab school for [[Muslim]] girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Rebecca |date=1 January 2012 |title=A l'école arabe de Mme Luce  |trans-title=At the Arab school of Mrs. Luce |url=http://www.histoire.presse.fr/mensuel/371/a-l-ecole-arabe-de-mme-luce-01-01-2012-41664 |language=french |journal=L'Histoire |accessdate=13 December 2013 |issue=371 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; dispensing a European-style education. Girls learned French,Arabic, arithmetic, embroidery, geography and sewing. The school was funded by the [[French Algeria]] government until 1861, after which it became a [[trade school]]. They taught [[embroidery]] and other subjects in order to educate the girls in traditional Algerian crafts, at a time when these crafts were being replaced by machine-made imports.&lt;ref name="WDL 8800"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8800/ |title = Luce Ben Aben School of Arab Embroidery I, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WDL 8803"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8803/ |title = Luce Ben Aben School of Arab Embroidery II, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These goods were exported throughout Algeria, as well as Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt;

The school was forced to close on 1 January 1846 because of  lack of financial support from the local French government.
Eugénie went to Paris to ask for help from the central government, after having managed to get support for school, it was reopened in June 1846. In January 1847 the French government formally agreed to support the school.&lt;ref name="trc-leiden.nl"&gt;https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/people-and-functions/authors-scholars-and-activists/madame-eugenie-luce-1804-1882&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858 she had over 120 pupils of different age groups. This school produced skilled embroideresses, who appeared in the London Exhibition of 1862, in the Algerian Pavilion of the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition at Chicago.&lt;ref name="trc-leiden.nl"/&gt;

The school continued under Madame Luce's daughter and later her granddaughter, Madame Luce Ben-Aben.

'''Eye movement in reading''' involves the [[visual processing]] of written text. This was described by the French [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Louis Émile Javal]] in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements ([[saccade]]s) intermingled with short stops ([[Fixation (visual)|fixations]]). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of [[eye movement]] in the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of [[human behaviour]] and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record, and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of [[cognitive psychology]] as a theoretical and methodological framework within which [[reading (process)|reading]] processes are examined. Sereno &amp; Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through recordings of eye movement and [[event-related potential]].

== History ==

Until the second half of the 19th century, researchers had at their disposal three methods of investigating eye movement. The first, unaided observation, yielded only small amounts of data that would be considered unreliable by today's scientific standards. This lack of reliability arises from the fact that eye movement occurs frequently, rapidly, and over small angles, to the extent that it is impossible for an experimenter to [[perceive]] and record the data fully and accurately without technological assistance. The other method was [[self-observation]], now considered to be of doubtful status in a scientific context. Despite this, some knowledge appears to have been produced from [[introspection]] and naked-eye observation. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham|Ibn al Haytham]], a medical man in 11th-century Egypt, is reported to have written of reading in terms of a series of quick movements and to have realised that readers use [[peripheral vision|peripheral]] as well as [[Fovea centralis|central vision]].&lt;ref&gt;Heller (1988:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eye Line of sight.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo da Vinci: The eye has a central line and everything that reaches the eye through this central line can be seen distinctly.]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) may have been the first in Europe to recognize certain special optical qualities of the eye. He derived his insights partly through introspection but mainly through a process that could be described as optical modelling. Based on dissection of the human eye he made experiments with water-filled crystal balls. He wrote "The function of the human eye, ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. But I found it to be completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo da Vinci (1955), das Lebensbild eines Genies, Emil Vollmer Verlag, Wiesbaden Berlin. Dokumentation der Davinci Ausstellung in Mailand 1938, p. 430; cited in 'Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude'  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the "line-of-sight", the optical line that ends at the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal vision (a more precise term for central vision) and [[peripheral vision]]. However, Leonardo did not know that the retina is the sensible layer, he still believed that the lens is the organ of vision.

There appear to be no records of eye movement research until the early 19th century. At first, the chief concern was to describe the eye as a [[physiological]] and mechanical moving object, the most serious attempt being [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s major work ''Handbook of physiological optics'' (1866). The physiological approach was gradually superseded by interest in the [[psychological]] aspects of visual input, in eye movement as a functional component of visual tasks.

The subsequent decades saw more elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including a claim that meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Pollatsek, &amp; Alexander (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the French [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Louis Émile Javal]] used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term [[saccade]]s. In 1898, Erdmann &amp; Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.

=== Early tracking technology ===

[[Eye tracking device]] is a tool created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of [[electromagnetic energy]] was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare was the first to use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamare |first1=M. |title=Des mouvements des yeux pendants la lecture |journal=Comptes rendus de la société française d'ophthalmologie |date=1893 |pages=35–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Edmund B. Delabarre]] invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a [[stylus]] with a direct mechanical connection to the [[cornea]].&lt;ref&gt;Delabarre (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used from the end of the 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps.

Mechanical systems suffered three serious disadvantages: questionable accuracy due to slippage of the physical connection, the considerable discomfort caused to participants by the direct mechanical connection (and consequently great difficulty in persuading people to participate), and issues of [[ecological validity]], since participants' experience of reading in trials was significantly different from the normal reading experience. Despite these drawbacks, mechanical devices were used in eye movement research well into the 20th century.

Attempts were soon made to overcome these problems. One solution was to use electromagnetic energy rather than a mechanical connection. In the "Dodge technique", a beam of light was directed at the cornea, focused by a system of lenses and then recorded on a moveable photographic plate. Erdmann &amp; Dodge&lt;ref&gt;Erdmann B &amp; Dodge R (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; used this technique to claim that there is little or no perception during saccades, a finding that was later confirmed by Utall &amp; Smith using more sophisticated equipment. The photographic plate in the Dodge technique was soon replaced with a film camera, but was still plagued by problems of accuracy, due to the difficulty of keeping all parts of the equipment perfectly aligned throughout a trial and accurately compensating for the distortion caused by the diffractive qualities of photographic lenses. In addition, it was usually necessary to restrain a participant's head by using an uncomfortable bite-bar or head-clamp.

In 1922, Schott pioneered a further advance called [[electro-oculography]] (EOG), a method of recording the electrical potential between the cornea and the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;Schott E (1922).&lt;/ref&gt; Electrodes may be covered with special contact paste before being placed on the skin. So, it is now unnecessary to make incisions in patient's skin. Common misconception about EOG is that measured potential is the electromyogram of [[extraocular muscles]]. In fact, it is only the projection of eye dipole to the skin, because higher frequencies, corresponding to EMG, are filtered out. EOG delivered considerable improvements in accuracy and reliability, which explain its continued use by experimentalists for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Preston, &amp; Fuchs (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Zhou, Hu (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tecce, Pok, Consiglio, O'Neil (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern eye tracking ==

Four major cognitive systems are involved in eye movement during reading: language processing, attention, vision, and oculomotor control.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~perfetti/Eye%20Movements%20During%20Reading.htm |title=Eye Movements During Reading |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eye trackers bounce near [[infrared]] light off the interior of the eyeball, and monitor the reflection on the eye to determine gaze location. With this technique, the position of a fixation on a screen can be precisely determined.&lt;ref&gt;wang (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Wang (2011) mentioned that a video-based eye-tracker which uses video cameras to record the eye position of human subjects—recording pupil dilation and eye movement—can be used to examine how fixations, saccades, and pupil dilation responses are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices. According to Wang (2011:185), "understanding the relationship between these observables can help us to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in. This is because fixations and saccades (matched with information shown on screen) indicate how people acquire information (and what they see), time lengths of fixations indicate attention, and pupil dilation responses indicate emotion, arousal, stress, pain, or cognitive load." {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--not thrilled with the strict categories Wang implies--&gt;

== Saccades ==

[[Image:Reading VOG hor.gif|thumb|right|Horizontal eye movement in reading. Left-to-right movement may be seen as "upstairs", and right-to-left saccades are clear.]]
Skilled readers move their eyes during reading on the average of every quarter of a second. During the time that the eye is fixated, new information is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200–250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms.&lt;ref&gt;Sereno &amp; Rayner (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, &amp; Seidenberg (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Slattery, Belanger (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but only recently have researchers begun to look at eye movement behavior as a reflection of [[cognitive processing]] during reading.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner K (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EyeFixationsReading.gif|frame|center|A diagram demonstrating the [[Visual acuity|acuity]] of foveal vision in reading]]
The lower line of text simulates the acuity of vision with the relative acuity percentages. The difficulty of recognizing text increases with the distance from the fixation point.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dyslexia ==
People with [[dyslexia]] generally suffer from a decreased reading speed, which can be caused by many different variables. There are many remedies to try and combat these deficits, depending on what [[Biological theories of dyslexia|biological theory of dyslexia]] they are based on. One such idea is based on magnocellular deficit, where [[magnocellular pathway]]s are uncoordinated, causing the skipping or re-reading of lines.&lt;ref&gt;Stein J., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11305228 The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia] Dyslexia. 2001 Jan–Mar;7(1):12–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer models of eye movement in reading ===
Competition–interaction theory and SERIF emphasise low level oculomotor processes in reading such as how the word length of the currently fixated word and its neighbour words affect saccade amplitude and latency (or fixation duration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(01)00025-6|title=Eye movements during reading: A theory of saccade initiation times|journal=Vision Research|volume=41|issue=25–26|pages=3567–3585|year=2001|last1=Yang|first1=S.-N|last2=McConkie|first2=G.W}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Current reference is only for competition-interaction theory}} Reader, EMMA, E-Z Reader and SWIFT emphasise higher level cognitive processes such as lexical processing, word frequency, word parsing or word predictability.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The '''Framework for Authentic Intellectual Work''' ('''AIW''') is an evaluative tool used by educators of all subjects at the elementary and secondary levels to assess the quality of classroom instruction, assignments, and student work. The framework was founded by Dr. Dana L. Carmichael, Dr. M. Bruce King, and Dr. Fred M. Newmann. The purpose of the framework is to promote student production of genuine and rigorous work that resembles the complex work of adults. Consequently, the framework identifies three main criteria for student learning (construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school), and provides standards accompanied by scaled rubrics for classroom instruction, assignments, and student work. The standards and rubrics are meant to support teachers in the promotion of genuine and rigorous work, as well as guide [[professional development]] and [[collaboration]].

==Authentic Intellectual work (Background)==

Authentic intellectual work refers to the complex work adults do to make informed decisions and accomplish tasks. It involves original application of knowledge and skills, rather than simply routine use of facts and procedures. Therefore, for students, authentic intellectual work results in a product or presentation that has meaning or value beyond the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many students, the work they perform in schools entails memorization of facts and algorithms, and can fail to relate to the work they will need to do as an adult. The disconnect between the material studied at school and the skills needed to perform well in one’s work, personal, or civic life can make school work seem meaningless or worthless. Learning tasks call for specific memorized information, retrieval of given information, or application of routine computational procedures, but rarely do they call for higher-level thinking, interpretation, or in-depth conceptual understanding. Schoolwork is regarded largely as a series of contrived exercises necessary to earn credentials (grades, promotions) required for future success, but for many, especially poor students of color, this work leads to disengagement and [[High school dropouts in the United States|dropping out]]. However, most jobs, personal matters and civic actions require [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] skills, in-depth understanding of problems and specific skills, and the ability to communicate in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Framework ==
The framework aims to prepare students for the intellectual challenges of work, civic participation, and life by maximizing expectations for intellectual [[Rigour|rigor]] for all students, encouraging in-depth understanding of content, and increasing student interest in academic work. This is made evident through its three main criteria for student learning: construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school.

The construction of knowledge refers to solving problems by organizing, interpreting, evaluating or [[wikt:synthesis|synthesizing]] prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplined inquiry involves gathering a knowledge base of relevant vocabulary, facts, concepts, algorithms, theories, and basic skills, gaining developing a deeper understanding by identifying, proposing, and testing relationships among key fact, events, concepts, rules, and claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, value beyond school acknowledges the necessity for students to present their knowledge in a variety of complex forms of communication to resemble real life work. To meet this criteria students use verbal, symbolic, graphic, and visual tools to explain, narrate, justify, and converse about a topic. The more each of these criteria, construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school, are met, the more “[[wikt:authentic|authentic]]” the work of the student.

== Summary of Research ==

From 1990-2003 researchers completed studies at [[Wisconsin Center for Education Research]] at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Minnesota, and the Consortium on Chicago School Research. The scoring rubrics described above were used to assess the quality of student work in (list demographics). Students who received higher levels of instruction and assessment showed higher achievement, both on direct assessments of authentic intellectual performance and on traditional standardized tests. Results were positive and consistent in grades 3-12 across different subject areas regardless of students’ [[race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], or [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their research was performed in response to their belief in a lack of [[Rigour|rigor]] and [[relevance]] in educational reforms that encouraged the teaching of basic skills and ability to recall knowledge. Researchers believed low expectations existed for intellectual challenge, especially for students from typically disadvantaged backgrounds, along with a lack of [[student engagement]], and an emphasis on breadth of knowledge rather than mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers argued that since cognitively integrated knowledge is more likely to be internalized and retained by students, it is more likely to be remembered and correctly applied on standardized tests than knowledge memorized as discrete items only for the purpose of repeating it when called upon. (27) Since demands for authentic intellectual work pose questions of interest to students in their lives beyond school, students are more likely to care about both the questions they study and the answers they learn. Thus, such assignments enhance a student’s willingness to put forth serious effort in learning the material, as compared to exercises that have no personal meaning beyond completing an assignment to please the teacher or to attain a promotion. In sum, assignments that demand more authentic intellectual work elicit intensive thinking about and a deeper engagement in varied applications of words, concepts, and ideas. This can help students to internalize understandings as their own, and to use this knowledge to respond to items on conventional tests that may not have been explicitly covered in class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards for Scoring Rubrics==

The framework provides standards for classroom instruction, assignments, and student work based on the three criteria for authentic intellectual work (construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school). Each standard is accompanied by a scoring [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] for evaluating a teacher’s promotion of authentic intellectual work for their students in the classroom. Standardized rubrics provide teachers with a common language and vision for learning, can help teachers reflect on the practice, and become useful tools for [[professional development]] and collaboration. While the rubrics are meant to guide instruction to help teachers improve the authentic intellectual quality of student learning, they are not meant to be used as a comprehensive evaluative tool. They do not concern other aspects of teaching that may be valuable to schools.

===Standards for Instruction===

* '''Standard 1''': Higher order thinking (HOT)
Students are required students to manipulate information and ideas in ways that transform their meaning and implication. This occurs when students combine facts and ideas in order to synthesize, generalize, explain, hypothesize, or arrive at some conclusion or interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Standard 2''': Deep knowledge
Knowledge is deep when, instead of trying to learn or expressing only fragmented pieces of information, students encounter and express details, distinctions, nuances, and different applications of central concepts aimed toward integrated or holistic understandings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Standard 3''': Substantive Conversation
Students engage in extended conversational exchanges with the teacher and/or their peers about subject matter in a way that builds an improved and shared understanding of ideas or topics.

Substantive conversation has three features: 
# talk is about subject matter in the discipline and includes higher order thinking;   
# the conversation includes sharing ideas and is not completely scripted or controlled by one party (as in teacher-led recitation);   
# the dialogue builds coherently on participants’ ideas to promote improved collective understanding of a theme or topic.  This is called a sustained conversation.
 
Newman, Carmichael, and King (2007) identify a "sustained conversation" as having at least three consecutive interchanges between participants. The interchanges need not be between the same two people, but they must be linked substantively as consecutive responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Standard 4''': Connections to the world beyond the classroom
Students make connections between substantive knowledge and public problems or personal experiences they are likely to have faced or will face in the future. 
According to Newmann, Carmichael, and King (2007) lessons can have value for students school success by:
# addressing an actual public problem of some contemporary significance
# building on students’ personal experiences to teach important ideas in the disciplines
# having students communicate their knowledge to others beyond the classroom in ways that assist or influence others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards for Assignments===

* '''Standard 1''': Construction of Knowledge
The assignment asks students to organize and interpret information in addressing a concept, problem, or issue relevant to the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Standard 2''': Elaborated Written Communication 
The assignment asks students to elaborate on their understanding, explanations, or conclusions through extended writing in the relevant discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* '''Standard 3''': Connection to Students’ Lives 
The assignment asks students to address a concept, problem, or issue in the relevant discipline that is similar to one that they have encountered or are likely to encounter in their daily lives outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newmann|first1=Fred M.|last2=King|first2=M. Bruce|last3=Carmichael|first3=Dana L.|title=Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects|date=2007|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|location=Des Moines, IA|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards for Evaluating Student Work===
It is not as possible to tell whether student performance will have value beyond school. Therefore, the rubrics and standards for student work only reflect the first two criteria, construction of knowledge and disciplined inquiry.

==The challenges of Implementing AIW==

According to a [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210917/http://www.sai-iowa.org/Resources/Authentic%20Intellectual%20Work%20Evaluation%20final-final%201-18-12.docx study] performed by Dr. Liz Winstien for the Iowa Department of Education on the initial findings of the implementation of AIW in Iowa school districts, a major challenge for using the framework is the amount of time it requires for teacher training on the rubrics and foundational principles of the framework. Also, the framework is meant to be a collaborative tool that teachers use to give and receive feedback on their instruction and student work. This can be an uncomfortable experience for some teachers. It may take time for teachers to become accustomed to sustaining a focused dialogue that critiques teacher instruction and student work. The study also noted that the framework may be more useful in certain academic disciples. For example, an Iowa Math teacher commented that math students have many fundamental skills to learn first, and incorporating elaborated conversation is less natural for the math-learning environment. An Art teacher had similar feelings. Additionally, administrators mentioned AIW doesn’t have a substantial amount of research behind it that supports its positive effects on students learning, which makes it more challenging to convince schools boards to fund its implementation.  Finally, administrators also commented on the challenge they face keeping teachers motivated to continue having worthwhile dialogue centered around the rubrics once they become accustomed to the framework and the feedback sessions become routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iowa Department of Education|title=An Initial Evaluation of the Iowa DE Project to Enhance Students' Authentic Intellectual Work|date=Fall 2011|publisher=Iowa Department of Education|pages=8–9|url=http://www.sai-iowa.org/Resources/Authentic%20Intellectual%20Work%20Evaluation%20final-final%201-18-12.docx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] [[Ordinary Level]] qualification. An O-level is a qualification of its own right, but more often taken in prerequisite for the more in-depth and academically rigorous [[Advanced Level (SL)|Advanced Level]] exams. It is usually taken by students during the final two years of [[Education in Sri Lanka#Secondary|Senior secondary school]] (Grade 10 &amp; 11 (usually ages 15–16)) or external (non-school) candidate. The exams are held in three mediums [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]].

===Contraction and release===
The fundamental movement of Graham technique is the cycle between "contraction" and subsequent "release", which developed as a stylized representation of [[breathing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaMothe|first1=Kimerer L.|title=Nietzsche's Dancers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and the Revaluation of Christian Values|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781403977267|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gubFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the "fall and recovery" dualism of [[Doris Humphrey]]'s technique, it is one of the most important concepts in early modern dance.&lt;ref name="Foulkes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia L. Foulkes|title=Modern Bodies: Dance and American Modernism from Martha Graham to Alvin Ailey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpia9O6Da_EC&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-6202-5|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CraineMackrell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Debra Craine|author2=Judith Mackrell|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42g8Hp-xA48C&amp;pg=PA196|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-956344-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

A classic Graham contraction is a movement originating from the deep [[pelvic floor|pelvic&amp;nbsp;muscles]]. These muscles, along with the [[Abdomen#Muscles|abdominal muscles]], pull the [[human vertebral column|spine]] into a [[:wikt:concave|concave]] arc from the [[coccyx]] to the [[nape]] of the neck, with the pelvis tucked and shoulders forward.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Lisa Rado |last=Reynolds | first=Dee |chapter=Dancing Free: Women's Movements in Early Modern Dance | title=Modernism, Gender, and Culture: A Cultural Studies Approach | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-136-51553-8 | pages=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bannerman99" /&gt; The spine grows longer, not shorter, in a contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macel |first1=Emily |title=Interview with Terese Capucilli |journal=Dance Magazine |date=July 2009 |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/july-2009/Terese-Capucilli |accessdate=12 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402193454/http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/july-2009/Terese-Capucilli |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The force of the contraction can be used to move the body through space or change its trajectory.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; The release may be considered a relatively passive return to a "normal" state, or alternatively an equally active outward propulsion of energy.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Terry | first=W. | title=I was there: selected dance reviews and articles--1936-1976 | publisher=Audience Arts | series=The Dance program | year=1978 | isbn=978-0-8247-6524-8 |pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction is associated with the exhale, and the release with the inhale, although this connection may be merely conceptual.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt;

The [[Indexicality|indexical]] meaning of the contraction in Graham's choreography is generally that the dancer is overcome with emotion, although the details depend on the specific context.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;

Graham's decision to make movement originate from the core rather than [[distal]]ly echoes the style of [[Isadora Duncan]], but Duncan wrote in [[My Life (Isadora Duncan autobiography)|her autobiography]] that movement originates in the [[solar plexus]] rather than the low abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Pearl |authorlink=Pearl Lang | editor=Horosko, M. | title=Martha Graham: The Evolution of Her Dance Theory and Training, 1926-1991 | publisher=Chicago Review Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-1-55652-142-3 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Spiraling===
The second fundamental concept in Graham technique is the [[spiral]]. The basic "spiraling" position consists of rotating the spine approximately 45° around its vertical axis, so that a dancer facing the front of the stage would have their shoulders aligned with the "Via Triumphalis", an imaginary line parallel to a corner-to-corner diagonal of the stage.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt; In a "hip spiral", the movement initiates subtly from the [[hip]] and builds to maximum tension by pulling the opposing [[scapula|shoulder blade]] away from the initiating hip.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;

===Falls===
{{quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|width=20%|align=right|salign=right
|quote="Falling is not a literal representation of reality, but instead an embodiment of inner experience; not a reductive language, but a poetic language that derives its meaning from the layering of the physical and psychic."
|source=Former Graham dancer Ellen Graff, 2004&lt;ref name="Graff" /&gt;
}}
Like other early modern choreographers, Graham used [[floorwork]] to explore the themes of weight and gravity in new ways;&lt;ref name="Graff"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Graff | first=Ellen | title=When your heart falls: The drama of descent in Martha Graham's technique and theater | journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory | volume=14 | issue=1 | year=2004 | pages=107–115 | url=http://marthagraham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Falling-by-Ellen-Graff.pdf | doi=10.1080/07407700408571443}}&lt;/ref&gt; European students were "shocked" when [[Anna Sokolow]] introduced them to Graham's "percussive" falling techniques in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Partsch-Bergsohn"&gt;{{cite book | last=Partsch-Bergsohn | first=I. | title=Modern Dance in Germany and the United States: Crosscurrents and Influences | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | series=Choreography and Dance Studies Series | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-134-35821-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecn9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Graham falls use contractions and manipulate the body's [[center of gravity]], in order to control the timing and direction of a fall.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; There are a wide range of strictly codified Graham falls, including sitting and traveling falls; falls from elevation; and standing falls, which may be directed forward, backwards, to the side, or into a split.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; In almost all falls, the dancer exerts a strong upward force to counteract the force of gravity and suspend the body in space for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt;

Graham falls can be used for dramatic effect, taking meaning in a choreographic context from manipulating the balance between actively suspending the body and surrendering to gravity.&lt;ref name="Graff" /&gt;

===Other aspects===
Graham technique uses the [[hand]]s in distinctive ways. They are generally meant to be active and purposeful, not decorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Ann|title=Critical Gestures: Writings on Dance and Culture|date=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819565662|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_g6IG0HIhoC&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Graham%20technique%22%20hands&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often held in a stylized, cupped position, with the fingers held straight and pulled towards the palm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guest|first1=Ann Hutchinson|title=Your Move|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135800055|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2ezz6bEvcAC&amp;pg=PA89}} (with illustration of Graham-contracted hand)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Eric N.|title=Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery|date=2012|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736067898|page=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC&amp;lpg=PA333&amp;dq=%22Graham%20technique%22%20hands%20feet&amp;pg=PA333}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arm]]s typically move in response to impetus from the back or shoulders. Arm movements were often left unspecified in Graham's early work, and there is variation between Graham teachers' use of ''[[port de bras]]'' (carriage of the arms).&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Analysis==

Graham technique is designed to make its dancers expressive and dramatic.

The technique's "earthbound" and "assertive" character initially drew strong criticism. In a "vehement" 1934 review, [[Lincoln Kirstein]] wrote: "Her jumps are jolts; her walks, limps and staggers; her runs, blind impulsive gallops; her bends, sways," and called the effect "stark, earth-ridden, gaunt, inward-eyed."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kane |first= Angela |title= Episodes (1959): Entente Cordiale? |journal= Dance Research |volume=25 |issue=1 |issn= 1750-0095 |pages= 54–72 |doi=10.1353/dar.2007.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Graham was strongly promoted by dance critic [[John Martin (dance critic)|John Martin]], who helped her to win a popular following.&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;{{cite book | last=Conner | first=L. | title= Spreading the gospel of the modern dance: newspaper dance criticism in the United States, 1850-1934 |publisher= University of Pittsburgh Press | year=1997 |accessdate= 21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was exceptionally flexible, and many of her technique's exaggerated movements can be difficult or painful to execute.&lt;ref name="Parviainen"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Parviainen |first= Jaana |title=Bodies Moving and Moved |type= |page=99 |url=http://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/68138/951-44-5595-9.pdf?sequence=1|year=1998 |publisher=[[Tampere University]] Press |access-date=12 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to ballet===

Graham is considered a "codified technique", like the several schools of classical [[ballet]].&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Helen|title=The Body, Dance and Cultural Theory|date=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137487773|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlkdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Jan|title=Modern dance in a postmodern world|date=1992|publisher=National Dance Association|isbn=9780883145258|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are major differences between Graham and ballet techniques.

Graham dancers are trained to highlight their effort and use weight as a dramatic tool, while ballet dancers strive to appear weightless and effortless.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham technique's use of large torso movements and floorwork represent further breaks from the balletic tradition.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Graham explained that, although she respected the advances made in the course of ballet history, "Ballet…did not say enough, especially when it came to intense drama, to passion."&lt;ref name ="Freedman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Russell|title=Martha Graham: A Dancer's Life|date=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780395746554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LauOC7vYx-gC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=e3LM_2BYW_&amp;dq=%22martha%20graham%22%20%22graham%20technique%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} However, her extended collaboration with ballet-trained [[Erick Hawkins]] made her technique more balletic over time.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;{{rp|23}}

===Gender===
The technique was originally developed on an all-female company, although the company later included men.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham sometimes criticized her dancers for failing to initiate from the pelvis, or as she sometimes put it, "move from the vagina";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherr|first1=Apollinaire|title=DANCE; Making a Career With One Eye on a Gender Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/04/arts/dance-making-a-career-with-one-eye-on-a-gender-gap.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the connection between Graham technique and the female pelvis led one of Graham's male dancers to develop "vagina envy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bannerman|first1=Henrietta|title=Martha Graham's House of the Pelvic Truth: The Figuration of Sexual Identities and Female Empowerment|journal=Dance Research Journal|date=2010|volume=42|issue=1|pages=30–45|doi=10.1017/S0149767700000814|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8511717|accessdate=12 March 2015}} "The contraction as described above encloses the vagina and the womb.…a male dancer claimed to have "vagina envy"' no doubt because he was unable to obey that particular female-centered instruction.…Vagina envy may have represented the male dancer’s desire for the type of pelvic flexibility that lends itself best to Graham's style."&lt;/ref&gt; The pelvic origin of the contraction contributes to the role of [[sexuality]] in Graham technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bullough | first=V.L. | last2=Bullough | first2=B. | title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-135-82502-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cqlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism|Feminist]] dance scholar [[Dee Reynolds (scholar)|Dee Reynolds]] has argued that, because Graham technique was "so large and forceful, thrusting into and conquering space," it allowed Graham and her early all-female company to "redefine femininity as powerful and autonomous."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Reynolds also noted that the idea of "moving from the vagina" is similar to late nineteenth-century ideas about "[[female hysteria]]," a supposed sexual disorder sometimes linked to dancing, and Graham's contractions could be seen as reclaiming the female body as an artistic medium.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;

==Influence on modern dance==
Graham, along with [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Helen Tamiris]], [[Agnes de Mille]], and others, was part of an artistic movement in dance which rejected both the centuries-old tradition of classical [[ballet]] and the first-generation rebels of [[modern dance]], such as those who taught at the [[Denishawn school]] where Graham studied.&lt;ref name="Freedman" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

The expressive force of Graham technique had a revolutionary effect on modern dance.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham is now taught in most university dance programs, and remains the "hallmark" style of contemporary [[concert dance]]; its movement vocabulary is familiar to almost all professional contemporary dancers.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Autard" /&gt; It strongly influenced several other codified techniques, notably those of [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Lester Horton]], and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]].&lt;ref name="McFee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFee|first1=Graham|title=Understanding Dance|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134899463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzauVU0RRE4C&amp;lpg=PT201&amp;dq=evolution%20of%20cunningham%20technique%20owes%20a%20debt%20to%20graham%20technique&amp;pg=PT201#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20cunningham%20technique%20owes%20a%20debt%20to%20graham%20technique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perces"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perces|first1=Marjorie B.|last2=Forsythe|first2=Ana Marie|last3=Bell|first3=Cheryl|title=The Dance Technique of Lester Horton|date=1992|publisher=Princeton Book Company|isbn=9780871271648|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harss|first1=Marina|title=A Form of Order: On Paul Taylor|publisher=The Nation|date=12 September 2012|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/169891/form-order-paul-taylor|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Graham developed a daily class for her company, which is still used (with some variations) to teach her technique.&lt;ref name ="Butterworth" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|first1=Jo|title=Dance Studies: The Basics|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136584060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpfHBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=%22graham+technique%22+%22modern+dance%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traiger|first1=Lisa|title=Common Ground: 5 Modern Techniques for the 21st Century|journal=Dance Studio Life|date=6 March 2008|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/common-ground-5-modern-techniques-for-the-21st-century/|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class is organized as follows:

*'''[[Floor work]]''' Students stand to salute the teacher as she or he enters, then work on the floor for thirty to forty minutes. Students begin with "bounces" of the torso in three seated positions, and perform contraction exercises and kneeling combinations. The floor exercises emphasize core strength and stability, explore the articulation of the spine and torso, and start to coordinate the arms, legs and head.&lt;ref name="BannermanSomatics"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bannerman | first=Henrietta | title=A question of somatics the search for a common framework for twenty-first-century contemporary dance pedagogy: Graham and Release-based techniques | journal=Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices | volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2010 | pages=5–19 | doi=10.1386/jdsp.2.1.5_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Standing exercises''' The floorwork exercises transition up to standing combinations, which work the legs, feet, and torso, and train balance and control.
*'''Across the floor''' These traveling combinations begin with simple walking exercises, and increase in complexity to include jumps and leaping turns. Students traditionally consider this section an opportunity for "real" dancing, in contrast to the other sections' duly executed technical training.
*'''Falls''' Each fall consists of a contraction and concurrent move from the feet or knees to the back. The falls are meant to demonstrate control of the body at each of the vertical levels previously practiced.&lt;ref name=Hart-Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart-Johnson|first1=Diana|title=A Graham Technique Class|journal=Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement|date=1997|volume=9|issue=4|pages=193–214|url=http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/9.4/9-4AGraham_Hart-Johnson193-214.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark dispute==
Martha Graham founded a school, the [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]], which she sold in 1956. After Graham's death, [[Ron Protas]], her sole heir, sued the school for the rights to use Graham's trademarked name and choreography. A federal court awarded the school the rights to the names "Martha Graham" and "Graham technique" in 2001, and the rights to Graham's choreography in 2002.&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Martha Graham Center Wins Rights to the Dances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/24/arts/martha-graham-center-wins-rights-to-the-dances.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=24 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Federal Judge Allows Martha Graham Center to Use Her Name and Methods|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/08/arts/dance/08GRAH.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York TImes|date=8 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin 04.JPG|thumbnail|300px|The [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]]]
The '''Humboldtian model of higher education''' (German: ''Humboldtisches Bildungsideal'', literally: '''Humboldtian education ideal''') is a concept of academic education that emerged in the early 19th century and whose core idea is a [[Holism|holistic]] combination of research and studies. Sometimes called simply the ''Humboldtian model'', it integrates the arts and sciences with research to achieve both comprehensive general learning and cultural knowledge, and it is still followed today.

Humboldt's educational model went beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:
{{quote|There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition – well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Profiles of educators: Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) by Karl-Heinz Günther (1988), {{DOI|10.1007/BF02192965}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The philosopher [[Julian Nida-Rümelin]] has criticised discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labour market, arguing that we need to decide between [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] and Humboldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2009/45/Bachelor-Kritik|title=Bologna-Prozess: Die Chance zum Kompromiss ist da|last=Nida-Rümelin|first=Julian|date=29 October 2009|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|access-date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of holistic academic education (compare [[Bildung]]) was an idea of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], a [[Prussian]] [[philosopher]], government functionary and [[diplomat]]. As a [[privy councillor]] in the Interior Ministry, he reformed the Prussian school and university system according to [[Humanism|humanist]] principles. He founded the University of Berlin (now the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) and appointed distinguished scholars to teach and research there.&lt;ref name= pb/&gt; Several scholars have called him the most influential education official in German history.
Humboldt sought to create an educational system based on unbiased knowledge and analysis, combining research and teaching and allowing students to choose their own course of study. The University of Berlin was later named after him and his brother, the naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]].

== Background ==
Humboldt's model was based on two ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]: the [[individual]] and the [[world citizen]]. Humboldt believed that the university (and education in general, as in the [[Prussian education system]]) should enable students to become autonomous individuals and world citizens by developing their own reasoning powers in an environment of [[academic freedom]]. Humboldt envisaged an ideal of ''Bildung'', education in a broad sense, which aimed not merely to provide professional skills through schooling along a fixed path but rather to allow students to build individual character by choosing their own way.&lt;ref&gt;See: R. D. Anderson, ''Germany and the Humboldtian Model'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt had studied the Greek classics since his youth. He is a prominent example of [[Eliza Marian Butler]]'s thesis about the important role of Ancient Greek literature and art in 19th-century German thinking.&lt;ref name=held/&gt; Humboldt believed that study of the Hellenic past would help the German national consciousness, reconciling it with modernity but distinguishing it from French culture, which he saw as rooted in the Roman tradition. The vehicle for this task was to be the university.&lt;ref name=held&gt;Held, Dirk t.D., PhD, Connecticut College, USA, "Hellenism, Nationalism, and the Ideology of Research in Humboldt's University", in ''Transformation and Continuity in the History of Universities'', International Commission for the History of Universities (CIHU) Oslo, 10–11 Aug. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural-historical background of the Humboldtian model answered the demands of the [[Bildungsbürgertum]] for enhanced [[general knowledge]] (''Allgemeinbildung''). The Bildungsbürgertum led the [[Prussian reforms]] of the early 19th century and managed to generate a [[knowledge society]] ''ante litteram''.&lt;ref name="aka-blaetter.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aka-blaetter.de/wilhelm-von-humboldts-idee-der-universitaet/|title=wilhelm-von-humboldts-idee-der-universitaet|publisher=aka-blaetter.de|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001/acprof-9780198206606-chapter-4|title= Humboldtian education ideal|publisher=www.oxfordscholarship.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[freedom of study for students (Lernfreiheit, contrasted with the prescriptive curricula of the French system)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/imperia/md/content/alumni-club/vortrag_kern_varna.pdf|title= Humboldtian education ideal |publisher=www.donau-uni.ac.at|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitypressscholarship.com/search?f_0=keywords&amp;q_0=Humboldtian%20ideal|title=Humboldtian ideal|publisher=www.universitypressscholarship.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt believed that teaching should be guided by current research, and that research should be unbiased and independent from ideological, economic, political or religious influences. The Humboldtian model strives for unconditional [[academic freedom]] in the intellectual investigation of the world, both for teachers and for students. Study should be guided by humanistic ideals and free thought, and knowledge should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism]] rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], or [[dogma]].&lt;ref name="www.drc.uns.ac.rs/presentations"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=freethinker|publisher=/www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought|title=free+thought|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the basic concept of [[Wissenschaft]],  Humboldt regarded philosophy as the link between the different academic disciplines, which include both humanities and natural sciences.&lt;ref name=JCM&gt;Bildung in Zeiten von Bologna?: Hochschulbildung aus der Sicht Studierender, Jennifer Ch. Müller Springer-Verlag, 28.06.2011, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt encouraged the University of Berlin to operate according to scientific, as opposed to market-driven, principles such as curiosity, freedom of research, and internal objectives. Nevertheless, Humboldt was a political conservative (in Prussian terms) and saw the state as the major player in educational matters. In 1920 [[George Peabody Gooch]] said that Humboldt's idea of the state could only be realised in a "community of Humboldts".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Peabody Gooch]] 1920, ''Germany and the French Revolution'', pp. 107ff, quoted in "Wilhelm von Humboldts Rechtsphilosophie", Jens Petersen, Walter de Gruyter, 2007,&lt;/ref&gt;

== University concept ==

The University of Berlin, founded in 1810 under the influence of Wilhelm von Humboldt and renamed the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] after World War II, is traditionally seen as the model institution of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="www.drc.uns.ac.rs/presentations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drc.uns.ac.rs/presentations/05_DS/03-Prof.Dr.HeinrichKern.pdf|title=Humboldt's educational ideal and modern academic education|publisher=www.drc.uns.ac.rs/presentations|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-idea-of-a-university-today|title=the-idea-of-a-university-today|publisher=www.historyandpolicy.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/article/128621-free-education-pipe-dream|title=free-education-pipe-dream|publisher=www.voxeurop.eu|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-humboldt/|title=wilhelm-humboldt|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other scholars, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] were appointed by Humboldt.&lt;ref name= pb/&gt; ''Niemals wieder hatte ein deutscher Unterrichtsminister eine stolzere Berufungsliste vorzuweisen'' (Never again did any German Minister of Education have such a proud list of appointments to show).&lt;ref name= pb&gt;Peter Berglar: Wilhelm von Humboldt.

The university's features included a unity in teaching and research, the pursuit of higher learning in the philosophy faculty, freedom of study for students (''Lernfreiheit'', contrasted with the prescriptive curricula of the French system) and corporate autonomy for universities despite their being funded by the state. In addition to Humboldt, the group of reformers in Prussia included philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], and Berlin University was a focus of national cultural revival.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Compare Anderson 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt was aware of other German philosophers educational concepts, such as [[Kant]], [[Hegel]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] was an important influence on the Berlin university.&lt;ref name=JCM/&gt;

== Impact ==
These principles, in particular the idea of the research-based university, rapidly made an impact both in Germany and abroad. The Humboldtian university concept profoundly influenced higher education throughout central, eastern, and northern Europe.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; It was in competition with the post-Revolutionary French concept of the ''[[grandes écoles]]''. The French system lacked the freedom of German universities and instead imposed severe discipline and control over curriculum, awarding of degrees, conformity of views, and personal habits, instituting, for example, a ban on beards in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe'',  Vol. III, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Universities built on the Humboldtian model have provided students with the ability to address [[wicked problems|recalcitrant problems]], leading to major scientific breakthroughs with important economic effects.&lt;ref name=Akki&gt;Hautamäki A. &amp; Ståhle P.

American universities were early to adopt several of the German educational and scientific principles, and during the 20th century these principles have been recognised as valuable in most of the world.&lt;ref name=berman&gt;Berman E.P.

Starting with the University of Berlin, founded in 1810, the 'Humboldtian' university became a model for the rest of Europe, and by 1914 German universities were generally admired as the best in the world. It was the Humboldtian model that shaped the research universities of the United States, which head the international league today."&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 1960s, the Humboldtian model of the university attracted renewed interest and was discussed internationally. The German sociologist and philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] actively promoted Humboldt's ideas.&lt;ref name="aka-blaetter.de"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;"First of all, the Humboldtian ideal of the unity of research and teaching has been in practice scrapped in favour of a division of labour, the function of which is to produce more efficiently: patents and citations, in the case of research; highly skilled labourers, in the case of teaching. Second, this division of labour is necessary insofar as the university is seen primarily as an economic motor for the region (understood locally for smaller colleges and nationally for the major universities). The classical ideals of Lehrfreiheit and Lernfreiheit, the academic equivalents to free speech and civil rights in liberal democracies, are eroded as they constitute impediments to achieving the market ideals of efficiency in production and distribution of goods (goods here understood as more engineers
and fewer humanists among students, for example; patents and technical applications instead of Bildung and basic research.)" {{cite web|url=http://www.cultureunbound.ep.liu.se/v1/a07/cu09v1a07.pdf|title=The Future of the European University: Liberal Democracy or Authoritarian Capitalism?|publisher=www.cultureunbound.ep.liu.se|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/globalassets/vetenskap_samhallet/forskningspolitik/utskottet/debattbok_appendix_fstrat_eng_2008.pdf |title=vetenskap_samhallet/forskningspolitik/ |publisher=www.kva.se/ |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102172822/http://www.kva.se/globalassets/vetenskap_samhallet/forskningspolitik/utskottet/debattbok_appendix_fstrat_eng_2008.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, breakthrough discoveries in [[biotechnology]] and patent legislation favouring market-oriented research such as the [[Bayh–Dole Act]] in the US allowed for the creation of research partnerships between universities and industry with the objective of rapidly bringing innovations to market. (The earliest such partnerships in the US, such as [[Stanford Research Park]], date back to the post-war period.) A similar development has taken place in all industrial countries, based on proposals of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;Niinikoski M-L. (2011). "Innovation: Formation of a Policy Field and a Policy-making Practice". [[Aalto University]] – Doctoral Dissertations 40/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation of the "market university" as an economic engine, which first emerged in the US, diverges from Humboldt's principles. In a 2012 study, Ståhle and Hautamäki doubted the long-term sustainability of what they termed a "contradictory science policy", and argued for a return to a neo-Humboldtian approach to the university that would aim less for "innovation than for civilization" and reinstate the basic Humboldtian principles of academic freedom and autonomy for educational institutions, the pursuit of knowledge as a basis for both civilization and education (German ''[[Bildung]]''), and unity in teaching and research.&lt;ref name=Akki/&gt;

The implications of the Humboldtian approach and of the conflict between market-driven and idealistic approaches to higher education have led to ironic results in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Though elite private universities in the US do charge high [[tuition fee]]s, both universities and their students also benefit from charitable donations as well as from government support. This combination of resources results in lavish funding that far exceeds the budgets of German universities, which are state-funded and mostly tuition-free.

==== Current debate ====
Humboldt is still being discussed in Germany. Current problems and policy decisions regarding German education are addressed by a joint initiative called ''Konzertierte Aktion Internationales Marketing für den Bildungs- und Forschungsstandort Deutschland'' (KAIM). KAIM coordinates efforts of the partners, which include the state and federal government, universities, trade unions and industry associations. (The name of the group, KAIM, refers to earlier cooperative efforts, for example the {{Interlanguage link multi|Konzertierte Aktion|de}} at the end of the 1960s.) It tries to improve the international position of German education and research capacities, including marketing. Estimating that American universities receive US$10&amp;nbsp;billion annually from tuition fees and other financial contributions, which KAIM sees as an important source of revenue for the US, they have warned Germany to prepare for American attempts to market the American university model via the [[World Trade Organization]] in order to corner the international educational and research market.&lt;ref&gt;Konzertierte Aktion "Internationales Marketing für den Bildungs- und Forschungsstandort Deutschland" (KAIM) Newsletter 2001, quoted in University of Kassel, Veranstaltungsreihe des AStA, "Konsequenzen der Hochschulstrukturreform und der Internationalisierung von Bildung", (Consequences of Structural Reform of Universities and of the Internationalisation of Education) 5.11.2 Ingrid Lohmann, Humboldts Bildungsideal vs. marktförmige Universität? (Humboldt's Educational Ideal versus Market-Format University?)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://educationandutopia.wordpress.com/|title=Can we think about the student as a public?|publisher=https://educationandutopia.wordpress.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Humboldt concept and its image are used by different and sometimes opposing parties in the German debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ses.unam.mx/curso2011/pdf/M2_Lecturas/M2_S1c_Rodriguez.pdf|title=Bachelor of What, Master of Whom? The Humboldt Myth and Historical Transformations of Higher Education in German-Speaking Europe and the US|publisher=www.ses.unam.mx|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom of teaching and learning (Lehr- und Lernfreiheit). Central here is that Humboldt was a liberal in thetraditional sense. He believed in individual freedom, and therefore argued that students had as much right to choose their instructors and subjects as professors had to decide what and how they taught. This implied a radical break with any form of set curriculum. The unity of teaching and research (Einheit von Lehre und Forschung). For Humboldt and those who cite him, learning is a collaborative enterprise, in which ‘the professors are not there for the students, but rather both are there for science (and scholarship)" Humboldt, 1809/1990, p. 274). The unity of science and scholarship (Einheit der Wissenschaft). For Humboldt at least there was no fundamental distinction in principle between the natural sciences and the humanities, because the concept of Wissenschaft applies to both. The primacy of 'pure' science (Bildung durch Wissenschaft) over specialised professional training (Ausbildung, Spezialschulmodell). Humboldt and those who cite him claim to understand science and scholarship as processes of inquiry — 'not a finished thing to be found, but something unfinished and perpetually sought after', as he put it — not the discovery and repetition of things to be learned from textbooks, but an approach to learning, an attitude of mind, a skill and a capacity to think rather than specialised knowledge". (Humboldt, 1809/1990, p. 274)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] was begun in 2005–06 to counter the perceived lack of cutting-edge achievement in both research and education in the state-funded universities. This initiative is primarily driven and funded at the federal level. The American tradition of large private grants and foundations for science has been mirrored in the 21st century, for example at [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology]]. The Freiberg University, one of the oldest mining schools in the world, narrowly escaped closure after [[German reunification]]. In 2007 it received a private grant in the triple-digit millions of [[euro]]s from the ''Dr.-Erich-Krüger-Stiftung'' (Dr. Erich Krüger Foundation), the largest grant ever made to a state-owned university in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Bartsch |url=http://www.taz.de/pt/2007/01/24/a0200.1/text |title=Geldsegen für Freiberg |newspaper=[[Die tageszeitung|taz]] |date=24 January 2007 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Krüger, the Munich-based real estate and food retail entrepreneur who endowed the foundation, was born in [[Freiberg]] and started an apprenticeship there in 1946, but was driven away by the [[East Germany|East German]] communists because of his bourgeois background. He was made an honorary senator of the University of Mining and Technology in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christian |last=Möls |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news211904 |title=Millionen-Stifter Peter Krüger wird Ehrensenator der TU Bergakademie Freiberg |publisher=[[Informationsdienst Wissenschaft]] |date=4 June 2007 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalamandalam Kalyanikutti Amma''' (1915–1999) was an epoch-making [[Mohiniyattam]] danseuse from [[Kerala]] in southern [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=kloqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Kalamandalam+Kalyanikutty+Amma|title=South Indian theatre|last=Sinha|first=Biswajit|date=2007|publisher=Raj Publications|isbn=9788186208540|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A native of [[Thirunavaya]] in [[Malappuram]] district of the state, she was instrumental in resurrecting Mohiniyattam from a dismal, near-extinct state into a mainstream Indian classical dance, rendering it formal structure and ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sahapedia|title=Remembering Kalamandalam Kalyanikutti Amma|date=2017-02-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAfE8CbBGLQ|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalyanikutti Amma, one of the early-batch students of [[Kerala Kalamandalam]], was married to the late [[Kathakali]] maestro [[Padma Shri]] [[Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unsung-legends-who-resurrected-two-dying-arts-of-kerala/article5894374.ece|title=Unsung legends who resurrected two dying arts of Kerala|last=Reporter|first=Staff|date=2014-04-10|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-06-17|last2=Reporter|first2=Staff|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two books Kalyanikutti Amma has authored, "Mohiniyattam - History and Dance Structure" is considered as an elaborate and only authentic documentation on Mohiniyattam.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sahapedia.org/traditions-mohiniyattam|title=Traditions in Mohiniyattam|date=2017-02-07|work=Sahapedia|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted among her disciples are her daughters Sreedevi Rajan and Kala Vijayan and [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]] and [[Deepti Omchery Bhalla]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

A winner of both the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy and Kendra Sangeet Natak Akademi awards, Kalyanikutty Amma died on 12 May 1999 in [[Tripunithura]] (where the couple had settled) at the age of 84. Her son [[Kalasala Babu]] was a cinema and television actor, while her granddaughter [[Smitha Rajan]] is a noted Mohiniyattam artiste.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

She got 'Kavayithri' award from the famous poet [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalindia.net/indian-dance/classical/mohiniattam.html|title=Mohini Attam – The Traditional Dance of Kerala!|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 she got Kerala Kalamandala Fellowship.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Kalyanikutti Amma passed the art of Mohiniattam beyond India. The first Russian dancer, Mohiniattam, was [[:ru:Милана_Северская_(Мандира)|Milana Severskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milana-art.ru/html/common/publicat/eng/ye181096.html|title=YOUTHEXPRESS 18/10/1996|website=www.milana-art.ru|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma blessed her on the continuation of the Mohiniattam tradition. Milana Severskaya created in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], Russia the first outside India school of education Mohiniattam. She founded the Natya Theater, where you can see the choreography Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma in the play, dedicated to her memory.

[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080422-F-6911G-058.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An open-air shoot house as used by Colombian special forces.]]

A '''kill house''' or '''shoot house''' is a live [[ammunition]] small arms shooting range used to train military and law enforcement personnel for close contact engagements in [[urban combat]] environments. Kill houses are designed to mimic residential, commercial and industrial spaces. Kill houses are often used to acquaint personnel in infiltrating (gaining access) structures and the methods used to overwhelm the target(s) in the quickest and most efficient manner. The construction of one of these facilities can vary in material and cost depending on the needs and the resources available. Like any shooting range, there are rules that must be followed to ensure a safe kill house training session.

== Purpose ==
A kill or shoot house is a type of indoor firing range modified to resemble a residential environment and with walls and floor fortified to safely absorb rounds fired from close range. It is used to train soldiers and police for various [[urban combat]] scenarios while permitting them to use their full power service weapons. The scenarios trained for include room and apartment clearing, [[door breaching]] and the inclusion of [[hostage]] or [[noncombatant]] targets along with enemy targets ("shoot/no shoot").

Simpler kill houses without the necessary fortification to be safe for live fire can be used for [[Blank (cartridge)|blank]] or [[dry fire]] training of the same variety. As necessary this can be reduced even further down to the "glass house", which is merely a residential floorplan marked out in full scale on the ground.

== Construction ==

=== Materials ===
[[File:US Army 50783 HALLWAY.jpg|thumb|right|200px|US Army live-fire shoot house showing construction layers.]]

Kill houses can be built from almost any materials, ranging from concrete to something as simple as plywood depending on the needs of the users of the kill house. For structures that need to contain and absorb gun fire, stronger materials are needed such as concrete or ballistic rubber. It's important to note that using materials that can't absorb gun fire may lead to injuries and death. For more temporary or cost effective needs, plywood or a plastic sheet can make a suitable wall.&lt;ref&gt;"Building a shoot house on a shoestring budget." Police Officers, Cops &amp; Law Enforcement | PoliceOne. http://www.policeone.com/Officer-Safety/tips/120541-Building-a-shoot-house-on-a-shoestring-budget/ (accessed October 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the actual facility, the shoot house also requires targets to simulate the individuals they must subdue. The most common and recognizable targets used in shoot houses are paper silhouettes and [[mannequins]]. To simulate the movement of an actual person the targets are either placed on rails or they can pop up from an undisclosed location.&lt;ref&gt;seventh, the, eighth days, and “they will be going full speed. "Association of the United States Army: Inside the Shoot House." Home. http://www3.ausa.org/webint/DeptAUSANews.nsf/byid/PCRR-6K2MNW (accessed October 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Meggitt SHOTT House (Shoot House for Optimized Tactical Training)."

=== Virtual kill house ===
[[File:US Navy 080219-N-7676W-005 Marines from 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, confront avatars, or virtual humans, while clearing a room at the Office of Naval Research Infantry Immersion Trainer (IIT) located at the I Marine Expeditiona.jpg|thumb|left|200px|US Marines clearing a room in a virtual shoot house at Camp Pendleton, California, 2008.]]
An alternative to the more traditional shoot house is a virtual kill house. Virtual kill houses make use of audio and visual technology to create an interactive, if not video game like, experience. This version of a kill house uses a projector to display different scenarios on a screen while sensors keep track of the soldier's relative position and if he/she has hit the target on the screen.

Virtual kill houses provide a similar experience to a traditional shoot house, but are more interactive. In a normal shoot house, soldiers would shoot at silhouettes or mannequins, but in the virtual counterpart the targets are life sized and free to move along the screen. These shoot houses usually only require a flat surface to display the scenarios, so wax ammunition is used in place of actual bullets.

One notable virtual kill house is the Army Live Fire Virtual Targeting system used at Fort Bragg. Previously, the software used for the facility was part of [[America's Army]], an online [[recruitment tool]], which has been adapted for use in real training exercises.&lt;ref&gt;"Shoot house tests servicemembers with video technology - News - Stripes." Stripes - Independent U.S. military news from Iraq, Afghanistan and bases worldwide. http://www.stripes.com/news/shoot-house-tests-servicemembers-with-video-technology-1.94614 (accessed October 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
To avoid unwanted discharges and accidents, there is a set of guidelines, known as the cardinal rules, used to ensure a safe shoot house session. These cardinal rules are:

# Treat every firearm as if it's loaded.
# Keep your firearm pointed away from other people.
# Keep your finger out and away from the trigger.
# Be aware of not just your target but everything beyond it.

In addition to the cardinal rules other guidelines include:
* The mandatory use of ear and eye protection.
* The mandatory use of [[body armor]].
* Targets should be placed around the room so rounds hit the impact areas.
* There should be no one in the shoot house before the training exercise.
* Equipment (guns, ammunition, targets, and the shoot house) should all be authorized and inspected before the training exercise.&lt;ref&gt;"Shoot House Instructor."

== Public use ==
In addition to military and police use, kill houses, like shooting ranges, are available for public use. Companies such as Meggitt Training Systems offer to build permanent or portable shoot houses for the public. There is also a community of enthusiasts that build and use kill houses for their own purposes and entertainment.

'''Legal education''' in the [[United States]] generally refers to a graduate degree, the completion of which makes a graduate eligible to sit for an examination for a license to [[Practice of law|practice]] as a Lawyer. Around 60 percent of those who complete a law degree typically practice law, with the remainder primarily working in business (especially finance, insurance, real estate, and consulting) or government or policy roles, where their degrees also confer advantages.&lt;ref name="Econ Value"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|last2=McIntyre|first2=Frank|title=The Economic Value of a Law Degree|journal=Journal of Legal Studies|date=2014|volume=43|issue=2|pages=249–289|doi=10.1086/677921|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2379146}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Other types of legal education, such as that of  [[paralegal]]s, of [[Limited Practice Officer]]s (in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]), and of the citizenry in general, and of the education of lawyers after admission to the bar ([[continuing legal education]]) are not covered in this article.)

== History ==

=== The first law schools in Europe ===
The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the [[glossators]] of the 11th century, which were schools of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first European university, that of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. The first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The University of Bologna served as the model for other law schools of the medieval age.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio García y García, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA399 “The Faculties of Law]," ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', Cambridge University Press, 1992; page 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of Roman Law. Although Oxford did teach canonical law, its importance was always superior to civil law in that institution.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 390&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early legal education in England===
In England in 1292, when Edward I first requested that lawyers be trained, law students merely sat in the courts and observed. Over time, the students would hire professionals to lecture them in their residences. This practice led to the institution of the [[Inns of Court]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 430.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original method of education at the Inns of Court was a mix of [[moot court]]-like practice and lecture, and observation of court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 431.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, the Inns obtained a status as a kind of university akin to Oxford and Cambridge, though very specialized in purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 432&lt;/ref&gt; With the frequent absence of parties to suits during the [[Crusades]], the importance of the lawyer's role grew tremendously, and the demand for lawyers grew.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The apprenticeship program for solicitors emerged, structured and governed by the same rules as the apprenticeship programs for the trades&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford and Cambridge did not see common law as worthy of study, and included coursework in law only in the context of canon and civil law, and for the purpose of the study of philosophy or history only. These universities, therefore, did not train lawyers.&lt;ref name="Id. at 435"&gt;Id. at 435.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professional training in England was unlike that of continental Europe, where the law was viewed as an academic discipline. Legal educators in England stressed practical training.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The training of solicitors by apprenticeship was formally established by an act of parliament in 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, and 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 435.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Blackstone]] became the first lecturer of law at Oxford in 1753. The university did not establish the program for the purpose of professional study, and the lectures were very philosophical and theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="Id. at 435"/&gt; Blackstone insisted that the study of law should be university based, where concentration on foundational principles can be had, instead of concentration on detail and procedure obtained through apprenticeship and the Inns of Court.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 793.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inns of Court]] continued but became less effective. No significant educational activity or examination was required for bar admission. In 1846, the Parliament examined the education and training of prospective barristers and found the system to be inferior to the legal education provided in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, and 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 436&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, formal schools of law were called for, but not finally established until later in the century. Even then, the bar did not consider a university degree in admission decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal education in the North American colonies and the United States ===
Initially there was much resistance to lawyers in colonial North America because of the role they played in hierarchical England. Slowly the colonial governments started using the services of professionals trained in the Inns of Court, and by the end of the Revolution there was a functional bar in each state.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 775.&lt;/ref&gt; As institutions for training developed in the colonies, because of the distrust of a profession only open to the elite in England, the institutions which developed in what would become the United States would be much different from those in England.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially in the United States, the legal professionals were trained and imported from England&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 438.&lt;/ref&gt;  A formal apprenticeship (training) or clerkship program was established first in New York in 1730—at that time a seven-year clerkship was required, and in 1756 a four-year college degree was required in addition to five years of clerking and an examination.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 439&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the requirements were reduced to require only two years of college education.&lt;ref&gt;Idem.&lt;/ref&gt; A system like the Inns did not develop, however, and a college education was not required in England until the 19th century, so the American system was unique.

The clerkship program required much individual study. The mentoring lawyer was expected to carefully select materials for study and to guide the clerk in his study of the law to ensure that the material was being absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J.,[http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 781&lt;/ref&gt; The student was supposed to compile his notes of his reading of the law into a "[[commonplace book]]", which he would endeavor to memorize.&lt;ref name="Id. at 782"&gt;Id. at 782.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although those were the ideals, in reality the clerks were often overworked and rarely were able to study the law individually as expected. They were often employed to tedious tasks, such as making handwritten copies of documents. Finding sufficient legal texts was also a seriously debilitating issue, and there was no standardization in the books assigned to the clerk trainees because they were assigned by their mentor, whose opinion of the law may be different greatly from his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 782 and 783.&lt;/ref&gt; One famous attorney in the United States, William Livingston, stated in 1745 in a New York newspaper that the clerkship program was severely flawed, and that most mentors "have no manner of concern for their clerk's future welfare… [T]is a monstrous absurdity to suppose, that the law is to be learnt by a perpetual copying of precedents."&lt;ref name="Id. at 782"/&gt;  There were some few mentors that were dedicated to the service, and because of their rarity, they became so sought after that the first law schools evolved from the offices of some of these attorneys who took on many clerks and began to spend more time training than practicing law.&lt;ref&gt;id at 782.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was seen over the years that the apprenticeship program was not capable of producing lawyers capable of serving their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Sonsteng, John O., "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1084098 A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century]" . William Mitchell Law Review, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2007 (Revised April 2, 2008); page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The apprenticeship programs often employed the trainee with menial tasks, and while they were well trained in the day-to-day operations of a law office, they were generally unprepared practitioners or legal reasoners.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishment of formal faculties of law in U.S. universities did not occur until the latter part of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 442.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first law degree granted by a U.S. university was a Bachelor of Law in 1793 by the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], which was abbreviated L.B.; [[Harvard University]] was the first university to use the LL.B. abbreviation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Marion R. Kirkwood and William B. Owens, [http://www.law.stanford.edu/school/history/historysls.pdf A Brief History of the Stanford Law School, 1893-1946] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407053200/http://www.law.stanford.edu/school/history/historysls.pdf |date=2012-04-07 }}, Stanford University School of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first university law programs in the United States, such as that of the University of Maryland established in 1812, included much theoretical and philosophical study, including works such as the [[Bible]], [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Aristotle]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Grotius]].&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 794.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been said that the early university law schools of the early 19th century seemed to be preparing students for careers as statesmen rather than as lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 795.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the LL.B. programs in the early 1900s at Stanford University and Yale continued to include "cultural study," which consisted of courses in languages, mathematics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;Marion R. Kirkwood and William B. Owens, [http://www.law.stanford.edu/school/history/historysls.pdf A Brief History of the Stanford Law School, 1893-1946] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407053200/http://www.law.stanford.edu/school/history/historysls.pdf |date=2012-04-07 }}, Stanford University School of Law; page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s there were many proprietary schools which originated from a practitioner taking on multiple apprentices and establishing a school and which provided a practical legal education, as opposed to the one offered in the universities which offered an education in the theory, history and philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;Sonsteng, John O., [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1084098 A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century]. William Mitchell Law Review, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2007 (Revised April 2, 2008); page 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The universities assumed that the acquisition of skills would happen in practice, while the proprietary schools concentrated on the practical skills during education.&lt;ref&gt;idem.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to compete with the small professional law schools, there began a great change in U.S. university legal education.  For a short time beginning in 1826 Yale began to offer a complete "practitioners' course" which lasted two years and included practical courses, such as pleading drafting.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 798.&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. Supreme Court justice Joseph Story started the spirit of change in legal education at Harvard when, as a lecturer there in the early 19th century, he advocated a more "scientific study" of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 800.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, at Harvard the education was much of a trade school type of approach to legal education, contrary to the more liberal arts education advocated by Blackstone at Oxford and Jefferson at William and Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 801.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless there continued to be debate among educators over whether legal education should be more vocational, as at the private law schools, or through a rigorous scientific method, such as that developed by Story and Langdell.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussions of the development of Langdell's method, see LaPiana, William P., [https://www.questia.com/read/90428553?title=Logic%20and%20Experience%3a%20The%20Origin%20of%20Modern%20American%20Legal%20Education Logic and Experience: The Origin of Modern American Legal Education], Oxford University Press (New York, 1994); and Stein, Ralph Michael, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L.

Ellis, Jr., Legal Education: A Perspective on the Last 130 Years of American Legal Training, 6 Wash. U.J.L. &amp; Pol'y 157, 166 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, into the year 1900 most states did not require a university education (although an apprenticeship was often required) and most practitioners had not attended any law school or college.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 801.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the modern legal education system in the U.S. is a combination of teaching law as a science and a practical skill,&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 802.&lt;/ref&gt; implementing elements such as clinical training,&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3021333 SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017).]&lt;/ref&gt; which has become an essential part of legal education in the U.S. and in the J.D. program of study.&lt;ref&gt;Sonsteng, John O., "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1084098 A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century]" . William Mitchell Law Review, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2007 (Revised April 2, 2008); page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas in the 18th and 19th century, few U.S. lawyers trained in an apprenticeship "achieved a level of competence necessary to adequately serve their clients," today as a result of the development of the U.S. legal education system, "law graduates perceive themselves to be prepared upon graduation" for the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 9 and 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==

== Academic degrees ==
{{Main|Juris Doctor}}
{{See also|Law school in the United States}}

Legal education is typically received through a [[law school]] program. The professional degree granted by U.S. law schools is the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.). Prospective lawyers who have been awarded the J.D. (or other appropriate credential), must fulfill [[Admission to the bar in the United States|additional, state-specific requirements]] in order to gain [[admission to the bar in the United States]].

The Juris Doctor (J.D.), like the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.), is a professional doctorate. The American Bar Association issued a Council Statement that the JD is equivalent to the PhD for educational employment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abanet.org/legaled/accreditation/Council%20Statements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] (S.J.D.) (''"Scientiae Juridicae Doctor"'' in Latin), and [[Doctor of Comparative Law]] (D.C.L.), are research and academic-based doctorate level degrees. In the U.S., the Legum Doctor is only awarded as an honorary degree.

As of July 2012, [[Yale Law School]] offers a Ph.D. in Law designed for students who have already earned a J.D. and who wish to pursue extended legal scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/graduate/phd_program.htm |title=Ph.D. Program &amp;#124; Yale Law School |publisher=Law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.).

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a Juris Doctor (J.D.), often seek to obtain a Juris Master (J.M.), [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.), or a Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.).

== Admission to the bar ==
Please see [[Admission to the bar in the United States]].  Depending upon their state, attorneys must also satisfy [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) credit requirements.

== Lawyer credentials, prestige, and career path ==
{{Disputed section|date=July 2008}}{{more citations needed|entire section|date=March 2013}}
American law firms are often very credential-oriented.  Apart from the minimum requirements of a J.D. and admission to the state bar, there are certain credentials recognized within the profession to distinguish lawyers from one another; those credentials are almost always mentioned in lawyer profiles and biographies, which are used to communicate to both fellow attorneys and prospective clients.  Chief among them are such honors as being a member of their law school's [[law review]], [[moot court]], or [[mock trial]] programs. [[Judicial clerkship]]s after graduation or [[law clerk]] positions at prestigious [[law firm]]s while in school are also distinguishing marks.

This credential-based system is sown in law school, where high grades are frequently rewarded with law review membership and much sought after summer [[clerkships]] (called "[[summer associateships]]" in some areas) with large private law firms.  These programs are designed to give a firm's [[summer associates]] an idea of what the everyday practice of law is like at that particular firm by allowing them to work with the firm's partners and associates on real projects involving real clients.  In larger cities, such as New York or Chicago, summer associates at large firms can make as much as $3,000 per week.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.alreadybored.com for current salaries for summer associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition to receive a summer offer from a firm is intense, and credentials (a student's GPA and class rank, law review or moot court membership, publications, etc.) play a decisive role in determining who is selected. Most offers are received after a three-step interview process. First, during the early fall of their 2L (second year), students at each law school first submit their resumes to a central paper file or online database (such as [[Current Research Information System|CRIS]] or [[LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell]]&lt;ref&gt;Julia Gray Smith, [http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202552362611/Martindale-Purchases-Struggling-eAttorney "Martindale Purchases Struggling eAttorney"], ''Daily Report''&lt;/ref&gt;), from which interviewers selected candidates they wish to interview, based almost entirely on their 1L [[GPA]] and [[class rank]]. Second, selected students are notified, usually via [[email]], and then schedule a [[screening interview]], either at the law school or at a local hotel; this interview is usually conducted by one or more attorneys from that firm and is part of most schools' On Campus Interview ("OCI") program, in which firms send recruiters to schools across the country. Finally, students selected from the screening interviews are invited for a final "callback" interview, commonly held at the firm's offices. If the selected student attends school in a place far from the city in which the firm is located, it is not unusual for the firm to fly the student in and pay for accommodations while he is in town.  After the callback, a selected candidate will receive a phone call (usually within 48 hours) informing him that he has been extended an offer. After the summer, early into their 3L (third) years, the vast majority of summer associates receive formal offers to join the firm after graduating school and sitting for the [[bar exam]].

=== Law school rankings ===
The ''[[US News and World Report]]'' publishes the most well-known annual ranking of American programs, where [[Yale Law School]] has held the #1 spot every year since the inception of the ranking reports. A number of alternative rankings exist, such as the [http://www.leiterrankings.com/ Leiter Reports Law School Rankings]. These rankings divide law schools into "tiers" based on the overall quality of each program. A number of factors and statistics are compiled to produce these rankings each year, including academic reputation, the quality of the faculty (usually measured by the quality of its publications), the quality of the student body (usually measured by average Law School Admission Test, or LSAT, score and undergraduate grade point average), the number of volumes in the library, the earnings potential of graduates, bar passage rates, and job placement rates. Most of these measurements are acquired by voluntary self-reporting from each law program; others are compiled through a formal process of polling judges, legal professionals, recent graduates, law professors, and school administrators. The issuance of press releases that dismiss the rankings has become a yearly ritual for many law programs, but all but a handful cooperate in gathering and reporting statistics to the various ranking publications.

====First tier====
There are approximately 200 ABA approved law schools in the United States.  There is no universally accepted ranking system, but many have attempted to divide law schools into "tiers" consisting of quartiles (50 law schools each) or perhaps eighths (25 law schools each), or have separated out the top 10 or top 20 law schools by U.S. News rank or median LSAT score.  ''After the JD'', a large study of law graduates who passed the bar examination (but were not necessarily practicing law), found that graduates of the top 10 law schools by median LSAT score of incoming classes typically earned incomes exceeding $170,000 within 12 years after graduation.&lt;ref name="searchworks.stanford.edu"&gt;After the JDIII https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10659607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="After the JII"&gt;[http://www.law.du.edu/documents/directory/publications/sterling/AJD2.pdf After the JII]&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of the next 10 law schools earned around $158,000, and graduates of schools ranked 21-50 typically earned more than $130,000.  Another peer reviewed study found that Law graduates at the 75th percentile of earnings ability typically earned around $80,000 more every year than they would have earned with only a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name="Econ Value"/&gt; Law graduate earnings typically continue to grow and do not peak until their mid 50s;&lt;ref name="Econ Value"/&gt; thus graduates of top tier law schools can likely peak at incomes exceeding $250,000 per year.

Though the specific rankings change from year to year, the overall composition of the top schools has remained fairly constant. Most legal professionals (judges, practitioners, or professors) rank the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]], [[Columbia Law School|Columbia]], [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], [[NYU Law School|NYU]], [[Stanford Law School|Stanford]], and [[Yale Law School|Yale]] in the top echelon of American law schools, with [[Yale Law School]], [[Harvard Law School]], and [[Stanford Law School]] being considered the most prestigious and the most selective schools to gain admission as measured by reputation scores from ''U.S. News'' surveys and admissions rate. In recent years, many people have used the concept of the T14 (the top 14) to define the top tier of law schools. These schools have consistently ranked in the top 14 in the annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20080318155932/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/law/brief/lawrank_brief.php US News ranking of law schools]. The T14 is composed of the schools listed above and also [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law|Berkeley (Boalt Hall)]], [[Cornell Law School|Cornell]], [[Duke University School of Law|Duke]], [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown]], [[University of Michigan Law School|Michigan]], [[Northwestern University School of Law|Northwestern]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of Virginia School of Law|Virginia]]. The most prestigious and sought-after law jobs in the country—U.S. Supreme Court Clerks, legal faculty, Bristow Fellows, Office of Legal Counsel Lawyers, Assistant U.S. Attorneys in cities like New York and Chicago—are more likely to be awarded to students and graduates in one of these programs. Recruiters from elite law firms visit top-tier law schools each fall to recruit new associates for the following summer. In contrast, small and mid-market law firms &amp;mdash; which make up the bulk of law firms in the U.S. &amp;mdash; cannot predict their labor needs that far in advance, and most new law school graduates who do not graduate from top tier law schools therefore must seek out jobs at law firms during their third year or even after graduation.

==== Lower tiers ====
The majority of law school students do not end up at an elite university, but many can, and often do, find well-paying jobs in law firms, government, or business positions. ''After the JD'', a large study of law graduates who passed the bar examination (but were not necessarily practicing law), found that even graduates of lower ranked law schools were typically making six figure ($100,000+) incomes within 12 years after graduation.,&lt;ref name="searchworks.stanford.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="After the JII"/&gt; although graduates of higher ranking schools typically earned more.  ''The Economic Value of a Law Degree'', a peer reviewed study which included law graduates who do not pass the bar exam, found that law graduates at the 25th percentile of earnings ability typically earned around $20,000 more every year than they would have earned with only a bachelor's degree, compared to around $80,000 more per year for those at the 75th percentile.&lt;ref name="Econ Value"/&gt;

=== Regional tiers ===
Most law schools outside the top tier are more regional in scope and often have very strong regional connections to these post-graduation opportunities. For example, a student graduating from a lower-tier law school may find opportunities in that school's "home market": the legal market containing many of that school's alumni, where most of the school's networking and career development energies are focused. In contrast, an upper-tier law school may be limited in terms of employment opportunities to the broad geographic region that the law school feeds.

=== State accredited schools ===
Some schools are accredited by state governments. They are located in Alabama, California, Massachusetts, and Tennessee. Some state authorized law schools are maintained to offer a non-ABA option eliminating costly ABA requirements seen as unnecessary by many of these states.

==== Unaccredited schools ====
Many schools are not accredited by a state or the American Bar Association.  Most are located in California.  While graduates of these schools may apply for admission to the [[California State Bar]], they may not necessarily be allowed to apply for admission in other states.

===Law school activities and honors===
Within each U.S. law school, students may receive additional credentials.  These include:

* [[Law review|Law review/Law journal]] membership or editorial position (based either on grades or write-on competition or both). This is important for at least three reasons. First, because membership is determined by either grades or writing ability, it is an indicator of strong academic performance. This leads to the second reason: potential employers sometimes use law review membership in their hiring criteria. Third, work on law review exposes a student to legal scholarship and editing, and often allows the student to publish a significant piece of legal scholarship on his or her own. Most law schools have a "flagship" journal usually called "''School name'' Law Review" (e.g., the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'') or "''School name'' Law Journal" (e.g., the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'') that publishes articles on all areas of law, and one or more other specialty law journals that publish articles concerning only a particular area of the law (for example, the ''[[Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology]]'').
* [[Moot court]] membership or award (based on oral and written argument). Success in moot court can distinguish one as an outstanding oral advocate or [[appellate brief]] writer and can provide a degree of practical legal training often absent from law review membership. Membership in moot court and related activities, such as [[alternate dispute resolution|Dispute Resolution]], may appeal especially to employers hiring for specialized litigation positions.
* [[Mock trial|Mock trial/trial advocacy]] membership or award, based on oral advocacy in mock trial competitions. Mock trial honors often have special appeal to litigation-oriented offices, such as a [[district attorney]]'s office, [[attorney general]]'s office, [[public defender]]'s office, or private firms that specializes in trial litigation. Mock trial is especially useful at assisting students with [[public speaking]], allowing them to master the [[rules of evidence]], and gain experience in writing [[opening statement]]s, [[direct examination]], [[cross examination]]s, and [[closing argument|closing statements]].
* [[Order of the Coif]] membership (based on [[grade point average]]). This is often coupled with Latin honors (summa and magna cum laude, though often not cum laude). A slight majority of law schools in the United States do not have Order of the Coif chapters.

==== Court clerkships ====
On the basis of these credentials, as well as favorable faculty recommendations and other connections, some students become [[law clerk]]s with judges after graduation, signing on for one or two-year clerkships. Clerkships may be with state or federal judges. There is a generally recognized hierarchy with regard to clerkships (federal clerkships are considered more prestigious than state court clerkships, and appellate court clerkships are considered more prestigious than trial court clerkships, with [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] clerkships considered the most prestigious).

The benefit to the lawyer from clerkships is experience working for a judge.  Often, clerks engage in significant legal research and writing for the judge, writing memos to assist a judge in coming to a legal conclusion in some cases, and writing drafts of opinions based on the judge's decisions.  Appellate court clerkships, although generally more prestigious, do not necessarily give one a great deal of practical experience in the day-to-day life of a lawyer in private practice.  The average litigator might get much more out of a clerkship at the trial court level, where he or she will be learning about motions practices, dealing with lawyers, and generally learning how a trial court works on the inside.  What a lawyer might lose in prestige he or she might gain in experience.

By and large, though, clerkships provide other valuable assets to a new lawyer.  Judges often become mentors to their clerks, providing the attorney with an experienced individual to whom he or she can go for advice.  Fellow clerks can also become lifelong friends and/or professional connections.  Those contemplating academia do well to obtain an appellate court clerkship at the federal level, since those clerkships provide a great opportunity to think at a very high level about the law.

Hierarchies aside, clerkships are great experiences for the new lawyers, and law schools encourage graduates to engage in a clerkship to broaden their professional experiences.

==== United States Supreme Court clerkships ====
Some law school graduates are able to clerk for one of the Justices on the Supreme Court. Each Justice takes 4 clerks per year.  Almost without exception, these clerks are graduates of elite law schools (with Harvard, Yale, and the University of Chicago being the most highly represented schools) who have already clerked for at least one year with highly selective federal circuit court judges (such as Judges [[Merrick Garland]], [[Alex Kozinski]], [[James Harvie Wilkinson III|Harvie Wilkinson]], [[David Tatel]], [[Richard Posner]]). It is perhaps the most highly selective and prestigious position a recently graduated lawyer can have, and Supreme Court clerks are often highly sought after by law firms, the government, and law schools.  The vast majority of Supreme Court clerks either become academics at elite law schools, enter private practice as appellate attorneys, or take highly selective government positions.

== Criticism ==
Law school normally consists of only a classroom setting, unlike training in other professions. (For example, [[Medical education in the United States|medical school]] in the United States is traditionally two years of class environment and two years of "rotations", or an apprenticeship-type hands-on experience.) Although some countries such as Germany and France require apprenticeship with a practicing attorney, this is not required in any United States jurisdiction. Because of this, many law students graduate with a grasp of the legal doctrines necessary to pass the bar exam, but with no actual hands-on experience or knowledge of the day-to-day practice of law. The American Bar Association called for American law schools to move towards a practice-based approach in the [[MacCrate Report]].

Many law schools have started to supplement classroom education with practical experience. [[Externship]] programs allow students to receive academic credit for unpaid work with a judge, government agency, or community legal services office. Several law schools also have law clinic programs in which students counsel actual clients under the supervision of a professor, such as [[University of Massachusetts School of Law]]. [[City University of New York School of Law]] and [[Florida Coastal School of Law]] are some of the few law schools that require student participation in law clinic courses. Similarly, [[Northeastern University School of Law]] and [[Savannah Law School]] use [[cooperative education]] to give their students law office work experience prior to graduation. [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]] has completely re-vamped its curriculum to require students to take practicum courses, externships, and clinics in the final year of law school to provide experience in preparation for practice.

=== Other issues ===
Large scale representative studies find that the overwhelming majority of lawyers are satisfied with their careers and their decisions to attend law school.&lt;ref name="No remorse"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinovitzer|first1=Ronit|last2=Garth|first2=Bryan|last3=Sterling|first3=Joyce|title=Buyers' Remorse?

{{expert needed|date=May 2014}}

A '''literature review''' or '''narrative review''' is a type of [[review article]].  A literature review is a [[scholarly paper]], which includes the current knowledge including substantive findings, as well as theoretical and methodological contributions to a particular topic. Literature reviews are [[secondary sources]], and do not report new or original experimental work.  Most often associated with academic-oriented literature, such reviews are found in [[academic journals]], and are not to be confused with [[book reviews]] that may also appear in the same publication.  Literature reviews are a basis for research in nearly every academic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gT1ADwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=literature+review+important+all+disciplines&amp;lr=|title=Doing a Literature Review: Releasing the Research Imagination|last=Hart|first=Chris|publisher=SAGE|year=2018|isbn=9781526423146|series=SAGE Study Skills Series|location=|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A narrow-scope literature review may be included as part of a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal article presenting new research, serving to situate the current study within the body of the relevant literature and to provide context for the reader. In such a case, the review usually precedes the methodology and results sections of the work.

Producing a literature review may also be part of graduate and post-graduate student work, including in the preparation of a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or a journal article. Literature reviews are also common in a [[research proposal]] or prospectus (the document that is approved before a student formally begins a dissertation or thesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baglione |first=L. |date=2012 |title=Writing a Research Paper in Political Science |location=Thousand Oaks, California |publisher=CQ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The main types of literature reviews are: ''evaluative'', ''exploratory'', and ''instrumental''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=John|last2=Khan|first2=Hafiz T A|last3=Raeside|first3=Robert|title=Research methods for graduate business and social science students|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9780761935896|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth type, the [[systematic review|''systematic'' review]], is often classified separately, but is essentially a literature review focused on a research question, trying to identify, appraise, select and synthesize all high-quality research evidence and arguments relevant to that question. A ''[[meta-analysis]]'' is typically a systematic review using statistical methods to effectively combine the data used on all selected studies to produce a more reliable result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolderston|first1=Amanda|title=Writing an Effective Literature Review|journal=Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences|date=June 2008|volume=39|issue=2|pages=86–92|doi=10.1016/j.jmir.2008.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process and product==
Shields and Rangarajan (2013) distinguish between the ''process'' of reviewing the literature and a finished work or ''product'' known as a literature review.&lt;ref name="Shields2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1-link=Patricia M. Shields |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |last2=Rangarjan |first2=Nandhini |date=2013 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management |location=Stillwater, Oklahoma |publisher=New Forums Press |ISBN=1-58107-247-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193–229}} The ''process'' of reviewing the literature is often ongoing and informs many aspects of the [[empirical research]] project. 

A careful literature review is usually 15 to 30 pages and could be longer.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The process of reviewing the literature requires different kinds of activities and ways of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=P. |date=2000 |title=Writing a Literature Review |journal=The Marketing Review |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=219–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) and Granello (2001) link the activities of doing a literature review with [[Benjamin Bloom]]’s revised taxonomy of the cognitive domain (ways of thinking: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating).&lt;ref name="Shields2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Granello2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Granello |first=D. H. |date=2001 |title=Promoting cognitive complexity in graduate written work: Using Bloom's taxonomy as a pedagogical tool to improve Literature Reviews. |journal=Counselor Education &amp; Supervision |volume=40 |pages=292–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marco Casagrande WEAK!.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marco Casagrande at SZHK Biennale 2009]]
'''Marco Casagrande''' (born May 7, 1971) is a [[list of Finnish architects|Finnish architect]], [[environmental art]]ist, [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], writer and [[professor]] of [[architecture]]. He graduated from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] department of architecture (2001).

== Early life ==
Casagrande was born in [[Turku]], Finland, to a well-off Finnish-Italian [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turunsanomat.fi/extra/?ts=1,3:1010:0:0,4:10:0:1:2001-01-27,104:10:64088,1:0:0:0:0:0: Kohuttu palkkasoturi päätyi arkkitehdiksi] - ''[[Turun Sanomat]]'' January 27, 2001 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood in [[Ylitornio]] in Finnish [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], but went to school in [[Karis]], a southern Finland small town, before moving to [[Helsinki]] to study architecture.

==Mercenary and writer==

Casagrande claimed that he volunteered for the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Bosnian Croat]] Defence Forces [[Croatian Defence Council|HVO]] in 1993 after his service in the [[Finnish Army]]. He wrote under the [[pen name]] Luca Moconesi a controversial book ''Mostarin tien liftarit / Hitchhikers on the Road to Mostar'' (WSOY 1997)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20010918IE19 ''The mind of a fanatic''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035219/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20010918IE19 |date=2007-09-30 }} - [[Helsingin Sanomat]], 18 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; about his alleged experiences in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian Civil War]], and based on descriptions of [[war crimes]] committed by the main character in the [[autobiography|autobiographical]] book, he came under suspicion as a possible war criminal. After becoming under suspicion he claimed that the book was in fact a work of fiction. The truth about Casagrande's involvement in the war remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voima.fi/content/view/full/531?PHPSESSID=3562ebc81376d0f87986b011af3e749b taiteen palkkasotureita] - ''[[Voima (newspaper)|Voima]]'' 4/2002 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Casagrande has expressed views condemning war crimes: "Those troops know that they are doing wrong. This is the very opposite of constructive collectivity and group spirit. Anybody can understand that it is by no measures militarily efficient to go kicking the doors of old people's home." Casagrande has been lecturing in the [[National Defence University (Finland)|National Defence University]] of Finland since 2006 on courses of [[strategy]] and [[leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;Anttalainen &amp; Vasaramäki, ''Casagrande'' (KALPA, Maanpuolustuskorkeakoulu, 2011), 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architect and artist ==
[[File:Taipei Organic Acupuncture by Marco Casagrande.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taipei organic acupuncture]]
From the early stages of his career Casagrande started to mix architecture with other disciplines of art and science landing with a series of ecologically conscious architectural installations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w3-mediapool.hm.edu/mediapool/media/fk01/fk01_lokal/aktuelles_7/veranstaltungen_8/vortragsreihess11/Casagrande-neu.pdf Architektur zwischen Landart und Konzeptkunst] - ''[[Munich University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Munchen]] '' 6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; After being a finalist in the UK journal ''[[Architectural Review]]''{{'}}s Emerging Architecture competition (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1234_206/ai_59177282] - ''[[Architectural Review]]'' 12/1999&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Casagrande and his then partner [[Sami Rintala]] were invited to the [[Venice Biennial]] 2000.  The [[New York Times]] reporter chose their project "60 Minute Man" as his personal favorite in the Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporary-magazine.com/architech44.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808170851/http://www.contemporary-magazine.com/architech44.htm |archivedate=2007-08-08 |df= }} - ''Adam Mornament: When Attitude Becomes Form'' Contemporary -magazine 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the project [[Casagrande &amp; Rintala]] had planted on oak forest in an abandoned barge on top of 60 minutes worth of composted human waste produced by the city of Venice. Casagrande's cross-over architectural work encompasses the realms of architecture, urban and [[environmental planning]], [[environmental art]], [[circus]]es and other [[art]]istic disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionarythurrock.org.uk/docs/facilities/who.html#] - ''Thurrock: A Visionary Brief in the Thames Gateway'' General Public Agency 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

''In search for subconscious architecture, real reality and connection between the modern man and nature. He believes that one shall not be blindfolded by stress, the surroundings of economics, the online access to entertainment or information. What is real is valuable.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleyprize.org/essay/essay.cfm?year=2004&amp;link=committee.cfm] - ''Berkeley Prize Committee and Jury'' University of California, Berkeley 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Casagrande's works and teaching are moving freely in-between architecture, urban and environmental design and science, environmental art and circus adding up into cross-over architectural thinking of ''commedia dell'architettura'', a broad vision of built human environment tied into social drama and environmental awareness. ''There is no other reality than nature''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w3-mediapool.hm.edu/mediapool/media/fk01/fk01_lokal/aktuelles_7/veranstaltungen_8/vortragsreihess11/Casagrande-neu.pdf Architektur zwischen Landart und Konzeptkunst] - ''[[Munich University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Munchen]] '' 6/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third generation city ==

Casagrande views cities as complex energy [[organism]]s in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing [[environmentalism]] and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (post industrial city).&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M.

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=2013-04-16 }} - ''Urban Applications - Community + Design Placemaking'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the Third Generation City views the post industrial urban condition as a machine ruined by nature including human nature and architects as ''design shamans merely interpreting what the bigger nature of the shared mind is transmitting.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr9/eng/cross-over.html] - ''Marco Casagrande: Cross-over Architecture and the Third Generation City'' Epifanio 9 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  This organic machine is kept alive through continuous and spontaneous ruining processes performed by citizens, to whom Casagrande refers to as 「anarchist gardeners」 by means of urban farming,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 The Community Gardens of Taipei] - P2P Foundation 2010&lt;/ref&gt; illegal architecture &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120526043446/http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ Illegal Architecture in Taipei] - Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan, Architizer 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Urban Acupuncture|urban acupuncture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/ruin-academy/docs/anarchist_gardener_issue_one Anarchist Gardener Issue One 安那其建築園丁] – ''Nikita Wu: Anarchist Gardener '' 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The element of Ruin is viewed as something man-made having become part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dezeen.com/2009/06/26/chen-house-by-c-laboratory/ Chen House by C-Laboratory] - Dezeen 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is developed in the independent multidisciplinary research centre [[Ruin Academy]] (2010-).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landezine.com/index.php/2010/11/ruin-academy/ Ruin Academy] - Landezine 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Generation City follows the first generation where humans' peacefully coexisted with nature and the second generation built walls and stone structures everywhere in an attempt to shut out nature. In the third generation however, nature, which can never be truly shut out, grows back through the ruins, through the cracks in the wall, sucking human nature back into the wider nature. Third Generation City concentrates on local knowledge and urban acupuncture rather than on centrally governed urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erenlai.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4520%3Areturning-man-to-nature-and-reality&amp;catid=697%3Amay-focus&amp;Itemid=348&amp;lang=en Returning Humans to Nature and Reality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211202/http://www.erenlai.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4520:returning-man-to-nature-and-reality&amp;catid=697:may-focus&amp;Itemid=348&amp;lang=en |date=2012-03-08 }} - Nick Couson, eRenlai 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:&lt;br /&gt;
''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] - Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html Ruin Academy] - Marco Casagrande'' Epifanio 14 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''  The theory 
opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom.  Each citizen is enabled to join the creative process, feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop his environment according to his will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadsbyggnad.lth.se/fileadmin/stadsbyggnad/images/_1_Sudes_Book/_1_B5_webversion1.pdf Compost City] - Guoda Bardauskait'' p. 30-31, Sustainable Urban Design Journal 1 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The agents of the Third Generation City are sensitive citizens who feel the calling of a sustainable co-operation with the rest of the nature, sensitive citizen who are aware of the destruction that the insensitive modern machine is causing to nature including human nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianurbanepicenters.com/?p=941 An alternative learning platform: Ruin Academy – Anarchist Gardener] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621053914/http://www.asianurbanepicenters.com/?p=941 |date=2012-06-21 }} - Mizah Rahman'', Asian Urban Epicenters 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture produces small-scale but socially catalytic interventions into the urban fabric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QbY7on6asu8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=urban+acupuncture+casagrande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gd8ozw3OLd&amp;sig=D0C58eXMpJuOZzsLtp6XftKyqnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mZxxUcu4C8HRtQbIsICoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=urban%20acupuncture%20casagrande&amp;f=false Ruin Academy - Casagrande Lab] - ''Ariane Lourie Harrison, Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory''Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

''Architects’ and designers’ position about organic knowledge is tricky. We are not the ones who carry this collective genetic memory on, but we are in a better position to interpret and negotiate with it, step by step, like a shaman getting answers from the organic side. This can easily go very wrong, when architect starts copyrighting fragments of local knowledge under his ego. I guess often it would be enough to create a platform of accidents for the organic knowledge to surface, start cooking, and finding its own forms and dynamics. Design is not necessarily needed in here, and design should not replace reality – while organic knowledge is close to reality, nature.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biourbanism.org/change-from-organic-city/ Change from organic city] - M.

== Collaboration with Rintala ==

'''Casagrande &amp; Rintala''' - Marco Casagrande and Sami Rintala -  is a Finnish architect and artist group producing architectonic installations 1998&amp;ndash;2003 for international venues of contemporary architecture and art. Their works are moving in-between [[architecture]] and [[environmental art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporary-magazine.com/architech44.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808170851/http://www.contemporary-magazine.com/architech44.htm |archivedate=2007-08-08 |df= }} - ''World Architecture Community'' Contemporary -magazine 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

For their landscape installation ''1000 White Flags'' (summer 2002), for example, the artists speckled a downhill-skiing range in Koli Nature Park, Finland, with flags made of used sheets from mental hospitals. Casagrande &amp; Rintala here drew attention to the madness of businessmen who cut down ancient forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciac.ca/biennale2002/en/casagrande.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531151039/http://www.ciac.ca/biennale2002/en/casagrande.htm |archivedate=2007-05-31 |df= }} - ''Biennale de Montreal: Casagrande &amp; Rintala (Finland)'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Casagrande &amp; Rintala's work [[Land(e)scape]] was awarded in the [[Architectural Review]]'s Emerging Architecture Award 1999 competition&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1234_206/ai_59177282] - ''[[Architectural Review]]'' 12/1999&lt;/ref&gt; and chosen to the [[Venice Biennale]] 2000. ''New York Times'' architecture critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] chose their project [[60 Minute Man]] his personal favourite of the biennale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E3DF113BF930A15754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3]  - ''The New York Times'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Casagrande &amp; Rintala designed and built all their works by themselves. The design process continued during the construction work. &lt;br /&gt;
"The work itself usually changes its shape or obtains more layers during the construction process. We keep ourselves open to changes in the work. When it is finding its shape it usually starts to tell us more about itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://architettura.supereva.com/architetture/20011101/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018164825/http://architettura.supereva.com/architetture/20011101/index.htm |archivedate=2006-10-18 |df= }} - ''ARCH'IT: Casagrande &amp; Rintala ''  2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land(e)scape''' (1999), an architectural [[Installation art|installation]] by Finnish architects Casagrande &amp; Rintala, with Marco Casagrande and [[Sami Rintala]], in a former [[Field (agriculture)|field]] in [[Savonlinna]]. The work is commenting on the desertion process of the Finnish countryside.

Three of these abandoned barns "were driven," the architects explained, "to the point where they have had to break their primeval union with the soil. Desolate, they have risen on their shanks and are swaying towards the cities of the south."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010415065647/http://www.arplus.com/archive/Dec99/casagrande/casagrande.html] - ''The Architectural Review: A dramatic architectural installation designed to draw attention to the plight of the Finnish countryside, 12/1999''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Redrum''' (2003) is an [[architecture|architectonic]] installation in [[Anchorage]] [[Alaska]] by [[Finnish people|Finnish]] architects [[Casagrande &amp; Rintala]]. The work is commissioned by Alaska Design Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskadesignforum.org/archive/index.htm ''Alaska Design Forum''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618202322/http://www.alaskadesignforum.org/archive/index.htm |date=2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3 [[Alaska Railroad]] [[oil]] tanks cut into total 12 pieces and turned into a [[temple]] structure opposite the Federal Building of Anchorage in the crossing of C-Street and 7th Avenue. The interior is painted bright red in contrast to the rusty and brutal exterior. The floor is made of 3500&amp;nbsp;kg of [[oyster]] shells, the origin of all Alaskan oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oppositionalarchitecture.com/CFOA/download%20reader.pdf ''Camp for oppositional architecture'' 25.6.2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009114803/http://www.oppositionalarchitecture.com/CFOA/download%20reader.pdf |date=2007-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Redrum" is "murder" backwards. The designers intended to comment on the connection of oil, war and environment. Local media described the piece as "a slap in the face to Alaskans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">'''Marguerite Lundgren''' (born 5 October 1916 in [[London]], d. 1 August 1983 in [[Hamburg]], Germany) was a British/Swedish [[Eurythmy|eurythmist]] and [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophist]].

Marguerite Lundgren was born to a [[Sweden|Swedish]] father and English mother and during her childhood lived both in Sweden and England, being fluent in both languages. Through an aunt, who was one of the founders of the  [[Wynstones School]] in [[Gloucestershire]], she was able to attend the [[Michael Hall (school)|Michael Hall school]], then in South London. This stimulated her interest in [[eurythmy]], which she went on to study with Lieselotte Mann in England. In 1946, after completing her training, she joined the stage group at the. [[Goetheanum]] in [[Dornach]], Switzerland, where her originality and talent were quickly spotted by the troupe leader, Marie Savitch. This led to a lifelong bond and common research between the two women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=1059 Marguerite Lundgren - Biographischer Eintrag in der Online-Dokumentation der anthroposophischen ''Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, she was asked to return to England to take over the eurythmy school of Vera and Judy Compton-Burnett, where she came to know and work closely with [[Owen Barfield]] and [[Cecil Harwood]], whom she married in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;''Owen Barfield: Romanticism Comes of Age – a Biography'' by Simon Blaxland De Lange, Temple Lodge Pub 2006 •  {{ISBN|1902636775}} {{ISBN|978-1902636771}} Page 293 - 296&lt;/ref&gt; Their cooperation led to her fundamental research in creating a eurythmic form specifically for the English language. For many years she taught and performed with the London School of Eurythmy, which she directed, and the London Stage Group. The work took her regularly to Scandinavia, North America and South Africa, where she did much to assist the development of eurythmy.

The last years of her life brought with them the death of her husband, Cecil Harwood, from which she never quite recovered, and the move of her eurythmy school from London to [[East Grinstead]] in Sussex, close to where they had lived for many years. She died in August 1983. The book ''Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance'' written together with Cecil Harwood and Marjorie Raffé, records her research into the principles of eurythmy in English.

'''''Marilyn Anne''''' is a three-masted auxiliary [[schooner]] that was built in 1919 as '''''Frem''''' by her Danish owner. She was sold to Sweden in 1938 and later renamed '''''Vestvåg'''''. In 1958, she was sold to Denmark and renamed '''''Vest'''''. Following her sale to an American owner in 1968, she was renamed ''Marilyn Anne''. In 1977, she became a training ship for disadvantaged Danish children.

In 1977, he abandoned the project and she was sold to the [[Struer Municipality]] in 1978. Following completion of the restoration work, ownership of ''Marilyn Anne'' was transferred to a holding company owned by the [[Herning Municipality|Herning]], [[Holstebro Municipality|Holstebro]] and Struer Municipalities.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; On 17 June 1996, Denmark issued a [[postage stamp]] depicting ''Marilyn Anne''.&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/43550-Gaff-rigged_schooner_Marilyn_Anne_1919-Sailships-Denmark |title=Gaff-rigged schooner "Marilyn Anne" (1919) |publisher=Colnect |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship now{{when|date=April 2017}} serves as a school ship for disadvantaged children.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

'''''Moondance'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moondance.org Moondance: Celebrating Creative Women - FULFILLMENT Issue — December 2007 - March 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is an online international women's literary, culture and art journal. The magazine began in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moondance.org/chronicles/ Moondance magazine issues 1996-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Said Editor-in-Chief Loretta Kemsley, "My background in newspaper design was a good start for our fledgling ezine but so very different from the demands and opportunities of Internet publishing. With little experience to guide us, that first edition was an adventure unto itself. Some of our volunteers doubted we could accomplish this feat, even as we worked hard to meet our self imposed deadline: September, 1996. Moondance was coded for Internet browsers while reading a book on simplified HTML," &lt;ref name="moondance.org"&gt;[http://moondance.org/chronicles/founding.html Moondance Chronicle - The Founding of Moondance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Loretta Kemsley of Los Angeles, creator and publisher for the magazine, began her media career in the mid-1950s as a young [[Equestrianism|horsewoman]] and stunt rider for cowboy star [[Gene Autry]] through Flying A Productions studios in Hollywood. In June 1954, Kemsley rode as a stunt double,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lore.moondance.org/buffalobilljr.html Life and Lore Interwoven&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of eight, for Nancy Gilbert who played the young Calamity in the ''[[Buffalo Bill, Jr.]]'' NBC series directed by George Archainbaud,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132652/fullcredits#directors "Buffalo Bill, Jr." (1955) - Full cast and crew&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Dick Jones (actor)|Dick Jones]] as Buffalo Bill, Jr., the Marshall of Wileyville, Texas. Forty more episodes were later co-produced by Autry for the children's western from 1954-1956.

==History==

"Moondance was an experiment without precedent when it began, but today is the role model for a variety of exciting new ezines. When we decided to publish Moondance, we searched the Internet for examples to emulate. None could be found. Starting from scratch, we used trial and error to devise the successful format which uses the best of print media design, combined with the expanded capabilities of online media, while remaining accessible to those with hardware and software limitations. Moondance is coded specifically for disabled access," said Kemsley about the magazine's creation.&lt;ref name="moondance.org"/&gt;

Only three years after its beginning in 1999, ''Moondance'' received a [[UNESCO]] Web Prize Award, Category I (Free Themes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://moondance.org/1999/winter99/index.html Moondance E-zine ~ Celebrating Creative Women - Winter 99 Issue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO - the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3328&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html About UNESCO - What is it? What does it do? | UNESCO.ORG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded as a cultural wing of the United Nations in 1945. Created through the UNESCO prize for the promotion of the arts the UNESCO Web Prize Competition was awarded from 1997-2003 "in recognition of the growing cultural and societal importance of the new information and communication technologies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/99-30e.htm 1999 UNESCO WEB PRIZE COMPETITION {23 February 1999}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In March, 1998, we were honored when Moondance was presented by Ida Miro Kiss, a Hungarian feminist and renowned speaker, as an example of women networking on the Internet at the UNESCO Inter-governmental Conference, Stockholm, Sweden," said Kemsley.

''Moondance'' is currently{{when|date=August 2014}} being used in many various university-level classroom curricula across the United States including [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]], [[George Mason University]] and [[Akamai University]] of Hawaii among others.{{cn|date=August 2014}} Mujeres University in Madrid, Spain has also used Moondance magazine in their English studies classroom curriculum since 1999. Today the American Political Science Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/~wpol/links.html :: Apsa ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2014}} a political science consortium of over 80 universities and higher education centers uses Moondance as a reference to enable a greater study and understanding of women's gender issues.

Past writers for ''Moondance'' include noted women journalists, poets, authors and novelists.

'''Olivia America Davidson Washington''' (June 11, 1854 – May 9, 1889) was born free as '''Olivia America Davidson''' in Virginia. After her family moved to the free state of Ohio, she studied in common schools and later college. She became a teacher and educator.

Davidson was hired by [[Booker T. Washington]] as a teacher and assistant principal of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] from 1881. In this role she also did fundraising and gave public speeches, especially about the education of African-American women. In 1886 she married Washington, the principal and a widower. She was his second wife; they had two sons together and reared his daughter by his first marriage. Olivia Washington died three years later of [[tuberculosis]].

==Early life and education==
Olivia America Davidson was born free on June 11, 1854, in Mercer County, Virginia, now [[Mercer County, West Virginia]]. Her mother was a [[free people of color|free woman of color]] and her father Elias Davidson had been freed from slavery. He worked in agriculture. Under slavery law, children took the status of their mother. Olivia had at least two sisters and a brother; all were born free. When Olivia was still a child, her family left western Virginia because of its discriminatory treatment of free blacks. 

They moved to [[Ironton Ohio|Ironton, Ohio]], as it was a free state. Some time after her father Elias died, the family moved to [[Albany, Ohio]]. Davidson continued to study at common schools.&lt;ref name="dorsey"&gt;Dorsey, Carolyn A. "The Pre-Hampton Years of Olivia A. Davidson," ''The Hampton Review 14.'' Fall 1988. 44–52.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870, she was living with her sister Mary and brother-in-law Noah Elliot in [[Gallipolis Ohio|Gallipolis]]. Her sister, a dressmaker and milliner, relocated with her husband several times before they settled in the larger city of  [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="dorsey"/&gt;

==Education career==
In 1870, at the age of 16, Davidson began teaching in towns in Ohio, Mississippi, and Arkansas.&lt;ref name="dorsey"/&gt; In 1874, she became a sixth-grade teacher in the new Clay Street School in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (now the [[Booker T. Washington High School (Memphis, Tennessee)|now operated as the Booker T. Washington High School]]). Her sister Margaret was also a teacher here, and their brother Joseph also lived and worked in the city. Her principal instituted changes recommended by Davidson. While Olivia was in Memphis, her sister Margaret died. In 1878 their brother Joseph was murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], at a time of violence to suppress black voting. Davidson returned to Ohio shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="dorsey"/&gt;

That year she enrolled as a senior at the Hampton Institute, now [[Hampton University]], in Virginia. She did so well that she was one of the graduation speakers on May 22, 1879. From there, she attended the State Normal School at [[Framingham, Massachusetts]] (now [[Framingham State University]]), where she studied further to get a teaching degree. Davidson graduated on June 29, 1881 as one of six honor students. 

Davidson returned to Hampton to recover from a serious illness. She also began teaching a group of Native American men who had been enrolled there as students after being released as [[prisoners of war]] from a United States fort in Florida. They were warriors from Plains Tribes who had been captured in the Indian Wars.

[[Booker T. Washington]], the postgraduate speaker at Hampton, contacted Davidson, asking her to help him develop the new Tuskegee Institute. After recovering from her illness, she joined him on August 25, 1881 as a teacher and vice principal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuskegee.edu/about_us/legacy_of_leadership/booker_t_washington/establishing_a_legacy.aspx. Tuskegee, ''Tuskegee University''.]&lt;/ref&gt; She threw herself into the work despite her precarious health, becoming Washington's partner in building Tuskegee. His first wife, Fannie N. Smith, died in 1884.

On August 11, 1886, in [[Athens, Ohio]], Davidson married the widower Washington.&lt;ref&gt;"Olivia Davidson and Booker T. Washington Wedding Invitation", FSU Historical Image Collection, 2013, Paper 64, [http://digitalcommons.framingham.edu/lib_aschistcoll/64]&lt;/ref&gt; She served as stepmother to young Portia Washington, the child of Booker T.'s first marriage.&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt;

In 1886, Olivia Davidson Washington addressed the Alabama State Teachers' Association on the topic of "How Shall We Make the Women of Our Race Stronger?," advocating that teachers strive to reach black girls as the "hope of the race." During her time at Tuskegee, she also helped raise funds for the school, both locally and through her contacts in the North.&lt;ref name="notable"&gt;"Olivia Davidson Washington," ''Notable Black American Women'', Gale, 1992. Biography In Context. Web. October 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first son, Booker T., Jr., was born on May 29, 1887. Their second son, Ernest Davidson Washington, was born February 6, 1889. Two days later, the Washingtons' house at Tuskegee burned down. Olivia Washington suffered exposure to the early morning cold and likely already had contracted [[tuberculosis]] (TB). Her health deteriorated and she died three months later of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] TB on May 9, 1889, at [[Mass general|Massachusetts General Hospital]].

[[File:Global Open Educational Resources Logo.svg|thumb|[[UNESCO]] Global Open Educational Resources Logo]]
'''Open educational resources''' ('''OER''') are freely accessible, [[open license|openly licensed]] text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes. There is no universal usage of [[open format|open file formats]] in OER. 

The term OER describes publicly accessible materials and resources for any user to use, re-mix, improve and redistribute under some licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.temple.edu/OER|title=Research Guides: Discovering Open Educational Resources (OER): Home|last=Bell|first=Steven|website=guides.temple.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development and promotion of open educational resources is often motivated by a desire to provide an alternate or enhanced ''[[education]]al [[paradigm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez|first=Claudia|title=The use of technological resources for education: a new professional competency for teachers|url=https://blogs.intel.com/intel-education-solutions/2012/11/30/the-use-of-technological-resources-for-education-a-new-professional-competency-for-teachers/|work=Intel® Learning Series blog|publisher=Intel Corporation|accessdate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329000906/http://blogs.intel.com/intel-education-solutions/2012/11/30/the-use-of-technological-resources-for-education-a-new-professional-competency-for-teachers/|archivedate=29 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and scope==
The idea of open educational resources (OER) has numerous working definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is OER?|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/What_is_OER|work=wiki.creativecommons.org|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was firstly coined at UNESCO's 2002 Forum on Open Courseware&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=chRkDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq=OER+in+UNESCO+2002&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR-JfI-fLXAhVILhoKHZnrA9sQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=OER%20in%20UNESCO%202002&amp;f=false|title=Science Education Research and Practice in Asia: Challenges and Opportunities|last=Chiu|first=Mei-Hung|date=2016-06-10|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9789811008474|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designates "teaching, learning and research materials in any medium, digital or otherwise, that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions. Open licensing is built within the existing framework of intellectual property rights as defined by relevant international conventions and respects the authorship of the work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/WPFD2009/English_Declaration.html|title=2012 Paris OER Declaration|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often cited is the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]] term which defines OER as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Educational Resources|url=http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education-program/open-educational-resources|work=The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) defines OER as: "digitised materials offered freely and openly for educators, students, and self-learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning, and research. OER includes learning content, software tools to develop, use, and distribute content, and implementation resources such as open licences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: THE EMERGENCE OF OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf|work=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is the definition cited by Wikipedia's sister project, [[Wikiversity]].) By way of comparison, the [[Commonwealth of Learning]] "has adopted the widest definition of Open Educational Resources (OER) as 'materials offered freely and openly to use and adapt for teaching, learning, development and research'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Educational Resources (OER)|url=http://www.col.org/resources/crsMaterials/Pages/OCW-OER.aspx|work=CoL.org|publisher=Commonwealth of Learning|accessdate=16 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503135718/http://www.col.org/resources/crsMaterials/Pages/OCW-OER.aspx|archivedate=3 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WikiEducator]] project suggests that OER refers "to educational resources (lesson plans, quizzes, syllabi, instructional modules, simulations, etc.) that are freely available for use, reuse, adaptation, and sharing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oer|url=http://wikieducator.org/Oer|work=WikiEducator.org|publisher=WikiEducator.org|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining OER|url=http://wikieducator.org/Educators_care/Defining_OER|work=WikiEducator.org|publisher=[[Open Education Resource Foundation]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above definitions expose some of the tensions that exist with OER:
*'''Nature of the resource:''' Several of the definitions above limit the definition of OER to digital resources, while others consider that any educational resource can be included in the definition.
*'''Source of the resource:''' While some of the definitions require a resource to be produced with an explicit educational aim in mind, others broaden this to include any resource which may potentially be used for learning.
*'''Level of openness:''' Most definitions require that a resource be placed in the public domain or under a fully open license. Others require only that free use to be granted for educational purposes, possibly excluding commercial uses. 

These definitions also have common elements, namely they all:
*cover use and reuse, repurposing, and modification of the resources;
*include free use for educational purposes by teachers and learners
*encompass all types of digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Camilleri |first1=Anthony F |last2=Ehlers |first2=Ulf |last3=Pawlowski|first3=Jan|year=2014 |title= State of the Art Review of Quality Issues related to Open Educational Resources (OER)|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|publication-place=Luxembourg |page=54 |url= http://www.pedocs.de/volltexte/2014/9101/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given the diversity of users, creators and sponsors of open educational resources, it is not surprising to find a variety of use cases and requirements. For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.

There is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER. While a semantic distinction can be made delineating the technologies used to access and host learning content from the content itself, these technologies are generally accepted as part of the collective of open educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (What are open educational resources?)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=10|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since OER are intended to be available for a variety of educational purposes, ''most'' organizations using OER neither award degrees nor provide academic or administrative support to students seeking college credits towards a diploma from a degree granting [[Higher education accreditation|accredited institution]].&lt;ref name="hafner"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hafner| first = Katie| title = Higher Education Reimagined With Online Courseware| work = New York Times| location = New York| accessdate = 2010-12-19| date = 2010-04-16| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18open-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnstone"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | last = Johnstone | first = Sally M. | title = Open Educational Resources Serve the World | journal = Educause Quarterly | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/EDUCAUSEQuarterlyMagazineVolum/OpenEducationalResourcesServet/157357 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100901161749/http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/EDUCAUSEQuarterlyMagazineVolum/OpenEducationalResourcesServet/157357 | archive-date = 2010-09-01 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[open education]], there is an emerging effort by some accredited institutions to offer free certifications, or achievement badges, to document and acknowledge the accomplishments of participants.

In order for educational resources to be OER, they must have an open license.  Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).  The [[Creative Commons license]] is the most widely used licensing framework internationally used for OER.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The term [[learning object]] was coined in 1994 by Wayne Hodgins and quickly gained currency among educators and instructional designers, popularizing the idea that digital materials can be designed to allow easy reuse in a wide range of teaching and learning situations.&lt;ref name=expert-meeting&gt;{{Cite journal|first = David|last= Wiley|title= Expert Meeting on Open Educational Resources |place= |publisher= Centre for Educational Research and Innovation|date= 2006-02-06|accessdate = 2015-11-18|url=https://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/36224377.pdf|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OER movement originated from developments in [[open and distance learning]] (ODL) and in the wider context of a culture of [[open knowledge]], [[open source]], free sharing and peer collaboration, which emerged in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=expert-meeting /&gt; OER and [[FLOSS|Free/Libre Open Source Software]] (FLOSS), for instance, have many aspects in common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://oerwiki.iiep.unesco.org/index.php/FOSS_solutions_for_OER_-_summary_report| title = FOSS solutions for OER - summary report| accessdate = 2011-02-20| authorlink = Unesco community| date = 2009-05-28| publisher = Unesco| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728143259/http://oerwiki.iiep.unesco.org/index.php/FOSS_solutions_for_OER_-_summary_report| archivedate = 2011-07-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Jan|last= Hylén|title = Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources |place = Paris, France|publisher = OECD Publishing|year = 2007|doi = 10.1787/9789264032125-en|accessdate = 2010-12-03|url = http://www.sourceoecd.org/education/9789264031746}}&lt;/ref&gt; a connection first established in 1998 by [[David A.

The [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] project is credited for having sparked a global Open Educational Resources Movement after announcing in 2001 that it was going to put [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s entire course catalog online and launching this project in 2002.&lt;ref name="guttenplan"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Guttenplan| first = D.

The term "open educational resources" was first adopted at [[UNESCO]]'s 2002 Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries.&lt;ref name="Johnstone" /&gt;

In 2005 OECD's Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) launched a 20-month study to analyse and map the scale and scope of initiatives regarding "open educational resources" in terms of their purpose, content, and funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oecd.org/document/20/0,3343,en_2649_35845581_35023444_1_1_1_1,00.html |title= Open Educational Resources|accessdate = 2011-01-02| publisher = CERI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report "Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|place = Paris, France|publisher = OECD Publishing|year = 2007|doi = 10.1787/9789264032125-en|accessdate = 2010-12-03|url = http://www.sourceoecd.org/education/9789264031746}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in May 2007, is the main output of the project, which involved a number of expert meetings in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CERI - Open Educational Resources: Meetings and Conferences - OECD|url = http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3746,en_2649_35845581_35735605_1_1_1_1,00.html|website = www.oecd.org|accessdate = 2015-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the [[Open Society Institute]] and the [[Shuttleworth Foundation]] convened a meeting in Cape Town to which thirty leading proponents of [[open education]] were invited to collaborate on the text of a manifesto. The [[Cape Town Open Education Declaration]] was released on 22 January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 5| issue = 5| last = Deacon| first = Andrew|author2=Catherine Wynsculley| title = Educators and the Cape Town Open Learning Declaration: Rhetorically reducing distance| journal = International Journal of Education and Development using ICT| accessdate = 2010-12-27| year = 2009| url = http://ijedict.dec.uwi.edu/viewarticle.php?id=878&amp;layout=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging governments and publishers to make publicly funded educational materials available at no charge via the internet.&lt;ref name="capetown-declaration"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cape Town Open Education Declaration | work = Cape Town Declaration | accessdate = 2010-12-27 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/read-the-declaration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global movement for OER culminated at the 1st World OER Congress convened in Paris on 20–22 June 2012 by UNESCO, [[Commonwealth of Learning|COL]] and other partners. The resulting [[UNESCO 2012 Paris OER Declaration|Paris OER Declaration]] (2012) reaffirmed the shared commitment of international organizations, governments, and institutions to promoting the open licensing and free sharing of publicly funded content, the development of national policies and strategies on OER, capacity-building, and open research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002443/244365e.pdf|title=Open educational resources: policy, costs, transformation|last=Miao|first=Fengchun|last2=Mishra|first2=Sanjaya|last3=McGreal|first3=Rory|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100158-1|location=|pages=8, 17, 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the 2nd World OER Congress in Ljubljana, Slovenia, was co-organized by UNESCO and the Government of Slovenia.

An historical antecedent to consider is the pedagogy of artist [[Joseph Beuys]] and the founding of the [[Free International University]] for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research in 1973. After co-creating with his students, in 1967, the German Student Party, Beuys was dismissed from his teaching post in 1972 at the Staatliche Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. The institution did not approve of the fact that he permitted 50 students who had been rejected from admission to study with him. The Free University became increasingly involved in political and radical actions calling for a revitalization and restructuring of educational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guggenheim Museum|title=Joseph Beuys|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/423|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|accessdate=10 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311025826/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/423|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biro|first=Matthew|title=The Arts of Joseph Beuys|journal=The Journal of the International Institute|date=Winter 1995|volume= 2|issue= 2|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jii/4750978.0002.203?view=text;rgn=main|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing and types==
[[File:Turning a Resource into an Open Educational Resource.webm|thumb|right|Turning a Resource into an Open Educational Resource]]

Open educational resources often involve issues relating to [[intellectual property]] rights. Traditional educational materials, such as textbooks, are protected under conventional [[copyright]] terms. However, alternative and more flexible licensing options have become available as a result of the work of [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization that provides ready-made licensing agreements that are less restrictive than the "all rights reserved" terms of standard international copyright. These new options have become a "critical infrastructure service for the OER movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | publisher = The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | last = Atkins | first = Daniel E. | author2 = John Seely Brown | author3 = Allen L.

Open licensing allows uses of the materials that would not be easily permitted under copyright alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jan |last=Hylén |title = Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|place = Paris, France|publisher = OECD Publishing|year = 2007|page = 30|doi = 10.1787/9789264032125-en|accessdate = 2010-12-03|url = http://www.sourceoecd.org/education/9789264031746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of open educational resources include: full courses, course materials, modules, [[learning object]]s, [[open textbook]]s, openly licensed (often streamed) videos, tests, software, and other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge. OER may be freely and openly available static resources, dynamic resources which change over time in the course of having knowledge seekers interacting with and updating them (such as this Wikipedia article), or a course or module with a combination of these resources.

==OER policy==
{{main article|Open educational resources policy}}

'''Open educational resources policies''' are principles or tenets adopted by governing bodies in support of the use of [[open content]] and practices in educational institutions. Many of these policies require publicly funded resources be openly licensed. Such policies are emerging increasingly at the country, state/province and more local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI), OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Creative Commons]] hosts an open educational resources policy registry lists 95 current and proposed open education policies from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OER Policy Registry|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Creative Commons]] and multiple other open organizations launched the Open Policy Network to foster the creation, adoption and implementation of open policies and practices that advance the public good by supporting open policy advocates, organizations and policy makers, connecting open policy opportunities with assistance, and sharing open policy information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Policy Network|url=http://openpolicynetwork.org/|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
One of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, T. J., Hilton, J., Wiley, D., &amp; Thanos, K. (2013, January 7). The cost and quality of online open textbooks: Perceptions of community college faculty and students. ''First Monday'', 1(18). Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/&lt;/nowiki&gt; index.php/fm/article/view/3972/3383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millard, M. (2014, September). ''Open-source textbooks can help drive down the overall cost of college''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_&lt;/nowiki&gt; Case_Studies/United_States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OpenStax College. (2014, October 14). ''Our textbooks have saved students $30 million''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://openstaxcollege.org/news/our-textbooks-have-&lt;/nowiki&gt; saved-students-30-million&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, D. A., Hilton III, J. L., Ellington, S., &amp; Hall, T. (2012). A preliminary examination of the cost savings and learning impacts of using open textbooks in middle and high school science classes. ''International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning (IRRODL)''. Retrieved from http:// www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153&lt;/ref&gt; While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, N., &amp; Hoosen, S. (2012). ''Exploring the business case for Open Educational Resources''. Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from http:// www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421&lt;/ref&gt; noted that “a key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies. However, to date there has been limited presentation of concrete data to back up this assertion, which reduces the effectiveness of such arguments and opens the OER movement to justified academic criticism.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Institutional support==
A large part of the early work on open educational resources was funded by universities and foundations such as the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]],&lt;ref name="guttenplan" /&gt; which was the main financial supporter of open educational resources in the early years and has spent more than $110 million in the 2002 to 2010 period, of which more than $14 million went to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT]].&lt;ref name="hafner" /&gt; The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], which focuses on projects concerning collaborative content creation, has contributed as well. With the British government contributing £5.7m,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Swain| first = Harriet| title = Any student, any subject, anywhere| work = The Guardian| location = London| accessdate = 2010-12-19| date = 2009-11-10| url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/nov/10/web-technology-degree-future-online}}&lt;/ref&gt; institutional support has also been provided by the UK funding bodies [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open educational resources programme - phase 2 | work = JISC | accessdate = 2010-12-03 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/oer }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open educational resources programme - phase 1 | work = JISC | accessdate = 2010-12-03 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/oer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] is taking a leading role in "making countries aware of the potential of OER."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Initiative Background| work = Taking OER beyond the OER Community| accessdate = 2011-01-01| year = 2009| url = http://oerworkshop.weebly.com/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has instigated debate on how to apply OERs in practice and chaired vivid discussions on this matter through its [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning|International Institute of Educational Planning]] (IIEP).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Believing that OERs can widen access to quality education, particularly when shared by many countries and higher education institutions, UNESCO also champions OERs as a means of promoting access, equity and quality in the spirit of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education| title = Communiqué: The New Dynamics of Higher Education and Research for Societal Change and Development| year = 2009| url = http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/ED/pdf/WCHE_2009/FINAL%20COMMUNIQUE%20WCHE%202009.pdf| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Initiatives==
A parallel initiative, [[OpenStax CNX|OpenStax CNX (formerly Connexions)]], came out of [[Rice University]] starting in 1999. In the beginning, the Connexions project focused on creating an open repository of user-generated content. In contrast to the OCW projects, content licenses are required to be open under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution International 4.0 (CC BY) license. The hallmark of Connexions is the use of a custom XML format CNXML, designed to aid and enable mixing and reuse of the content.

In 2012, [[OpenStax]] was created from the basis of the Connexions project. In contrast to user-generated content libraries, OpenStax hires subject matter experts to create college-level textbooks that are peer-reviewed, openly licensed, and available online for free.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/346309/free-textbooks-from-rice-openstax-too-good-to-be-true|title=Free Textbooks From Rice OpenStax: Too Good to Be True?|work=PCMAG|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the content in OpenStax CNX, OpenStax books are available under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons CC BY licenses]] that allow users to reuse, remix, and redistribute content as long as they provide attribution. OpenStax's stated mission is to create professional grade textbooks for the highest-enrollment undergraduate college courses that are the same quality as traditional textbooks, but are adaptable and available free to students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other initiatives derived from [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] are [[China Open Resources for Education]] and [[OpenCourseWare in Japan]].  The OpenCourseWare Consortium, founded in 2005 to extend the reach and impact of open course materials and foster new open course materials, counted more than 200 member institutions from around the world in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Attwood| first = Rebecca| title = Get it out in the open| work = Times Higher Education| location = London| accessdate = 2010-12-18| date = 2009-09-24| url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=408300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the ownership of [[Wikipedia]] and [[Wiktionary]] projects was transferred to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], a non-profit charitable organization whose goal is to collecting and developing free educational content and to disseminate it effectively and globally. Wikipedia ranks in the top-ten most visited websites worldwide since 2007.

[[OER Commons]] was spearheaded in 2007 by [[ISKME]], a nonprofit education research institute dedicated to innovation in open education content and practices, as a way to aggregate, share, and promote open educational resources to educators, administrators, parents, and students. OER Commons also provides educators tools to align OER to the [[Common Core State Standards]]; to evaluate the quality of OER to OER Rubrics; and to contribute and share OERs with other teachers and learners worldwide. To further promote the sharing of these resources among educators, in 2008 ISKME launched the OER Commons Teacher Training Initiative, which focuses on advancing [[open educational practices]] and on building opportunities for systemic change in teaching and learning.

One of the first OER resources for K-12 education is [[Curriki]]. A nonprofit organization, Curriki provides an Internet site for open source curriculum (OSC) development, to provide universal access to free curricula and instructional materials for students up to the age of 18 (K-12). By applying the open source process to education, Curriki empowers educational professionals to become an active community in the creation of good curricula. Kim Jones serves as Curriki's Executive Director.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In August 2013, [[Tidewater Community College]] become the first college in the U.S. to create an Associate of Science degree based entirely on openly licensed content{{snd}} the "Z-Degree". The combined efforts of a 13-member faculty team, college staff and administration culminated when students enrolled in the first "z-courses" which are based solely on OER. The goals of this initiative were twofold: 1) to improve student success, and 2) to increase instructor effectiveness. Courses were stripped down to the Learning Outcomes and rebuilt using openly licensed content, reviewed and selected by the faculty developer based on its ability to facilitate student achievement of the objectives. The 21 z-courses that make up an associate of science degree in business administration were launched simultaneously across four campus locations. [[Tidewater Community College|TCC]] is the 11th largest public two-year college in the nation, enrolling nearly 47,000 students annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/community-college-to-offer-textbook-free-degree/article_d45bcffc-bea5-5049-acd3-b025170041f2.html|title=Community college to offer textbook-free degree|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest community colleges in the nation, NOVA serves around 75,000 students across six campuses. The Extended Learning Institute (ELI) is the centralized online learning hub for the entire college. Dr. Wm. Preston Davis, Director of Instructional services at ELI, led this OER initiative called the [https://eli.nvcc.edu/oer/ OER-Based General Education Project.] Davis led the ELI team of faculty, instructional designers and librarians on the project to create what NOVA calls [https://eli.nvcc.edu/oer/zero.htm "digital open]" courses. During the planning phase, the team was careful to select core, high-enrollment courses that could impact as many students as possible, regardless of specific course of study. At the same time, the team looked beyond individual courses to create depth and quality around full pathways for students to earn an entire degree. Currently, 20% of students at NOVA have taken an OER course and enrollment in these courses is rising. From Fall 2013 to Fall 2016, more than 15,000 students have enrolled in NOVA OER courses yielding textbook cost savings of over 2 million dollars over the three-year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.nvcc.edu/ld.php?content_id=29047618|title=Open Educational Resources at Northern Virginia Community College|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In Sweden there is a growing interest in open publication and the sharing of educational resources but the pace of development is still slow. There are many questions to be dealt with in this area; for universities, academic management and teaching staff. Teachers in all educational sectors require support and guidance to be able to use OER pedagogically and with quality in focus. To realize the full potential of OER for students' learning it is not enough to make patchwork use of OER{{snd}} resources have to be put into context. Valuable teacher time should be used for contextual work and not simply for the creation of content. The aim of the project OER for learning OERSweden is to stimulate an open discussion about collaboration in infrastructural questions regarding open online knowledge sharing. A network of ten universities led by Karlstad University will arrange a series of open webinars during the project period focusing on the use and production of open educational resources. A virtual platform for Swedish OER initiatives and resources will also be developed. The project intends to focus in particular on how OER affects teacher trainers and decision makers. The objectives of the project are: To increase the level of national collaboration between universities and educational organisations in the use and production of OER, To find effective online methods to support teachers and students, in terms of quality, technology and retrievability of OER, To raise awareness for the potential of webinars as a tool for open online learning, To increase the level of collaboration between universities' support functions and foster national resource sharing, with a base in modern library and educational technology units, and To contribute to the creation of a national university structure for tagging, distribution and storage of OER.

LATIn Project brings a Collaborative Open Textbook Initiative for Higher Education tailored specifically for Latin America. This initiative encourages and supports local professors and authors to contribute with individual sections or chapters that could be assembled into customized books by the whole community. The created books are freely available to the students in an electronic format or could be legally printed at low cost because there is no license or fees to be paid for their distribution, since all they are released as OER with a [[Creative Commons]] [[CC-BY-SA]] license. This solution also contributes to the creation of customized textbooks where each professor could select the sections appropriate for their courses or could freely adapt existing sections to their needs. Also, the local professors will be the sink and source of the knowledge, contextualized to the Latin American Higher Education system.

With the advent of growing international awareness and implementation of open educational resources, a global OER logo was adopted for use in multiple languages by UNESCO. The design of the Global OER logo creates a common global visual idea, representing "subtle and explicit representations of the subjects and goals of OER". Its full explanation and recommendation of use is available from UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mello|first=Jonathas|title=Global OER Logo|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/Events/global_oer_logo_manual_en.pdf|work=UNESCO|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical discourse about OER as a movement==

===External discourse===
The OER movement has been accused of insularity and failure to connect globally: "OERs will not be able to help countries reach their educational goals unless awareness of their power and potential can rapidly be expanded beyond the communities of interest that they have already attracted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = UNESCO and COL promote wider use of OERs| work = International Council for Open and Distance Education| accessdate = 2011-01-01| date = 2010-06-24| url = http://www.icde.org/UNESCO+and+COL+promote+wider+use+of+OERs.b7C_wlrQXZ.ips| archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110321183913/http://www.icde.org/UNESCO+and+COL+promote+wider+use+of+OERs.b7C_wlrQXZ.ips| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2011-03-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More fundamentally, doubts were cast on the [[Altruism|altruistic]] motives typically claimed by OERs. The project itself was accused of [[imperialism]] because the economic, political, and cultural preferences of highly developed countries determine the creation and dissemination of knowledge that can be used by less-developed countries and may be a self-serving imposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = University of Amsterdam | last = Mulder | first = Jorrit | title = Knowledge Dissemination in Sub-Saharan Africa: What Role for Open Educational Resources (OER)? | location = Amsterdam | year = 2008|pages=58–67| accessdate = 2011-01-01| url=http://www.gg.rhul.ac.uk/ict4d/workingpapers/mulderOER.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the general dominance of OER from the developed countries, the [http://roer4d.org Research on OER for development] (ROER4D) research project, aims to study how OER can be produced in the global south (developing countries) which can meet the local needs of the institutions and people. It seeks to understand in what ways, and under what circumstances can the adoption of OER address the increasing demand for accessible, relevant, high-quality and affordable post-secondary education in the Global South.

===Internal discourse===
Within the open educational resources movement, the concept of OER is active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OER: Articles, Books, Presentations and Seminars|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/open-educational-resources-oer|work=EduCause.edu|publisher=Educause|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider, for example, the conceptions of [[gratis versus libre]] knowledge as found in the discourse about [[MOOC|massive open online courses]], which may offer free courses but charge for end-of-course awards or course verification certificates from commercial entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivard|first=Ry|title=Coursera begins to make money|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/04/08/coursera-begins-make-money|work=InsideHigherEd.com|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Kevin|title=The Brave New World of College Branding|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Brave-New-World-of-College/138107/|work=Chronicle.com|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second example of essentially contested ideas in OER can be found in the usage of different OER logos which can be interpreted as indicating more or less allegiance to the notion of OER as a global movement.

[[Stephen Downes]] has argued that, from a [[Connectivism|connectivist]] perspective, the production of OER is ironic because "in the final analysis, we cannot produce knowledge for people. Period. The people who are benefiting from these open education resource initiatives are the people who are producing these resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downes|first=Stephen|title=The Role of Open Educational Resources in Personal Learning|url=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s59/sh/4f75978a-415f-4786-9132-3df5efdae7f0/a0ac2190fb9fd581c26b9fd9150f95a4|work=VI International Seminar of the UNESCO chair in e-Learning|publisher=Universitat Oberta de Catalunya|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oslofrokost1952.jpg|thumb|right|Oslo breakfast at a primary school in Oslo in 1952]]

The '''Oslo breakfast''' was a type of uncooked [[school meal]] developed in the 1920s and rolled out as a free universal provision for [[Oslo]] school children in 1932. It typically consisted of bread, cheese, milk, half an apple and half an orange.

The original [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] name for the meal was ''Oslofrokosten''. The Oslo Breakfast had been designed by professor [[Carl Schiøtz]] to be as healthy as possible, with widely reported studies suggesting it delivered excellent results for the children's long-term health. During the 1930s the ''Oslo breakfast'' became famous and was copied by programs in Scandinavia, Europe, and the wider world. Many of these initiatives were small scale however, sometimes restricted to just a single school. By the late 1950s the provision of Oslo breakfasts by schools had largely ceased; sometimes they were replaced by more popular hot meal provision, or sometimes just dropped altogether as rising prosperity meant the provision of free school meals was seen as less necessary.

==Ingredients==
While there was some variation in the meal, its typical ingredients included:
* Two slices of wholemeal bread ([[Kneippbrød]]) spread with [[margarine]]
* A slice of [[Norwegian cuisine#Dairy products|cheese]]
* Half a pint of milk
* Half an apple and half an orange

Extra ingredients might include slices of raw uncooked vegetable, such as carrots or [[Rutabaga|swedes]]. Between autumn and spring, a dose of [[cod liver oil]] could be included.&lt;ref name = "NewNorway"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Osloschool.jpg|thumb|Children at a school in Oslo]]
The earliest known modern advocate for school dinners was [[Count Rumford]], who oversaw a program to feed and educate children in late 18th-century Germany. 

Oslo, or Christiana as it was then known, began to provide midday hot school meals in 1897. These meals were criticized by food scientists such as [[Axel Holst]] from as early as 1909 for not being nutritious. In the 1920s, there was still considerable poverty in Norway, including in Oslo, leading to poor nutrition. Carl Schiøtz designed the ''Oslo breakfast'' using the best scientific knowledge available at the time to make it nutritious, and began advocating for it to replace the traditional hot meal from about 1927. He later published results of experiments which found that when fed on the breakfast instead of the hot meal, the often-undernourished Oslo school children would gain more weight. As well as being a professor, Schiøtz was also a senior official in the Oslo municipal authorities, which helped him achieve the practical implementation of his ideas.&lt;ref name = "optimal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "welfare"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HistoryFNS"/&gt; By 1932, the city was providing the Oslo breakfast to all primary school children.&lt;ref name=frukt&gt;{{cite web |title=Skolemåltidets historie |url=http://www.frukt.no/gronne-fakta/aktuelt1/skolemaltidets-historie/ |publisher=Opplysningskontoret for frukt og grønt |accessdate=18 May 2013|language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later older children were also given the meal. It was provided free of charge to all, to prevent poor children from being [[stigmatized]] if they had to apply to get it at no cost.&lt;ref name = "optimal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "welfare"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HistoryFNS"/&gt;

The Oslo breakfast was the most famous of a number of similar worldwide developments in the 1920s and 1930s, for governmental and educational authorities to provide school children with more nutritious food. Perhaps the second most famous example was [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr's]] work in Scotland, which showed the benefits of giving school children free milk – this led to universal school milk provision across Scotland and later the whole of Great Britain. 

From the 1930s to 1950s, programs based on the Oslo breakfast soon spread to other Norwegian cities, across Scandinavia, the rest of Europe, and to the wider world, including countries like Australia and Canada. As an example of the positive reports from trials of the breakfast, [[Jack Drummond]] of London University said that after 130 poor children had been fed on the breakfast, effects had been "remarkable".&lt;ref name = "HistoryFNS"/&gt; The children had lost the poor skin conditions common at the time, and had enjoyed a 25% gain in height over those not having the breakfast.&lt;ref name = "optimal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "welfare"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HistoryFNS"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "birth"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0873388496
|publisher = [[Kent State University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide popularity of the Oslo breakfast reached its peak around the mid-1950s, and then began to decline. In some areas it had been introduced as a supplementary meal to school lunch, not as a replacement as had originally been the case in Oslo. Schools found that running two meal programs reduced their teaching time, and chose to eliminate the breakfast rather than the more popular lunch. In the late 1950s the Oslo breakfast ceased to be provided in its home country: With Norway now much more prosperous, authorities saw no need to continue to provide any form of free school meal. Norwegian parents took over, providing a [[packed lunch]] with similar ingredients to the original breakfast.&lt;ref name = "optimal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "welfare"/&gt;

==Other uses==
British food writer [[Marguerite Patten]] refers to the Oslo breakfast as a light alternative to the traditional [[Full breakfast|cooked breakfast]], in a 1955 book aimed at "brides and beginners". In this context it is a meal at home, resembling a savoury [[Breakfast#Hotels_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_Ireland|Continental breakfast]].&lt;ref&gt;Learning to cook with Marguerite Patton. Phoenix House: London. 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Personk''''' is a 1978 video game, and the debut work of Tom Snyder, who would later release many educational series under [[Tom Snyder Productions]].

==Development==
Snyder is an educator and video game developer. Snyder, who had a master's degree in teaching, attained a teaching job in the 1970s and eventually began thinking about teaching aids.&lt;ref name="Personk-Herald"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/13446983/|title=Tyrone Daily Herald from Tyrone, Pennsylvania on September 6, 1984 · Page 2|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Snyder had a meeting arranged with the head of game acquisitions at [[Parker Brothers|Parker Bros]]. He hoped to present a wood-wire-string contraption named ''Personk'', that was a simplified model of a computer. Despite having planned the meeting for months, constantly redesigning the game and putting considerable time and money into the project, he went to the meeting on the wrong date and lost the opportunity.&lt;ref name="SnoopTroop"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Profile of a snooper trooper |magazine=[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]] |publisher=[[Ahl Computing, Inc.]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |date=April 1983 |page=130 |issn=0097-8140 |url=https://archive.org/stream/creative_computing_apr83#page/n131 |access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event gave Snyder a creative burst of energy; within the week he had purchased a microcomputer, taught himself to program, and transformed the three-dimensional ''Personk'' into a piece of software for children&lt;ref name="SnoopTroop"/&gt; with the assistance of a Radio Shack Model 1.&lt;ref name="Personk-Herald"/&gt;

==Legacy==
His first innovation, the game turned into an experiment that foreshadowed the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="Personk-Herald"/&gt; Snyder would immediately follow the game with a series of educational titles collectively referred to as [[The Search Series]].&lt;ref name="SnoopTroop"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">The '''Premier's Reading Challenge''' is a literacy initiative developed by Australian state governments. It is set not as a competitive event, but rather as an individual challenge to each student, as well as to promote a love of reading books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/about.html About the challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007024026/http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/about.html |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/prc/default.htm Premier's Reading Challenge - Home - Reading Challenge - Department of Education and Early Childhood Development]&lt;br&gt;- [https://products.schools.nsw.edu.au/prc/faqs.html#about1 NSW Premier's Reading Challenge 2008 : Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;br&gt;- http://www.premiersreadingchallenge.sa.edu.au/prc/files/links/PRC_pamphlet_A5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is run in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[Western Australia]], a similar program called the '''Premier's Summer Reading Challenge''' was cancelled in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/events/readingChallenge/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tasmania]]'s Labor government joined the other states in 2008.

The Premier's Reading Challenge in [[South Australia]], launched by Premier [[Mike Rann]] (2002 to 2011) has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, May 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines==
The guidelines for the program in each state differ slightly, but students must generally read a minimum of books within a certain number of books, within a certain amount of time. In some states, these books must be a combination of personal choice books and books from a pre-selected list of approved literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiersreadingchallenge.sa.edu.au/prc/pages/books/guidelines Premiers Reading Challenge]&lt;br&gt;- [http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/guidelines.html 2007 Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007024155/http://education.qld.gov.au/schools/readingchallenge/guidelines.html |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/prc/about/rules.htm Rules - Reading Challenge - Department of Education and Early Childhood Development]&lt;br&gt;- [https://products.schools.nsw.edu.au/prc/rules.html NSW Premier's Reading Challenge 2008 : Challenge Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Australia the Premier's Reading Challenge involves students aged between 5 and 14 in reading a minimum of 12 books (but often many more) upon which they are tested for comprehension. At the end of their first year in the Challenge successful students receive a certificate signed by the Premier. At the end of the second year they receive a bronze medal. Then, in subsequent years, silver, gold, "legend" and "hall of fame". Top sports stars, celebrities and children's authors are appointed Premier's Reading Challenge Ambassadors and visit schools to promote the program and read to students. Former Premier Mike Rann, who proposed the Ambassadors and medal components of the scheme, said the medals and end of year medal ceremonies at schools contributed to the success of the program. "At first the younger children love the idea of the medals but then they fall in love with the books", Rann said.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC: What States Can Do, 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In special needs schools==
The NSW Premier's Reading Challenge has been used at Mary Brooksbank School, to help give the pupils with intellectual difficulties as many educational opportunities as are possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/equal-opportunity-for-all-students/2007/09/08/1188783558455.html Equal opportunity for all students - National - smh.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 students which attend the school have all successfully completed the challenge in two consecutive years. Many of the students cannot read independently, and so the books on the list were read to them by the teachers.

==In the news==
In 2005, the Victorian Premier's Reading Challenge attracted over 130,000 students, with 60,000 of them meeting the requirements for the award by reading 12 books in the set time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/premiers-reading-challenge-attracts-60000/2005/08/20/1124435182574.html Premier's reading challenge attracts 60,000 - Books - Entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt; In six months, over 1,000,000 books were read by the students.

The ''Sun-Herald'' provided an online section of its website which provides links to articles which can be used as part of the personal choices reading by students in the New South Wales Reading Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classscoop.sunherald.com.au/readingchallenge.asp Sun Herald Class Scoop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060819214340/http://www.classscoop.sunherald.com.au/readingchallenge.asp |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=September 2007}}
'''Reference software''' is software which emulates and expands upon print reference forms including the [[dictionary]], [[translation dictionary]], [[encyclopaedia]], [[thesaurus]], and [[atlas]]. Like print references, reference software can either be general or specific to a domain, and often includes [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]]. Reference software may include [[multimedia]] content including animations, audio, and video, which further illustrate a concept. Well designed reference software improves upon the navigability of print references, through the use of search functionality and [[hyperlink]]s.

==Origins and development==
Many dictionaries and encyclopedias rushed into [[CD-ROM]] editions soon after the widespread introduction of the [[CD-ROM]] to home computers. A second major development occurred as the internet also became widely available in homes, with reference works becoming available online as well. The conversion of previously print-only reference materials to electronic format marked a major change to the marketing and accessibility of such works. A striking case study is that of the venerable [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], which was previously only available at prices of USD 1500 and higher, restricting it to the better libraries and the wealthy. Today, the Encyclopædia Britannica and [[World Book Encyclopedia]] retail in electronic format for around 50 USD, with cheaper [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] versions sometimes bundled with new computers. Such dramatic changes brought conventionally restricted knowledge repositories to the fingertips of an almost universal audience in a period of less than 11 years. The opportunities brought by new media enticed new competitors into the reference software market. One of the earliest and most well-known was Microsoft [[Encarta]], first introduced on CD-ROM and then also moving online along with other major reference works. In the dictionaries market, one of the more prolific brands was [[Merriam-Webster]], which released CD-ROM and then online versions of English dictionaries, [[thesauri]] and foreign language dictionaries. Since 2010, reference materials have begun to appear as apps on [[Smartphone]]s. In the field of [[English as a foreign or second language]], this is seen as an interesting pedagogical development and is the subject of much discussion [http://ltsig.org.uk/component/content/article/3-newsflash/203-call-review-spring-2011.html], as language learners increasingly abandon print dictionaries for online editions and apps like the one produced by [[Macmillan Education]][http://www.macmillandictionary.com/apps/]. A list of online dictionaries is maintained under "[[dictionary|dictionaries]]". Wikipedia and its offspins (such as [[Wiktionary]]) marked a new departure in educational reference software. Previous encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists. The [[Wiki]] concept allowed anyone and everyone to join in creating and editing an online set of reference works.

'''Robert C. Michelson''' (born 1951) is an American engineer and academic widely known for inventing the [[entomopter]], a [[Biomimicry|biologically inspired]] flapping-winged aerial robot, and for having established the [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]].  He has received degrees in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Michelson's professional career began at the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]] where he worked on radar-based ocean surveillance systems.  He later became a member of the research faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  At the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] (GTRI) he was involved in full-time research, directing over 30 major research programs.

He is the author of three U.S. [[patent]]s and over 90 journal papers, book chapters and reports. Michelson also developed classes in avionics and taught in the School of Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology until his retirement from the [[University System of Georgia]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nesmith|first=Robert|date=2016-08-24|title=Georgia Tech Family Members at the Forefront of Aerial Vehicle Technology|location=GTRI Home Page (archived)|url=http://www.angel-strike.com/documents/GTRI_Family_Legacy_story.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910010101/http://www.angel-strike.com/documents/GTRI_Family_Legacy_story.pdf|archive-date=2016-09-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelson is the recipient of the 1998 AUVSI Pioneer Award and the 2001 [[Pirelli Internetional Award|Pirelli Award]] for the diffusion of scientific culture as well as the first ''Top Pirelli Prize''.

During the 1990s, he created a tax-exempt corporation to apply high tech solutions to modern archeology and has organized a number of archeological expeditions into eastern [[Anatolia]].  He now heads the engineering consulting company, Millennial Vision, LLC.  Since the mid-1990s, Michelson's work has concentrated on biologically inspired [[micro air vehicle]] design.  Michelson is certified in various fields including [[amateur radio]], [[SCUBA diving]], [[experimental aircraft]] design/mechanics, and general contracting for home building.

===Project director===
While at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Michelson worked on radar-based ocean surveillance systems and flew hardware test missions on a [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed Warning Star PO-1W Super Constellation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://angel-strike.com/rcmbio/RCM/PastProjects/Michelson-NRL-activity.GIF|title=Robert Michelson's Research Activities Aerospace Radar Branch - U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 Michelson began work at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, where he got his first contract when an entry-level engineer (Research Engineer I).  This first project involved methods to electronically track the endangered species Trichechus ''manatus'' ([[West Indian Manatee]]) in the waters around the [[Kennedy Space Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://angel-strike.com/rcmbio/RCM/PastProjects/Auto-ManateeTracking.GIF|title=Automated Tracking of the Florida Manatee (Trichechus ''manatus'') |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelson directed over 30 major research projects during his career at the Institute. In 1979 Michelson directed the Army's Indirect Fire Simulation effort conducted for Combat Development and Experimentation Command (CDEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Dragon Stalker Drone.png|thumb|right|200px|Compound [[ducted fan]] developed by Michelson's UAV team at GTRI began as a traffic surveillance drone program.]]
Michelson directed various efforts pertaining to future transportation. His team invented battery-state-of-charge estimation techniques, developed electric vehicle systems simulation tools, and experimented with actively blown surfaces on passenger vehicles. During the mid-1990s, Michelson's research began to focus almost entirely on unmanned vehicle systems, especially those with the power of flight.  He directed efforts with both U.S. Government agencies and private industry pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAS).  One of his first UAS development programs was for a traffic surveillance drone using a compound [[ducted fan]] design, made to fly over Atlanta's highways in order to fill surveillance gaps in the State's tower-mounted traffic camera system.  It also could be sent to traffic accident locations to gather and relay vital information in advance of first-responder arrival. Funding shortfalls resulted in the cancellation of the project before its maiden flight, but the design was later marketed for military use.  Michelson's focus turned to smaller vehicle systems that could fly indoors autonomously without the aid of [[global positioning system]] (GPS) reference signals.  Under various contracts to DARPA and the Air Force, and using internal research and development funds from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, his design team designed a micro air vehicle (MAV) known as the [[entomopter]].  The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts recognized the unique flight qualities of the entomopter and awarded Michelson two contracts to explore the feasibility of the entomopter for slow flight in Mars' lower atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2004 Michelson retired from the Georgia Tech Research Institute and started Millennial Vision, LLC which continued to pursue UAS and MAV research.  Soon after establishing Millennial Vision, LLC, Michelson became engaged in a program to develop an unmanned stratospheric airship for persistent reconnaissance. He also was interested in MAVs and competitions by helping to define and organize various international events such as the 1st US-European MAV event in Garmisch Germany (MAV-05) and the subsequent 1st US-Asian Demonstration and Assessment of Micro Aerial Vehicle and Unmanned Ground Vehicle Technology (MAV-08) held in Agra India, as adjunct to the U.S. Army RDECOM-Pacific and Indian Ministry of Defence.

===Associate professor of Aerospace Engineering===
During the 1990s, Michelson became an [[Adjunct professor#Adjunct professor|adjunct]] associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of Aerospace Engineering, where he taught graduate classes in avionics, with emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicles and micro air vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gtri.wikispaces.com/file/view/AvionicsCourseOutline.pdf |title=Avionics Course Outline |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gtri.wikispaces.com/file/view/MAVCourseOutline.pdf |title=MAV Course Outline |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with his teaching duties in the Georgia Tech School of Aerospace Engineering, Michelson created a team-taught short course through the Georgia Tech Department of Continuing Education entitled, "21st Century Aerial Robotics".  Laurence "Nuke" Newcome and Michelson taught this course on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology for several years before engaging in single offerings around the United States as well as Sweden, Norway, and Turkey under NATO grants.&lt;ref&gt;http://angel-strike.com/documents/RTO_Consultant_Norway.pdf NATO RTO consultancy plan for FFI/KA Norway&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://angel-strike.com/documents/Consultant_Exchange_Approval_Ltr_Michelson.pdf NATO Consultant Exchange Approval - HHO Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

While working with ground penetrating radar for detection of urban gas leaks, road voids, and buried land mines at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, Michelson became interested in the use of high technology applications to archeology.  Since 1995 he has organized half a dozen excursions into the military zone along the Turkish-Iranian border, often with Turkish military escort, to research ancient [[Ekistics|ekistical]] artifacts of the [[eastern Anatolia region]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://angel-strike.com/sepdac/5MICHELSONArcheology.html|title=Recent Travels to the Iranian Frntier of Eastern Türkiye|accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.angel-strike.com/sepdac/video.php|title=Planetary Catastrophe video series|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has created a 501 (c3) non-profit corporation to apply various non-traditional technologies to the field of archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://corporations.angel-strike.com/SEPDAC.html|title=Scientific Enterprise in Pursuit and Discovery of Ancient Cultures (SEPDAC)|accessdate=2009-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628040624/http://corporations.angel-strike.com/SEPDAC.html|archivedate=2009-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelson completed training in general contracting/home building in 1986 and built his own home.  Later he was overseer for the construction of a Woodstock Georgia church building while continuing his career at the Georgia Tech Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://house.angel-strike.com/homebrochure/YourNewHome.pdf|title=Built own home|accessdate=2017-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224142/http://house.angel-strike.com/homebrochure/YourNewHome.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he completed a home of his own design in the mountains of North Georgia that was lumber-free, consisting entirely of steel structural members with concrete foundation and concrete exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://house.angel-strike.com/homebrochure/steelhome.jpg|title=Michelson steel &amp; concrete home design|accessdate=2017-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308125906/http://house.angel-strike.com/homebrochure/steelhome.jpg|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelson was a Boy Scout and has maintained interest in scouting principles over the years.  As a youth he attained Star rank in Troop 981 located in [[Alexandria Virginia]], and was inducted into the Order of the Arrow. He became a Brotherhood member of [[Scouting in Washington, D.C.|Amangamek Wipit]] Lodge 470, one of the largest lodges in the nation, and participated in activities such as the [[Philmont Scout Ranch|Philmont Scout Reservation]] (1967).  Influenced by their father, both of Michelson's sons are Eagle Scouts with gold and silver [[Eagle Palm|palm]] awards.  Michelson was adult advisor to [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131220134108/http://troop8880.org/ Troop/Crew 8880]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://crew8880.org/info.php|title=Crew 8880 official web site|accessdate=2017-07-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224020846/http://crew8880.org/info.php|archivedate=2012-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; until its transition away from the BSA to becoming a [[Trail Life USA]] unit where Michelson remains in an advisory capacity.

Michelson has had interest in languages and syntax both for computers and spoken communication.  He was formally taught [[Fortran]] in undergraduate school and learned [[BASIC]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], and various [[assembly language]]s on his own in support of his computer-based projects.  He designed the target processing unit for the Army's Environment and Radar Operation Simulator (EROS) where it was necessary to design the hardware and coding language for a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (100 ns cycle time) processor before such things were available in microprocessor form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Two decades later, in a 2012 interview with the ''[[The Post and Courier|Post and Courier]]'' newspaper, Faulkner said that what precipitated her leaving so abruptly was a threat to kill her parents by a person present when she entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/archives/where-is-shannon-now/article_0d2b52b1-86c6-5165-9168-bd6bea0dbd4b.html|title=Where is Shannon Now|last=Hawes|first=Jennifer|date=October 19, 2012|work=the Post and Courier|access-date=June 17, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parent's home was [[Vandalism|vandalized]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1999, she told the ''[[Associated Press]]'', "I went into it knowing I may not get anything out of it.

==In popular culture==
Faulkner is mentioned indirectly in the ''[[King of the Hill]]'' episode "Jumpin' Crack Bass". In the episode, she is referred to as "that pushy gal who's tryin' to get into The Citadel".

[[Garry Shandling]] makes reference to Faulkner in Season 4, Episode 8 of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', entitled "Nothing Personal".

[[Lisa Simpson]]'s experience in ''[[The Simpsons]]''' 8th-season finale, ''[[The Secret War of Lisa Simpson]]'', broadly resembles Faulkner's.&lt;ref name="Henry2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew A.

At [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], a '''sizar''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|z|ər}} is an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] who receives some form of assistance such as meals, lower fees or lodging during his or her period of study, in some cases in return for doing a defined job.

==Etymology==
The word is thought to derive from the "sizes" or "sizings" (in turn a shortened form of "[[assize]]"), which were the specified portions of food and drink made available at a fixed price at the college. One of the sizar's duties was, historically, to fetch the "sizes" for his colleagues.

==History==
At Cambridge, a sizar was originally an undergraduate student who financed his studies by undertaking more or less menial tasks within his college but, as time went on, was increasingly likely to receive small grants from the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary: sizar|url=https://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=Glossary%2Fsizar|website=janus.lib.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain colleges, including [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], distinguished between two categories of sizar: there were specific endowments for specific numbers of sizars who were called "proper sizars", those who were not so endowed, but who were maintained by [[Commoner (academia)|fellow-commoner]]s and [[fellow]]s were called subsizars. [[Isaac Newton]] [[Matriculation|matriculated]] as subsizar at Trinity College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngzh.ch/Neuj1972.html |title=Isaac Newton als Mathematiker |trans-title=Isaac Newton as a mathematician Markus Fierz |language=de |website=Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Zürich |accessdate=2013-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906162848/http://www.ngzh.ch/Neuj1972.html |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard S. Westfall]] noted that sizars were considerably more successful in gaining degrees than the gentlemen who entered Cambridge in the seventeenth century. Whereas only 30% of the latter continued to the degree (and 68% of the sons of professionals), around 80% of the sons of tradesmen and [[yeomen]], who made up most of the sizars, took their degree.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|authorlink=Richard S. Westfall |last=Westfall |first=Richard S. |title=Never at Rest |page=75|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-521-27435-4|ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Churchill College, Cambridge]] offers three sizarships per year, with the recipients being expected to promote music, theatre and the visual arts in the life of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sizarships|url=https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/student-hub/resources/financial-support/sizarships/|website=Churchill College|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''Alumni Dublinenses'' from 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Alumni Dublinenses, Dublin, Alex. Thom &amp; Co. Ltd., 2 Crown Street, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; most students entered Trinity College, Dublin as "pensioners"; in other words, they paid a fixed sum annually. The other two categories were "sizars" and "fellow commoners" (''Socii Comitates''). Sizars were "allowed free education in consideration of performing certain, at one time menial, duties"; fellow commoners paid double fees and enjoyed several privileges, including that of finishing the College course in three years instead of four; "sizars were sons of poor parents, frequently the clergy". According to [[William Howitt]], writing in 1847 with reference to [[Oliver Goldsmith]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Trinity College, Dublin, is a noble structure; and, with its spacious courts and extensive gardens, more fittingly deserving the name of parks, one would think a place where the years of studentship might — especially in the heart of such a city — be very agreeably spent. But Goldsmith entered there under circumstances that were irksome to him, and to add to the matter, he met with a brute in his tutor. The family income did not allow him to occupy a higher rank than that of a sizer, or poor scholar, and this was mortifying to his sensitive mind. The sizer wears a black gown of coarse stuff without sleeves, a plain black cloth cap without a tassel, and dines at the fellows' table after they have retired. It was at that period far worse; they wore red caps to distinguish them, and were compelled to perform derogatory offices; to sweep the courts in the morning, carry up the dishes from the kitchen to the fellows' table, and wait in the hall till they had dined. No wonder that a mind like that of Goldsmith's writhed under the degradation! He has recorded his own feelings and opinions on this custom: "Sure pride itself has dictated to the fellows of our colleges the absurd fashion of being attended at meals, and on other public occasions, by those poor men who, willing to be scholars, come in upon some charitable foundation. It implies a contradiction, for men to be at once learning the liberal arts and at the same time treated as slaves; at once studying freedom and practising servitude." A spirited fellow at length caused the abolition of the practice of the sizers acting as waiters, and that, too, on grand occasions before the public, by flinging the dish he was carrying on [[Trinity Sunday]], at the head of a citizen in the crowd, assembled to witness the scene, who made some jeering remarks on the office he had to perform.&lt;ref&gt;William Howitt, "Oliver Goldsmith" Homes and Haunts of the Most Eminent British Poets (1847) 1:286–336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sizarships are still awarded at Dublin, to new entrants of limited means who have shown merit in their school-leaving examinations. They receive their evening meal ([[Commons]]) free of charge, normally for the first two years of an undergraduate course. The word ''sizarship'' is also still used elsewhere to refer to monetary awards made to members of a student body willing to take on defined jobs with responsibility; according to [[John Stillwell]], "Sizars had to earn their keep as servants to the wealthier students [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Spalding Method''' is the methodology and educational philosophy of The Writing Road to Reading program. The Spalding philosophy is [[Child-centered|child centered]], that is the physical and mental well-being of students is a primary concern of Spalding teachers. High expectations for all children are central to the philosophy. These principles of learning and instruction are applied throughout the spelling, writing, and reading curricula.

Spalding instruction is explicit, interactive, diagnostic, and multisensory. Teachers model, coach, and provide support as needed; students articulate, reflect, and explore new concepts. Careful daily observation of student progress enables teachers to differentiate  instruction to meet student needs. Students see, hear, say, and write using all channels to the brain to enhance retention. All elements of the language are integrated in [[spelling]], writing, and reading lessons. The kindergarten through to sixth-grade curricula is structured, sequential, and cumulative. [[Phonemic awareness]], systematic [[phonics]], high-frequency vocabulary are taught in spelling. In the writing lesson, the same high-frequency words are used to teach word meanings, usage, word parts, grammar, and composition. In the reading lesson, students learn the attributes of fine literature, the structure of narrative and expository text, fluency, listening and reading comprehension. They learn to monitor their comprehension while reading, to make connections with prior knowledge and the text, to predict word meanings, type of writing, outcomes and so forth. They learn to reorganize (reformat) the information in text and use it to mentally summarize to enhance comprehension.

'''Stephen Farthing''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (born 16 September 1950) is an English painter and writer on [[art history]].

==Education==
Stephen Farthing grew up in London and earned a bachelor's degree from [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in 1973 and a master's degree in painting from the [[Royal College of Art]], London in 1976.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/painters/stephen-farthing-ra,175,AR.html |title=Stephen Farthing RA - Painters - Royal Academicians - Royal Academy of Arts |publisher=Royalacademy.org.uk |date=1950-09-16 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the final year of his master's program, Farthing won a scholarship to study at the [[British School in Rome]] for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purdyhicks.com/artists/stephenfarthing/ |title=Purdy Hicks Artists Index |publisher=Purdyhicks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Since his return from Italy in 1977, Farthing has had one-man shows in the UK, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the United States.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing's work featured in the 1989 [[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo Biennale]] and that same year he served as the Artist in Residence at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in London.  He also won prizes in the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition on eight separate occasions between 1976 and 1999.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;

Farthing was elected as a member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing's work is in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)]] and he also showed at the [[Tate Britain]] in 2006 as part of a project called "Drawing from Turner," that he designed and curated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/drawingfromturner/ |title=Drawing from Turner |publisher=Tate |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farthing also painted large murals for the [[Cleveland Browns]] Football Club in Cleveland, Ohio (2004) and [[Aston Villa]] Football Club in Birmingham, UK (2008).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1405273,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/marco.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193759/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/marco.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Farthing's teaching career began at [[Canterbury College of Art]] (1977–1979) where he was a lecturer of painting.  He went on to teach at the [[Royal College of Art]] (1980–1985) before becoming the Head of Painting and later the Head of Fine Art at [[West Surrey College of Art and Design]] (1985–1989).&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing spent the next ten years at [[Oxford University]] serving as the Ruskin Master at the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].  He was also made a Professorial Fellow of Oxford's [[St Edmund Hall]] (1990–2000).  Upon leaving the university in 2000, Farthing was made a professor emeritus of St Edmund Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/users/stephenfarthing |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Seh.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing moved to New York in 2000 to become the Executive Director of the [[New York Academy of Art]] and led the Academy until he became the Rootstein Hopkins Research Chair of Drawing at the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2004, a position he held until 2017.&lt;ref name="chelsea.arts.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-staff/a-z/professor-stephen-farthing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150046/http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-staff/a-z/professor-stephen-farthing/ |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing has published extensively.  Most known for his authorship of ''1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die'' and ''501 Great Artists''.   He also authored the Intelligent Person's Guide to Modern Art, published in 2000 in addition to numerous academic essays and journal articles.&lt;ref name="chelsea.arts.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/biblio.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208064936/http://stephenfarthing.com/biblio.htm |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Farthing continues to live and work in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Work==
[[File:Step9.gif|thumb|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''Louis XV Rigaud'' (1975), [[Walker Art Gallery]]]]''

Farthing described his work in a 2005 interview, saying "I have dined with the devil in terms of becoming a modern artist.  I have taken hold of history, tried to understand it—and then used and abused it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=196599&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Draw the line at copying? Not him &amp;#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2005-06-10 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's work reflects his education, personal experience and perspective on historical events that have captured his imagination.  After spending a period of study at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris while a student at the [[Royal College of Art]], Stephen Farthing inadvertently fell upon what one could later describe as a postmodernist relationship with history.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Paris, he painted an interpretation of [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s portrait of [[Louis XV]] that as a student won him a prize at the John Moores Exhibition in Liverpool, today this painting stands as an early example of British post modernist painting.&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |title='Louis XV Rigaud', Stephen Farthing - Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool museums |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228131607/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s whilst showing with Edward Totah in London, Farthing showed works that positioned Latin American vernacular culture within a modernist idiom and classicism within the vernacular.

During the 1990s, he reinvented history painting as a viable contemporary narrative taking on subject matters as diverse as the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], swagger portraiture, and the topographical mapping of cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193821/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/122406/pro_122406079.shtml |title=Cleveland Browns owner getting his kicks from English football &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most recent work makes explicit a theme that has consistently sat between Farthing and his audience, the "narrative" and "text".

[[File:GetAttachment-2.aspx.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''The Backstory: Boucher'' (2009)]]

Farthing commented that his work is, "not this thing about 'Oh, let's let the audience make up their mind what it is'…" but about "degrading it on purpose so it becomes not more ambiguous, but less what it was in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|title=Stephen Farthing : Marginally Out of Control|publisher=Lynnparr.co.uk|accessdate=2013-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193753/http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 2009, Farthing had his first one-person show at the Purdy Hicks Gallery in London where, for the first time, he showed the "back-story" paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "back-story" paintings are a series of images painted with a text in reverse sitting on the picture plane between the audience and the image.  The text tells us what is going on not in the picture but behind it, so compromising and at the same time informing the image with  text.   His technically very skilled paintings  all seem to be grounded on one guiding principle  - that what we see will always be  always conditioned by what we know.

In November 2010, Farthing became the second living Royal Academician to be featured in the "laboratory" series of one man shows at the Royal Academy of Arts London. "The Back Story," featured an epic 30 foot painting of the Atlantic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Academy of Arts|title=Artists' Laboratory 02: Stephen Farthing RA, The Back Story|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301044735/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|work=Press Release|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chelsea Space|title=Stephen Farthing's Ultra Marine Painting|url=http://www.chelseaspace.org/blog/archives/272|work=Atlantic Ocean|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's  work  as a painter  sits midway between the conservative and the cutting edge  between a classical and radical painting.

The '''Superior Technical School of Architecture of Madrid''' ({{lang-es|Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid}}, '''ETSAM''') is the superior school of [[architecture]] of the [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM), [[Spain]]. It prepares future architects and grants the title of [[Architect]], as well as doctorates and diverse master's degrees. The center is located on the ''Avenida Juan de Herrera'', 4, within the [[University City of Madrid]]. The present building has been used since 1936. It has an extensive library which includes original treaties of [[Le Corbusier]], [[Serlio]] and [[Andrés de Vandelvira]], the most recent magazines of architecture, the most influential books on modern architecture. This school is considered by many professionals of the sector as the best in Spain and one of the best worldwide.

== Study plan ==
Currently the study plan followed in the center focused on the obtention of the main Architecture diploma is the plan 2010, also known as Bolonia. It was passed in the session celebrated in 2007 at the same school. From then on, the old ''Plan 96'' was slowly extincted, till June 2018. The 2010 Plan consists in 360 European credits ''ECTS'', with an equivalence of between 25 and 30 hours of work per credit, and started in 2010-2011. 

The 360 credits are split into a 300-credit degree and a 60-credit master, a formula known as 5+1 years. The degree is a 5 year study plan, with each year split in 2 different cuatrimesters, Fall and Spring.  Subjects can be classified as Basic (shared with other faculties in UPM), compulsory or Optative (exclusively lectured at ETSAM). Only 18 credits correspond to Optative subjects. Once the programme is completed, the student receives a Graduate title in Architecture fundaments, which opens the way for the University Master in Architecture, (one year), which grants the full title of Architect.

== Posgraduate Studies ==
The school grants different posgraduate studies, accesible only to those with the title of Architect. Studies at this level can be Phds or posgraduate. Phd Studies are organised in programs, each one of them having several subjects that jointly present unity and relationships, and together define a speciality inside the Phd studies.

Posgraduate studies are divided into 9 University masters, 15 specialisation courses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214041819/http://www.aq.upm.es/secretaria/tercer_ciclo/|title=[etsam]|date=2007-12-14|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 independent titles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etsamadrid.aq.upm.es/escuela/subdirecciones/posgrado/master_propio_programas|title=Subdirección de Doctorado y Posgrado {{!}} etsamadrid.upm.es|website=etsamadrid.aq.upm.es|language=es|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many of them present an international level of prestige and influence, such as the Master in City Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citysciences.com/|title=MASTER CITY SCIENCE - HOME|website=www.citysciences.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MCH Master in Collective Housing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mchmaster.com/|title=MCH: Master in Collective Housing|website=www.mchmaster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''University of the South Pacific''' ('''USP''') is an [[intergovernmental organisation]] and [[public university|public]] [[research]] [[university]] with locations spread throughout a dozen countries in [[Oceania]]. It is an international centre for teaching and research on Pacific culture and environment. USP's academic programmes are recognised worldwide, attracting students and staff from throughout the Pacific region and internationally.

The British colonial link and the establishment of the University of the South Pacific in 1968 allowed the education system to follow suit from the qualification system of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is the only university in the [[Oceania]] region (other than Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and Guam) to be internationally recognised outside for its bachelor's and other awards programme.

USP is owned by the governments of 12 Pacific island countries: the [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[Niue]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tokelau]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Vanuatu]].

==Courses and programmes==
USP offers [[Undergraduate Education|Undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study programmes including: 
*[[teacher|Teaching]]
*[[Tourism]]
*[[Journalism]]
* Literature
* Linguistics
*[[Agriculture]]
*[[Science]] and [[Environmental Management]]

*[[Accounting]] and [[Economics]]
*[[Law]] and [[Politics]]
*[[Banking]] and [[Finance]]
*[[Public Administration]] and Management
* Land Management
*[[Counselling]] and [[Social Services]]
* others

==Campuses==
USP's main campus, called Laucala, is in Fiji. The Alafua Campus in Samoa hosts the School of Agriculture and Food Technology. The Emalus Campus in Vanuatu is the location for the School of Law.

In addition, USP operates 11 regional centres based in Pacific islands countries. The region served by USP covers 33 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the Pacific ocean, an area more than three times the size of Europe. In contrast, the total land mass of territories served corresponds to the area of Denmark. Populations of member countries vary from [[Tokelau]] with 1,500 people to [[Fiji]] with more than 900,000 people. (The population of the region is about 1.3 million.)
