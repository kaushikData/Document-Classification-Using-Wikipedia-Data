[[File:Shahbandar11.jpg|thumb|Jan.1920]]
'''Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar''' (1880 – June 1940) was a prominent [[Syrian people|Syrian]] nationalist during the [[French Mandate of Syria]] and a leading opponent of compromise with French authority. His devotion to [[Arab nationalism]] dated to the days of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] and its "Turkification" policies. He supported the [[Arab Revolt]] during [[World War I]] and briefly headed the foreign ministry under Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]].

When France occupied Syria in July 1920 he fled the country. Shahbandar returned in 1921 and organized the [[Iron Hand Society]] to agitate against French rule. This was the first nationalist group to emerge in [[Damascus]] during the Mandate and Shahbandar organized its spread to [[Homs]] and [[Hama]].&lt;ref&gt;In [[Aleppo]] a similar organization called the Red Hand Society also agitated against French rule.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1922, the French arrested him and other Iron Hand leaders for incitement against their rule. The arrests triggered several days of demonstrations and bloody confrontation between protesters and French forces in Damascus. Nonetheless, the French tried Shahbandar for subversive activities and sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment.

After serving 1½ years of his sentence the French sent him into exile where he joined the activities of the Syrian-Palestine Congress based in [[Cairo]]. The French allowed him to return to Syria in 1924. The following year Shahbandar guided the formation of Syria's first nationalist party, the [[People's Party (Syria)|People's Party]]. He then helped organize the spread of the [[Great Syrian Revolt|Syrian Revolution]] from [[Jabal ad-Druze (state)|Jabal Druze]] to the rest of Syria. He eluded the French authorities and moved to Jabal Druze for the duration of the revolt. There he and [[Sultan al-Atrash]] formed a provisional government. When the revolt collapsed in 1927 Shahbandar fled to [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and from there to [[Egypt]].

In 1937 a French amnesty allowed him to return from exile and he directed his supporters to oppose the [[Franco–Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|Franco-Syrian Treaty]] on the grounds that it granted France privileges that detracted from Syrian sovereignty. He was joined by powerful Syrian politicians such as [[Munir al-Ajlani]]. He also directed a political campaign to discredit the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] government of Prime Minister [[Jamil Mardam Bey]]. During [[World War II]] the French considered cooperating with Shahbandar because of his opposition to the National Bloc and because of support for him from Britain and the [[Hashemites]]. In June 1940 he was assassinated in [[Damascus]]. The French accused several prominent National Bloc figures, including Jamil Mardam and [[Saadallah al-Jabiri]], of plotting the murder and they fled to [[Iraq]]. While Shahbandar was one of Syria's most popular leaders he never built up an organization that would perpetuate his political legacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The '''''Ali{{okina}}i nui''''' were high chiefs of the four main [[Hawaiian Islands]]. The rulers of [[Molokai]], like those of the other Hawaiian islands, claim descent from [[god]] [[Wākea]].

== Overview ==
The traditional history of Moloka{{okina}}i is fragmentary. The island was not of major political importance. Its importance lay in the connections its royal family made by [[marriage]], and, in later years, the reputation of its [[Witchcraft|sorcery]] and ''[[kahuna]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/hi/keepers/koc8.txt Historical Collections of The Hawaiian Islands - Kalaupapa, Kalawao County (Part 1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705154355/http://files.usgwarchives.org/hi/keepers/koc8.txt |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Molokai was the fifth largest of the eight main [[Hawaii]]an isles, and its size hindered it in its struggle for power and survival among the other islands of [[Maui]], O{{okina}}ahu, Kaua{{okina}}i and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. Its main enemies were the [[Alii Aimoku of Oahu|chiefs of O{{okina}}ahu]] and Maui.

By the end of the 17th century, as interisland conflict grew worse and worse, and Moloka{{okina}}i suffered many blows from the powerful monarchs of other isles; notably [[Kapiiohookalani]], [[Peleioholani]] and [[Kahekili II]]. Moloka{{okina}}i finally, and completely, succumbed to the might of Maui prior to the end of the [[ancient Hawaii]]an era.

'''Anita Palmero''' (13 September 1902 - 11 January 1987) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clubdetango.com.ar/efemer/enero2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was a Spanish cabaret and [[tango singer]], as well as an actress.

She was born in [[Ronda]], Malaga, Spain in 1902 and grew up there with her four sisters: Catherine, Mary, Mercedes and Carmen. Her father, Manuel Rojas Palmero, was a theater electrician, so from a very young age, she was in contact with the art world. Her mother died in 1917 so the family moved to [[Casablanca]] for economic reasons.
In 1925, she appeared at the Romea Theatre of Madrid before touring Mexico and Cuba.&lt;ref name=Aballe&gt;{{cite web|last=Aballe|first=Guadalupe|title=Anita Palmero|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/apalmero.asp|publisher=Todo Tango|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, she sang the song "Botarate" in ''Mosaico criollo'', a film by Comminetti Edmo, which was the first tango sung in film. She died in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina in 1987.

'''Beasley Denson''' served as Miko or Tribal Chief of the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]] from 2007 to 2011. He is the third person to be elected as Tribal Chief since the tribe adopted its modern constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanasijournal.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=463&amp;Itemid=1&amp;ed=62|title=Beasley Denson: Sworn in as Chief of Mississippi Band, Denson assumes title of ''Miko''|accessdate=2009-07-21|date=2007-08-14|publisher=Tanasi Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043156/http://www.tanasijournal.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=463&amp;Itemid=1&amp;ed=62|archive-date=2007-09-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Beasley Denson defeated 28-year incumbent Phillip Martin by 211 votes, receiving 1,697 votes to Martin's 1,486.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wtok.com/news/headlines/8342857.html|title=Recount Done, Martin Concedes Defeat|accessdate=2009-12-01|date=2007-07-05|publisher=[[WTOK-TV]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112131654/http://www.wtok.com/news/headlines/8342857.html|archivedate=2008-11-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Beasley Denson was born in the Conehatta Community as the son of the late David Denson and Bema Steve York. He has two sisters, Angela and Rita, and a brother, Douglas Sam Denson. They grew up in the Standing Pine Community of [[Choctaw, Neshoba County, Mississippi|Choctaw, Mississippi]]. He is a fluent [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] speaker. Denson graduated from Choctaw Central High School and earned an associate degree from [[Hinds Community College]] and [[Mississippi State University]].

He married Lena John of Red Water and Pearl River. They have two sons, Michael David and Darren Keith, one daughter, Lane; a son-in-law Oga; and six grandchildren. 

==Early career==

Denson went to work for the Choctaw Tribe, which had reorganized in the first half of the 20th century. Its reservation includes land in several counties in central Mississippi.

==Political career==
Denson was first elected to the Choctaw Tribal Council in 1975. During his five terms, he served as both Secretary Treasurer and Vice Chief. During this period, Mississippi adopted a gaming law. In 1994 the Choctaw established the first of their two gaming casinos, known as [[Pearl River Resort]]. It has generated funds to be used for welfare and economic development.

Denson also served on the Choctaw Gaming Commission for two years. He was an officer on the [[National Indian Education Board]] and the Board of Directors for [[United Southeastern Tribes]]. 

Denson works to be an open and accessible leader; he puts ''Chahta'' first. His adherence to this philosophy can be seen across the Reservation. As chief, he made progress reducing the back log of Tribal housing, improving the health care system and upgrading educational facilities.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==Later life==
Since serving as Chief, Miko Denson serves on the Board of the [[Native American Rights Fund]], a non-profit law firm dedicated to defending the rights of Native Americans and Tribes. NARF staff brought the suit in North Dakota in 2016, challenging the state's new photo ID law because it did not accept Tribal cards as identification. A federal court ruled in August 2016 that the law is discriminatory against Native Americans, placing an undue burden on them, and that the state had to allow Native Americans to use former forms of ID for the election in 2016. 

Denson is also Treasurer of the Sovereign Nations Alliance, a political action committee created to further the legislative goals of Indian Country at the federal level.

==Tribe information==
The MBCI, with an enrolled membership of 9,660, is the only federally recognized tribe in the State of Mississippi. The Tribe provides a range of government services for its members including schools, a hospital, medical clinics, police and fire protection, courts, an elderly care center and many others.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  
The Choctaw Indian Reservation contains some {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} of tribal lands situated in ten different Mississippi counties. This land is held in trust for the benefit of the Choctaw Tribe by the federal government. The Tribe has eight officially recognized Choctaw Indian communities: Pearl River, Red Water, Bogue Chitto, Crystal Ridge, Standing Pine, Tucker, Conehatta, and Bogue Homa. 

[[Pearl River, Mississippi|Pearl River]], located in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba]], is the largest Choctaw Indian community. It is the site of Tribal government headquarters, as well as [[Pearl River Resort]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Ben Kilpatrick''' (January 5, 1874 – March 12, 1912) was an [[United States|American]] [[outlaw]] during the closing days of the [[Old West|American Old West]].  He was a member of the [[Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch|Wild Bunch]] gang led by [[Butch Cassidy]] and [[Elzy Lay]].  He was arrested for robbery and served about 10 years of his 15-year sentence.  Upon his release from prison, he returned to crime and was killed by a hostage during a train robbery.

==Early life==
Kilpatrick was born in [[Coleman County, Texas]], in 1874, the third of nine children of a [[Tennessee]]-born farmer, George Washington Kilpatrick (or "Killpatrick"), by his wife, Mary, a native of [[South Carolina]], according to the 1880 Federal Census.&lt;ref&gt;1880 Federal Census for Precinct 11, Coleman County Texas (Coleman County Enumeration District 45, Sheet 6, Lines 1-8) shows "Benjamen A. Killpatrick" as a six-year-old native of Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a [[cowboy]] for a time in [[Texas]] and became acquaintances with Tom and Sam Ketchum and Bill Carver.

==Outlaw life==
{{WikiProject AOW WildBunch

| caption = Kilpatrick is in the front row - centre; Fort Worth, Texas, 1900}}

After Cassidy's release from prison, Lay and he organized the Wild Bunch gang, and the gang began the most successful train-robbing career in history. Kilpatrick is thought to have been a friend of Lay, but he may have had minimal  or no involvement with crimes involving Butch Cassidy or the Sundance Kid. Kilpatrick became involved with Kid Curry, but where or how they met is uncertain.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Escape===
As was their trait, the gang would commit their robberies, then break up heading in several different directions, meeting up some time later in the Hole in the Wall hideout in Wyoming.
Bullion and he made their way to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they met with [[Kid Curry]] and his girlfriend [[Della Moore]]. Moore was arrested shortly thereafter for passing money traced back to one of the gang's robberies. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Arrest===
Kilpatrick was captured on November 5, 1901, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and received a 15-year sentence.

===Death===
[[File:Two train robbers killed near Sanderson Tex., Mar. 13, 1912 LCCN2006680243.jpg|200px|thumb|Photograph shows the bodies of Ben Kilpatrick and Ole Hobek being held up by others after being killed near Sanderson Tex., Mar. 13, 1912]] 

He was released from prison in June 1911. On March 12, 1912, Kilpatrick and outlaw Ole Hobek were killed while robbing a train near [[Sanderson, Texas]]. The duo is thought to have participated in several train robberies outside of Memphis in November 1911 and February 1912, as well as other small robberies in West Texas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In March 1912, Kilpatrick boarded a Southern Pacific Express train near Sanderson, Texas, alongside a former inmate whom he had befriended. Attempting a robbery, Kilpatrick held up the express messenger, David Trousdale, in the Wells Fargo baggage and mail car. While Kilpatrick looted the safe and any other valuables he could find, Trousdale managed to hide an ice mallet underneath the back of his jacket. Trousdale then told Kilpatrick that there was a valuable package lying on the ground. Kilpatrick rested his rifle against his leg while he leaned over to pick up the package. As he did, Trousdale pulled the mallet from beneath his coat and struck Kilpatrick three times in the back of the neck and head. Kilpatrick died instantly of a broken neck and crushed skull. The beating with the mallet was so brutal that Kilpatrick's brains stained the walls of the car.

'''Borys Ivanovych Tarasyuk''' ({{lang-uk|Борис Іванович Тарасюк}}; born 1 January 1949) is a Ukrainian politician who twice served as the [[foreign minister|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] of Ukraine and is now an [[Member of parliament|MP]]. He is from [[Zhytomyr Oblast]]. Tarasyuk studied international relations and international law at [[Kiev University|National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv]], and graduated in 1975. Besides [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], he is fluent in English, French and Russian. As of 2012, Tarasyuk is a sitting member of the International Honorary Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomats.pl/en/component/content/article/465.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202140001/http://diplomats.pl/en/component/content/article/465.html |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the European Academy of Diplomacy.

==Career as foreign minister==
Tarasyuk served as deputy of foreign minister from 9 March 1992 until 16 September 1995.
In 1995 – 1998 he was ambassador in Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Ukraine representative in [[NATO]].
He became foreign minister for the first time from 17 April 1998 until 29 September 2000. He later broke with President [[Leonid Kuchma]], and became a foreign relations adviser to [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the main opposition candidate in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]]. After Ukraine's [[Orange Revolution]], Tarasyuk became foreign minister again on 4 February 2005, and served in the Cabinets of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]], and [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. Tarasyuk favors Ukrainian integration with the [[European Union]].

Tarasyuk was formally dismissed by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 1 December 2006. He disputed this dismissal in Kyiv [[Shevchenkivskyi District, Kiev|Shevchenkivskyi District]] court, and on 5 December parliament's decision was reversed on the grounds that it violated Ukrainian law. On the same day, Yushchenko issued a decree that Tarasyuk must keep his job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/news/data/6_12314.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070423040331/http://www.president.gov.ua/news/data/6_12314.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 April 2007 |title=Shevchenkivskyi district court ruled that the Verkhovna rada dismissal of Tarasyuk is ineffective |accessdate=21 May 2007 |work=Official website of the [[President of Ukraine]] |language=Ukrainian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this court order and presidential decree, he was not allowed to enter [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet]] meetings and this caused political conflict based on interpretations of amendments to [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]]. On 30 January 2007 Tarasyuk announced his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/30/news/ukraine.php |title=Ukraine president loses one of his last remaining cabinet allies |date= 30 January 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune |language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he served as the Chairman of the [[Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of European integration]].

==Political career since his ministerial post==
Tarasyuk was placed at number 7 on the electoral list of [[Batkivshchina]] during the [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/58995 They Call Themselves the Opposition], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (31 August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electedintoVRUK111112"/&gt; He was elected into parliament.&lt;ref name="electedintoVRUK111112"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2012/11/11/6977259/ Список депутатів нової Верховної Ради], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (11 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; A part of [[People’s Movement of Ukraine]], including Tarasyuk, merged (the rest of this party had merged with [[Ukrainian People's Party]] in May 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://un.ua/eng/article/450522.html Ukrainian People's Party, People's Movement Of Ukraine Decide Unite Into Rukh, Elect Kuibida Its Leader], [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (19 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;) into Batkivshchina on 15 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/batkivschyna-front-for-change-reform-and-order-party-part-of-nru-unite-for-victory-tymoshenkos-address-to-congress-2/ Batkivschyna, Front for Change, Reform and Order Party, part of NRU unite for victory – Tymoshenko’s address to congress], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (15 June 2013)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/tymoshenko_re_elected_batkivshchyna_leader_yatseniuk_council_chair_305211 Tymoshenko re-elected Batkivshchyna leader, Yatseniuk council chair], [[Ukrinform]] (15 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] he was again re-elected into parliament; this time after placing 12th on the electoral list of Batkivshchina.&lt;ref name="allcountedCECIU81114"&gt;[http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/poroshenko_bloc_to_have_greatest_number_of_seats_in_parliament_327072 Poroshenko Bloc to have greatest number of seats in parliament] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112000000/http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/poroshenko_bloc_to_have_greatest_number_of_seats_in_parliament_327072 |date=12 November 2014 }}, [[Ukrinform]] (8 November 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html People's Front 0.33% ahead of Poroshenko Bloc with all ballots counted in Ukraine elections - CEC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112000000/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html |date=12 November 2014 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233426.html Poroshenko Bloc to get 132 seats in parliament - CEC], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://tvi.ua/new/2014/09/15/povnyy_vyborchyy_spysok_partiyi_batkivschyna Full electoral list of "Fatherland"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915212430/http://tvi.ua/new/2014/09/15/povnyy_vyborchyy_spysok_partiyi_batkivschyna |date=15 September 2014 }}, [[TVi (TV channel)|TVi]] (15 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation==

Borys Tarasyuk is the founder of the [[Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation]] (''IEAC''), a [[political action committee]] established to campaign for [[NATO]]- and [[European Union]] memberships in Ukraine. The group is funded by [[Dollar diplomacy|Western donations]] and is open about its goals. The IEAC' logo juxtaposes the [[flag of Ukraine]] with the logos of NATO and the European Union. Polls cited by Tarasyuk showed that only between 18% and 22% of Ukraine's population supported NATO-membership in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csdr.org/2005book/tarasyuk.htm |title=The Orange Revolution: Six Months Later |date=10–12 June 2007 |work=Center for Strategic Decision Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage has increased to 47% by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Goncharenko, Roman. "[http://www.dw.de/what-ukraine-wants-from-nato/a-17896198 What Ukraine wants from NATO]". ''DW''. 3 September 2014. Retrieved 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation has influenced Ukraine state policy in the past.  For example, a report produced by the Institute titled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060529033413/http://moldova.org/download/eng/510/ Trilateral Plan for Solving the Transnistrian Issue]'' recommended changes to the customs regime relating to Transnistria. Less than five weeks after the report's publication, the recommendations were implement and signed into law.  [[Ukraine-Transnistria border customs conflict]] followed on 3 March 2006. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (''OSCE''), the [[European Union]], and the United States backed the legislation, while Russia opposed it.

'''Cape Verdeans''', also called '''Cabo Verdeans''' ({{lang-pt|cabo-verdiano}}), are the citizens of [[Cape Verde]], an [[island nation]] consisting of an archipelago in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Cape Verde is a ''sociedade mestiça'' ([[mestizo]] society; as described in Portuguese), which means that it is home to mixed-race people. Nearly all Cape Verdeans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries.

The [[Cape Verde]] [[archipelago]] was uninhabited when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] landed there in 1456. Slaves from adjacent [[West Africa]] were brought to the islands to work on Portuguese plantations. As a result, many Cape Verdeans are ''[[mulatto]]es'' (''[[mestiço]]s'' in Portuguese), having biracial origins. European ancestors also include [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Italians|Italian]] seamen who were granted land by the [[Portuguese Empire]], followed by Portuguese settlers, exiles, and Portuguese Jews who were victims of the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]]. Many foreigners from other parts of the world settled in Cape Verde as their permanent country. Most of them were [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] ([[English people|English]]), [[Arab]] and Jewish (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]]).

A genetic study revealed that the ancestry of the population in Cape Verde is predominantly European in the male line and West African in the female line; counted together the percentage is 56% West African and 44% European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&amp;ak=1 |title = Actualidade |publisher = Asemana.sapo.cv |date =  |accessdate = 2013-01-31 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130501115847/http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&amp;ak=1 |archivedate = 2013-05-01 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
{{main|Cape Verdean diaspora}}

Prior to independence in 1975, many thousands of people emigrated from drought-stricken [[Portuguese Cape Verde]], formerly an [[overseas province]] of Portugal. Because these people arrived using their Portuguese passports, they were registered as [[Portuguese diaspora|Portuguese immigrants]] by the authorities. Today, more Cape Verdeans live abroad than in Cape Verde itself, with significant emigrant&lt;ref&gt;Jorgen Carling, 2004, p.113-132&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Verdean communities in Brazil and in the United States (102,000 of Cape Verdeans descent in the U.S., with a major concentration on the [[New England]] coast from [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]).
 
In 2008, Portugal’s National Statistics Institute estimated that there were 68,145 Cape Verdeans who legally resided in Portugal.  This made up "15.7% of all foreign nationals living legally in the country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asemana.cv/article.php3?id_article=28328 A Semana.  "Cape Verdeans make up 15.7% of all foreigners in Portugal." Retrieved January 20, 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229180245/http://www.asemana.cv/article.php3?id_article=28328 |date=February 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Languages==
Cape Verde's official language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is the language of instruction and government.

[[Cape Verdean Creole]] is used colloquially, and is the mother tongue of virtually all Cape Verdeans. Cape Verdean Creole or ''Kriolu'' is a dialect continuum of a Portuguese-based [[creole language|creole]]. There is a substantial body of literature in Creole, especially in the [[Santiago Creole]] and the [[São Vicente Creole]]. Creole has been gaining prestige since the nation's independence from Portugal.

More than 93% of the population of [[Cape Verde]] is nominally [[Roman Catholic]], according to an informal poll taken by local churches.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90087.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Cape Verde].

Other religious groups include the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Cape Verde|the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and various other [[Pentecostal]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] groups.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; There are also small [[Bahá'í]] communities and a small [[Islam|Muslim]] community.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The number of [[atheists]] is estimated at less than 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Cape Verde}}
The [[culture]] of Cape Verde reflects its mixed West African and Portuguese roots. It is well known for its diverse forms of music such as ''[[Morna (music)|Morna]]'', and a wide variety of dances: the soft dance ''Morna'', the ''[[Funaná]]'', the extreme sensuality of ''[[coladeira]]'', and the ''[[Batuque (music)|Batuque]]'' dance. These are reflective of the diverse origins of Cape Verde's residents. The term "Criolo", or also "Kriolu"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurley-Glowa|first1=Susan|title=Cape Verdeans in the Atlantic: the formation of Kriolu music and dance styles on ship and in port|journal=African Music|date=2015|volume=10|issue=1|pages=7–30|doi=10.21504/amj.v10i1.1224|url=http://journal.ru.ac.za/index.php/africanmusic/article/view/1224|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to refer to residents as well as the culture of Cape Verde.

'''Cardinal Lamberto''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. He is portrayed by [[Raf Vallone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000826/|title=Cardinal Lamberto (Character)|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20079/The-Godfather-Part-III/cast|title=The Godfather, Part III (1990)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the film==
Lamberto is a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the man favoured to succeed the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] [[Pope Paul VI]] as head of the Church. He is visited by [[Michael Corleone]] on the advice of Don Tommasino, and Michael tells him of his swindle at the hands of corrupt Vatican bank officials Frederick Keinszig, Licio Lucchesi, and Archbishop Gilday. Lamberto encourages Michael to confess his sins; Michael is initially reluctant, but eventually gives in under the Cardinal's gentle prodding. He breaks down in tears when confessing that he ordered the murder of his brother [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]. Upon the conclusion of the confession, Lamberto tells Michael that he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, yet [[absolution|absolves]] him and tells him he still has a chance for redemption.

Upon the death of Paul VI, Lamberto is elected the new Pontiff; he takes the name [[John Paul I]] upon his accession. A moral, thoroughly honest man, he immediately calls for an investigation into the activities of the [[Vatican Bank]] and requests a meeting with Keinszig, the Bank's chief accountant. However, Keinszig has left [[Rome]] with a large sum of money and several documents. Fearing that their corruption will be exposed, Keinszig, Lucchesi, and Gilday plot to murder the Pope. Gilday poisons the Pontiff's tea, killing him in his sleep.

==Inspiration==
The character of Lamberto and the film's depiction of the events which led to his murder are based upon one of the [[Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] surrounding the sudden death of the real-life [[Pope John Paul I]], Albino Luciani.  Like the Lamberto character, Luciani was discovered dead in his bed in 1978, 33 days after his election to the papacy.  Various theories, such as the one outlined in [[David Yallop]]'s 1984 book, ''[[In God's Name]]'', have suggested that Luciani was murdered because he was investigating and planning reforms for the Vatican Bank, in light of the [[Banco Ambrosiano]] scandal.

'''Christiana Abiodun Emanuel''', born '''Abiodun Akinsowon''' (1907–1994), was the co-founder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=220968|last1=Denzer|first1=LaRay|title=Yoruba Women: A Historiographical Study|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|date=1994|volume=27|page=17}} (JStor)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Cherubim and Seraphim, an [[Aladura]] [[Christian denomination]].&lt;ref name=Holy/&gt; After a [[schism]] in the Church, she founded and led the [[Cherubim and Seraphim Society]].

==Personal life==
Abiodun Akinsowon was born in 1907 to a [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saro]] family. The daughter of a [[pastor]], she was baptised into the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] in [[Lagos]], Nigeria, where she attended elementary school. In 1920, she left school to join her aunt as a trader. In 1942, she married George Orisanya Emanuel, a civil servant working in Lagos City Council.&lt;ref name="DAB"&gt;{{cite book|last = Sheldon|first= Kathleen|chapter = Emanuel, Christiana Abiodun |editor1=Akyeampong, Emmanuel K. |editor-link=Emmanuel K.

==Founding the Cherubim and Seraphim==
In 1925, while watching a Catholic [[Corpus Christi procession]],&lt;ref name =Holy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA4|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|title=Holy People of the World: A cross-cultural encyclopedia|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1576073556|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel reportedly fell into a lengthy trance. She awoke from her coma after the healer Moses Orimolade arrived to pray for her. Waking, Emanuel claimed she had been visited by [[angel]]s who had taken her to heaven.&lt;ref name=Holy/&gt; As increasing numbers of visitors came to hear of her visions, Emanuel and Orimolade founded an interdenominational prayer group called the Cherubim and Seraphim.&lt;ref name=DAB/&gt; In 1927, Emanuel led an evangelical tour of Western Nigeria, condemning the worship of traditional gods and encouraging Christian prayer.&lt;ref name =Holy/&gt; In 1928, they established the Cherubim and Seraphim as its own independent church, within the [[Aladura]] tradition.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Aladura|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12038/Aladura|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schism and reconciliation==
In 1929, the Cherubim and Seraphim underwent its first schism, with Emanuel founding the [[Cherubim and Seraphim Society]] and Orimolade founding the [[Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim]]. The split arose from disputes within the group over the role of female leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1581509|last1=Adogame|first1=Afe|title=Engaging the Rhetoric of Spiritual Warfare: The Public Face of Aladura in Diaspora|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|date=November 2004|volume=34|page=498}} (JStor)&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel demanded to be recognised as co-founder of the church. This was viewed by Orimolade, who denied she was co-founder, as insubordination, and led to their eventual split.&lt;ref name =Holy/&gt; This was followed by other schisms, leading to the existence of more than 10 separate sects within the Cherubim and Seraphim.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

After Orimolade's death, Emanuel campaigned to be recognised as the supreme head of the church, claiming she had been discriminated against as a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Hermoine|title=Review: New Directions in Gender and Religion: The Changing Status of Women in African Independent Churches by Brigid M. Sackey|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|date=2007|volume=41|page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, in an attempt to reunite the disparate groupings within the Church, she was reinstalled as leader of a united Cherubim and Seraphim Church.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;

'''John Colin Wallace''' (born c. 1943) is a former [[United Kingdom|British]] member of Army Intelligence in Northern Ireland and a [[psychological warfare]] specialist. He was one of the members of the intelligence agency-led [[Clockwork Orange (plot)|'Clockwork Orange']] project, alleged to have been an attempt to [[Smear tactic|smear]] various individuals including a number of senior British [[politics|politicians]] in the early 1970s. He also attempted to draw public attention to the [[Kincora Boys' Home]] sexual abuse scandal several years before the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] finally intervened.

He was wrongly convicted of manslaughter in 1981, for which he spent six years in gaol, until 1987.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Foot01a"/&gt; The conviction was later quashed in the light of new forensic and other evidence that raised serious questions about the dubious nature of the evidence used to convict Wallace initially. The journalist [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]], in his book ''Who Framed Colin Wallace?'',&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt; suggested that Wallace may have been [[Frameup|framed]] for the killing, possibly to discredit the allegations he was making. This view was similarly expressed by [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|Alex Carlile]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (now [[House of Lords|Lord]] Carlile),&lt;ref name=Carlile01a/&gt; who later speculated that this may have been the motive not just for the alleged frameup, but also for murder.&lt;ref name=Carlile02a/&gt;

==Early life==
Wallace was born in [[Randalstown]], [[Northern Ireland]], in 1943 and educated at [[Ballymena Academy]]. He was commissioned into the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in 1961, and later became a marksman in the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]], or 'B Specials'. A former cadet officer in the [[Irish Guards]], he was commissioned in 1972 into the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]], part of the Regular Army, and was immediately granted the rank of captain. He became the Regiment's Psychological Operations officer. He was seconded to the [[New Zealand SAS]] before working for the [[British Intelligence Corps]] as a [[psychological warfare]] officer.  During the early 1970s he ran the [[British Army]]'s free-fall parachute display team in Northern Ireland, taking part in a variety of 'Hearts and Minds' projects throughout the region.  Several members of that team were also members of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) or the Intelligence Corps. In 1969, ''The Irish Guards Association Journal'' carried this reference to Wallace:  "He is a great training enthusiast and is never happier than when he is on top of one 3,000-foot peak busily engaged in plotting his hop to the next one.  He will eventually achieve great fame as he will, no doubt, be the first Brigade officer to visit RHQ without getting salute at the main gate - as knowing him, he will surely parachute in."&lt;ref&gt;Irish Guards Association Journal, February 1969, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information officer==
Wallace joined the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] on 15 March 1968 as an assistant information officer for the [[British Army]] at its [[Northern Ireland]] headquarters at [[Thiepval Barracks]] in [[Lisburn]]. He became an established information officer from 14 December 1971, and a senior information officer with effect from 27 September 1974, having first held this latter post on temporary promotion from 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm198990/cmhansrd/1990-01-30/Writtens-2.html Commons statement on Wallace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526085606/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm198990/cmhansrd/1990-01-30/Writtens-2.html |date=26 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as carrying out overt information work for the British Army, Wallace was also working for [[14 Intelligence Company]] as a member of the ultra-secret Army Psychological Operations unit (Information Policy), covertly attempting to undermine, disrupt and control paramilitary groups.

In the years following his appointment to the Information Policy unit, Wallace received high praise from the senior staff at Thiepval.  In 1971, his Annual Confidential Report concluded: 'This is an officer of the highest calibre. Totally dedicated to the Army, he demonstrates this by a devotion to duty that is truly remarkable.' The counter-signing officer scribbled underneath: 'I heartily agree.' In 1972, the Chief of Staff recorded that enthusiasm and dedication were not his only virtues. His abilities were just as remarkable: 'Continues to demonstrate that his talents are of the very highest standard.'&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from Wallace's Annual Confidential Reports released by the MOD in 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's former boss, Major [[Tony Staughton]], confirmed that by 1973 he had  twice recommended Wallace for the [[MBE]], and could not understand how and why the recommendations were turned down. "I've never known such a deserving case," he told journalist [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]].&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt;

===Clockwork Orange===
{{main|Clockwork Orange (plot)}}
In 1973 and 1974 Wallace was involved with an operation called [[Clockwork Orange (plot)|Clockwork Orange]]. Wallace alleges that this involved [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] members of the security services in a disinformation campaign aimed not at [[paramilitary]] organisations in [[Northern Ireland]], but at British [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]. He was supported by a covert specialist military troop (possibly an SAS unit made up of specially-trained Northern Ireland personnel). This group was shrouded in secrecy. Journalists from foreign news organisations would be given briefings and shown forged documents, which purported to show that politicians were speaking at [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republican]] rallies or were receiving secret deposits in [[Swiss bank]] accounts.

On 16 March 1976 the British Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], retired suddenly without any apparent reason. In the days leading up to his resignation there had been no hint that he was about to go.  Two months later, on 12 May, Wilson invited two BBC reporters, [[Barrie Penrose]] and Roger Courtiour to visit him at his home at 5 North Street, near Parliament.  He told the reporters that he believed members of MI5 had been involved in a plot to undermine his Government.  He said that he had called in the head of MI6, Sir [[Maurice Oldfield]], who told him that there was a section of MI5 that "was unreliable" and that he (Oldfield) was "going to bring it out".  Wilson also said that he had called in the head of MI5, Sir [[Michael Hanley]], who confirmed the existence within his Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right-wing views.  Later, the two reporters interviewed Sir Michael Hanley at his home and asked him if there had been talk of a coup to overthrow the Wilson Government in the mid 1970s. The former Head of MI5 replied: "I think it is generally accepted. Yes".

On 19 May 1976, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published a story under the headline: "Campaign in US to smear MPs".   The story claimed that "persistent efforts have been made in recent months to discredit leading members of the three major British political parties by planting derogatory stories about them in news agencies in Washington".  One of the news agencies to be given such information said: "So far this year we have been offered similar matter about some eleven MPs, a Conservative, two Liberals and eight Labour".
&lt;ref&gt;The Pencourt File by Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour, Secker and Warburg1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''[[Spycatcher]]'', former senior MI5 officer, [[Peter Wright]] stated:

{{quote|Feelings had run high inside MI5 during 1968. There had been an effort to try to stir up trouble for Wilson then, largely because the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' tycoon, [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King]], who was a longtime agent of ours, made it clear that he would publish anything MI5 might care to leak in his direction. It was all part of Cecil King's "coup," which he was convinced would bring down the Labour Government and replace it with a coalition led by [[Lord Mountbatten]].

But the approach in 1974 was altogether more serious. The plan was simple. In the run-up to the election which, given the level of instability in Parliament, must be due within a matter of months, MI5 would arrange for selective details of the intelligence about leading Labour Party figures, but especially Wilson, to be leaked to sympathetic pressmen. Using our contacts in the press and among union officials, word of the material contained in MI5 files and the fact that Wilson was considered a security risk would be passed around.

Soundings in the office had already been taken, and up to thirty officers had given their approval to the scheme. Facsimile copies of some files were to be made and distributed to overseas newspapers, and the matter was to be raised in Parliament for maximum effect. It was a carbon copy of the [[Zinoviev letter]], which had done so much to destroy the first [[Ramsay MacDonald]] Government in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;'Spycatcher' by Peter Wright. Published by Viking Penguin 1987&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The information appears to bear a striking similarity to some of the material contained in the notes which Colin Wallace had been instructed two years earlier as part of the 'Clockwork Orange' project.  People named in Colin Wallace's notes as having been targeted in this manner included [[Harold Wilson]], [[Edward Heath]], [[Merlyn Rees]], [[Cyril Smith]], [[Jeremy Thorpe]], [[Tony Benn]] and [[Ian Paisley]].

On 20 March 1975, Hugh Mooney, a member of the top secret [[Information Research Department]] run by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], wrote a memo to his superiors claiming that the former Head of Army Intelligence in Northern Ireland told him that Colin Wallace "had been one of his best sources."    MI5 accused Colin Wallace of leaking information to the press about William McGrath, the leader of the Loyalist paramilitary group Tara, who had been sexually abusing children at the Kincora Home.&lt;ref&gt;https://villagemagazine.ie/index.php/2018/05/licence-to-deceive/&lt;/ref&gt; However, official records later showed that he had been instructed by his superiors to draw the attention of the press to McGrath's activities.

Mooney also gave an interview to the Sunday Correspondent on 18 March 1990 about Colin Wallace's attempts to expose the sexual abuse at Kincora,.  The Sunday Correspondent report said:

{{quote|Mooney also admitted that Mr Wallace had told him about the above sex scandal at the Kincora boys home in Belfast - casting further doubt on Government claims that the security forces had no knowledge of the long-running rape and buggery of children in care.

'I do know he mentioned it. He was dropping it in and feeling his way. He kept pushing it. But I could never understand why. I thought it was totally irrelevant to our concerns. I did get the feeling he was pushing this.'&lt;ref&gt;Memo dated 20 March 1975 from Mooney to Mr Joy,IRD&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==After HQNI==
Wallace resigned from the Ministry of Defence in 1975 in order to avoid disciplinary action, ostensibly for privately briefing journalists with classified information. Wallace always claimed that this action was consistent with his secret job duties as a member of the Intelligence Services and that the real reasons for his dismissal were related to his refusal to continue working on the Clockwork Orange project in October 1974, and his exposure of a [[child abuse]] [[scandal]] at the [[Kincora Boys' Home]]. He claimed his allegations were blocked because the leading perpetrator was both a leading member of a loyalist paramilitary group and an [[undercover agent]] for [[MI5]].  The government later admitted that Wallace had the authority to take decisions on the release of classified information in support of psychological operations.

In the 1980s, to support his claims, Wallace produced a collection of documents, including a series of handwritten notes on material which formed part of the Clockwork Orange project. The notes were later subjected to an independent [[forensic]] analysis by Dr [[Julius Grant]], and the results were consistent with the notes having been made contemporaneously during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Who framed"&gt;Foot, Paul (1989) - details below in [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace was probably the first member of the security forces to attempt to draw public attention to the sexual abuse of children at the Kincora Boys' Home in Belfast.  In 1973, at the request of his superior officers, he gave several journalists the name of the loyalist paramilitary leader running the home, together with his address and telephone number.  He also pointed out that the man was "a known homosexual." None of the newspapers he briefed published the story and the abuse of children continued unabated for a further seven years before the police were finally forced to take action following revelations in the ''[[Irish Independent]]''.&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt;

Several commentators have pointed to the coincidence that the events which led to Wallace being wrongly convicted of manslaughter took place shortly after Kincora was finally exposed in the ''Irish Independent''.

Writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in 1986, [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] revealed that, at about the time Wallace was charged with manslaughter, intelligence officers wrote to Sir [[Frank Cooper (civil servant)|Frank Cooper]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Senior officials|Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence]],  warning him that "Wallace had both the information and the motivation to reveal the story behind Kincora".&lt;ref name="duncancampbell.org"&gt;http://www.duncancampbell.org/menu/journalism/newstatesman/newstatesman-1986/gov%20must%20answer%20kincora%20questions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Entries in intelligence notebooks kept during 1974 by former Special Military Intelligence Unit Officer, Captain [[Fred Holroyd]], who had met Colin Wallace in Northern Ireland at that time,&lt;ref name="NS-1994-05-04a"&gt;''[[New Statesman]]'', 4 May 1984&lt;/ref&gt; refer to the Kincora hostel by name, and say of leading Protestant politicians that they are "all queers", as British Army and RUC intelligence officials had had no difficulty coupling information about homosexual Protestant extremist politicians to the Kincora hostel.

Holroyd is also quoted as saying that, while being trained for his Northern Ireland duties, he was told that the [[Tara (Northern Ireland)|Tara]] organisation was in effect controlled by British intelligence, and was not a real security threat, implying that [[William McGrath]], a former house-father at Kincora and leader of Tara, had come under intelligence control before 1973.&lt;ref name="duncancampbell.org"/&gt;

[[Clive Ponting]], a former senior official in the Ministry of Defence, told the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' that he had attended meetings with MI5 officers at the MOD to discuss how to prevent Wallace and Fred Holroyd from making allegations about 'dirty tricks' in Northern Ireland.  Ponting said that MI5 were "genuinely worried about what Wallace might say".&lt;ref&gt;"Irish firm in bid to publish Wright book". Sunday Times 17 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1987, a former MI5 agent, [[James Miller (MI5)|James Miller]], told the Sunday Times that he knew Wallace when he was working in Northern Ireland during the 1970s.  Miller said that his first task for MI5 was to spy on William McGrath.  He said that his MI5 handler told him to leave McGrath to them (MI5) and he understood that they used his information to recruit McGrath as an informer." &lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times 29 March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Kincora story was initially exposed in the press, the [[Northern Ireland Secretary]], [[James Prior]], asked Sir George Terry, the Chief Constable of the Sussex Police, to carry out an investigation into the affair. Terry's full report was never shown to Parliament.  In a summary of the report, Terry said: "Military sources have been frank, and I am satisfied there is no substance to allegations that Army intelligence had knowledge of homosexual abuse at Kincora."&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt;

This inexplicable conclusion almost certainly misled the British Parliament.  Moreover, Terry failed to inform Parliament that MI5 had refused to allow one of their senior officers, who had blocked prior military investigations into Kincora, to be questioned by his investigators.&lt;ref&gt;'The Kincora Scandal' by Chris Moore&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, therefore, no surprise that [[Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Members]] of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] ridiculed the report.  [[John Cushnahan]], a spokesman for the non-sectarian [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]], was indignant: he found one of the most disturbing aspects of Terry's conclusions was the complete dismissal of any possibility that military circles knew about the scandal. He then referred to a number of people as having been interviewed by British Army people for British military intelligence about William McGrath and Kincora. Cushnahan concluded by saying that it was misleading and blatantly dishonest for Terry to claim that the whole matter had been fully ventilated.&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Times, 10 November 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the obvious and unexplained weaknesses of the Terry Inquiry, Prior told Parliament that a 1921 Act Inquiry was not justified.  Instead, Prior proposed to establish a public inquiry under the powers contained in article 54 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 to examine the administration of Kincora and of young people's hostels in Northern Ireland.  That Inquiry would be led by a retired circuit judge, Judge William Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hansard.House of Commons Debate 18 January 1984 vol 52 cc319-26&lt;/ref&gt; and it was decided that "It will be up to the Inquiry and the eminent judge who will preside over it to examine anything which is relevant to the particular boy's home (Kincora), or to the other five boys' homes, and the circumstances which led up to the problems."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard House of Commons Debate 18 January 1984 vol 52 cc319-26&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked on ''The World At One'' (BBC Radio 4, 18 January 1984) if the inquiry would take evidence on the alleged activities of the intelligence agencies, Prior replied that if there was any evidence, it would.&lt;ref&gt;'The World at One', BBC Radio 4, 18th January 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these assurances given by Prior, Judge Hughes made it clear in his report: "The conduct of the police, or elected representatives, or clergymen, or military intelligence or any other persons who may have been in receipt of allegations, information or rumours relating to Kincora or any other home, was not under scrutiny in this Inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Children s Homes and Hostels the Hughes Inquiry 31 12 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Wallace's evidence was, therefore, excluded from the Hughes Inquiry.

In July 2014, Exaro News reported that the late Lord Havers, as Attorney General in 1984, limited the terms of reference for the Inquiry to exclude politicians and other key categories of people from investigation. &lt;ref name="exaronews.com"&gt;http://www.exaronews.com/articles/5328/baroness-butler-sloss-faces-another-hitch-in-heading-csa-inquiry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Wallace's Army Annual Confidential Report described his performance in Northern Ireland as "outstanding" and said that he had made "one of the most effective personal contributions of any to the standing and reputation of the Army in these troubles."  The Report was signed by the Commander Land Forces, Northern Ireland, Major General Peter Leng.&lt;ref&gt;Documents released by the MOD at Wallace's disciplinary hearing in 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Wallace was promoted to Senior Information Officer and, shortly afterwards, he wrote a lengthy memorandum to his superiors complaining that no action was being taken to stop the sexual abuse of children at the Kincora Home.  A few weeks later he was removed from his job on the grounds that his life "was in danger", and posted to an Army HQ in England.&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt;

Former BBC journalist, [[Martin Dillon]], who has written several best-selling books on the Northern Ireland conflict, says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the ghastly aspects of what became known as 'The Kincora Scandal' was that McGrath and McKeague (another Loyalist paramilitary paedophile), as Intelligence assets, were agents of the State. What Wallace was unaware of was that McGrath and McKeague had virtual immunity from prosecution because of the information they were supplying to their Intelligence bosses.  According to Chris Moore's (another BBC journalist) investigations of McGrath, MI5 was the organisation that recruited and funded his political activities.  They were fully aware of contacts he made with Rhodesian and South African Intelligence in order to acquire arms for Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;'The Trigger Men' by Martin Dillon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chris Moore summed up the situation succinctly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;McGrath made it obvious to all those who heard him speak that he was acting on Intelligence. There was a higher authority; McGrath was not alone. Figures like John McKeague spring to mind, and there are other documented episodes like the Colin Wallace affair and the case of Brian Nelson to suggest strongly that British Intelligence had penetrated and was manipulating the loyalist paramilitary   underground from the early 1970s onwards. Where was the democratic control over all this unquestionably illegal activity?  Why have elected representatives, including MPs from Northern Ireland itself, been so reluctant to become involved in uncovering the truth?&lt;ref&gt;'The Kincora Scandal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1980, David McKittrick of the Irish Times, reported how he had been briefed by Wallace "many times" during the 1970s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was clear that he had access to the highest levels of intelligence data.  He had a encyclopaedic memory, which he occasionally refreshed with calls made on his personal scrambler telephone to the headquarters intelligence section a few floors above his office.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Times 21 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Broderick, Head of the Army Information Services at HQ Northern Ireland in 1973, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To my knowledge, he (Wallace) worked at least 80 hours a week: coming to his desk every day.  He lived in the Officers Mess and regarded himself as always on duty.  On my arrival, I found that he had taken virtually no leave for six years. He had a knowledge of the Irish situation which was totally unique in the Headquarters and surpassed that even of most of the Intelligence Branch.  As time progressed, he was not only the main briefer for the press, but also the adviser on Irish matters to the whole Headquarters and - because of his personal talents - contributed much creative thought to the Information Policy Unit.  In order to do his job, he had constant and free access to information of the highest classification and extreme sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Imprisonment===
In 1980, shortly after the Kincora story appeared in the press, Wallace was arrested and subsequently convicted of the [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] of the husband of one of his colleagues. It was reported that Wallace had beaten antiques dealer Jonathan Lewis to death before attending a dinner party with the dead man's wife. Later that night, Wallace was alleged to have dumped the body in the [[River Arun]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]]; ''Man gaoled for killing'', 21 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He served six years in gaol, from 1981 to 1987.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Foot01a"/&gt;

The conviction was quashed in 1996 in the light of new forensic and other evidence. During the appeal hearing, a Home Office pathologist, Dr Ian West, admitted that some of the evidence that he had used at Wallace's trial had been supplied to him by "an American security source". The journalist [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]], in his book ''Who Framed Colin Wallace?'',&lt;ref name="Who framed"/&gt; suggested that Wallace may have been [[Frameup|framed]] for the killing, possibly by renegade members of the security services in a bid to discredit his allegations about the Kincora scandal, and the fact that members of the intelligence community had attempted to rig the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|1974 general election]] after which Harold Wilson came to power with a minority government.

Wallace himself suggested that Lewis had been murdered by 'rivals in the antiques trade' and that the police had suppressed evidence to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Boggan]], 'Wallace faces possibility of new death trial', The Independent, 9th October 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, a former Special Branch officer who was familiar with the Wallace case wrote to Paul Foot saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I sincerely believe that Colin Wallace was 'fitted up' by corrupt members of the Establishment embarrassed by the events described in the early part of your book.  I do not suggest for a moment that any Sussex Police officer involved in this enquiry was corrupt, because I do not believe they were, but I feel there was a hidden agenda, and that the senior officers knew a lot more about the matter than they would ever care to reveal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Foot private collection 4 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the controversy over the Kincora affair gathered momentum, [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|Alex Carlile]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (now [[House of Lords|Lord]] Carlile), the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]]'s Legal Affairs spokesman, issued a statement saying: "It is clear that Colin Wallace, a principled man, knew too much about the Kincora Boys' Home scandal."&lt;ref name=Carlile01a&gt;Alliance{{which|date=June 2015}} Party News Release, 2 March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, Mr Carlile was quoted in the ''Sunday Today'' newspaper saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe there are many people in high places and within the security services who feel ill-will towards Wallace for exposing their activities. The question is that if MI5 was prepared to kill to get even with Wallace, why not kill him?  It may be that Wallace's allegations about MI5 officers being involved in activities verging on the treasonable were widely known  -  so if any harm came to him the finger would point directly at them. I have tried repeatedly in the House to get an adjournment on the conviction and will continue to do so."&lt;ref name=Carlile02a&gt;Sunday Today, 17 May 1987, "I believe there are many people in high places and within the security services who feel ill-will towards Wallace for exposing their activities. The question is that if MI5 was prepared to kill to get even with Wallace, why not kill him?  It may be that Wallace's allegations about MI5 officers being involved in activities verging on the treasonable were widely known  -  so if any harm came to him the finger would point directly at them. I have tried repeatedly in the House to get an adjournment on the conviction and will continue to do so.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1987, a former senior Ministry of Defence official, Clive Ponting, was quoted on Channel 4 News about high-level meetings he had taken part in with MI5 officers regarding Wallace's case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was never any suspicion that Wallace was making these stories up or that it was totally unfounded and very easy to rubbish. It was very much a matter that, OK the story was being contained at the moment because he was in jail, but that in a few years' time he would be back out again and could be expected to start making the allegations again and then that would be a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;Channel 4 News, 25 June 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''After Dark''===
In 1987 Wallace appeared on the [[After Dark (TV series)#Peter Hain, Clive Ponting, Peter Utley, Colin Wallace and "Secrets"|first programme]] of the [[Channel 4]] discussion series ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' alongside [[Clive Ponting]], [[T. E. Utley]], [[Peter Hain]] and others.

===Government re-examination===
In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], in 1990, the Government admitted that Ministers had "inadvertently misled" Parliament over Wallace's role and confirmed that he had been involved in disinformation activities on behalf of the security forces and that he had been authorised to supply, on occasions, classified information to journalists.

In a letter to Terence Higgins MP on 30 January 1990, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] referred to earlier statements made by Government Ministers about the Wallace case and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I regret to say that a re-examination of departmental papers has brought to light information which shows that there were a number of statements in my letters, and in other Ministerial statements and official correspondence, which were incorrect or require clarification.&lt;ref&gt;letter from Margaret Thatcher to Terence Higgins MP dated 30 January 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later that day, the Armed Forces Minister, Mr Archie Hamilton made an extraordinary statement to the House of Commons admitting that several key allegations consistently made by Wallace were in fact true.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Papers which have now come to light indicate that, when the case was made to establish Mr. Wallace's post, it was proposed that its duties should include responsibilities for providing unattributable covert briefings to the press ; and it was stated that the incumbent would be required to make on-the-spot decisions on matters of national security during such interviews. It seems that, in the event, the arguments for including these responsibilities in Mr. Wallace's job description were made orally rather than in writing to those who approved the establishment of the SIO post. But presumably Mr. Wallace was told what duties he was expected to carry out; and indeed it would appear that he had already been undertaking unattributable briefing activities of this kind, which may have included disinformation.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 30 Jan 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A government inquiry set up by Prime Minister Thatcher and undertaken by Sir [[David Calcutt]] QC confirmed that Wallace had, indeed, been working for the intelligence services during the 1970s and that his enforced resignation from the Ministry of Defence had been made on the basis of a false job description designed to conceal his covert role in psychological warfare. Sir David Calcutt also found that members of the Security Service (MI5) had manipulated the disciplinary proceedings taken against Wallace. In the light of the Inquiry's findings, Wallace was awarded compensation by the Government.

Wallace's solicitor, Jim Nicol, referred Sir David Calcutt's report to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, on the basis that the conclusions indicated that Security Service officers who manipulated the proceedings had attempted to defraud Wallace.  The Metropolitan Police referred the matter to the DPP for guidance. The DPP concluded that it would not be in the public interest for the police to pursue the matter.

Despite the findings of the Calcutt Inquiry, the Ministry of Defence refused to allow the Defence Select Committee to have access to Wallace's secret job description. In a letter dated 11 February 1991, the Ministry of Defence said that Wallace's job description contained "sensitive information relating to the security and intelligence matters" and that the provision of such papers, even under the conditions relating to the Committee's access to classified information, "would be inconsistent with the conventions"&lt;ref&gt;MOD letter D/S of S/PS/20/229J dated 11 February 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin bombings inquiry===
Evidence from Wallace was used by the Barron Report, an [[Irish government]] inquiry into the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]].

A letter from Colin Wallace to Tony Stoughton, the Chief Information Officer of the Army Information Service at Lisburn, on 14 August 1975 noted the connections between [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitaries and intelligence agencies of the British Army and of the [[RUC Special Branch]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is good evidence the Dublin bombings [see [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]]] in May last year were a reprisal for the Irish government's role in bringing about the [power sharing] Executive. According to one of Craig's people [Craig Smellie, the top MI6 officer in Northern Ireland at the time], some of those involved, the Youngs, the Jacksons, Mulholland, [[Billy Hanna|Hanna]], Kerr and McConnell were working closely with SB [Special Branch] and Int [Intelligence] at that time. Craig's people believe the sectarian assassinations were designed to destroy [then Northern Secretary Merlyn] Rees's attempts to negotiate a ceasefire, and the targets were identified for both sides by Int/SB. They also believe some very senior RUC officers were involved with this group. In short, it would appear that loyalist paramilitaries and Int/SB members have formed some sort of pseudo-gangs in an attempt to fight a war of attrition by getting paramilitaries on both sides to kill each other and, at the same time, prevent any future political initiative such as Sunningdale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.ie/article/80134 Death Squad Dossier, ''Irish Mail on Sunday'' by Michael Browne, 10 December 2006], see also, [http://www.indymedia.ie/article/80012 ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'', 30 November 2006] for further information&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a further letter dated 30 September 1975, Wallace revealed that MI5 was trying to create a split in the UVF in order to foment violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;because they wanted the more politically minded ones ousted. I believe much of the violence generated during the latter part of last year was caused by some of the new Int people deliberately stirring up the conflict. As you know, we have never been allowed to target the breakaway UVF, nor the UFF, during the past year. Yet they have killed more people than the IRA!&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2003, the [[Dáil]]'s Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, published the ''Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings'' which took place in May 1974.  The Inquiry was led by a former Irish Supreme Court Judge, Mr Justice [[Henry Barron (judge)|Henry Barron]].  Judge Barron interviewed Wallace on a number of occasions during the Inquiry and comments:

{{quote|In person, Wallace comes across as intelligent, self-assured, and possessed of a quiet yet unwavering moral conviction. Though he has reasons enough to be bitter - the abrupt and unjust ending of a promising career in Northern Ireland, five years spent in prison on a conviction which has since been quashed - he displays no outward signs of resentment towards individuals or institutions. He remains intensely loyal to his country and to the Army: insofar as he has a quarrel, it is with individuals rather than the institutions concerned. He says he believes that much of the propaganda work undertaken by Information Policy was justifiable in the interests of defeating subversives and promoting a political solution to the Troubles.

When speaking of matters directly within his own experience, the Inquiry believes him to be a highly knowledgeable witness. His analyses and opinions, though derived partly from personal knowledge and partly from information gleaned since his time in Northern Ireland, should also be treated with seriousness and respect.}}

Judge Barron also refers to what he calls "the dubious nature of his (Wallace's) conviction for manslaughter in 1981", and points out that the "conviction was quashed on 21 July 1996."

In his book, ''Inside Intelligence'', former SIS officer [[Anthony Cavendish]] confirms that he knew Wallace and says that his story is "frightening and disquieting, but one which ties in with many events to which I have been privy". Cavendish sent Wallace a first edition of his book which contains the following inscription:  "Colin - a great help and a true friend."

Cavendish, a close friend over many years of Sir [[Maurice Oldfield]], former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, says that Wallace's assertion that Oldfield was the target of a black propaganda campaign by MI5, "match closely details which were told to me privately by Maurice."

{{quote|The black propaganda campaign against Maurice started in 1972, increased the year later when he became Chief of MI6 and was reinforced with a vengeance in 1979 when it became known that he was to be the new Security Supremo for Northern Ireland. 

In Maurice's view it was undoubtedly the pressure of increasing in-house rivalries and the danger it was causing which caused Mrs Thatcher to ask him to come out of retirement and reorganize from scratch the whole intelligence empire in Northern Ireland.}}

In his biography of Sir Maurice Oldfield. Richard Deacon [Donald McCormick] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who were Oldfield's enemies? Who wanted to hound him even in retirement and, if possible, to destroy him totally? These were questions which I felt it imperative to try to answer. I tried to track down the source of these various stories which became embroidered as time passed, but there was nothing positive one could go on other than word of mouth gossip. My information is that the first report came not from the IRA, but from an undisclosed Ulster Defence Regiment source. Later sources suggested the stories came from inside the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;'C' A Biography of Sir Maurice Oldfield, by Richard Deacon.Futura Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The intelligence world in which Wallace operated in Northern Ireland was graphically described by Lord Stevens, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.  Lord Stevens had presided over the [[Stevens Inquiries]] into collusion between the intelligence services, the British Army, the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries in the murders of Irish nationalists.  In May 2011, he gave evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you talk about Intelligence, of the 210 people we arrested, only three were not (Intelligence) agents. Some of them were agents for all four of those particular organisations (Army, MI5, MI6 and Special Branch), fighting against each other, doing things and making a large sum of money, which was all against the public interest and creating mayhem in Northern Ireland. Any system that is created in relation to this country and Northern Ireland has to have a proper controlling mechanism. It has to have a mechanism where someone is accountable for what the actions are and that has to be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of The Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills, 3 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Summary==
To this day, Wallace's full role on behalf of the Army remains a mystery. Former members of the Special Forces admit that Wallace worked with them as far afield as [[Berlin]] and the [[Oman]] during the [[Cold War]], but the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Services still try to distance themselves from what Wallace was doing in Northern Ireland. He had been part of the Army team preparing for the [[Widgery Tribunal]] into the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] killings of protesters in [[Derry]], and in 2002 he testified at the [[Bloody Sunday Inquiry|Saville Inquiry]] into the events.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Foot01a"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,802698,00.html|author=Paul Foot (journalist)|journal=The Guardian|date=2 October 2002 | title=The Final Vindication|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Wallace's close friends in the Army described him as follows: "I played golf with the General. That was an accident. Colin was needed by the General. Everyone needed him. They just could not do without him."&lt;ref&gt;"Who Framed Colin Wallace" by Paul Foot Page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant-Colonel Tony Yarnold, who worked with Wallace in Northern Ireland, said: "Let's face it, Colin was the lynchpin of the whole operation. He was terrific - way ahead of us all in his knowledge and his readiness to work. Everyone wanted him all the time, and somehow he was always available."&lt;ref&gt;"Who Framed Colin Wallace" by Paul Foot Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

A former Ministry of Defence Chief Information Officer commented: "For loyalty and dedication to the Army, Colin Wallace was in a class of his own.  I just cannot conceive of any situation in which he would act maliciously against the interests of the Crown or the Army." &lt;ref&gt;Formal statement made by Peter Broderick, Chief Information Officer, Ministry of Defence, in support of Colin Wallace at the disciplinary hearing on 17 October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, as depicted by [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470]]
A '''dragonslayer''' is a person or being that slays [[dragon]]s. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaoskampf]] theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.

==Description==
[[Image:Paul Gustave Dore Andromeda.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] Chained to a Rock'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).]]

A dragonslayer is often the hero in a "[[Princess and dragon]]" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrók]], who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, [[Þóra borgarhjörtr]], whom he later marries.

There are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.

In a Norse legend from the [[Völsunga saga]], the dragonslayer, [[Sigurd]], kills [[Fafnir]] - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, [[Andvari]]. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, [[Regin]]. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (1990). Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23285-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego."
&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elena Topuridze''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ელენე თოფურიძე; May 3, 1922 – September 29, 2004) was a prominent [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] philosopher and writer. Born in [[Batumi]], Georgia, her family moved to [[Tbilisi]] during her childhood. In 1945, she graduated from the faculty of [[philosophy]] of the [[M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University]]. As a postgraduate student, Topuridze studied at the Institute of History of Art of Academy of Sciences of the [[USSR]], in [[Moscow]].  In 1951, she returned to Tbilisi and took a position of professor at the [[Shota Rustaveli]] Theatrical Institute of Georgia. From 1961 to the end of her life she worked at S. Tsereteli Institute of Philosophy of [[Georgian National Academy of Sciences]].

==Education and work==
Topuridze held a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (1951) and a [[Doctor of Science]] (1969) and was a  prolific writer and a professor of [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[art]], and [[history]] of Western European/American [[theatre]] and [[literature]]. She authored several works on influential figures in [[Italian art]] and [[philosophy]]: [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], and [[Eleonora Duse]].  In 1978, her work ''Aesthetics of Benedetto Croce'' was translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and published in [[Tokyo]].  The problem of freedom and free choice was the main theme in her work ''Man in Classical Tragedy'', which explored the origins of the idea of [[free will]] in the works of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] poets.

===Macon city council===
Erickson was elected on November 6, 2007 to a four-year term as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the Macon, Georgia [[city council]].&lt;ref name=Macon.com&gt;{{cite news|last= Gaines|first=Jim|title=Erickson to quit Macon City Council for Atlanta gig|url= http://www.macon.com/2011/01/06/1399941/erickson-to-quit-macon-city-council.html|accessdate=October 15, 2012|newspaper= The Telegraph|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his office on February 16, 2011, partway through his first term to pursue a job with [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] radio in [[Atlanta]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Holland|first=Joshua|title=Meet Erick Erickson, the Toxic Idiot Guiding House Republicans on the Debt Ceiling Fight |publisher= [[AlterNet]]|date=July 26, 2011|url= http://www.alternet.org/teaparty/151793/meet_erick_erickson,_the_toxic_idiot_guiding_house_republicans_on_the_debt_ceiling_fight|accessdate=2011-07-28}}

==Political commentator==
===RedState===
Erickson joined the conservative blog RedState in 2005.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Erick Erickson to leave RedState|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/erik-erickson-to-leave-redstate-214444|website=POLITICO|accessdate=2015-12-10|last=Gold|first=Hadas|authorlink=Hadas Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served as its editor-in-chief. Erickson was CEO of RedState, Inc. While working at RedState, Erickson developed a reputation as one of the most influential American conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Is the Most Powerful Conservative in America Losing His Edge?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/is-the-most-powerful-conservative-in-america-losing-his-edge/383503|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson's "Morning Briefing" e-mails grew from 498 subscribers when they began in February 2009 to nearly 70,000 by January 2010. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that "The ability of a single e-mail to shape a message illustrates the power of the conservative network." The article described Erickson as one of the American conservative movement's "key national players".&lt;ref&gt;Markon, Jerry, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102860.html "New media help conservatives get their anti-Obama message out"], washingtonpost.com, February 1, 2010; retrieved May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erickson wrote the "Confessions of a Political Junkie" blog and is former editor-in-chief of the "Peach Pundit" blog. His first book, ''Red State Uprising: How to Take Back America'' (co-authored with Lew Uhler), was published by [[Regnery Press]] in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Hanlon, Chip.

In 2014, RedState was sold by RedState, Inc. to [[Salem Media Group]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = RedState Names Leon Wolf Managing Editor As Erick Erickson Prepares Exit|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/redstate-leon-wolf-erick-erickson_5612acdce4b0dd85030cb569|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Erickson left his position at the site to focus on his radio show.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Television and radio===
From 2010 to January 2013, Erickson was a political contributor at CNN.&lt;ref&gt;Martel, Francis, [http://www.mediaite.com/online/red-states-erick-erickson-relocating-to-john-king-usa/], March 16, 2010, "Mediaite.com", retrieved August 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Erick, [http://www.redstate.com/erick/2010/03/16/heres-my-news-erick-erickson-joins-cnn’s-roster-of-political-contributors], "RedState.com", March 16, 2010; retrieved August 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson later joined [[FOX News]] as a contributor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn-political-contributors-carville-matalin-and-erickson-leaving_b164597], "TVNewser.com", January 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Erickson began hosting a local radio show on [[WSB (AM)|WSB Radio 750/95.5]], replacing [[Michael Savage]]. Erickson eventually moved to the slot vacated by [[Herman Cain]] when he announced his 2012 presidential bid. In 2014 and 2015, Erickson guest-hosted the national broadcast of ''[[Rush Limbaugh|The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' on numerous times. Toward the end of Erickson's career at RedState he began to increase his focus on his radio show, which was owned by [[Cox Media Group]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He eventually quit the site to work on it full-time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===The Resurgent===
In January 2016, Erickson launched the conservative website The Resurgent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside the Beltway: The unconstitutionality index: 3,408 new federal regulations, 87 laws|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/4/inside-the-beltway-the-tally-3408-new-federal-regu/?page=1|website = The Washingtion Times|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views and controversies==
The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' of London put Erickson on its "List of Most Influential US Conservatives", giving him a rank of 69th most influential in 2007 and 65th in 2010.&lt;ref name="tellist2010"&gt;Hamden, Toby,  [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6967325/The-most-influential-US-conservatives-80-61.html "The most influential US conservatives: 80-61"], January 11, 2010, ''The Telegraph'', retrieved May 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; to the 2007 newspaper article: "Erickson epitomises the new power of the internet. A small-government [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal]] and [[social conservative]] based in the south, he taps into and influences the Republican 'base' that the GOP’s 2008 candidates are courting."&lt;ref name="tellist07"&gt;Hamden, Toby, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1435464/The-most-influential-US-conservatives-61-80.html "The most influential US conservatives 2007: 61-80"], October 30, 2007, ''The Telegraph'', retrieved May 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Atlantic'', Erickson's conservatism is more traditional (as opposed to libertarian) and "deeply informed by his evangelical faith".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/is-the-most-powerful-conservative-in-america-losing-his-edge/383503/|title=Is the Most Powerful Conservative in America Losing His Edge?|last=Ball|first=Molly|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson emphasizes small government, strong national defense, and the primacy of the traditional family.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Donald Trump===
On August 7, 2015, Erickson disinvited [[Donald Trump]] from a RedState gathering held in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/08/donald-trump-black-balled-by-conservatives-over-menstruation-comment|title=Donald Trump banned from RedState over menstruation jibe at Megyn Kelly|last=Jacobs|first=Ben|date=August 8, 2015|newspaper=Guardian US|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[CNN]] interview after a [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2016|Republican Party debate]] hosted by [[Fox News Channel]] on August 6, 2015, Trump had said that the Fox News anchor and debate co-moderator [[Megyn Kelly]] had “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever” while questioning him during the debate.  According to Erickson, Trump's remark "was a bridge too far” and that even "blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross" certain lines, including decency.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The following day, Trump released a statement stating that Erickson had a history of making controversial statements for which he has had to apologize, and that he, Trump, was an outsider who did not fit into Erickson's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Zeke J.|date=August 8, 2015|title=Donald Trump Fires Back After Outrage Over Megyn Kelly Remarks|url=http://time.com/3989656/donald-trump-redstate-gathering/|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
In 2013, Erickson was criticized for saying in an interview on [[Fox Business Network]] that males dominate females in the "natural world" and it was only "science" for men to be the breadwinners for their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/erick-erickson-anti-working-moms-defense/314716|title=Erick Erickson Needs to Fact-Check His Anti-Working Moms Fairy Tale|last=Reeve|first=Elspeth|newspaper=The Atlantic|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guns ===
In December 2015, Erickson posted a picture of a bullet ridden copy of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he had shot at. That day's edition contained a front-page editorial in favor of [[gun control]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/the-gun-control-debate-is-starting-to-get-out-of-hand/news-story/8c7d90bbca3fdfed48505080335173e9|title=This is how crazy Americans are|author=Young, Matt|date=December 7, 2015|website=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/erick-erickson-gun-new-york-times-6681537.php|title=Conservative radio host fires bullets into the New York Times' gun control op-ed|author=Pereira, Alyssa|date=December 7, 2015|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erickson spread a false story by RedState which claimed that 17-year old [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|Parkland, Florida school shooting]] survivor David Hogg was not actually at the Parkland school when it was attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/parkland-students-hogg-gonzalez.html|title=Parkland Students Find Themselves Targets of Lies and Personal Attacks|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described Hogg as a "bully" after Hogg called for an advertiser boycott of right-wing Fox News host Laura Ingraham when she mocked him for not getting into a number of universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/29/media/laura-ingraham-apologizes-david-hogg/index.html|title=Laura Ingraham's apology to David Hogg has not stemmed the advertiser exodus|last=Kludt|first=Tom|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/375595-erick-erickson-florida-shooting-survivor-is-a-high-school-bully|title=Erick Erickson: Florida shooting survivor is 'a high school bully'|last=Savransky|first=Rebecca|date=2018-02-26|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBT rights ===
In 2017, Erickson signed a manifesto which condemned homosexuality and transgender identity, saying that homosexual and transgender identity was not according to God's plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/30/us/evangelicals-issue-nashville-statement-on-sexuality-trnd/index.html|title=Evangelical group issues 'Christian manifesto' on sexuality|last=CNN|first=Ralph Ellis,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks on public figures ===
In April 2009, Erickson described retiring [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[David Souter]] on his Twitter account as "the only goat fucking child molester to ever serve on the Supreme Court”. In an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Erickson said the statement was "not my finest hour."&lt;ref name="tellist2010" /&gt; Erickson called Texas state senator [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]] “Abortion Barbie.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In a blog post, Erickson considered whether President Obama was “shagging hookers” and wondered whether Michelle Obama (whom he called a “marxist harpy”) “would go Lorena Bobbit [''sic''] on him should he even think about it.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Erickson argued that President Obama won the Nobel Prize because of an “affirmative action quota.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/erick-erickson-is-sorry-about-some-of-the-things-he-has-said|title=Erick Erickson Is Sorry About Some of the Things He Has Said|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson compared the Obama administration's health care communications director Linda Douglass to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/29/eric-erickson-on-past-con_n_516868.html|title=Erick Erickson On Past Controversial Statements: 'I've Definitely Had To Grow Up' (VIDEO)|last=Shea|first=Danny|date=2010-05-29|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augusto Pinochet ===
In November 2018, Erickson tweeted that [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]] to [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Mexico]] would be more effectively spent installing "[[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] types" in these countries. He added that the US should "support strong leaders who support [[Free market economics|free market]] reforms and promote economic stability, even if with a heavy hand". When challenged on this proposal, Erickson replied "I'm hoping for some helicopters in this plan", a reference to [[Death flights]] in [[Chile]] during Pinochet's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Luke |title=Conservative pundit praises late Chilean dictator who threw political dissidents from helicopters |url=https://thinkprogress.org/conservative-erick-erickson-praises-pinochet-helicopters-552b2f3b6597/ |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
In 2017 he published a book ''Before You Wake: Life Lessons from a Father to His Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/opinion/erick-erickson-common-ground.html|title=Opinion - Erick Erickson: How to Find Common Ground|first=Erick-Woods|last=Erickson|date=September 30, 2017|publisher=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugen Leviné''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Левине}}) (born 10 May 1883 – 5 July 1919) was a [[German people|German]] [[Communism|communist]] revolutionary and leader of the short-lived [[Bavarian Council Republic]].

==Background==
Leviné was born in [[St. Petersburg]] into the [[Jewish]] merchant family Julius and Rozalia (née Goldberg).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stephen Eric Bronner|2012|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Frank Kyle|2012|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|H.A. Winkler|2007|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|M. Avrum Ehrlich|2008|p=847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Leviné died when Eugen was 3 years old, and Rozalia emigrated to [[German Empire|Germany]] with her son, settling in [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Mannheim]]. Eugen went on to study law at the [[Heidelberg University]]. He returned to Russia to participate in the failed [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution of 1905]] against the [[Tsar]]. For his actions, he was exiled to [[Siberia]]. He eventually escaped to Germany and began studying at [[Heidelberg University]] and, in 1915, married Rosa Broido from the Polish town of [[Gródek, Białystok County|Gródek]]. They had at least one child, a son, whom they named Eugen. For a short time, he served in the [[Imperial German Army]] during the [[First World War]].

==Bavarian Council Republic==
After the war ended, Leviné joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] and helped to create a socialist republic in Bavaria. However, the republic lasted only several weeks, replaced quickly by a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet-style republic]] after the assassination of [[Kurt Eisner]], then leader of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD).

The ruling government of the new republic lasted only six days, due to poor leadership under the German playwright [[Ernst Toller]].  Leviné rose to power as the communists assumed control of the government.

Leviné attempted to pass many reforms, such as giving the more luxurious flats to the homeless and giving workers control and ownership of factories. He also planned reforms for the education system and to abolish [[Banknote|paper money]], neither of which he ever completed.

Under orders from Leviné, the Red Guards began rounding up people they considered to be hostile to the new regime as hostages against imminent outside attack. As the German president [[Friedrich Ebert]] gave orders to subdue the Council Republic and reinstate the Bavarian government under [[Johannes Hoffmann (SPD)|Johannes Hoffmann]], the Red Guards executed eight hostages on 29 April 1919.

The [[Reichswehr|German Army]], assisted by [[Freikorps]], with a force of roughly 39,000 men, invaded and quickly conquered Munich on 3 May 1919. In retaliation for the execution of the hostages, the Freikorps captured and killed some 700 men and women. Leviné himself was arrested, found guilty as part of those executions, and was shot by firing squad in [[Stadelheim Prison]].

==Influence==
The American Soviet agent and later outspoken [[anti-communist]] [[Whittaker Chambers]] cited Leviné as one of three men who inspired him. Chambers wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Bavarian Council Republic in 1919, Leviné was the organiser of the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviets. When the Bavarian Council Republic was crushed, Leviné was captured and court-martialed. The court-martial told him: "You are under sentence of death." Leviné answered: "We Communists are always under sentence of death."&lt;ref&gt;

Soon after the completion of ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' poll in 2002, [[BBC]] organized a similar opinion poll to find out who is the greatest [[Bengalis|Bengali]] personality in Bengali nation's history of thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://dailyasianage.com/news/7256/listeners-name-greatest-bengali |title=Listeners name ‘greatest Bengali’ |work=The Asian Age |date=2016-01-10 |access-date=2018-01-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=567921&amp;date=2016-04-13 |title=News Details|work=BSS |date=2016-04-13 |language=en |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bcuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=Greatest+Bengali+Of+All+Time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wI5OceluxO&amp;sig=QTl08MY5Zm3MktcM1CaVMjMrCP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2k_qw4fXYAhUMXlMKHUDsCE0Q6AEIpQEwEg#v=onepage&amp;q=Greatest%20Bengali%20Of%20All%20Time&amp;f=false|title=Communalism and Globalization in South Asia and Its Diaspora|last=Heath|first=Deana|last2=Mathur|first2=Chandana|date=2010-12-22|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136867873|location=|pages=145|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, BBC's Bengali Service conducted the opinion poll with the title 'Greatest Bengali of all time' started from February 11 continued onto March 22. The poll was participated by Bengalis around the world including from [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] (states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]], [[Assam]]) and overseas Bengali communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3623345.stm| title=Listeners name 'greatest Bengali' |work=BBC News |date=2004-04-14 |access-date=2017-12-14 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/04/16/d4041601066.htm |title=BBC Listeners' Poll |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2004-04-16 |access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Habib |first=Haroon |date=2004-04-17 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/04/17/stories/2004041703001700.htm |title=Mujib, Tagore, Bose among `greatest Bengalis of all time' |newspaper=The Hindu |access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/36313 |title=The speech that changed the course of history |newspaper=The Independent |location=Dhaka |date=2016-03-07 |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Total 140 nominations had been produced from the poll. [[BBC]] started to announce the top 20 names from 26 March declaring one name each day starting from 20th position. On the final day of 14 April, which was also the [[Pahela Baishakh]] (Bengali New Year day), BBC announced [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the founding father of Bangladesh as the 'Greatest Bengali of all time' voted by Bengalis worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Describing the process of voting, BBC's Bengali Service stated that to avoid any flaw or controversy, they followed the most modern method of [[opinion poll]]ing. Participants were asked to nominate their five choices of greatest Bengali on the order of preference instead of one. The top nominee of each voter was given five points, second nominee four points, thus eventually the fifth nominee got one point. On the basis of total points, the final list of the greatest Bengali poll was generated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

BBC informed that [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] bagged almost double points than the second place holder [[Rabindranath Tagore]], while Tagore himself secured double points than [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] and Nazrul got double than [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]]. The other 17 personalities however had narrow differences of points with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Along with highest six politicians, the list also contains several authors and social reformers. Also two religious preachers, one scientist and one economist got place in the final list. [[Begum Rokeya]] was the only woman and [[Amartya Sen]] only living personality to be voted in top 20.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He was arrested in [[Serbia]] on 28 March 2012 for "crimes against [the] constitution and security of Republic of Serbia".&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur70/008/2012/en/ |title=Serbia: Amnesty International condemns "retaliatory" arrest of Kosovo Albanian trade unionist |author= |date=29 March 2012 |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Serbian Interior Minister [[Ivica Dačić]], the arrest was made in "retaliation" for the arrests of four Kosovo Serbians the previous day.&lt;ref name=ER1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/28032012-dacic-kosovo-trade-unionist-arrest-is-retaliation/ |title=Dacic: Kosovo Trade Unionist Arrest Is Retaliation |author=Lawrence Marzouk and Gordana Andric |date=28 March 2012 |work=Eurasia Review |publisher= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1990s, Abazi was active in pre-independence Kosovo politics, twice serving in the parliament formed by [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as a "parallel" to the Serbian parliament. Abazi is a trade unionist and currently serves as the president of the Kosovo Metalworkers Union.&lt;ref name=ER1/&gt;

==March 2012 arrest==
On 27 March 2012, four Kosovo Serbs, including the mayor of [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]], were arrested while attempting to cross the Kosovo-Serbia border at [[Bela Zemlja]] with campaign materials for an upcoming election. They were subsequently charged with "incitement to hatred and intolerance among ethnic groups".&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/30/serbiakosovo-halt-arbitrary-arrests |title=Serbia/Kosovo: Halt Arbitrary Arrests |author= |date=31 March 2012 |work= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following day, trade Hasan Abazi was arrested with fellow unionist Izet Mustafa who was released immediately by Serbian border police at a crossing near Gnjilane, Kosovo.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; Abazi was charged with espionage and  Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic stated of the arrests that "Serbian police did not wish to take this approach, but the situation obviously could no longer go on without retaliation... If someone wants to compete in arrests, we have the answer".&lt;ref name=ER1/&gt; According to his lawyer, Abazi was then held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=ER2/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] responded to the charges by calling for Abazi's release, stating that "people’s individual liberty cannot be put at risk as a bargaining chip in a political dispute between Serbia and Kosovo".&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] described it as an "arbitrary" arrest and also called for Abazi and Urseli's release.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; Members of [[European Parliament]] [[Edvard Kukan]] and [[Jelko Kacin]] sent a joint letter to Serbian Prime Minister [[Mirko Cvetković]] protesting Abazi's detention and stating "great concern about the independence of state institutions and rule of law in Serbia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_id=79724 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721224509/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_id=79724 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=EP rapporteur wants ethnic Albanian freed |author= |date=11 April 2012 |work= |publisher=B92 |accessdate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, the Serbian High Court in [[Vranje]] ordered Abazi to be detained for thirty days on espionage charges dating to a 1999 incident in which Abazi allegedly gave information to NATO.&lt;ref name=ER2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-isolates-hasan-abazi |title=Hasan Abazi Faces Month in Custody |author=Fatmir Aliu |date=30 March 2012 |work=Eurasia Review |publisher= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gauchowheat edit2.jpg|thumb|Huaso in a [[Chile]]an [[wheat]] field, 1940]]
[[Image:ElHuasoYLaLavandera.jpg|thumb|"The Huaso and the Washerwoman" by [[Mauricio Rugendas]] (1835).]]
A '''huaso''' ({{IPA-es|ˈwaso}}) is a [[Chile]]an countryman and skilled horseman, similar to the [[United States|American]] [[cowboy]] or [[Mexico|Mexican]] ''[[charro]]'', the  [[gaucho]] of [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Rio Grande Do Sul]] and the [[Australia]]n [[Stockman (Australia)|stockman]]. A female ''huaso'' is called a '''huasa''', although the term '''china''' is far more commonly used for his wife or sweetheart, whose dress can be seen in [[cueca]] dancing.  Huasos are found all over [[Central Chile|Central]] and [[Zona Sur|Southern Chile]] while the [[Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes Region]] sheep raisers are gauchos. The major difference between the huaso and the gaucho is that huasos are involved in farming as well as cattle herding.

Huasos (plural) are generally found in Chile's central valley. They ride [[Chilean Horse|horses]] and typically wear a straw hat called a ''[[chupalla]]''. They also wear a [[poncho]]—called a ''manta'' or a ''[[chamanto]]'' (although this was originally reserved to land owners, as it is much more expensive)—over a short Andalusian waist jacket, as well as tooled leather legging over booties with raw hide leather spur holders that sustain a long-shanked spur with 4-inch rowels, and many other typical garments.

Huasos are an important part of [[Culture of Chile|Chilean folkloric culture]] and are a vital part of parades, fiestas, holidays, and popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Mularski, Jedrek. ''Music, Politics, and Nationalism in Latin America: Chile During the Cold War Era''. Amherst: Cambria Press. {{ISBN|9781604978889}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dancing of the [[cueca]] in which the coy china is courted by the persistent huaso, both traditionally attired, is ''de rigueur'' on such occasions.

In Chile, the term ''huaso'' or ''ahuasado'' (in a ''huaso'' way) is also used disparagingly to refer to people without manners or lacking the sophistication of an urbanite, akin to US English [[redneck]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Huasoencerro.jpg|thumb|Huaso on a hill.]]

Various theories are commonly advanced: from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''wakcha'' (hispanicized as ''huacho'') meaning ''orphan'', ''not belonging to a community'', hence free and homeless, an important aspect of the huaso/gaucho myth, or alternatively from the Quechua ''wasu'', meaning either the back of an animal, or rough and rustic. Moreover the word ''guaso/a'' is used in Andalusian and American Spanish with the last sense. 

It appears that a form of [[folk etymology]] has operated to conflate the contrasting identities of the huaso, viewed as both a free horseman (implying some wealth and nobility) and an unsophisticated country bumpkin. Both senses can be observed in Chilean usage.

==Work in cryptography==
In 1995, Goldberg with [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]] discovered a flaw in the [[random number generator]] used for temporary key generation in the SSL implementation of [[Netscape Navigator]].&lt;ref name="netscape-ssl-cracked"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian1.html|title=The Cypherpunks Who Cracked Netscape|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian2.html|title=Security Flaw Is Discovered In Software Used in Shopping|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian3.html|title=Discovery of Internet Flaws Is Setback for On-Line Trade|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian4.html|title=Cypherpunks|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian5.html|title=The New Watchdogs of Digital Commerce|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian6.html|title=Good thing we're not 'bad guys,' say code-cracking grad students|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian7.html|title=The up and comers|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/press/iang/ian8.html|title=Net scoop|website=people.eecs.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first cryptanalyses on the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] wireless encryption protocol was conducted by Goldberg with [[Nikita Borisov]] and David Wagner, revealing serious flaws in its design.&lt;ref name="wep-insecurity"&gt;

==Early life==
Jason Conley was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and attended [[Montrose Christian School]] in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], a perennial national high school basketball power that has sent many players to the Division I and professional levels.&lt;ref name=MIZZOU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Montrose Christian Division I Players |work=montrosebasketball.com |publisher=[[Montrose Christian School]] |year=2010 |url=http://www.montrosebasketball.com/d1.html |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616135157/http://www.montrosebasketball.com/d1.html |archivedate=16 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not catch many college basketball recruiters' attention, but [[Virginia Military Institute]], a small Division I university located in [[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]], [[Virginia]] offered him a scholarship.&lt;ref name=ENQ&gt;{{Cite web | last = Schmidt | first = Neil
| title = Five questions with Jason Conley | publisher = ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' | date = 16 February 2002 | url = http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/02/16/spt_five_questions_with.html| accessdate = 2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College==
===VMI===
Conley is [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] and failed to attain the minimum [[SAT]] entrance exam score to be eligible to play college basketball right after high school.&lt;ref name=ENQ/&gt; To try to help him qualify, he spent one year at a postgraduate school called [[Millersburg Military Institute|Millersburg (Ky.) Military Institute]], but Conley still fell short of his SAT requirement.&lt;ref name=ENQ/&gt; As a partial qualifier, he sat out one year at VMI but did not lose a year of eligibility.&lt;ref name=ENQ/&gt;

When Conley's college basketball career finally started in 2001, two full years after his high school graduation in 1999, he burst onto the national scene. As a freshman, Conley started all 28 games, averaged 29.3&amp;nbsp;points, 8.0&amp;nbsp;rebounds and 2.9&amp;nbsp;steals per game while shooting 46.7% from the field and 81.8% from the [[free throw]] line.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{Cite web | title = Jason Conley stats | publisher = [[ESPN.com]] | year = 2010 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=3057 | accessdate = 2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some of his best games against top-tier competition: 24&amp;nbsp;points against [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], 25&amp;nbsp;against [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] and even 38&amp;nbsp;against [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]].&lt;ref name=ENQ/&gt;

When the [[2001–02 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2001–02 season]] had come to a close, Conley's 29.3&amp;nbsp;ppg average made him the first [[freshman]] ever to win [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season scoring leaders|the national scoring title]].&lt;ref name=MIZZOU/&gt;&lt;ref name=SLAM/&gt;&lt;ref name=VMI/&gt; He was named the [[Southern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Co-Southern Conference Player of the Year]] with [[Dimeco Childress]] of [[ETSU Buccaneers basketball|East Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=EURO/&gt;&lt;ref name=POSM/&gt;

Conley followed up an historical freshman campaign at VMI with a [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] season that saw him transfer to [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]] after the first semester had ended.&lt;ref name=MIZZOU/&gt; At the time, Conley played in 10&amp;nbsp;games and was averaging 22.2&amp;nbsp;ppg with VMI.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; Since he transferred midway through an academic year, he only had to sit out the spring semester at Missouri before he was eligible to suit up for the Tigers the following year.&lt;ref name=MIZZOU/&gt;

===Missouri===
As a [[junior (education)|junior]] in [[2003–04 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2003–04]], Conley was selected to the [[Big 12 Conference]] All-Newcomer and All-Reserve Teams.&lt;ref name=MIZZOU/&gt; He averaged 7.6&amp;nbsp;points and 3.4&amp;nbsp;rebounds in 18.2&amp;nbsp;minutes per game,&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; and scored a season-high 24&amp;nbsp;points in a win over [[Baylor Bears basketball|Baylor]].&lt;ref name=MIZZOU/&gt; As a [[senior (education)|senior]] in [[2004–05 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2004–05]], Conley's role on Missouri increased as he averaged 10.2&amp;nbsp;points and 5.9&amp;nbsp;rebounds in a career-high 33&amp;nbsp;games played.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; Although neither of his seasons at Missouri matched what he accomplished at Virginia Military Institute, he still finished his college basketball career with 1,567&amp;nbsp;points and 557&amp;nbsp;rebounds.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

==Professional==
The closest Conley came to making a [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) roster was participating for the [[Atlanta Hawks]]' summer league team in 2005.&lt;ref name=POSM/&gt; He was signed to play for [[Germany]]'s [[Telekom Baskets Bonn]] in 2005, a team he stayed with through 2007–08.&lt;ref name=EURO/&gt; He followed this with one-month stints for [[Finland]]'s Porvoon Tarmo (February 2009) and Namika Lahti (March 2009).&lt;ref name=EURO/&gt; In 2009–10, Conley signed with WBC Kraftwerk Wels of the [[Austria]]n A Bundesliga.&lt;ref name=EURO/&gt;&lt;ref name=POSM/&gt;

'''John Banister''' (December 26, 1734 – September 30, 1788) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer and an [[American Revolutionary War]] [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]] from [[Petersburg, Virginia]].

== Early life ==
The son of John Banister and grandson of John Banister, the [[natural history|naturalist]], he was educated at [[Middle Temple]] in [[London]], [[England]], admitted on September 27, 1753. He was a member of the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] in 1776. He also served in the [[House of Burgesses]] (1765–1775, 1777), the [[Continental Congress]] (1778 – 1779) as a [[delegate]], where he was a framer of and signed the [[Articles of Confederation]], and the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] (1776–1777, 1781–1783).

== Revolutionary War ==
During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Banister was a [[Major]] and [[Lieutenant colonel|Lt. Colonel]] of [[United States Cavalry|cavalry]] in the Virginia line [[militia]] (1778–1781). [[General (United States)|General]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]], [[George Washington]] regarded him highly, as witnessed by a letter he wrote to him from [[Valley Forge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1781 he aided in supplying his militia and in repelling the British from his state.  Much of his personal property was lost. British forces under [[General]] Phillips would commonly stop at his home in Battersea, in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. He was well informed on current affairs and an established writer. Banister was married three times. His first was to Elizabeth Munford in 1755, and his marriage was to Elizabeth "Patsy" Bland, the daughter of [[Theodorick Bland of Cawsons]] and the sister of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Theodorick Bland (congressman)|Theodorick Bland]] (see also the [[Richard Bland]] topic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Banister's suburban villa in Petersburg, [[Battersea (Petersburg, Virginia)|Battersea]], was built in 1768 in a five-part [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style. A notable feature of the interior is a Chinese style staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Cheriton Church - geograph.org.uk - 873482.jpg|thumb|Cheriton Church - geograph.org.uk - 873482]]'''John David Davies''' (1831 - 1911) was a Welsh priest. His father was John Davies (1834-1873), Rector of [[Reynoldston]]. As a young man he studied at Trinity College, [[Dublin]], graduating first with a B.A., and then with an M.A. in 1859. He was ordained Deacon in 1855, and priest in 1856. In 1860 he was appointed Rector of [[Llanmadoc]], and of Cheriton in 1867, holding both appointments until his death in 1911. One of his favourite pastimes was wood carving, and he was responsible for much of the carving present in the churches of Cheriton, [[Llangennith]], [[Llanrhidian]], and [[Llanmadoc]].

His written works include a study of the history of the [[Gower]] (which was published in four volumes), 'A History of West [[Gower]]' (Swansea, 1877–94), and the essay, 'A Few Words on Non-communicating Attendance' (Swansea, 1879).

'''Saints Julian and Basilissa''' (died ca. 304) were [[husband]] and [[wife]].  They were [[Christian]] [[martyr]]s who died at either [[Antioch]] or, more probably, at [[Antinopolis|Antinoe]], in the reign of [[Diocletian]], early in the fourth century, on 9 January, according to the ''Roman Martyrology'', or 8 January, according to the Greek ''[[Menaea Graeca|Menaea]]''.

Their feast day is also given as 6 January, while a group of people martyred with Julian ('''[[Celsus and Marcionilla|Celsus, Marcionilla]], [[Anthony of Antioch|Anthony]], [[Anastasius of Antioch (martyr)|Anastasius]]''') have the feast day of January 9.

There exists no historically certain data relating to these two personages, and more than once this Julian of Antinoe has been confounded with [[Julian of Cilicia]]. The confusion is easily explained by the fact that thirty-nine saints of this name are mentioned in the ''Roman Martyrology'', eight of whom are commemorated in the one month of January. But little is known of this saint, aside from the exaggerations of his ''Acts''.

==Legend==
Forced by his family to marry, he agreed with his spouse, Basilissa, that they should both preserve their [[virginity]], and further encouraged her to found a [[convent]] for women, of which she became the superior, while he himself gathered a large number of [[monk]]s and undertook their direction.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, the idea of monks (or nuns) living together in communities is attributed to [[Pachomius the Great|Saint Pachomius]], who lived decades later.&lt;/ref&gt; The two converted their home into a [[hospital]] which could house up to 1,000 people (thus, Julian is often confused with [[Julian the Hospitaller]]).

Basilissa, after having stood severe persecutions, died in peace; Julian survived her many years, but was martyred, (together with Celsus a youth, Antony a priest, Anastatius, and Marcianilla the mother of Celsus) under the [[Persecutions of Diocletian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/210/1/092.html Butler, Alban. "St. Julian and St. Basilissa, Martyrs", ''The Lives of the Saints'', vol. I, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julian's Martyrdom==
During the persecution of Diocletian he was arrested, tortured, and put to death at Antioch, in [[Syria]], by the order of the governor, Martian, according to the Latins, at Antinoe, in [[Egypt]], according to the Greeks, which seems more probable. Unfortunately, as with most saints lives the exact historical details are hard to parse from the religious tropes and maxims. &lt;ref name=Clugnet&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08556b.htm Clugnet, Léon. "Sts. Julian and Basilissa." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celsus and Marcionilla|Celsus]], the young son of [[Celsus and Marcionilla|Marcionilla]], was martyred along with Julian.  The priest [[Anthony of Antioch|Anthony (Antony)]] was martyred at the same time, as well as a convert and [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]] named [[Anastasius of Antioch (martyr)|Anastasius]].  Marcionilla's seven brothers are also said to have been killed.

==Veneration==
In any case, these two saints must have enjoyed a great reputation in [[ancient history|antiquity]], and their veneration was well established before the eighth century. In the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'' they are mentioned under 6 January; [[Usuard]], [[Ado (archbishop)|Ado]], [[Notker of St Gall]], and others place them under the ninth, and [[Rabanus Maurus]] under the thirteenth of the same month, while Vandelbert puts them under 13 February, and the Menology of Canisius&lt;!--"Menology" suggests a Jesuit work - but two of the people on the DAB page were SJ--&gt; under 21 June, the day to which the Greek Menaea assign St. [[Julian of Caesarea]]. There used to exist at [[Constantinople]] a church under the invocation of these saints, the dedication of which is inscribed in the Greek Calendar under 5 July.&lt;ref name=Clugnet/&gt;

Only a fragment of [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric's]] ''Passion of St. Julian and His Wife Basilissa'' from his ''Lives of the Saints'' has survived, but the traditional legend is there: the two saints vow not to [[consummate]] their marriage on their wedding night, and devote themselves to ''clænnysse'' ("chastity").  Julian suffers martyrdom by [[decapitation|beheading]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/OddCouples/OddCouples.htm Kiernan, Kevin.

The {{nihongo|'''Kudan'''|件|literally "matter", more creatively translated as "human-faced bovine"}} is a [[yōkai]] which became widely known throughout [[Japan]] during the first half of the [[19th century]].

==Etymology==
The [[kanji]] for ''kudan'' is composed of two characters: {{nihongo|''hito''|人||"human"}}, and {{nihongo|''ushi''|牛||"cow" or "bull"}}.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=216}}

=== "Like the Kudan" ===
Throughout Western Japan, the idiom {{nihongo|"like the ''kudan''"|件の如し|kudan no gotoshi}} began to appear on deeds and official documents. The phrase indicated that "As the prophecy [of the ''kudan''] is always true, so too is the information in this document." However, while the description of the ''kudan'' did not appear until the late Edo Period, the idiom "like the ''kudan''" has been documented since the [[Heian period]]. It appears on page 128 of the early 11th century book ''[[The Pillow Book]]''. For this reason, the relationship between the phrase "like the ''kudan''" and the ''yōkai'' is considered an anachronistic one.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=216}}{{sfn|Matsumaya|2004|p=74}}

==Appearance==
Traditionally, the ''kudan'' is depicted as having the head of a human and the body of a bovine. Subsequent depictions have occasionally switched these elements and placed the head of a bovine onto the body of a human similar to a [[Minotaur]].{{sfn|Meyer|2015}}

===Ushi-onna===
During the period of post war reconstruction which followed [[World War II]], another rumour similar to that of the ''kudan'' started to appear. Instead of a human-faced bovine, the creature spoken of was a kimono-wearing woman with a cow's face, referred to as {{nihongo|''ushi-onna|牛女||lit. "cow woman"}}.{{sfn|Matsuyama|2004|p=72}}

===Interpretation===
The most widespread interpretation of the ''kudan'' comes from the [[Edo period]], in which it is described as a creature which—despite being born from a cow—has the ability to use human speech. The creatures invariably die just a few short days after their birth,{{sfn|Meyer|2015}} yet in that time they are said to coincide with some major event. Sometimes these events bring various misfortunes such as poor crop harvest, natural disasters, or sickness, only for the ''kudan'' to die when the event has come to pass.{{sfn|Matsumaya|2004|p=74}}

They are also said to issue prophecies of things to come. These prophecies typically depict bleak happenings such as war. A ''kudan'' was rumoured to have predicted Japan's defeat during World War II.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=216}} Despite this, pictures and talismans of the ''kudan'' are still seen as good luck charms due to their association with honesty.{{sfn|Meyer|2015}}

==Historical appearances==

===Pre-Meiji period===
From the [[Edo period]] through [[Shōwa period]], there have been several reported sightings throughout Japan, though they are most often reported in Western Japan. The earliest recorded appearance of the ''kudan'' comes in 1827 from [[Tateyama, Toyama|Tateyama]] in [[Etchū Province]] (now part of [[Toyama Prefecture]]). Originally, the creature was referred to as {{nihongo|''Kudabe''|くだべ|}}.

Pickers of wild plants came across a monster with a human face in the mountains calling itself "''Kudabe''". The creature predicted that "many would fall victim to an epidemic plague within the next few years. However, if a person were to carry and look upon a drawing of [the ''Kudabe''], they would be spared". This then became something of a tradition, and amulets containing pictures of the ''Kudabe'' became very popular. Similarly, amulets containing pictures of the {{nihongo|''Jinja-hime''|神社姫||"Shrine Princess"}}—an omen associated with cholera outbreaks—were believed to save people from cholera.{{sfn|Tetsunemitsu|2002|p = 159-161}}

The earliest pictorial example of a creature referred to as ''kudan'' was reported on an engraved tile in 1836. According to the tile, in "December 1836, in [[Tango Province|Tango province]], a monster with the face of a human and the body of a cattle called "''kudan''" appeared on Kurahashi Mountain".{{sfn|Kimura|2005|p=27-28}} The engraving also stated that "a kudan also appeared in December 1705, and a good harvest followed. Any who wore an amulet depicting the ''kudan'' experienced great family prosperity even in times of sickness, and large harvests in times of famine. Indeed, it is an auspicious beast! Because the ''kudan'' is an honest beast, it is customary to write "like the ''Kudan''" at the end of every act and deed".{{sfn|Tetsunemitsu|2002|p = 159-161}} At this time, the [[Tenpo famine]] was at its peak, and so it is believed that this report was intended to "give people hope of a good harvest".{{sfn|Kimura|2005|p=28}}

===Post-Meiji Restoration===
On June 21, 1909, a Nagoya newspaper reported a sighting of the ''kudan''. According to the article, a calf had been born with a human face a decade before in a farmhouse on the [[Gotō Islands]]. It reported that "It died only 31 days after its birth and prophesied [[Russo-Japanese War|a war between Japan and Russia]]." The calf was later stuffed and put on display in the Yahiro Museum in [[Nagasaki]]. The museum has since closed and the calf's whereabouts are unknown.{{sfn|Jinbun-sha Editorial Department|2006|p = 123}}{{sfn|Kimura|2005|p=28}}

From the [[Meiji period]] to the early [[Shōwa period]], objects referred to as "stuffed ''kudan''" started to appear in "spectacle huts". In his book ''From Hoki to Oki'', [[Lafcadio Hearn]] makes mention of these huts and travelling entertainers who would spread rumours of the ''kudan'' legend. According to this report, a travelling entertainer in 1892 brought a stuffed ''kudan'' aboard a ship bound for [[Mihonoseki, Shimane|Mihonoseki]]. However, due to the unholy nature of the beast, the gods sent strong winds as punishment and the ship was unable to land at Mihonoseki.{{sfn|Hearn|2014|p = 193-194}}

The theory about the ''kudan'' being a benevolent wish-granting creature subsided during the Shōwa period and was replaced by greater emphasis on the ''kudan's'' wartime prophecies. A kudan appeared in 1930 in a forest in [[Kagawa Prefecture]], prophesying: "Soon, there will be a great war. You shall win, but you will later be struck down by plague. However, those who eat red beans and tie yarn around their wrists within 3 days of hearing this prophecy shall not fall sick."{{sfn|Kei|1933|p = "Volume 2, Number 7"}} In 1933, this rumor reached [[Nagano Prefecture]] and quickly spread, with elementary school students spreading it further by taking red bean rice into school for their lunches. However, the content of the rumor changed. Instead of a ''kudan'', the prophecy was attributed to a snake-headed beast, sent by the deity of the [[Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]] in Nagano Prefecture: Mishaguchi.{{sfn|Kei|1933|p = "Volume 2, Number 4"}}

During [[World War II]], many rumors were spread about prophecies regarding the war and air raids. In 1943, a ''kudan'' was said to have been born in a [[Geta (footwear)|Geta]] shop in [[Iwakuni]]. This ''kudan'' predicted that "the war will end next year, around April or May."{{sfn|Kimura|2005|p=28-29}} It was then reported in the spring of 1945 in [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] that "A Kudan has been born in [[Kobe]]. He says that 'anyone who consumes red beans or bean cakes within three days of hearing this tale shall escape the air raids.'" The rumors quickly circulated throughout Matsuyama.{{sfn|Kimura|2005|p=29}}

[[Image:LouisLeonowensBrompton.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London]]
'''Louis Thomas Gunnis Leonowens''' (25 October 1856 – 17 February 1919) was a [[British subject]] who was the basis of a major character in the 1944 novel ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'', as well as other fictional works based on it (see below). He was the son of [[Anna Leonowens]], famous as a tutor of King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam ([[Thailand]]). Leonowens later served as an officer with the Siamese [[Royal Guards (Thailand)|Royal Cavalry]] and founded a Thai [[trading company]] that still bears his name, Louis T. Leonowens Ltd.

==Early life==
Leonowens was the son of [[Anna Leonowens]] ''nee'' Edwards, an [[Anglo-Indian]] who had never visited Britain, and Thomas Leon Owens, an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born, India-raised clerk, who married in India in 1849. The couple left India for [[Singapore]], then part of the [[Straits Settlements]], in 1852.

Louis was born at [[Lynton, Western Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Register of Births, Western Australia, no. 3469, 1856&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was working for the [[Commissariat]]. In 1857, the family moved to Indonesia, where his father was a hotel manager.&lt;ref name="ltl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louist.co.th/html/ltl_started.html|website=louist.co.th|title=Louis T. Leonowens Ltd|accessdate=2017-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080506124322/http://www.louist.co.th/html/ltl_started.html|archivedate=2008-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1859, and his mother moved to Singapore with Louis and his elder sister, telling the British expatriate community there that she was a genteel Welsh woman, the widow of a British army officer who had unfortunately lost her fortune.&lt;ref name=Historical&gt;Loos, Tamara. [https://www.ufv.ca/jhb/volume_5/volume_5_loos.pdf "Review of ''Bombay Anna...'' by Susan Morgan], ''Journal of Historical Biography'', vol 5 (Spring 2009), pp. 146–52&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother's story was believed, and she was invited, in 1862, to teach the wives and children of King [[Mongkut]] of Siam (now Thailand). After sending Louis's sister to England to get a British education, his mother took him to Bangkok. He was raised in the Siamese royal palace for nearly six years and was schooled by his mother alongside the royal children, until 1867. He was sent to Europe to complete his education. By 1874, Louis was in the U.S. with his mother, but he had accumulated debts. He fled the U.S. and was estranged from his mother for 19 years.&lt;ref name=Historical/&gt;

==Career==
In 1881, at the age of 25, he returned to Siam and was granted a commission of [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the Royal Cavalry, by [[King Chulalongkorn]].&lt;ref name="ltl" /&gt;

Leonowens in 1884 left the military and entered the [[teak]] trade. He went on in 1905 to found the Louis Thomas Leonowens Company in Siam, which became Louis T. Leonowens Ltd, an international trading company. This company remains a leading exporter of [[Malay Peninsula|Malayan]] [[hardwoods]] and an importer of building materials and general merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (16 September 1963); p. x, col. A.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became less involved in the operations of the company after 1906 and left Siam for the last time in 1913.&lt;ref name="ltl"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Louis Thomas Gunnis Leonowens was married to:
*'''Caroline Knox''' (1856–1893), the youngest daughter of Sir [[Thomas George Knox]], British consul-general in Siam from 1824 to 1887, and his wife, Prang Yen, a Siamese noblewoman.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Smith, "It Was Love, Love, Love", ''The New York Times'', 16 September 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

*'''Reta May''' (1880–1936) married Leonowens in 1900. They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Bristowe, ''Louis and the King of Siam'' (Chatto and Windus, 1976), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonowens died in 1919 during the [[1918 flu epidemic|global influenza pandemic]]. He is buried, with his second wife, in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.

'''Louis Wigfall''' (born '''Louis Trezevant Wigfall'''; April 21, 1816 &amp;ndash; February 18, 1874) was an American politician who served as a [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate States Senator]] from [[Texas]] from 1862 to 1865. He was among a group of leading [[secessionist]]s known as [[Fire-Eaters]], advocating the preservation and expansion of an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[Agriculture|agricultural society]] based on [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]]. He briefly served as a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Brigadier General of the [[Texas Brigade]] at the outset of the [[American Civil War]] before taking his seat in the Confederate Senate. Wigfall's reputation for oratory and hard-drinking, along with a combative nature and high-minded sense of personal honor, made him one of the more imposing political figures of his time.

==Early life and career==

===Youth===
Wigfall was born on a plantation near [[Edgefield, South Carolina]], to Levi Durant and Eliza Thomson Wigfall. His father, who died in 1818, was a successful [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] merchant before moving to Edgefield. His mother was of the French [[Huguenot]] Trezavant family. She died when young Louis was 13. An older brother, Hamden, was killed in a duel. Another, Arthur, became a bishop in the Episcopal Church.&lt;ref name=X&gt;Ritter, pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutored by a guardian until 1834, he then spent a year at Rice Creek Springs School, a military academy near [[Columbia, South Carolina]], for children of elite aristocrats. He then entered the [[University of Virginia]]. A perceived insult by another student prompted the first of many [[duel]]ing challenges he would make, but the affair was resolved peaceably.&lt;ref&gt;Cashion, p. 58. The claim in this version was that he was expelled.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836 he entered South Carolina College (now the [[University of South Carolina]]) to complete his studies, but his attendance was erratic. He developed an interest in the law, participated in debating clubs, and wrote epistles on student rights. Most of his time however, was spent at off-campus taverns rather than at his studies.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 49. "An act of the legislature was secured in 1837 forbidding the sale of liquor to students as minors; drinking was the cause of the greatest disorders on campus."&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned academics altogether for three months to fight in the [[Third Seminole War]] in [[Florida]], achieving the rank of Lieutenant of volunteers. Despite these distractions he managed to graduate in 1837.&lt;ref name=XA&gt;Walther, pp. 161-162&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow graduate considered to be his closest friend was [[John Lawrence Manning]], who would later become a [[governor of South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="XA"/&gt;

In 1839 Wigfall returned to Edgefield and took over his brother's law practice. Having squandered his inheritance, and with a proclivity for drinking and gambling,&lt;ref&gt;Allegedly, these habits coincided with frequent visits to an [[Augusta, Georgia]], brothel.&lt;/ref&gt; he accumulated debts.&lt;ref name="XA"/&gt; He borrowed from friends to maintain a freewheeling lifestyle, including from his future bride. "Mere office business" as an upcountry lawyer did not suit his temperament and sense of purpose, nor prove to be as profitable as he had hoped.&lt;ref name="XA"/&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1841 Wigfall married his second cousin, Charlotte Maria Cross, daughter of the prominent Charlestown lawyer and former South Carolina State Controller, Col. George Warren Cross, and his wife, Frances Maria Halsey.

Their Children were:
* Francis Halsey Wigfall.
* Louise Sophie Wigfall, Civil War diarist.
* Mary Frances (Fanny) Wigfall.

===Violence and politics===
In the South Carolina gubernatorial election of 1840, Wigfall actively supported the candidacy of [[John Peter Richardson II|John Peter Richardson]] over the more radical [[James Henry Hammond]], which led to public exchanges of arguments and insults. In a five-month period, Wigfall managed to get into a fistfight, two duels, three near-duels, and was charged, but not indicted, for killing a man.&lt;ref&gt;Wigfall shot and killed Thomas Bird, a cousin to [[Preston Brooks]], when he attempted to remove "postings" at the Edgefield courthouse that called Brooks' father a coward for rejecting a duel challenge.&lt;/ref&gt; This outbreak of political violence culminated in 1840 on an island in the [[Savannah River]] near [[Augusta, Georgia]], where Wigfall took a bullet through both thighs while dueling with future Congressman [[Preston Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CEEDD1431E733A25756C2A9679D94669ED7CF  New York Times archive on Brooks-Wigfall duel] Brooks suffered a wounded hip in the affair and had to use a walking cane for the rest of his life. He would famously use that cane on the floor of the U.S. Senate against Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]] in 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hammond lost the race for Governor, he attempted to mediate the dispute between the two hot-headed young men. Wigfall received an aide-de-camp and Lieutenant Colonelcy on Governor Richardson's staff, but never was completely satisfied with the outcome of the Brooks affair.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, p. 60-62. Hammond thought the difficulty between the two started much earlier. Wigfall's letters to his friend John Manning suggest that he and Brooks were courting the same Augusta belle prior to the election.&lt;/ref&gt;

This initial foray into politics and the Brooks affair destroyed his law practice. He was elected delegate to the South Carolina Democratic convention in 1844, but his violent temperament and behind-the-scenes meddling had already doomed his youthful political ambitions. He piled up medical bills because of a sickly infant son who eventually died. Sheriff sales followed, swallowing up his Edgefield estate. A [[Texas]] cousin, [[James Hamilton, Jr.]], a former [[governor of South Carolina]], arranged for him a fresh start and a law partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 70, Jewett, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Wigfall's reputation as a duelist, often exaggerated, followed him his entire life, even though he gave up the practice entirely after his marriage. However, he would continue to claim the [[code duello]] was an important "factor in the improvement of both the morals and manners of the community."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gone to Texas===
Arriving in Texas in 1848,&lt;ref&gt;Several accounts claim he arrived in 1846. His wife's whereabouts can be traced to Rhode Island during this time. their infant son, John Manning Wigfall, was buried in a [[Providence, Rhode Island]] cemetery in 1846 and their daughter Louise was born there in December 1846 according to census records, among other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Wigfall joined [[William B. Ochiltree]]'s law practice at [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], then settled in [[Marshall, Texas]]. He quickly dove back into politics, serving in the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from 1849 to 1850, and in the [[Texas Senate]] from 1857 to 1860. He became a staunch political opponent of [[Sam Houston]]. When Houston ran for governor in 1857, Wigfall followed him on the campaign trail, attacking his congressional record at each of Houston's stops, and accused Houston of being a traitor to the [[Southern United States|South]]. He claimed that Houston had ambitions for a presidential nomination and courted the support of [[Northern United States|Northern]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s.&lt;ref name=XA2&gt;Walther, pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

He organized state Democrats to resist the [[Know Nothing]] party, but with their defeat his radical views descended in the estimation of Democratic moderates. [[John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry]] propelled him and his radical views back to prominence in the state.&lt;ref name=XA2/&gt;

===United States Senator===
The Texas legislature elected Wigfall to the United States Senate in 1859 as a Democrat to the [[36th United States Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[James Pinckney Henderson]]. [[Matthias Ward]] was appointed to the Senate following Henderson's death and served from September 27, 1858 until Wigfall was elected and sworn in on December 5, 1859.&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress website http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000138&lt;/ref&gt;  Wigfall served until March 23, 1861, when he withdrew.  He was expelled from the Senate on July 11, 1861 for support of the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress website http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000447&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a member of the Texas delegation to the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]], which formed the [[provisional government]] of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and which selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its president. Wigfall had continued to hold his seat after Texas had seceded on February 1, 1861 and was admitted to the Provisional Confederate Congress on March 2, 1861, exhorting the rightness of the Southern cause and berating his Northern colleagues whether on the floor of the Senate or in Capitol Hill saloons. During this time in Washington, he spied on Federal preparations for the coming conflict, secured weapons for delivery south, and upon [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expulsion]] by his fellow Senators, he went to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and recruited soldiers for the new Confederacy before traveling to the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p.12. Wigfall concocted a scheme to kidnap President [[James Buchanan]] so that Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]], a friend and fellow southerner, could assume the presidency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
[[File:Carte-de-Visite of a half portrait of Louis Trezevant Wigfall (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis Wigfall in 1861]]
In the days leading up to the start of hostilities, Wigfall advocated an attack on [[Fort Sumter]] and [[Fort Pickens]] in [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]] to prompt [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]] and other upper southern slave states to join the Confederacy. In January 1865, Wigfall stated his reasons for having supported the Confederacy, namely, opposition to African American equality:

{{Quotation|Sir, I wish to live in no country where the man who blacks my boots or curries my horse is my equal.|Louis Wigfall||January 1865, Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/orationsandaddr03curtgoog|title=Orations and addresses of George William Curtis|first1=George William|last1=Curtis|first2=Charles Eliot|last2=Norton|date=16 October 1894|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, as the siege of [[Fort Sumter]] commenced. According to diarist [[Mary Chesnut]], he was the only "thoroughly happy person I see."&lt;ref&gt;Chestnut, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as an aide to General [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Beauregard]] during [[Battle of Fort Sumter|the bombardment of Fort Sumter]], and without authorization, he rowed a skiff out to the island fort and demanded its surrender from [[Major Robert Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 41, Walther, p, Eicher, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was widely reported in the newspapers furthering his celebrity, but the story redacted the important detail that Wigfall had not spoken to Beauregard in two days. When the ''authorized'' emissaries arrived at the fort, they were dismayed upon learning that Wigfall had granted terms to Anderson which Beauregard had already rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brigade commander===
With his newfound celebrity Wigfall secured an appointment to full colonel of the [[1st Texas Infantry]] Regiment, and a rapid promotion thereafter to brigadier general of the "[[Texas Brigade]]" in the Confederate Army. He took up residence near his encamped troops in a tavern at [[Dumfries, Virginia]], during the winter of 1861–1862, where he would frequently call the men to arms at midnight, imagining a Federal invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Polley, pg. 16 Colonels Hood and Archer would refuse to call their men to the color line on these instances until General Wigfall had sent down direct orders to do so.&lt;/ref&gt; His nervousness was blamed on his fondness for whiskey and hard cider. He appeared visibly drunk, on and off-duty, in the presence of his men on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, p. 78, Polley p. 15 "Wigfall's imagination was too often quickened by deep potations to be reliable."&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his commission in February 1862 to take a seat in the Confederate Senate, and was replaced by [[John Bell Hood]].&lt;ref name=XC&gt;Heidler, pg. 2104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederate States Senator===
At the beginning of the war Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]. Like political alliances throughout his career, he would first support then split with Davis as the war progressed. Davis supported an increasingly strong national government, while Wigfall, forever an advocate of [[states rights]], moved to block the creation of the Confederate Supreme Court, fearing Davis' appointments would rule against the states. Wigfall also challenged Davis, a [[West Point]] graduate and former [[United States Secretary of War]], on many of his military-related policies, citing his own military experience in the Seminole Wars. Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and frequently proposed legislation on the general's behalf. He was also an early proponent of making [[Robert E. Lee]] commander of all Confederate armies.&lt;ref name=XC/&gt;

==Later life==
At the conclusion of hostilities, Wigfall escaped back to Texas in the company of Texas troops with a forged parole,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt; then went to London, in 1866 as an exile&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; where he intrigued to foment trouble between Britain and the United States. He bought a mine in Clear Creek, Colorado, returning to the United States in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, p. 24. Some give the year of return as 1871 or 1872, but he appears on the 1870 Colorado census with his son Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived for a while in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and was in [[Galveston, Texas]], in January, 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, p. 328. A biographical note claims he was on a lecture tour.&lt;/ref&gt; He died a month later of "[[apoplexy]]" and is buried there in the Episcopal cemetery.&lt;ref name=XB&gt;Billups, pg. 144
&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 1992 [[alternate history]]/[[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], Senator Wigfall serves as the running mate to [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] on the Patriot Party in the 1867 Confederate Presidential Election opposing [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Albert Gallatin Brown]]. The Forrest-Wigfall ticket lost by a narrow margin. The book uses real quotes of Wigfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rulit.me/books/the-guns-of-the-south-read-181259-137.html|title=Читать онлайн "The Guns of the South" автора Тертлдав Гарри Норман – RuLit – Страница 137|website=www.rulit.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory Hill''' (21 May 1941 &amp;ndash; 20 July 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.discordia.scc/browse_thread/thread/25f571774b7b2003/f05d32875321aae9 alt.discordia.scc post]&lt;/ref&gt;), better known by the [[pen name]] '''Malaclypse the Younger''', was one of the two writers of the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', along with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (a.k.a. Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). He was also adapted as a character in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''. During the early years of circulation of the ''Principia Discordia'', rumors claimed that the author of the book was [[Richard Nixon]], [[Timothy Leary]], or [[Robert Anton Wilson]]; or that the book and Malaclypse the Younger were both fictional inventions of Robert Anton Wilson, as with [[Abdul Alhazred]]'s ''[[Necronomicon]]''.

==Biography==
Gregory H. Hill was born in California on Wednesday, May 21, 1941. He worked for Western Union while a young man in the Southern California area of Whittier, California.&lt;ref name="kt_hill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kerrythornley.com/greghill/ |title=Greg Hill |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1958 or 1959 while still a teenager, he, Kerry Thornley and others began working on the Discordian religion.&lt;ref name="kt_hill"/&gt;

In 1965, the first edition of Principia Discordia was printed, allegedly in five copies. The most famous edition was the fourth.

Hill spent much of his life working for Bank of America as a computer programmer, and moved to the San Francisco Bay area. He had apparently visited there while a child.&lt;ref name="kt_hill"/&gt;

Robert Anton Wilson stated, in the lecture "The I in the Triangle" from 1990, that Greg Hill was at the time the head of a large computer facility owned by one of the largest banks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;'The I in the Triangle', lecture by Robert Anton Wilson in 1990 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9h2eNHB4vY Video of the lecture (duration: 1:56:25)]&lt;!--this needs to be replaced with a cite video template by someone that watches the video, making a reference to the exact minute where this is said --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A designer of one of the early video games, Hill wrote about computers including editing a computer-oriented newsletter. He also published an article proposing using a computer to transmit signals to remotely control robots.&lt;ref name="kt_hill"/&gt;

He was married to Jeanetta; they later separated and may have divorced.&lt;ref name="kt_hill"/&gt;

He died in the San Francisco Bay area of California on the July 20, 2000.  A long-time smoker, he died of cancer.&lt;ref name="kt_hill"/&gt;

In 1994, he and [[Kerry Thornley|Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]] were inducted into the Order of the Pineapple.&lt;ref name="pineapple_thornley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://op.loveshade.org/members.html|title=Order of the Pineapple: Honored Members|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Hill described Mal-2 as a spirit sent into him by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] that helped him write the ''Principia Discordia'' over the course of ten years in his early adulthood. An interview included in the fourth edition of the ''Principia Discordia'' by [[Loompanics]] Press reveals that Mal-2 left once the book was finished. He claims Mal-2 returned to leave a fifth and final edition consisting solely of a Western Union telegraph form filled with the letter "M". Greg Hill also reveals that he had access to Western Union forms when he worked at Western Union.

==''Principia Discordia''==
In 2006, a copy of the first edition of the ''Principia Discordia'' was claimed to have been discovered in the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection]] in the National Archives, proving Malaclypse the Younger to be Gregory Hill.&lt;ref&gt;The complete document may be found here:[http://appendix.23ae.com/pd1/07.html], and the entry in the JFK Assassination Archive here {{cite web|url=http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path%3Djfksnew.txt%26id%3Ddemo%26pass%3D%26OK%3DOK |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917155729/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }} by searching for "Kerry Thornley". The document is titled "Discordian Socity" (sic).&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessing many titles, including "Omnibenevolent Polyfather of Virginity in Gold", Malaclypse's true identity or position within the Erisian religion is completely unknown. He is frequently mentioned in the ''Principia Discordia''. Credited with wiring telegrams to God from the Celestial Hotel and decrying the usefulness of prayer, these claims are in the nature of the ''Principia Discordia''.

Very little is known about Malaclypse the Elder, the namesake of Mal-2. The ''Principia Discordia'' merely mentions him as a "non-prophet" and that he was mistaken for a doomsayer when carrying a sign that read "DUMB."

==''Illuminatus!''==
Malaclypse the Younger also appears in ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'' by [[Robert Shea]] and Robert Anton Wilson. According to ''Illuminatus!'', he founded the [[Norton Cabal]], and then left the cabal to join the very esoteric Erisian Liberation Front. The character Dr. Ignotum P. Ignotius says the last thing Mal-2 wrote before he left for the ELF was, "Everybody understands [[Mickey Mouse]]. Few understand [[Hermann Hesse]]. Hardly anyone understands [[Albert Einstein]]. And nobody understands [[Emperor Norton]]."  This is the slogan of the Joshua Norton Cabal of San Francisco.

Malaclypse the Elder has an even larger role in ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''. In fact, he is an important shape-shifting character in the book, posing as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Billy Graham]], and [[the Devil]]. According to Malaclypse the Elder himself, he is a 4th century B.C. Erisian priest (who was also prepared to perform services to [[Hermes]], [[Dionysus]], [[Heracles]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Athena]], and [[Hera]]) who achieved "transcendental illumination" in the course of the massacre at [[Milos|Melos]] in 415 BC. The [[Illuminati]] believe that death releases a certain form of energy. Given enough death and a person intent on capturing said energy, a person may be transformed into an immortal, immaterial being, or so the plot element goes. Malaclypse the Elder also posed as [[Jesus]] after Jesus was crucified. In the form of Jesus, he introduced [[Bingo (US)|Bingo]], but asked Luke to not record it.

'''Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner''' (April 9, 1818 – December 17, 1913) was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and a [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon pioneer]]. One of the plural wives of [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Brigham Young]], Lightner is credited with rescuing papers that were later published as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] from [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] mobs.

==Early life==
Mary Elizabeth Rollins was born April 9, 1818, in [[Lima, New York]], to John D. Rollins and Keziah Keturah Van Benthuysen. She was one of three children. Her father died in a shipwreck on [[Lake Ontario]] when she was a child.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; In 1828, she and her family moved to [[Kirtland, Ohio]], to live with her uncle [[Algernon Sidney Gilbert]].&lt;ref name="women"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Susan Easton|author2=Woodger, Mary Jane|title=Women of Character|date=2011|publisher=Covenant Communications|location=American Fork, Utah|isbn=9781680470185|pages=192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived there for two years.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; 

During that time, they learned about the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints| church]] established by Joseph Smith. She was [[baptism|baptized]] into the church in October 1830. She was lent a [[Book of Mormon]] by [[Isaac Morley]] for one night. She and her family stayed up late reading it, and she had memorized the first verse by morning. When she went to give the book back to Morley, he was impressed at how much she had read and he let her keep it until she finished.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; At the time she read the Book of Mormon, Mary was eleven years old.&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith|last1=Newell|first1=Linda King|last2=Avery|first2=Valeen Tippetts|date=1994|edition=2|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=1325 S Oak St, Champain, IL 61820|isbn=978-0-252-06291-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjHEhhqVu1UC|access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} Shortly after she finished reading the Book of Mormon, [[Joseph Smith]] moved to Kirtland&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; in February 1831.&lt;ref name="compton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Compton|first1=Todd|title=In sacred loneliness: The plural wives of Joseph Smith|date=1996|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=9781560850854|pages=205–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was brought to her home and she received a blessing from him by the [[laying on of hands]].&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rollins Lightner|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Autobiography of Mary E. Lightner|journal=The Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine|date=July 1926|volume=17|url=http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/MLightner.html|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jackson County==
In the fall of 1831, she and her family left Kirtland for [[Independence, Missouri]]. Here Mary experienced the [[Spiritual gift|interpretation of tongues]]. She interpreted several sermons from other languages.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; She started working for [[Peter Whitmer Sr.]] as a [[seamstress]]. She met [[Lilburn Boggs|Governor Lilburn Boggs]] while working for Whitmer. Boggs tried to convince Mary to leave the church and live with them, but she refused. She recorded that many people persecuted members of the church in Missouri. Mobs destroyed their houses and set fire to their crops. She witnessed the [[tarring and feathering]] of [[Edward Partridge]].&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; 

===Saving papers===
Mary also witnessed the tearing down of the [[printing press]] in Independence on July 20, 1833.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; She watched as a mob tore down the building and threw pages of the [[Book of Commandments]] into the streets. She and her sister grabbed armfuls of the paper, despite the mob pursuing them. They hid in a cornfield until the mob passed. They turned over the papers to Sister Phelps, the wife of [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]]. Later, some of the pages were bound and given to Mary.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; They were later published as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]].&lt;ref name="Printing press"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ricks|first1=Kellene|title=Caroline and Mary Elizabeth Rollins|journal=[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]|date=March 1990|url=//www.lds.org/liahona/1990/03/caroline-and-mary-elizabeth-rollins|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the church were forced to leave Independence and went to [[Clay County, Missouri]], where Mary began teaching children how to read and write. She taught for two years. Her mother remarried, and Mary lived with her uncle Gilbert until he died in 1834. During this time, she also witnessed the expedition of [[Zion's Camp]],&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; and was reunited with Joseph Smith again. Smith later commented to Mary that in 1834 he received a revelation to marry her as a [[plural wife]]. But because of physical separation and distance, Smith did not pursue the marriage.&lt;ref name="remember wives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Rollins Lightner|url=http://wivesofjosephsmith.org/09-MaryRollinsLightner.htm|website=Remembering the Wives of Joseph Smith|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Far West==
Mary Rollins was married to Adam Lightner on August 11, 1835. He was not a Latter Day Saint. They would go on to have ten children. They moved to [[Far West, Missouri]], to open a store. The couple's first son, Miles Henry, was born in 1836. Towards the end of 1837, they moved to [[Milford, Missouri]], just outside of Far West, to open another branch of the store. They faced persecution in Milford as well. She and her husband were requested to meet with a mob and their leader, a General Clark. They were told that Governor Boggs was going to destroy the city, but that he requested her family and another be safely evacuated first. Mary refused to leave everyone else behind. The next day, the mob took Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith]] but did not harm Far West.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;

Mary and her family went to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to visit Adam's brother, leaving their possessions in Far West. They rented a house there for six months. She was offered work as a seamstress, but refused because the pay was too low. She painted some pictures and sold them, and would go on to give many painting lessons to earn money.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;

==Nauvoo==
Although her family struggled financially, the Lightners traveled through [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on their way to rejoin the Latter Day Saints in [[Alton, Illinois]], where Mary's brother Henry was. On their trip, she taught painting lessons to a woman on board the boat. Mary continued giving painting lessons and found acceptable work as a seamstress when they moved to [[Farmington, Illinois]], where they stayed for two years. They lost their money when their bank failed, and they went to live with Mary's stepfather, Mr. Burt.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;

While their family moved many times, Mary often found work as a seamstress and a painting teacher. Some of her students included [[Julia Murdock Smith]] and Sarah Ann Whitney. The Latter Day Saints left the area of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. Before leaving, Mary recounts that Joseph Smith came to her family and her brother's family and told them to be rebaptized. All were baptized except her husband, who was not a member. Adam said that he did not feel worthy.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;{{rp|150}} In February 1842, Mary was [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]] to Joseph Smith as a [[plural marriage|plural wife]]. In 1843, she was accepted into the women's [[Relief Society]] of Nauvoo.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

==Pontoosuc==
Their family moved to [[Pontoosuc, Illinois]]. Joseph Smith was upset by this and told Mary that if they left the church, they would suffer hardships. Her son George died.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; Mary had her fourth child in May 1843. Shortly after, she became ill with "inflammation of the bowels". She stayed in bed, and woke up once to find everyone in her household lying on the floor as if they were dead. While she was in bed, lightning had struck the house. She and all members of the family eventually recovered.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; 

Men from Pontoosuc sought to kill Joseph Smith in June 1844. They made Mary make a flag for their company. While she refused, they threatened her and she made the flag. This group was part of the mob that attacked [[Carthage Jail]], which resulted in the [[death of Joseph Smith]] and his brother Hyrum. Mary's family was kept in Pontoosuc for three months and robbed of many of their possessions by these men.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; 
Mary became sick again, and doctors said that she would die shortly. She felt the urge to go to Nauvoo to get a blessing from [[Alpheus Cutler]], who worked in the [[Nauvoo Temple]].&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; Her friends and family feared that the trip would kill her, but she insisted on going. She did make it to Nauvoo and received a blessing and felt better within two weeks.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; 

Mary received her [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] in the Nauvoo Temple on January 30, 1845.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; While earning money to make the trip to the temple, she was sewing and got half of a needle stuck in her arm, which doctors couldn't remove in June 1847.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Previously, in the fall of 1844, [[Brigham Young]] and [[Heber C. Kimball]] offered themselves as proxy husbands to widows of Joseph Smith. Mary accepted the offer from Young, and she and Young were sealed on May 22, 1845, in the temple.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

==Living in the North==
After having another son in February 1848, she took a job as a tailor. Her husband had a harder time finding work, and they were offered a job maintaining a hotel in [[St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin]]. There Adam and their baby became very sick. Mary's leg swelled and she almost had her leg amputated. She records that she prayed for God to spare her limb. While living there, a man stopped by her house and offered her a medicine that would supposedly heal anything. Uninterested, but in an attempt to get the man to leave, she, her husband and her aunt tasted the medicine. She even gave some to her children. Within moments, they all became ill and two of her children died. The man had given them poison.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; The man was caught by authorities, but Mary begged them not to hang him. They were going to put the man on trial, but he escaped and was never tried.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; 

The family bought a 65-acre farm near [[Lake St. Croix Beach, Minnesota|Lake St. Croix, Minnesota]]. However, they faced many hardships and several of their horses died. They accepted a job keeping a three-story hotel in [[Willow River, Minnesota]], and stayed for two years.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Mary left to take care of her sister Caroline who was sick and lived in Farmington in 1853; her sister died five weeks later. Mary took some of Caroline's children home with her to raise them. The family later moved to [[Maine]] in 1854 and opened their own boarding house.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; They lost their property in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;
After suffering so many losses, Mary convinced her husband that they should rejoin the Latter Day Saints.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

==Traveling westward==
After their hotel failed, they moved back to Missouri to [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]]. After staying only a year, they returned to Minnesota where their tenth child, Adam, was born on October 28, 1862. they boarded the "Canada" headed for St. Louis on May 25, 1863 and began traveling westward. They were faced by threats from soldiers, Indians and plagues of sickness. They reached [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and met up with other Latter Day Saints from [[England]], [[South Africa]], and [[Denmark]]. They traveled across the plains in a wagon company.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; They arrived in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah on September 15, 1863.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

==Minersville==
The Lightners settled [[Minersville, Utah]]. In 1869, the [[Relief Society]] was organized there, and Mary was called to be its president.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Mary's mother died in 1877, and Brigham Young died later that same year.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; After 1880, Adam was unable to find work.&lt;ref name="deseret bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turley Jr.|first1=Richard E.|title=Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner (1818–1913)|url=http://seek.deseretbook.com/richard-e-turley-jr-mary-elizabeth-rollins-lightner-1818-1913/i|website=Seek|publisher=Deseret Book|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary wrote to [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] in September 1881, reporting that she needed financial assistance. In August 1884, Mary went to Salt Lake City to ask for help in person.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; Adam became ill and died on August 19, 1885. He never joined the church.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; He left Mary with over $100 in debt.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; Shortly after her husband's death, Mary's son was convicted of [[grand larceny]]. She worked hard to get her son Adam Jr. out of jail; he was released in June 1886. He died four years later.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; 

Mary lived the rest of her life destitute.&lt;ref name="deseret bio" /&gt; She may have suffered [[depression (mood)|depression]]. She traveled occasionally to Salt Lake City.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; She relied on the church to receive money since she was one of Joseph Smith's widows. She did speak at meetings, sharing her life experiences about the early days of the church and her testimony.&lt;ref name="deseret bio" /&gt; Mary spoke at the graduation ceremony at [[Brigham Young University]] on April 14, 1905. She was promised by [[Heber C. Kimball]] before his death that she would see Joseph Smith again during her lifetime. In 1905, she shared that she had been visited by Smith after his death.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; Mary Rollins Lightner died on December 17, 1913,&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; in Minersville.&lt;ref name="defining wife" /&gt; At the time of her death, she was the last surviving plural wife of Smith.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

==Marriage==
Mary claimed that Smith had a private conversation with her in 1831, when she was only 12. He told her that she "was the first woman God commanded him to take as a plural wife."&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;{{rp|65}} He approached her in 1834 again; however, she married Adam Lightner on August 11, 1835. She admitted later that she had had dreams of being Smith's wife. She reported that Smith told her that an [[angel]] threatened to take away his life unless he followed God's instruction to practice [[plural marriage]].&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;{{rp|100–101}} He also predicted that her husband would not join the church and, therefore, she needed to be [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]] to a [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] holder.&lt;ref name="defining wife"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Jeffrey Ogden|title=Determining and Defining 'Wife': The Brigham Young Households|journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|date=May 1986|pages=57–67|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V20N03_59.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary would not marry Smith until she had received a witness from God for herself. She prayed about the proposal, and reported that she saw an angel pass through her room.&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;{{rp|100–101}} Smith then told her that certain events would take place in her life, and they did. Mary consented to be married to Smith, although the sealing did not cancel her marriage to Adam.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; She was the sixth of Smith's plural wives.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt; They were sealed in February 1842 by [[Brigham Young]]. At the time, Mary was pregnant with her son George.&lt;ref name="Mormon polyandry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Wagoner|first1=Richard S.|title=Mormon Polyandry in Nauvoo|journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|date=1983|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V18N03_69.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}}&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Mary mentions that her husband was away at the time of her sealing to Smith, so Adam's consent or knowledge is unclear.&lt;ref name="mormon delusion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitefield|first1=John|title=The Mormon Delusion: The Truth Behind Polygamy and Secret Polyandry|date=2012|isbn=9781409259046|edition=1|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRcMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's first wife, [[Emma Smith]], knew about the marriage.&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;{{rp|151}} Mary later reported that she knew that Smith had other children by his plural wives.&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;{{rp|98}} Mary signed an [[affidavit]] in 1902 to document her sealing to Smith.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

After Joseph Smith's death in 1844, Mary was sealed to Brigham Young. The sealing was performed in the [[Nauvoo Temple]] on May 22, 1845. Mary recorded, "I was also sealed to Brigham Young as proxy for Joseph."&lt;ref name="defining wife" /&gt; When Mary lived in Minersville, she records that Young stopped by to visit. She wrote to him and updated him on how her family was doing throughout her life. Through correspondence letters between Mary and [[Eliza R. Snow]], it appears that Mary knew and was friendly towards other plural wives of Young.&lt;ref name="compton" /&gt;

'''Nirad Chandra Chaudhuri''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (23 November 1897 – 1 August 1999) was an Indian English-language writer.

Chaudhuri authored numerous works in English and Bengali. His oeuvre provides a magisterial appraisal of the histories and cultures of India, especially in the context of British colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries. Chaudhuri is best known for ''[[The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian]]'', published in 1951. Over the course of his literary career, he received numerous accolades for his writing. In 1966, ''[[The Continent of Circe]]'' was awarded the [[Duff Cooper Prize|Duff Cooper Memorial Award]], making Chaudhuri the first and only Indian to date to be given the prize. The [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's national Academy of Letters, awarded Chaudhuri the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for his biography on [[Max Müller]], ''Scholar Extraordinary''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1990, [[Oxford University]] awarded Chaudhuri, by then a long-time resident of the city of [[Oxford]], an Honorary Degree in Letters. In 1992, he was made an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Biography==
Chaudhuri was born in [[Kishoreganj District|Kishoregunj]], [[Mymensingh]], East Bengal, British India (now Bangladesh), the second of eight children of Upendra Narayan Chaudhuri, a lawyer, and of Sushila Sundarani Chaudhurani. His parents were liberal middle-class Hindus who belonged to the [[Brahmo Samaj]] movement.

Chaudhuri was educated in [[Kishorganj]] and [[Kolkata]] (then, Calcutta). For his FA (school-leaving) course he attended [[Surendranath College|Ripon College]] in Calcutta along with the famous [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]]. Following this, he attended [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]], where he studied history as his undergraduate major. He graduated with honors in history and topped the [[University of Calcutta]] merit list. At Scottish Church College, Calcutta, he attended the seminars of the noted historian, Professor [[Kalidas Nag]]. After graduation, he enrolled for the M.A. at the University of Calcutta. However, he did not attend all of his final exams, and consequently was not able to complete his M.A.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[File:Chaudhuri blue plaque, Oxford.JPG|thumb|right|The blue plaque for Nirad Chaudhuri in Lathbury Road, [[North Oxford]].&lt;ref name="blue-plaque" /&gt;]]
After his studies, he took a position as a clerk in the Accounting Department of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]]. At the same time, he started contributing articles to popular magazines. His first article on [[Bharat Chandra]] (a famous Bengali poet of the 18th century) appeared in the most prestigious English magazine of the time, ''[[Modern Review (Calcutta)|Modern Review]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Chaudhuri left his position in the Accounting Department shortly after, and started a new career as a journalist and editor. During this period he was a boarder in Mirzapur Street near College Square, Kolkata, living together with the writers Bibhuti Bhushan Banerjee and Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder. He was involved in the editing of the then well-known English and Bengali magazines ''Modern Review'', ''[[Prabasi]]'' and ''[[Sonibarer Chithi]]''. In addition, he also founded two short-lived but highly esteemed Bengali magazines, ''Samasamayik'' and ''Notun Patrika''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1932, he married Amiya Dhar, a well-known writer herself; the couple had three sons.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1938, Chaudhuri obtained a job as secretary to [[Sarat Chandra Bose]], a political leader in the freedom movement in India. As a result, he was able to interact with political leaders of India: [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and the brother of Sarat Chandra Bose, [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] (also known as Netaji). A growing familiarity with the workings of the inner circle of Indian politics led him to be skeptical about its eventual progress, and he became progressively disillusioned about the ability of Indian political leadership.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Apart from his career as a secretary, Chaudhuri continued to contribute articles in Bengali and English to newspapers and magazines. He was also appointed as a political commentator on the Kolkata branch of the [[All India Radio]]. In 1941, he started working for the Delhi Branch of the All India Radio.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Chaudhuri was a prolific writer even in the very last years of his life, publishing his last work at the age of 99. His wife Amiya Chaudhuri died in 1994 in [[Oxford]], England. He too died in Oxford, three months short of his 102nd birthday, in 1999. He lived at 20 Lathbury Road&lt;ref name="symonds"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Changing Faces of North Oxford | volume=Book One | publisher=[[Robert Boyd Publications]] | last=Symonds | first=Ann Spokes| chapter=The Chaudhuris | page=90 | year=1997 | isbn=1-899536-25-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1982 until his death and a [[blue plaque]] was installed by the [[Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="blue-plaque"&gt;{{cite book| first=Elizabeth Jean |last=Warr | title=The Oxford Plaque Guide | publisher=The History Press| location=Stroud, Gloucestershire | year=2011| isbn=978-0-7524-5687-4 | pages=34–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student historian Dipayan Pal wrote of Nirad C. Chaudhuri in [[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]] in 2016:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pal  |first=Dipayan |date=19 May 2016 |title=An unknown Bengali in Oxfordshire |url=https://www.thestatesman.com/supplements/an-unknown-bengali-in-oxfordshire-143281.html |newspaper=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Why was he always in love with England, though he had never visited the land before the age of 57? These questions perplexed  me and the only answer I could decipher is that perhaps Nirad Chaudhuri was in search of a home that he could call his own.

And perhaps this street in 1980s took him closer to the novels of Hardy and Austen. Lovers of literature not only see texts through their lives but also sculpt live through the texts they read.  His textual affinity was coupled with the colonial aura he grew up with- we must remember that he spent his first 50 years in an empire where the sun never set.

His England was a realisation of certain dominant sensibilities and visions he idealised but they were far from reality. Places like 20, Lathbury road makes me wonder why people choose to migrate and why certain places receive more sanctity than others. For Nirad Chaudhuri, England was sacred and for some America is. The solution to this onerous puzzle cannot be found in better living standard or socio-economic conditions of higher wages.

Furthermore, certain places celebrate certain people. Nirad Chaudhuri would have been immensely happy if he knew about the blue plaque as it would fit his sensibilities perfectly. Even Oxford County Council was happy enough to remember this “an original thinker, forthright in his opinions and an internationalist, in the sense of one who embraces the best of all cultures but never loses his own.}}

==Major works==
His masterpiece, ''[[The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian]]'', published in 1951, put him on the long list of great Indian writers. He courted controversy in the newly independent India due to the dedication of the book, which ran thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
To the memory of the British Empire in India,
Which conferred subjecthood upon us,
But withheld citizenship.
To which yet every one of us threw out the challenge:
"Civis Britannicus sum"
Because all that was good and living within us
Was made, shaped and quickened
By the same British rule.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dedication, which was actually a mock-imperial rhetoric, infuriated many Indians, particularly the political and bureaucratic establishment. "The wogs took the bait and having read only dedication sent up howls of protest", commented Chaudhuri's friend, editor, historian and novelist, [[Khushwant Singh]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Chaudhuri was hounded out of government service, deprived of his pension, blacklisted as a writer in India and forced to live a life of penury. Furthermore, he had to give up his job as a political commentator in All India Radio as the [[Government of India]] promulgated a law that prohibited employees from publishing memoirs. Chaudhuri argued that his critics were not careful-enough readers; "the dedication was really a condemnation of the British rulers for not treating us as equals", he wrote in a 1997 special edition of ''[[Granta]]''.&lt;ref name="Granta"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaudhuri|first1=Nirad|title=India! The Golden Jubilee [Granta 57]|date=1997|publisher=Granta|isbn=9780140141474|pages=209–210|edition=Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, to demonstrate what exactly he had been trying to say, he drew on a parallel with [[Ancient Rome]]. The book's dedication, Chaudhuri observed, "was an imitation of what [[Cicero]] said about the conduct of [[Verres]], a Roman proconsul of [[Sicily]] who oppressed Sicilian Roman citizens, who in their desperation cried out: "''[[Civis romanus sum]]''".&lt;ref name="Granta"/&gt;

In 1955, the [[British Council]] and the [[BBC]] jointly made arrangements to take Chaudhuri to England for eight weeks. He was asked to contribute lectures to the BBC, and wrote eight of these. His impressions of England and Europe were later collected in ''A Passage to England''. ''[[The Continent of Circe]]'', published in 1965, traces Chaudhuri's doggedly independent-minded ideas on the social, geo-political, and historical aspects of sub-continental India across millennia. An extended sequel to his famous autobiography, titled ''[[Thy Hand, Great Anarch!]]'' was published in 1988. His last book ''[[Three Horsemen of the New Apocalypse]]'', published in 1997, coincided with his hundredth year.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Social views and writing style==
Although he was highly critical of the [[post-independence Congress party]] establishment, Chaudhuri was more sympathetic to the right-wing Hindu nationalist movement in India. He refused to criticise the destruction of mosques: “Muslims do not have the slightest right to complain about the [[Demolition of Babri Masjid|desecration]] of one mosque in [[Ayodhya]]. From 1000 AD every temple from Kathiawar to Bihar, from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas has been sacked and ruined. Not one temple was left standing all over northern India. They escaped destruction only where Muslim power did not gain access to them for reasons such as dense forests. Otherwise, it was a continuous spell of vandalism. No nation with any self-respect will forgive this. What happened in Ayodhya would not have happened had the Muslims acknowledged this historical argument even once.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/287210/Ram-ki-Nagri-once-again.html Ram ki Nagri, once again] ''[[Daily Pioneer]]'' – 3 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaudhuri was also deeply distressed by what he saw as the deep hypocrisy in Bengali social life and in particular those that resulted from class and [[caste]] distinctions. His historical research revealed to him that the rigid Victorianesque morality of middle class Bengali women was a socially enforced construct, that had less to do with religion, [[choice]] and [[judgment]], but more to do with upbringing, social acceptance and intergenerational transference of values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

His prose was highly influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and the older version of the Bengali language, the ''[[Shadhubhasha]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He had little respect for the [[proletarian]] language, ''Choltibhasha'' (চলতিভাষা ) or ''Cholitobhasha'' (চলিতভাষা), which he regarded as being common in taste and scope. He avoided the use of words and very common expressions originating from [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] in modern Bengali.

==Controversies==
Nirad C Chaudhuri is accused of being in secret connivance with the British and leaked information about the whereabouts of Sarat Chandra Bose. This may have led to arrest of Sarat Bose in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Netaji-kin-want-Nirad-files/articleshow/19099792.cms | title=Netaji kin want Nirad files}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. Radha Nag (রাধা নাগ) showed the conflict of the 'writer' Nirad C with the 'person' Niradbabu in her Bengali book আত্মঘাতী নীরদ চৌধুরী 'Atmaghati Nirad Choudhuri'(Suicidal Nirad Choudhuri).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Paparazzi''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|p|ɑː|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|t|s|i}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|p|æ|p|ə|ˈ|r|æ|t|s|i}}; {{IPA-it|papaˈrattsi|lang}}; singular: masculine '''paparazzo''' or feminine '''paparazza''') are independent [[photographer]]s who take pictures of high-profile people, such as [[Sportsperson|athletes]], [[entertainer]]s, [[politician]]s, and other [[celebrity|celebrities]], typically while subjects go about their usual life routines. Paparazzi tend to make a living by selling their photographs to [[mass media|media outlets]] focusing on [[tabloid journalism]] and [[sensationalism]] (such as [[gossip magazine]]s).

== Description ==
Paparazzi tend to be [[independent contractor]]s, unaffiliated with [[mainstream media]] organizations, and photos taken are usually done so by taking advantage of opportunities when they have sightings of high-profile people they are tracking.&lt;ref name=AJR&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=2325 |title= Is Everyone a Journalist? |work= [[American Journalism Review]] |date= October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts have described the behavior of paparazzi as synonymous with [[stalking]], and anti-stalking bills in many countries address the issue by reducing harassment of public figures and celebrities, especially with their [[minor (law)|children]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/24/local/la-me-pc-gov-brown-signs-law-protecting-children-of-public-figures-20130924|title=Gov.

== Etymology ==
A news photographer named Paparazzo (played by [[Walter Santesso]] in the 1960 film ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' directed by [[Federico Fellini]]) is the [[eponym]] of the word ''paparazzi''. In his book ''Word and Phrase'', Robert Hendrickson writes that Fellini took the name from an [[Italian language|Italian]] dialect word that describes a particularly annoying noise, that of a buzzing [[mosquito]]. As Fellini said in his interview to ''Time'' magazine, "''Paparazzo''&amp;nbsp;... suggests to me a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872287-1,00.html |title= The Press: Paparazzi on the Prowl |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= April 14, 1961 |volume=77 |issue=16 |accessdate= October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those versions of the word's origin are confirmed by ''[[Treccani]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite encyclopaedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/paparazzo/ |title=Paparazzo |encyclopaedia= [[Treccani]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most authoritative Italian encyclopaedia, but sometimes contested. For example, in the [[Abruzzese-Neapolitan|Abruzzo dialect]] spoken by [[Ennio Flaiano]], co-scriptwriter of ''La Dolce Vita'', the term ''paparazzo'' refers to the local clam, ''[[Venerupis decussata]]'', and is also used as a metaphor for the shutter of a camera lens.

Further, in an interview with Fellini's screenwriter Flaiano, he said the name came from the book ''Sulla riva dello Jonio'' (1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite book |last=Gissing |first=George Robert |authorlink=George Gissing |title=Sulla riva dello Ionio.

He further states that either Fellini or Flaiano opened the book at random, saw the name of a restaurant owner, Coriolano Paparazzo, and decided to use it for the photographer.

By the late 1960s, the word, usually in the Italian plural form ''paparazzi'', had entered English as a generic term for intrusive photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.word-origins.com/definition/paparazzi.html |work= Word Origins and History |title= Paparazzi |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220005135/http://www.word-origins.com/definition/paparazzi.html |archivedate= December 20, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who has been photographed by the paparazzi is said to have been "papped".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pap|title=pap - definition of pap in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|accessdate=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
Due to the reputation of paparazzi as a nuisance, several states and countries restrict their activities by passing laws and [[curfew]]s,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and by staging events in which paparazzi are specifically not allowed to take photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= AB 2479 Bill Analysis |first= Ellen M. |last= Corbett |url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_2451-2500/ab_2479_cfa_20100628_125856_sen_comm.html |access-date= September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= SB 465 Summary |url= http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2013/Bills/SB465_.HTM |access-date= September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= How Princess Diana Changed the Way Paparazzi Pursue Kate Middleton |first= Danna |last= Harman |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2011/0429/How-Princess-Diana-changed-the-way-paparazzi-pursue-Kate-Middleton |work= [[Christian Science Monitor]] |access-date= September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= French Paparazzi Laws Favor Celebrities: Jolie, Pitt Latest Couple to Benefit |first= Angela |last= Doland |url= http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2004470054_brangelina11.html |work= [[Seattle Times]] |access-date= September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, celebrity news organizations are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Taking a Shot at Paparazzi |last= Lowry |first= Brian |date= August 6, 2013 |url= https://search.proquest.com/docview/1429233078|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |volume= 320 |issue= 17 |pages= |access-date= September 30, 2013 |registration= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect the children of celebrities, California passed a new bill in September 2013. The purpose of the bill is to stop paparazzi from taking pictures of children in a [[Harassment|harassing]] manner, regardless of who their parents are. This law increased the penalty on harassment and the penalty for harassment of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McGreevy |first= Patrick |title= Gov.

In 1972, paparazzo photographer [[Ron Galella]] sued [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] after the former First Lady ordered her Secret Service agents to destroy Galella's camera and film following an encounter in New York City's [[Central Park]]. Kennedy counter-sued claiming harassment. The trial lasted three weeks and became a groundbreaking case regarding photojournalism and the role of paparazzi. In ''Galella v. Onassis'', Kennedy obtained a restraining order to keep Galella {{convert|150|ft|m}} away from her and her children. The restriction later was dropped to {{convert|25|ft|m}}. The trial is a focal point in ''[[Smash His Camera]]'', a 2010 documentary film by director [[Leon Gast]].

In 1997, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and [[Dodi Fayed]] were [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|killed in a limousine crash]] as their driver was speeding, trying to escape paparazzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/504736/Princess-Diana-Security-DIY-Car-Crash-Paris |title= Policeman who Spoke to Dying Princess Diana Blasts 'DIY' Security who Failed to Stop Crash |access-date= November 11, 2014 |last1= Allen |first1= Peter |date= August 29, 2014 |work= Express |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/31/newsid_2510000/2510615.stm |publisher= [[BBC]] |title= 1997: Princess Diana Dies in Paris Crash |access-date= November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inquest jury investigated the involvement of paparazzi in the incident, and although several paparazzi were taken into custody, no one was convicted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- That several paparazzi were taken into custody probably isn't common knowledge, so needs a citation, although the facts that paparazzi were investigated and none were convicted probably is common knowledge and therefore doesn't need a citation. --&gt; The official inquests into the accident attributed the causes to the speed and manner of driving of the Mercedes, as well as the following vehicles, and the impairment of the judgment of the Mercedes driver, [[Henri Paul]], through alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottbaker_inquests.gov.uk/evidence/docs/inquisition_diana.pdf |title=Jury verdict - Inquisition forms: Princess Diana of Wales |website=Coroner's Inquests into the Deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090607230257/http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/evidence/docs/inquisition_diana.pdf |archive-date=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the ''[[Oriental Daily News]]'' of Hong Kong was found guilty of "scandalizing the court", an extremely rare law that the newspaper's conduct would undermine confidence in the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="WorldLII"&gt;{{cite court | |litigants= Wong Yeung Ng v.

The paper had also arranged for a "dog team" (slang for paparazzi in the Chinese language) to track a judge for 72 hours, to provide the judge with first-hand experience of what paparazzi do.&lt;ref name="ODN"&gt;{{cite journal |first= Tim |last= Hamlett |date= July–December 2011 |title= Scandalising the Scumbags: The Secretary for Justice vs the Oriental Press Group |url= http://www.uow.edu.au/crearts/journalism/APME/contents11/TimHamlett.pdf |format= PDF |journal= AsiaPacific MediaEducator |volume= |issue= 11 |pages= 20–33 |access-date= August 20, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060518072905/http://www.uow.edu.au/crearts/journalism/APME/contents11/TimHamlett.pdf |archive-date= May 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Style &amp; Design special issue in 2005 ran a story entitled "Shooting Star", in which Mel Bouzad, one of the top paparazzi in Los Angeles at the time, claimed to have made US$150,000 for a picture of [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] in Georgia after their breakup. "If I get a picture of [[Britney Spears|Britney]] and her baby," Bouzad claimed, "I'll be able to buy a house in those hills (above [[Sunset Boulevard]])."&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |title= Shooting Stars |url= http://www.time.com/time/2005/style/091305/shooting_stars_paparazz39a.html |access-date= June 16, 2006 |work= Time |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20051226032035/http://www.time.com/time/2005/style/091305/shooting_stars_paparazz39a.html |archive-date= December 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paparazzi'' author Peter Howe told ''Time'' that "celebrities need a higher level of exposure than the rest of us so it is a two-way street. The celebrities manipulate."

In 2006, [[Daniella Cicarelli]] went through a scandal when a paparazzo caught video footage of her having sex with her boyfriend on a beach in Spain, which was posted on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/mat/2006/09/28/285875345.asp Justiça mantém liminar que obriga sites a tirar vídeo de Cicarelli com namorado do ar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308025739/http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/mat/2006/09/28/285875345.asp |date=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After fighting in the court, it was decided in her favor, causing YouTube to be blocked in Brazil. This caused major havoc among Brazilians, including threatening a [[boycott]] against [[MTV Brasil]] unless Cicarelli was fired from that company.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The block only lasted a few days, and Cicarelli was not dismissed. The legal action backfired as the court decided she had no [[expectation of privacy]] by having sex in a public location.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The [[E!]] network program ''[[Celebrities Uncensored]]'' used often-confrontational footage of celebrities made by paparazzi.

Following the publication of photographs showing [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] sunbathing whilst topless at her husband's cousin's ([[David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley|Viscount Linley]]'s) holiday home in France, it was announced on September 14, 2012, that the Royal couple were to launch legal action against the French edition of [[Closer (magazine)|''Closer'']] magazine. It was the first time that a senior royal has sued in a court outside the UK. The reason cited for the legal action is that the Duchess had a right of privacy whilst at the home—the magazine responded that the pictures had been taken from the public highway. The injunction was granted September 18, 2012 and the publishers of the magazine were ordered not to publish the photographs in France and not to sell the images. The publishers were also ordered to hand over the original material of the published pictures under threat of a €10,000 fine for every day delay in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mrpaparazzi.com |title= mrpaparazzi.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216110716/http://www.mrpaparazzi.com/ |archive-date= February 16, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[Sienna Miller]], [[Amy Winehouse]], and [[Lily Allen]] won injunctions that prevent the paparazzi from following them and gathering outside their houses. Miller was awarded £53,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/04/celebrities-paparazzi |title= Have Celebrities Finally Snapped? |newspaper= The Guardian |location= London |date= May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, rapper [[Kanye West]], facing assault charges for attacking a photojournalist, said he would fight to get the law changed so celebrities can profit from the paparazzi's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Kanye-West-demands-money-from-paparazzi/tabid/418/articleID/314523/Default.aspx |title= Kanye West Demands Money from Paparazzi |publisher= 3 News NZ |date= September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kanye-west-paparazzi-should-pay-2296723 |title= Kanye West: 'The Paparazzi Should Pay Me' |work= The Mirror |location= London |date= September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, he joined the WWWF, winning its [[WWE Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[WWWF United States Championship|United States Championship]].

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1959–1965) ===
When he was 17 years old, Morales trained under Barba Roja to become a wrestler and participated in a card held at New York in 1959, where he debuted by earning a victory over Howard LaVine, who performed under the pseudonym Buddy Gilbert, going on to participate in tag team matches and other stipulation matches throughout the tri state area the following year.&lt;ref name="page13"/&gt; The following two years, he made campaign in Virginia and North Carolina, particularly in the towns of Petersburg and Charlotte. Morales frequently wrestled fellow Puerto Rican [[Gypsy Joe]] in these cards, also earning wins over Jimmy Quinn, Don Savage and Sonny Fargo, while wrestling several local figures such as Swede Hanson, Laverne Baxter and Tony Nero. The following year, Morales began visiting several more states, often teaming with different Latin luchadores such as Pepper Gonzales and [[Gory Guerrero]], while holding loose feuds with a wrestler simply known as “The Viking” and Mark Starr.&lt;ref name="page13"/&gt; As a traveling performer, he amassed mixed results, with most of his victories taking place in British Columbia, where Morales defeated Tarzan Potvin, Tony Nero, Bud Rattal, Tommy O'Toole and Johnny Demchuk in a two-month period, before losing three challenges to Oliver Winrush. After a similar result in a short program with [[Hard Boiled Haggerty]], he had two draws against Allan Garfield, before defeating him on July 16, 1962.&lt;ref name="page13"/&gt; During the following months, Morales served as a midcarder, losing to several of the high-card talents but gaining wins over jobbers such as Poncho Pico, Sputnik Monroe and winning a three-fall match over Gypsy Biviano.&lt;ref name="page13"/&gt;

In August, Morales traveled to Texas and was involved in a series of matches with Jack and Jim Dalton, facing them along multiple tag team partners. After emerging victorious in a feud over Nelson Royal, he relocated to Washington, D.C. and Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he wrestled  Miguel Torres, [[Angelo Savoldi]] and [[Lou Albano]], while entering into a rivalry with Tony Altimore.&lt;ref name="page13"/&gt; It was here where he first teamed with [[Miguel Pérez (wrestler)|Miguel Pérez, Sr.]] and [[Argentina Apollo]], who were the first tag team champions recognized in the history of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF). Morales opened 1963 by performing in several tag team matches against [[Johnny Barend]] and Magnificent Maurice and returning to New York and New Jersey in a program along Gordo Chihuahua, who worked as enhancement talent. Later in the year, he formed a recurrent tag team with Perez and feuded with Pedro Rodriguez. In June, Morales joined [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Bobo Brazil]], Perez and Apollo to once again enter a storyline with Johnny Barend, who was now joined by Diamond Jack.&lt;ref name="page14"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Vittorio Apollo became his main stay tag team partner, along whom he challenged [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]], Johnny Barend and [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]]  on several dates. Morales finished the year by teaming with Pérez, earning three victories over the Fabulous Kangaroos.&lt;ref name="page14"/&gt; The team opened 1964 by feuding with [[Chris Tolos|Chris]] and [[John Tolos]], losing the first two encounters but winning the three-fall rubber match. Individually, Morales defeated Chuck Martoni, Arnold Skaaland and Prince Nero on several occasions.&lt;ref name="page14"/&gt;

The tag team next entered a feud with [[Dr. Jerry Graham|Jerry Graham]] and [[Luke Graham (wrestler)|Luke Graham]], losing several times before earning a win on September 19, 1964.&lt;ref name="page14"/&gt; The team also exchanged results against Hans &amp; Max Mortier. During this time frame, Morales picked singles wins over Frank Hickey, Chuck Martoni, Bobby Davis, Arnold Skaoland, Humberto Mercado, Matt Gilmore, Boris Malenko, Klondike Bill, Jose Quinteras, Magnificent Maurice, Bull Johnson and Luke Graham  while losing in matches against Wild Red Berry and Freddie Blassie. Morales then entered a double feud against Pedro Rodriguez and Gene Kiniski, dominating Rodriguez but losing to Kiniski.&lt;ref name="page14"/&gt; Along Pérez, he retook their feud with the Grahams, picking a second victory. In the final months of 1964, Morales also gained wins over Robert Duranton and Steve Stanlee.

=== Worldwide Wrestling Associates (1965–1968) ===
He opened 1965 by moving to [[Worldwide Wrestling Associates]] in California, an organization that had been created as a mirror to the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], where he engaged in multiple concurrent feuds, defeating The Executioner in his first match, before going on to defeat several wrestlers with similar characters by winning against The Axeman twice, El Verdugo and The Hangman on several occasions during the first three months of the year.&lt;ref name="page14"/&gt; Morales also experienced success in matches outside storyline, besting Jesse Rose, Charlie Kalani, Ruffy Colden, Billy Red Lyons, Kenny Yates, Don Savage, Luke Graham, Hard Boiled Haggarty, some of them more than two consecutive times. In March, he was involved in a program with Karl Von Stroheim, winning a series of matches against him and teaming with Mr. Moto and Luis Hernandez to win tag team matches that also included Kurt Von Stroheim.&lt;ref name="page15"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 1965, Morales defeated "The Destroyer" [[Dick Beyer]] to win the [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship (Los Angeles)|WWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in a three-fall match.&lt;ref name=ring&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/moralesbio.html|title=Hall of Fame: Pedro Morales|author= Steven Slagle|publisher=The Ring Chronicle|accessdate=2013-03-11|year=2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526141203/http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/moralesbio.html|archivedate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued earning singles victories over Horst Wessel, Kurt Von Stroheim, Al Marshall, Broadway Venus, Bill Cody and in a rematch against The Destroyer, while teaming along Hernandez to wrestle multiple combinations. He became involved in a feud against The Assassins and The Butcher, steadily gaining the upper hands both individually and in tag matches.&lt;ref name="page15"/&gt; Morales moved on from these angles and defeated Rod Orell, Billy Klutzer and The Mummy, before dropping the championship to Luke Graham on July 23, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Luke Graham|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/luke-graham.html|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales responded by defeating Graham in a three-fall chain match less than a month later, in the process winning a Brass Knuckles Championship. Meanwhile, his team with Hernandez won three consecutive matches against The Assassins by disqualification. Subsequently, a revival of his previous feuds with The Butcher and The Assassins became intertwined with the current involving Graham, leading to a series of matches featuring different combinations during the following months.&lt;ref name="page15"/&gt; Hernandez was eventually replaced by Adalberto Torres as Morales's tag team partner, along whom he also faced Gorilla Monsoon  and a variety of partners. On October 17, 1965, he defeated Graham to regain the WWA World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name="page15"/&gt; Morales went on to defeat Graham in two more rematches, scoring victories over Ox Anderson, Bandito Lopez and Jack Allen as well. Following a short series against El Mongol, he continued this pattern in matches involving Swede Karlsen, Baron Leone, Killer Karlson, The Golden Terror, Mark Lewin, [[Killer Karl Kox]] and Clyde Steeves.&lt;ref name="page15"/&gt; Morales also won a battle royale held in Fort Worth, Texas and brought closure to his feud with El Mongol by besting him on February 13, 1966. During this stage, he also changed tag team partners frequently, teaming with Better Boucher, Ramon Torres and Billy Red Lyons among others, gathering mixed results.&lt;ref name="page16"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final months before making a tour to Japan, Morales defeated Mark Lewin and Indio Joe, but also lost to Lyons and Mark Lewin. In his first show at Tokyo, he had a draw against Don Lewin.&lt;ref name="page16"/&gt; Morales continued this run by defeating Michiaki Yoshimura, Yoshino Sato, [[Tor Kamata|Mr. Moto]], Mitsu Hirai, [[Umanosuke Ueda]], tying against [[Kintaro Ohki|Kim Il]] in all of their encounters and losing only to [[Giant Baba]] by countout in singles.&lt;ref name="page16"/&gt; During this run, he teamed with Arman Hussein, Lewin, Wilbur Snyder, Lonnie Mayne &amp; Billy Two, among others, with the results being divided inequitable manner between wins, losses and draws.

Morales then teamed twice with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] in a draw and a win against Lars Anderson &amp; Killer Karl Kox, also teaming with Muraco one last time to defeat Koloff and Saito.&lt;ref name="page32"/&gt; On December 6, 1977, Morales wrestled Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, failing to win the belt. The following night he faced Race, Dick Murdoch, Baron Von Krupp and Mr. Sakuruda for the title, but was disqualified. To close the year, Morales earned singles victories over Buddy Roberts and Tank Patton.&lt;ref name="page32"/&gt; His team along Johnson opened the year by winning their first two matches, going on to defeat Koloff and Saito to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on January 24, 1978.&lt;ref name="page32"/&gt; Concurrently, Morales wrestled Anderson and divided honors in a series which included a win in the [[Superbowl of Wrestling]]. A feud with Killer Karl Kox ended in individual and team losses,  a streak which ended costing them the titles. After recovering with wins over Koloff and Saito, Morales and Johnson regained the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on February 14, 1978.&lt;ref name="page32"/&gt; This reign was short, lasting only two weeks before dropping them to Saito and Mr. Sato. Morales then wrestled several singles matches, defeating Killer Karl Kox, Bobby Dumcum, Saito, Bob Roop, Jack Ruggers and Charlie Cook, dividing contests with Dick Slater and losing to Koloff.&lt;ref name="page33"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by three new partners, Tiger Conway, Jr., along whom he won four consecutive bouts, Joe Azzari, which led to two losses, and Jerry Brisco, who wrestled with him in two draws.&lt;ref name="page33"/&gt;

=== New Japan Pro Wrestling and Canada (1978–1980) ===
On May 5, 1978, Morales returned to Puerto Rico for one night and teamed with Rivera. Afterwards, [[Ron Mikolajczyk]] became a recurrent teammate, mostly in matches involving Butch Bronson and a chosen partner. During the following months, Morales scored wins over [[Len Denton]], [[Butch Cassidy]], [[Rick Oliver]] and [[Sir Winston]], but lost to [[Killer Karl Kox]], [[Dick Slater]] and The Spoilers.&lt;ref name="page33"/&gt; On June 23, 1978, he made a tour to [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], but only participated in tag matches. This was followed by a visit to Kansas, where Morales defeated Alex Perez and lost to Jesse Ventura. In October, he toured Germany, with a win over Amet Chong and losses to Kublai Khan.&lt;ref name="page33"/&gt; On November 11, 1978, Morales made a one night visit to California, teaming with [[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]] in a win over Eddie Mansfield and The Grappler. The following year, he began making appearances in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. His first partner became Skip Young, along whom he managed to gain mixed results in matches involving Moose Morowski, [[Big John Studd|John Studd]] and [[Baron Von Raschke]] among others.&lt;ref name="page33"/&gt; In singles competition, Morales defeated Mr. X #1, Brute Bernard and Morowski. A secondary teammate, Les Thornton, joined him in several victories, while Abe Jacobs and Johnny Weaver teamed occasionally. Eventually, Jay Youngblood became Morales’s main partner, recording a winning streak while he also teamed with several other wrestlers including Cocoa Samoa, Tiger Jeet Singh and Bob Marcus with similar success.&lt;ref name="page33"/&gt; However, as a single performer he lost matches to Nick Bockwinkel, Len Denton and Killer Karl Kox, also failing to advance in a tournament for the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship. His victories during this timeframe were over Brute Bernard, Rudy Kay and Charlie Fulton.&lt;ref name="page34"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 1979, Morales returned to NJPW, besting Kengo Kimura, Kuniaki Kobayashi, drawing with Tatsumi Fujinami and losing to Antonio Inoki. He also teamed with Singh and [[Bob Backlund]] in wins that included both Fujinami and Inoki, but lost along Greg Valentine in return matches. To open the following year, Morales relocated to Canada, where he defeated David Patterson, Mr. X #1, The Scorpion, Doug Somers and Brute Bernard, but lost a series to Ox Baker in alternate dates at South and North Carolina.&lt;ref name="page34"/&gt; In his final matches within the NWA circuit, Morales earned wins over Billy Starr, Frankie Laine and The Destroyer, both in singles and tag team matches.&lt;ref name="page34"/&gt;

=== Return to WWF ===
==== Triple Crown Champion (1980&amp;ndash;1983) ====
On May 6, 1980, Morales returned to the renamed World Wrestling Federation, defeating Moose Monroe, Frank Savage, Mark Pole,  Brute Bernard and Ben Alexander during the course of the following weeks.&lt;ref name="page34"/&gt; He formed a tag team with Bob Backlund, which won its first two contests. Meanwhile, Morales continued on his successful run with victories over Ron Shaw, Mikel Scicluna, Tor Kamata, Afa, B.B. Coleman, Johnny Rodz and The Hangman.&lt;ref name="page34"/&gt; On August 9, 1980, he won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] along Backlund by besting Afa and Sika, the [[Wild Samoans]], at the [[Showdown at Shea#1980|Showdown at Shea 1980]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=World Tag Team title history|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they had to forfeit the championship belts the following day, due to a rule stating that no heavyweight champion could  hold a second title at the same time. During the following month, Afa and Kamata served as enhancement talent, while Morales also participated in a battle royale. Afterwards, he went on to defeat several adversaries, including [[Larry Zbyszko]], Scicluna, Afa, Rodz and The Hangman.&lt;ref name="page35"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series with Patera intensified after a loss, with Morales recovering to defeat him to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] on December 8, 1980. With this win, he became the first man in history to win the [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)|Triple Crown Championship]], which along his United States Championship reign also meant holding all of the promotion’s titles during his era, a recognition that only he held for almost two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322372 |title=Morales' first Intercontinental reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020115058/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322372 |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales also feuded with [[Sgt. Slaughter]], defeating him by disqualification. During the early months of 1981, he continued defeating the likes of The Hangman, Ron Shaw, Jose Estrada and Zbyszko, but tied in contests against St. Slaughter and Stan Hansen.&lt;ref name="page35"/&gt; After defeating and drawing with St. Slaughter in another series, [[Killer Khan]] became Morales' most recurrent adversary, experiencing more success, while other names such as [[Greg Valentine]] and Hansen challenged him occasionally. This was followed by a short feud against [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]], which ended with singles wins over both members of the team.&lt;ref name="page35"/&gt; On March 26, 1981, Morales faced [[Hulk Hogan]], dominating throughout the match and winning by count out. The feud with The Moondogs resumed afterwards, with mixed results in tag team competition but another win over Moondog Rex.&lt;ref name="page35"/&gt; Another figure that became a mainstay was St. Slaughter, whom he often defeated by disqualification.

Jerry Johnson and Johnny Rodz served as jobbers during this run. After participating in a battle royale won by Angelo Mosca, the two entered a feud, from which Morales emerged victorious.&lt;ref name="page37"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the month of June, he also scored consecutive wins over his former rivals Killer Khan and St. Slaughter, ending their respective storylines. This led to a feud against Don Muraco, to whom Morales dropped the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 20, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/|title=Intercontinental Championship title history|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two subsequent rematches ended in one win, three losses and a draw. Morales began wrestling and defeating other adversaries, including [[George Steele]], The Executioner  and Larry Sharpe, besides the usual low card talents that he had consistently bested previously. However, the feud with Muraco was reignited and he earned two wins and a draw, leading to a titular rematch between them.&lt;ref name="page37"/&gt; Morales entered the contest with wins over The Executioner and Greg Valentine, winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship back on November 23, 1981, in a Texas Death match.&lt;ref name="page37"/&gt; With this win, Morales became the first man to hold the Intercontinental title twice, and he held it for fourteen months, the longest reign up until that point.&lt;ref name=IC2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322384 |title=Morales' second Intercontinental reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903155702/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322384 |archivedate=2007-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was successful in four rematches against Muraco, with Valentine systematically becoming his main adversary. In his first bout of 1982, Morales defeated Valentine by disqualification.&lt;ref name="page37"/&gt; He was able to dominate Hans Schroeder, Larry Dee and Killer Khan, but drew in another match against Valentine, who also went on to win their next encounter by disqualification. Their series continued with the equitable results of one win, one loss and a draw.&lt;ref name="page38"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; To continue, Morales won two consecutive contests, including a Brass Knuckles Alley Fight, but got disqualified in the third. This was momentarily interrupted with a short program against Mr. Fuji, Mr. Saito and Lou Albano, which also featured wins over Rodz and Adrian Adonis.&lt;ref name="page38"/&gt; After being resumed, Morales won two more matches over Valentine, once again being disqualified in the third, before coming back to win in a Texas Death match. He then entered a winning streak, during which he defeated The Black Demon twice, Jesse Ventura by countout, Adonis thrice, Fuji and Valentine four times, two of these being Brass Knuckles Matches and other a Street Fight.&lt;ref name="page38"/&gt; This came to an end when Morales was disqualified against Jimmy Snuka. He wrestled Valentine three more times, winning in a Brass Knuckles match and by countout.

During the summer of 1982, Morales feuded with Bob Orton, Jr., gaining the upper hand after being disqualified in the open bout.&lt;ref name="page38"/&gt; Estrada, Saito and Swede Hanson were also bested during this time. However, this streak was also ended in a count out loss to Snuka. In September, Morales won contests over Rocky Cole and Scicluna, but was counted out against Buddy Rose, which led to a draw in a rematch. He opened the following months with victories in matches featuring Bob Bradley,  Tony Russo and Swede Hanson, but was counted out in a challenge by [[Superstar Billy Graham]].&lt;ref name="page39"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales continued his feud with Buddy Rose, defeating him by disqualification. Two more matches against Graham ended in a draw and a disqualification loss. Afterwards, Morales was involved in a no contest and a double disqualification draw with Rose, going on to close with two consecutive wins.&lt;ref name="page39"/&gt; During the month of November, he divided honors with Graham, also scoring victories over Tony Russo and Fuji. On December 28, 1982, Morales wrestled Don Muraco to a double disqualification draw.&lt;ref name="page39"/&gt; On his first match of 1983, the result was repeated, this time in a match involving Graham. The following weeks brought wins over Sammy Sanders, Bob Bradley, Fuji and Rose, but also losses to Graham and Muraco, most of which were by countout or disqualification. After besting Graham in another bout, Morales dropped the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship to Muraco on January 22, 1983.&lt;ref name="page39"/&gt; However, he countered by winning a rematch, also defeating Graham before losing a second rubber match.&lt;ref name="page39"/&gt; Afterwards, Morales gained wins over Swede Hanson, Bob Bradley, Victor Rivera,  Buddy Rose, Huertas Gonzalez and Fuji. He also emerged victorious from a feud with Graham, winning the majority of their encounters. Morales and Muraco went on to exchange results, but neither one was able to dominate cleanly, with most wins being consequence of count outs and disqualifications.&lt;ref name="page40"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he bested Eddie Carson and participated in occasional multi-wrestler team matches. 

====Puerto Rican tours (1983&amp;ndash;1984)====
On April 23, 1983, Morales began a tour in his native Puerto Rico performing for Capitol Sports Promotions (CSP), now known as the [[World Wrestling Council]], challenging [[Ric Flair]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in his first appearance.&lt;ref name="page40"/&gt;

After a brief interruption where he bested Swede Hanson in a WWF card held at New York, Morales returned to CSP joining [[Carlos Colón, Sr.]] to win the [[WWC World Tag Team Championship|CSP World Tag Team Championship]] over The Medics.&lt;ref name="page40"/&gt; On June 25, 1983, he defeated Buddy Landel to add the [[WWC North American Heavyweight Championship|CSP North American Heavyweight Championship]]. In a rare CSP card outside of Puerto Rican soil, Morales wrestled [[Hugo Savinovich]] in Trinidad.&lt;ref name="page40"/&gt; On September 10, 1983, The Medics recovered the titles from him and Colón. One week later, Morales faced Ric Flair in the first [[WWC Aniversario|Aniversario]] event, winning the contest by disqualification.&lt;ref name="page40"/&gt; On January 6, 1984, he dropped the North American Heavyweight Championship o Sweet Daddy Siki. After wrestling Cyclon Negro in Trinidad and defeating Buddy Rose in a WWF event, Morales won a rematch against Siki, recovering the title.&lt;ref name="page40"/&gt; He held the belt until September 15, 1984, dropping it to [[Randy Savage]] during the final stage of his CSP stay. Another notable opponent was [[James J. Dillon]]. This run was highlighted by a feud against [[Bob Sweetan]], who injured Morales' neck with a piledriver during one of their encounters.&lt;ref name="page40"/&gt;

==== Various feuds and retirement (1985&amp;ndash;1987) ====
During the months of March and April 1985, he participated in tag team matches for the WWF, including participation in a show held at Kuwait. Morlaes later went on to defeat Mr. X, Terry Gibbs and Steve Lombardi during the following months. On May 24, 1985, he wrestled Strong Machine #1 to a draw in a NJPW show.&lt;ref name="page41"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales entered the [[King of the Ring|1985 King of the Ring]] tournament, besting Johnny V in the opening contest before receiving a bye during the quarterfinals. However, he was eliminated by Muraco in the semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King of the Ring: July 8, 1985|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering85.html|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this timeframe, [[Tito Santana]] became his occasional tag team partner. Individually, Morales went on to defeat Mr.X several times, Gibbs, Lombardi and Barry O twice, Rene Goulet four times and Tiger Chung Lee.

Morales made his following appearance in a WWF event held in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], where he defeated The Spoiler.&lt;ref name="page41"/&gt; The second half of the month brought wins in two matches along Santana and singles success over opponents that he had previously wrestled. This pattern continued in November, when Morales and Santana  exchanged results against Valentine and Brutus Beefcake. Individually, he gained victories over several familiar performers including Lee, Barry O, Gibbs and The Spoiler, also winning a series against Alexi Smirnoff and losing a single time to Orton.&lt;ref name="page43"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contests including Moondog Spot, Thorton and Lee ended in the same fashion, with Morales going on to win a rematch over Orton.

Morales advanced further by besting Mike Rotundo in the quarterfinals and Nikolai Volkoff in the semifinals, but lost the final to [[Harley Race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King of the Ring: July 14, 1986|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering86.html|accessdate=2007-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905234059/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering86.html|archivedate=September 5, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following months brought mixed results, with wins over Muraco and [[Jim Neidhart]] but losses to Hercules and Adrian Adonis.

Morales recovered by defeating Savage three times and Gibbs once, while drawing with Orton before losing a rematch to Race.

He lost a series of matches against Bravo, but bested Muraco before entering a feud with Nick Kiniski  that featured several draws before he gained the upper hand in the final bout.&lt;ref name="page45"/&gt; Despite this, during this stage of his career Morales was unable to gain wins over the likes of King Kong Bundy and Bravo, unsuccessfully challenging the new Intercontinental Champion, [[The Honky Tonk Man]], on several dates.&lt;ref name="page45"/&gt; Some wrestlers that he had bested in the past, such as Butch Reed or Sika were also booked over him, along strong adversaries such as Jake Roberts, Bravo, Oron and Paul Orndorff. His wins over this timeframe were over Moondog Spot, Sika and Jimmy Jack Funk. On March 8, 1987, Morales teamed with Danny Spivey in the quarterfinals of a tournament for the World Tag Team Championship, but were eliminated by Rick Martel and Tom Zenk.&lt;ref name="page47"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; May was marked by several unsuccessful matches that formed part of a rivalry with [[Ron Bass (wrestler)|Ron Bass]], but finished with a win over Lombardi. Morales and Santana teamed twice more, but were unable to overtake the team of Haku and Tama, however, he subsequently joined Jim Brunzell, being successful over [[The Hart Foundation]], Hart and Neidhart.&lt;ref name="page47"/&gt; During July, he bested Martin twice, also losing to [[One Man Gang]] and Orndorff.&lt;ref name="page47"/&gt; Morales made a final in-ring appearance by participating in a battle royale held on November 16, 1987.&lt;ref name="page47"/&gt;

=== Retirement (1987–present) ===
Following his retirement from the squared circle, Morales became a road agent and later commentator for the WWF's Spanish-language programming, the first time that a Puerto Rican performed this duty for an international promotion.&lt;ref name=ring/&gt; He returned to this role working for [[World Championship Wrestling]] during the 1990s, narrating ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' and [[List of WCW pay-per-view events|pay per views]] along Miguel Alonzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2008/04/02/pf-5176426.html|title=Remembering Luis Magana, bilingual announcer extraordinario|author=Mike Lano|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Slam!

Morales has made few wrestling related appearances since his WCW days, the most recent being autograph signings in fan conventions, the first instance was at Wrestling Reunion III held in 2005 and the second at Wrestling Reunion 5 held in 2007, where he was reunited with Sammartino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/06/20/pf-1096982.html|title=Morales emerges as highlight of reunion|author=Chris Sokol|publisher=[[canoe.ca|Slam! Sports]]|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite living a low profile life following his retirement, he has been the inspiration for homages and mentions throughout the decades that followed. Morales has explained that he is no longer involved with the discipline due to the way that it has changed over the years. A self-proclaimed "old school" wrestler, he is not interested in the overselling of [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]s and spectacle that is seen in modern professional wrestling, despite admitting the economic success of the "sports entertainment" formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thnt.com/thnt/story/0,21282,925718,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040317160308/http://www.thnt.com/thnt/story/0%2C21282%2C925718%2C00.html |title=Wrestling with change in culture |author=Jerry Barca |publisher=''Home News Tribune'' |date=2004-03-15 |archivedate=2004-03-17 |accessdate=2013-05-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Morales was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] as part the [[WWE Hall of Fame (1995)|class of 1995]].&lt;ref name="WWEHOF"/&gt; Professional wrestling critics and purists have discussed his contributions to the discipline in widespread publications. Tomás Marín Rodríguez "El Martillo", part of a group led by José Antonio Geigel and one of the founding members of the first promotion in Puerto Rico, expressed in an interview that he considers Morales the best Puerto Rican wrestler in history. Marín considered that both his in-ring style and chivalry made him "unique" among performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prwrestling.com/entrevistas/martillo.html|title=PR: Entrevista a Tomás Marín "El Martillo"|author=Manuel González|publisher=Puerto Rico Wrestling|language=Spanish|date=2002-10-28|accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Funk, Stan Hansen, Greg Valentine and Magnificent Muraco have expressed having enjoyed working matches with Morales. Fernwood Gold III and Thor Jensen of [[UGO Networks]] listed him as the 36th best face wrestler in history, noting how he appealed to the fanbase in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/sports/best-wrestling-faces-pedro-morales|title=Best Wrestling Faces: Pedro Morales|author=Fernwood Gold the Third and K.

Bill Barnwell of [[IGN|IGN Sports]] also included Morales in the site's list of Top Intercontinental Champions, placing him in the sixth slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/871/871347p2.html|title=Top Ten Intercontinental Champions of All Time|author=Bill Barnswell|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2008-05-02|accessdate=2012-01-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615011109/http://sports.ign.com/articles/871/871347p2.html|archivedate=2009-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Thomas of 411.com ranked him fifth as part of a debate among the website's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/197339|title=The 411 Wrestling Top 5 08.24.11: Week 138 – Top Intercontinental Champions|author=Larry Caonka|publisher=411.com|date=2011-08-24|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar discussion held at [[Canoe.ca|Slam! Sports]], writer Greg Oliver considered him the best wrestler to hold the belt, stating that when "he held the title, there was a sense of honour and pride with it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2008/12/16/pf-7765676.html|title=SLAM!

The promotion mentions being the first wrestler to win the title twice and holding it for a combined record of over 600 days, more than any other wrestler, as merits for this recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/wwefeaturepage/features/top25intercontinentalchamps|title=WWE "Top 25 Intercontinental Champions"|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE also included him in a compendium titled "Top 50 Good Guys in Wrestling  History", which featured wrestlers that performed as fan favorites during their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/top-50-good-guys/page-8|title=Top 50 Good Guys in Wrestling History|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2012-09-28|accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the promotion joined [[NBC Universo]] to commemorate [[National Hispanic Heritage Month]], creating a series highlighting the career of several wrestlers including Morales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/videos/wwe-and-nbc-universo-honor-pedro-morales-during-hispanic-heritage-month|title=WWE and NBC Universo honor Pedro Morales during Hispanic Heritage Month|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2016-09-27|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the WWE, he has received recognition as a Latin American and Hispanic pioneer in other promotions. In mid 1996, Morales appeared at an event of the short lived [[American Wrestling Federation]], in the championship match between [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Tito Santana]], along with other superstars and legends like [[Sgt. Slaughter]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], and special guest referee [[Jim Brunzell]]. On August 31, 2006, as part of a [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] taping, Morales was mentioned by [[Konnan]] along fellow Hall of Famers Carlos Colón, [[Mil Máscaras]] and [[Los Guerreros|the Guerrero family]], being acknowledged as Latinos that paved the way within the wrestling industry.&lt;ref name="LAX"/&gt; This was part of an in-character celebratory speech following [[The Latin American Xchange]]'s coronation as [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Champions]].&lt;ref name="LAX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=20042&amp;p=1|title=TNA Impact Report: Thumbstacks Match on TV|author=Richard Trionfo|publisher=''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''|date=2006-09-01|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Konnan credits him with "[teaching] a lot" about the politics of wrestling and "the things you need to do in the ring to be a success in this business" during his time in WCW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/09/21/1872095.html|title=Konnan raps on race, TNA and LAX|author=Jason Clevett|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Slam! Sports]]|date=2006-09-21|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 onwards, the World Wrestling Council approached Morales and offered holding an Aniversario event in his honor, but he declined the invitations for ten years. In 2013, Morales accepted being the honoree of Aniversario 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2013/09/09/wwc-aniversario-40-dedicado-a-pedro-morales/|title=WWC: ANIVERSARIO 40 DEDICADO A PEDRO MORALES|author=Anthony Piñero|publisher=''Súper Luchas''|language=Spanish|date=2013-09-09|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the centerpiece of the International Pedro Morales Fan Club, an independent organization that ran during the 1970s and that recruited members through wrestling magazines. In 2000, ''The Ring Chronicle'' inducted Morales into its own version of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/pedromorales4.html|title=Hall of Fame Inductee: Pedro Morales|author=Steve Slage|publisher=The Ring Chronicle's Online Museum|year=2000|accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern fan reaction has also been positive in regards to the historical significance of his accomplishments. Nate Scaccia, collaborator of [[Bleacher Report]], considers Morales the best Intercontinental champion of all time, ranking first in the title's entry at the website's WWE Champion Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/646000-wwe-top-10-champion-series-top-10-intercontinental-champions-of-all-time/page/12|title=WWE Champion Series Top 10 Intercontinental Champions of All Time|author=Nate Scaccia|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=2011-03-26|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Robinson and Will Baker, amateur writers for the same site, also consider him the 31st best WWE wrestler in history and 11th greatest WWE Champion respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bleacherreport.com/articles/581682-top-100-wwe-wrestlers-of-all-time-40-31#/articles/581682-top-100-wwe-wrestlers-of-all-time-40-31/page/11 |title=Top 100 Wrestlers Of All-Time:40-31|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=2011-01-22|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/784208-ranking-the-greatest-wwe-champions-of-all-time|title=Ranking the Greatest WWE Champions of All Time|author=Will J.

As a trainer, Morales was involved in the instruction of [[Dory Funk Jr.]], a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who in 2009 was inducted into the Hall of Fame as part of The Funks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1107/567118/dory-funk-jr-talks-his-wrestling-school/|title=Dory Funk Jr. Talks His Wrestling School, Why He Left WWF, Training Kurt Angle, Wrestling Terry|author=Raj Giri|publisher=Wrestling, Inc.|date=2013-11-07|accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Morales was born in the municipality of Culebra, an island extending eleven square miles located off the shore of Puerto Rico's main island. He was a member of a large family, with 85 cousins just on his mother's side.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thnt.com/thnt/story/0,21282,854390,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031118175543/http://www.thnt.com/thnt/story/0%2C21282%2C854390%2C00.html |title=Pro wrestler now grows tomatoes in Woodbridge |author=Michelle Sahn |publisher=''Home News Tribune'' |date=2003-11-13 |archivedate=2003-11-18 |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales once claimed that sixty five percent of Culebra's population had some bloodline connection to him.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; He was raised in Culebra throughout his childhood and remained there until reaching his adolescence, when his mother sent him to live with an aunt in [[Brooklyn]], New York to finish his high school education.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; It was there that one of his sister's friends introduced him to the members of a wrestling club, quickly earning an interest.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; After practicing in his school and at a local [[YMCA]], Morales debuted as an amateur wrestler at the age of 13, competing in the 160&amp;nbsp;lb division.&lt;ref name="Slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/ResultsArchive/Wrestlers/morales.html|title=Wrestlers Results Archive: Pedro Morales|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Slam! Sports]]|accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York he also became a professional wrestling fan, witnessing [[Miguel Pérez (wrestler)|Miguel Pérez, Sr.]]'s run as one half of the only undefeated NWA Capitol (WWWF's predecessor) World Tag Team Champions along [[Antonino Rocca]].&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt; Since early in his life, Morales had displayed aptitude for athletic competitions, mostly focusing in the practice of baseball. When he was 16 years old, he was selected in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico's (now known as [[Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]]) first year draft by the [[Leones de Ponce (baseball)|Leones de Ponce]].&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt; However, due to living outside of Puerto Rico he declined the opportunity. Instead, Morales elected to train in order to become a professional wrestler, in the process gaining twenty pounds.&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt; A year later, his father signed the documentation required by the New York State Athletic Commission in order to begin his career as an underage performer.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt;

He married his wife Karen in 1966, continuing this relationship throughout his wrestling career and afterwards.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; The couple has a son, Pedro Morales, Jr. born in 1974. Due to the nature of his work, Morales had lived in over a dozen cities throughout his career, including some time in Japan.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; However, when his son was about to start kindergarten, the family bought a house in Central New Jersey. His wife, a teacher herself, began working at Avenel Street Elementary School.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; After his last job in pro wrestling as a Spanish narrator in WCW, Morales retired from the sport and permanently settled in [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey]] where he adopted gardening as a hobby, cultivating tomatoes in his personal garden.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; Due to working during a time where the ring featured no methods of protection, Morales suffered several injuries that continued to linger after his career was over, limiting the amount of physical exercise that he was capable of doing.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; However, he remained a frequent visitor to The Club, a gym located in Woodbridge.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; Despite being a resident of this area, he continued to travel frequently to Puerto Rico, visiting the archipelago multiple  times per year. In 2003, he expressed interest in returning to live permanently in a coastal town near the Caribbean Sea once his wife retired.&lt;ref name="jumpin' fish"/&gt; However, this has yet to materialize. An advanced case of [[Parkinson's disease]] now prevents him from traveling to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prwrestling.com/noticiasprw2/9439.php|title=Resultados Aniversario 40|publisher=Puerto Rico Rico Wrestling|language=Spanish|date=2013-09-21|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Little is known about Henlein's life.  He apparently apprenticed in his youth as a locksmith.  At the time, locksmiths were among the few craftsmen with the skills and tools to enter the new field of clockmaking,&lt;ref name="Farr"&gt;{{cite book

He sought asylum at a local Franciscan monastery, where he stayed for four years, until 1508.  In 1509 he became a master in the city's locksmith guild.&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;     

==Small wearable clocks==
He became known as a maker of small portable ornamental spring-powered brass clocks, very rare and expensive,&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt; which were fashionable among the nobility of the time.   These were sometimes worn as pendants or attached to clothing,&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; and so may be considered the first watches, although at over 3 inches long&lt;ref name="Carlisle" /&gt; they were bigger than the first true [[pocketwatch]]es which appeared about a century later, and were not able to fit in pockets.   

He is mentioned in the city's records as the supplier of small spring-driven clocks, which were given as gifts to important people.&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;   He was supposedly the first craftsman to build clockworks into "Bisamköpfe", small containers fashioned from precious metals for fragrances or disinfectants.&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;  For example a Nuremberg paper records that in 1524 he was paid 15 florins for a gilt musk-ball watch.&lt;ref name="Campbell" &gt;{{cite book

[[File:Nuernberger Ei offen.jpg|thumb|An early "clock-watch" ''(Taschenuhr)'', 2nd half of the 16th century.]]


==Recognition==
Henlein's fame is mostly due to a passage by [[Johann Cochläus]] in the 1511 ''Cosmographia'' by Pomponius Mela:&lt;ref name="Milham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Peter Hele, still a young man, fashions works which even the most learned mathematicians admire. He shapes many-wheeled clocks out of small bits of iron, which run and chime the hours without weights for forty hours, whether carried at the breast or in a handbag&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His reputation as the inventor of the watch came after his rise to popular consciousness in the 19th century, through a novel by Karl Spindler, ''Der Nürnberger Sophokles''.&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;   This was made into [[The Immortal Heart|a 1939 film]], and his likeness appeared on a 1942 German stamp.&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;   

However, although he was a notable and talented clockmaker, there were other clockmakers making small clocks at the time,&lt;ref name="Cipolla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;  and no contemporary source from his time credits him with inventing anything.&lt;ref name="Rossum" /&gt;  The [[mainspring]] which made portable clocks possible, often attributed to him,&lt;ref name="Milham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anzovin" /&gt;  actually appeared in the early 15th century, almost a century before his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;This . . . Henlein was very nearly the first of those who invented how to put small clocks into little boxes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Porthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds''' is a [[fictional character]] in the novels ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bUaYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;lpg=PT160&amp;dq=Athos+three+musketeers+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r-elmbv8YG&amp;sig=XIZ8CzRUu9QwhPkbsSP4qzXBRks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VzDCVNTiC8yVatPIgIAJ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Athos%20three%20musketeers%20analysis&amp;f=false|title=The Social Psychology of Communication|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other two [[musketeer]]s, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Aramis]], are friends of the novel's protagonist, [[d'Artagnan]].

In ''The Three Musketeers'' his [[family name]] is du Vallon. In ''Twenty Years After'', having made a financially advantageous marriage, he is first known as du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=20 Years After|publisher=The World's Classics|isbn=0-19-283074-0|pages=110–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he earns the title of [[Baron]].

Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers. His eating abilities even impress [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] during a banquet at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. As the story advances, he looks more and more like a giant, and his death is that of a [[titan (mythology)|titan]].

At the time of ''The Three Musketeers'' (ca. 1627) he apparently has few lands or other resources to draw from. He was finally able to extract sufficient funds from an elderly lawyer's somewhat younger wife (whom he was romancing and later married) to equip himself for the [[Siege of La Rochelle]].

The fictional Porthos is very loosely based on the historical [[musketeer]] [[Isaac de Porthau]].

'''Rio Díaz-Cojuangco''' (born '''Rosario Aspillera Díaz'''; 14 August 1959 – 4 October 2004), was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[beauty queen]], [[television presenter]], actress and politician. The sister of former [[Miss Universe]] [[Miss Universe 1969|1969]] [[Gloria Diaz|Gloria Díaz]], she was diagnosed with stage four [[colon cancer]] and died in the [[United States]] in 2004. She was an aunt of [[Georgina Wilson]], through another sister Aurora who is Wilson's mother.

==Biography==
Born in Manila, Díaz was the youngest of twelve children born to Jaime Díaz and Teresa Aspillera. A ramp and commercial model, she was crowned [[Mutya ng Pilipinas]] in 1977 and won Fourth Runner-up in the [[Miss Asia Pageant]] that same year.

Díaz began a relationship with musician [[Hajji Alejandro]], and together they [[Filipino diaspora|emigrated]] to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where they operated a small restaurant along [[Melrose Avenue]]. After separating from Alejandro, Díaz returned to the Philippines and resumed her career in entertainment. She co-hosted ''[[Eat Bulaga]]'' in 1991 and stayed for a couple of years before meeting Charlie Cojuangco on a [[blind date]] in 1993 and marrying him the following year. For the greater part of the 1990s, Díaz worked for television and starred in several films.

===Politics===
She was elected [[vice-mayor]] of [[Pontevedra, Negros Occidental]] in the [[Philippine general election, 1998|1998 elections]], while her husband won a seat in [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]. Díaz later became president of the vice-mayors' league of [[Negros Occidental]].

===Illness and death===
During a routine checkup in December 1998, her American doctors informed her of a small growth in her left abdomen. After a six-hour surgery, they found a [[malignant tumour]] in its fourth stage, and Díaz was given three months to live. She underwent another operation, and received [[chemotherapy]] for three months.

In 1999, [[Stanford]] [[oncologist]] Dr George Fisher, declared she had been cured. When the cancer cells returned in May 2000, Rio travelled back to Stanford for an eight-hour surgical procedure and another round of chemotherapy sessions. Díaz stopped the sessions in 2002, citing her body's inability to cope further, but her physicians later that year said she had no recourse but to continue treatment.

Six years after the original diagnosis, Díaz died on 4 October 2004 at [[Seton Medical Center]] in [[Daly City]], [[California]], at the age of 45.

'''Rowena Cade''' (1893–1983) was the creator of the [[Minack Theatre]] in [[Porthcurno]], [[Cornwall]], UK.

==Life==
Cade was born in [[Spondon]] near Derby on 2 August 1893.&lt;ref name=new&gt;[http://www.cornwall-calling.co.uk/famous-cornish-people/cade-rowena.htm Rowena Cade, Creator of the Minack Theatre], cornwall-calling, Retrieved 26 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; She was the older sister of [[Katharine Burdekin]] and with her two brothers they lived at [[The Homestead, Spondon|The Homestead]] in Spondon. Rowena Cade's family sold their house in Spondon and Cheltenham and moved to [[Lamorna]] in [[West Penwith]], Cornwall after the First World War.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cornwalls.co.uk/history/people/rowena_cade.htm|title=Rowena Cade - Creator of the Minack Theater|date=2013-01-07|work=Cornwall Guide|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[File:Plaque to Rowena Cade - geograph.org.uk - 297855.jpg|alt= Plaque commemorating the founder and builder of the Minack Theatre|thumb|left|Plaque commemorating the founder and builder of the Minack Theatre]]

She discovered and bought the Minack headland in the 1920s for £100 and built a house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cornwallforever.co.uk/places/minack-theatre|title=Minack Theatre history &amp; Rowena Cade {{!}}|work=Cornwall For Ever!|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-21850687|title=In Pictures: Rowena Cade's Minack theatre|date=2013-03-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister's marriage had ended in 1922 and she, and later her partner, also lived in Minack.&lt;ref name="Burdekin1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katharine Burdekin|title=The End of this Day's Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1qf5qa8zs0C&amp;pg=PA163|year=1989|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=978-1-55861-009-5|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cade put on a local production of ''A Midsummer Night’s Dream'' in 1929, she began searching for a suitable venue for a permanent outdoor stage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10245136/Carved-in-granite-the-Minack-Theatre-was-more-than-merely-a-stage-for-Miss-Cade.html|title=Carved in granite, the Minack Theatre was more than merely a stage for Miss Cade|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is carved into the granite cliffs at Porthcurno, just a few miles from Land’s End.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She built the theatre herself with the help of her gardner Billy Rawlings in 1931–32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.minack.com/our-history-1/|title=Our history - Minack Theatre|work=Minack Theatre|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage took six months to build and the first performance was of Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'' in summer 1932. Without any formal lighting, the performance used batteries and car headlights to light the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1976, Cade gave the theatre to a charitable trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She died on 26 March 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1055|title=Engineering Timelines - Minack Theatre|website=www.engineering-timelines.com|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cade family continued to be involved in the theatre – the general manager in 2015 was married to Rowena's great niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desforges|first=Kate Elizabeth|date=Jan 2015|title=Burdekin’s Utopian Visions: A Study of Four Interwar Texts|url=https://hydra.hull.ac.uk/assets/hull:14090a/content|journal=|volume=PhD Thesis|pages=|via=University of Hull}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is now managed by Philip Jackson and has featured in a number of BBC programmes about the South West of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04fl6zs|title=Minack Theatre - drama by the sea, Coastal Path - BBC One|website=BBC|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Countryfile|title=Minack Theatre and Rowena Cade (Cornwall) - BBC - 24th April 2016|date=2016-04-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrs6s3zBeD4|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scribbly''''' was a Dutch comic strip, created by Jan-Paul Arends. It ran daily in the Dutch edition of the ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' free newspaper from 1999 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/arends_jp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506094241/http://lambiek.net/artists/a/arends_jp.htm |archivedate=2012-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven albums have been published containing the daily strips. The comic is known for its weird cast, and its tendency for parodying well-known films, books and famous people.

==Cast==
* '''Scribbly''' is the eponymous protagonist. He is a [[schizophrenic]] and lives in an institute for people who are mentally disturbed. 
* '''Psychotron''' is Scribbly's super-hero [[alter ego]], in a few strips where he deludedly wears a red cape, which allows him to think he can fly.
* '''Frits''' is Scribbly's voice-inside-his-head.
* '''Quibus''' is an animated sheet of paper who is usually Scribbly's friend.
* '''Doctor Psilo''' leads the House for the Mentally Disturbed.
* '''Zark''' is an extraterrestrial alien who looks like a giant pickle with an antenna. He can use the antenna for radio reception, remote control, as well as hearing Frits. He hails from planet Zortian II.
* '''Kraz''' is Zark's brother. He lives on the same planet where Zark used to live.
* '''Waverider''' is Zark's [[super-hero]] alter ego, who has no known powers.
* '''Doe-ran''' is a haunting spirit, in the shape of a floating mask, that was initially summoned by Quibus to torment Scribbly. He is a powerful magician.
* '''Draakje''' is a little dragon that doesn't talk and has a tendency of breathing fire at inconvenient moments. He barks just like a dog.
* '''Olav''' is a huge man who is a [[porter (carrier)|porter]] at the House. He shouts a lot.
* '''V-252''' is a friendly robot from outer space with a television on his belly. He is married to another robot, and they have a toaster for a child.
* '''H-Nibal''' is a huge killer robot from outer space, who was eventually defeated by D-2120.
* '''Mildred''' is a nurse at the House, who keeps an eye on the patients using Meneer Pollepel.
* '''Pollepel''' is a ladle with a drawn-on angry face. When used, he scares the patients.
* '''Eddy''' is one of the newer patients in the House, and is a naughty baby duck. He likes wine, and drives around the house in a pink toy [[Cadillac]].
* '''Geestenclub''' are four ghosts who incidentally appear in the comics.
* '''Flumpy''' is a huge bee, who is the [[mascot]] of the brand of cereal eaten in the House.
* '''Giovanni''' is a shrimp, who is sometimes being drawn by Zark in an attempt to create a comic book. Giovanni lives in Garnaalsmeer.
* '''Zen''' is a robot who thinks for himself, created by V-252.

'''Steven Anthony Smith''' (born August 30, 1964) is a former professional [[American football]] [[fullback (gridiron football)|fullback]], playing 9 seasons in the [[National Football League]] with the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]]. He was a [[Captain (sports)|team captain]] on [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]'s [[Penn State Nittany Lions football under Joe Paterno (as an Independent)#1986 season|1986 National Championship]] team.

Smith was a third-round draft choice of the Raiders in the [[1987 NFL Draft]]. Converted to [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], Smith blocked for Raiders star running backs [[Bo Jackson]] and [[Marcus Allen]]. He then spent 2 seasons with Seattle until a back injury ended his career.&lt;ref name="battlingillness"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2006/12/29/sports/college_and_pro/doc45952bd9108ce651032684.txt | title = Former Raider fullback Smith battles illness | last = Armas | first = Genaro C. | publisher = The Associated Press | date = 2006-12-29 | accessdate = 2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although primarily a blocker, he finished his career with 1627 rushing yards and 13 receiving touchdowns.

In 1995, Smith won the inaugural [[Madden Bowl#The Madden Bowl|Madden Bowl]], a tournament during [[Super Bowl]] weekend in which current and former NFL players compete at the [[Madden NFL]] [[video game]].

==After football==
Smith married former [[Oakland Raiderettes|Raiderette]], Chie Aguilar-Hiroto from Cypress, CA in December  1989.&lt;ref name="commitment2acceptance"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.raiderdrive.com/commitment_to_acceptance1.htm | title = Oakland Raider Steve Smith: Commitment to Acceptance | last = Turse | first = Paul | publisher = raiderdrive.com | accessdate = 2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two children, Dante (July 1990) and Jazmin (Sept 1991) and live in [[Richardson, Texas]].&lt;ref name="battlingillness"/&gt; Smith has been afflicted with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]] since July 2002. He cannot speak because of a [[ventilator]] and receives his food through a [[feeding tube]]. He communicates via a state of the art computer system paid for by The Steve Gleason Foundation, reported his wife.

Smith was the focus of an August 17, 2010, episode of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'' exploring how toxic proteins that form after brain trauma may cause Lou Gehrig's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

'''Thomas Judson Brooks''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|MBE|JP}} (7 July 1880 &amp;ndash; 15 February 1958) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] coal miner and politician who became a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament]]. A [[spiritualism|spiritualist]], his main achievement was to lead the successful campaign to repeal the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]].

==Working life==
Brooks was born on Eastfield Farm at [[Thurgoland]] near [[Barnsley]], [[Yorkshire]], where his father was a farmer. He attended Thurgoland Church School, and on leaving instead of following his father into farming, he became a coal miner at [[Glass Houghton]]. Active in the Yorkshire Mine Workers' Association, he became Secretary of his branch of the Union in 1911. He was elected as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate to [[Castleford]] [[Urban District Council]] in 1914.

==Local politics==
In 1924 Brooks was appointed Chairman of Wakefield and Pontefract War Pension Committee and made a [[Justice of the Peace]] for the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In the next year he was elected to the West Riding County Council, on which he remained until 1942 and was elected as a County [[Alderman]] in 1940. He was also Chairman of Trustees for Castleford, Normanton and District Hospital. In 1931 he was awarded [[Order of the British Empire|Membership of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to the local community.

==Election to Parliament==
When the Labour MP [[William Lunn]] died in May 1942, Brooks won the endorsement of the Yorkshire Miners' Association, and at the [[Rothwell by-election, 1942|Rothwell by-election in August]] he was elected unopposed as Labour [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Rothwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Rothwell]].  After the end of the war Brooks was appointed to a Committee advising the Speaker on the rebuilding of the Chamber of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which had been destroyed by German bombs in 1941. He was a firm opponent of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]].

==Spiritualism==
Brooks' most pressing issue was that of [[Spiritualism]], as he was an ardent spiritualist himself. He led delegations from the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to the Home Secretary over what spiritualists believed was heavy-handed policing, and in 1943 obtained a concession that action would only be taken in the most extreme cases of misrepresentation. However, after the prosecution of medium [[Helen Duncan]] in 1944, the Spiritualists decided to campaign for a change in the law.

With [[Private Member's Bill]]s having been suspended during the [[Second World War]] and for some years afterwards, it was not until 1950 that an opportunity emerged. Brooks' friend [[Walter Monslow, Baron Monslow|Walter Monslow]] won a spot in the annual ballot for Bills, and Brooks persuaded him to introduce a Bill to repeal the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]] and replace it with an Act criminalising deliberate deception. With Brooks' guidance, the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]] was passed unanimously.

Brooks retired from Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]].

== WEP Security ==
Newsham partially discovered the '''Newsham 21-bit''' WEP attack. The Newsham 21-bit attack is a method used primarily by [[KisMAC]] to brute force WEP keys. It is effective on routers such as [[Linksys]], [[Netgear]], [[Belkin]], and [[D-Link]] but does not affect [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] or [[3Com]], as they use their own [[algorithms]] for generating [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] keys. Using this method allows for the WEP key to be retrieved in less than a minute. When the WEP keys are generated, they use a text based key that is generated using a 21-bit algorithm instead of the more secure 40-bit encryption algorithm, but the router presents the key to the user as a 40-bit key. This method is 2^19 times faster to brute force than a 40-bit key would be, allowing modern processors to break the encryption rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;http://kismac-ng.org/ kismac-ng.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/secprog/class3/7.Wireless.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Newsham was awarded a Lifetime Achievement [[Pwnie award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pwnies.com/archive/2008/winners/#lifetime |title=2008 Pwnie Awards |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Brownlow''' [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC (I)]] (10 April 1726 – 28 October 1794) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] politician.

He was the only son of [[William Brownlow (1683-1739)|William Brownlow]] MP  and Lady  Elizabeth Hamilton, daughter of [[James Hamilton, 6th Earl of Abercorn]] and Elizabeth Reading.

Brownlow was first elected to the [[Irish House of Commons]] as the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Armagh County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Armagh County]] in 1753, holding the seat until 1794. He was also returned for the [[Strabane (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Strabane]] constituency in 1768, but was replaced in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Johnston-Liik, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jitdluWSybIC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Alexander+Gradon+naas+mp&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OWYBWe6i_R&amp;sig=1IBtQjrwGSvhBFPYDM5_MrQv4Zg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix8ZzOoYnLAhVL2BoKHSlICEcQ6AEIMjAD#v=snippet&amp;q=brownlow&amp;f=false ''MPs in Dublin: Companion to History of the Irish Parliament, 1692-1800''] (Ulster Historical Foundation, 2006), p.74 (Retrieved 26 February 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

He married firstly Judith  Letitia Meredith, daughter of the Reverend Charles  Meredith, [[Dean of  Limerick and Ardfert|Dean of Ardfert]],  and had at least four children, including Charles, his heir. One of their daughters, Frances Letitia, married [[John Vesey, 2nd Viscount de Vesci]]. He married secondly Catherine Hall, daughter of Roger Hall of Mount Hall, [[County Down]], by whom he  had  ten  more children, including Elizabeth, who married [[John Bligh, 4th Earl of Darnley]].

Charles, his eldest surviving son and heir, was the father of [[Charles Brownlow, 1st Baron Lurgan]].

'''William Parish Chilton''' (August 10, 1810 – January 20, 1871) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from [[Alabama]] to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]] from 1861 to 1862.

==Early life==
Called Will Chilton, he was born in [[Columbia, Kentucky]], on August 10, 1810, the ninth child of Rev. Thomas John Chilton (a slave-owning Baptist minister) and Margaret Bledsoe, sister of [[Jesse Bledsoe]]. He was a younger brother of [[Thomas Chilton]], Representative from Kentucky and ghost writer of an "autobiography" by [[David Crockett]]. When Chilton was 14 months old his large family was among the victims of the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]]. As a teenager he left home to live in Tennessee with an older sister, Jane, and her husband Charles Metcalfe. He [[read law]] with Return J. Meigs III in [[Athens, Tennessee]], passed the bar in 1828, and began to practice law.

==Career==
In 1831 Chilton moved to [[Talladega, Alabama]]. In 1839 he was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to represent his county in the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]. Chilton campaigned vigorously for [[William Henry Harrison]] in 1840 and [[Henry Clay]] in 1844. In 1843 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress. While practicing law in Talladega, he tutored his brother-in-law [[John Tyler Morgan]], who passed the bar in 1845. In 1846 he established a law school in [[Tuskegee]]. On December 31, 1847 the state legislature elected Chilton an Associate Justice of the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]. He became Chief Justice December 2, 1852 and served until January 2, 1856. After retiring from the bench, he established a law partnership with [[William Lowndes Yancey]]. In 1859 he was elected to the [[Alabama Senate|state Senate]] from Macon County.

==American Civil War==
Chilton originally opposed secession, but once Alabama decided to join the [[Confederate States of America]] he became a supporter.  Elected to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]], which met in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] on February 4, 1861 it was Chilton's task to call the convention to order as the representative of the district where the body met.  After electing [[Howell Cobb]] as presiding officer, on February 9 the Provisional Congress elected [[Jefferson Davis]] as President. On February 18, Davis arrived in Montgomery to take his oath of office; he was escorted into the capitol building by Chilton and [[Robert Rhett]]. After Davis completed his speech to the Provisional Congress, in which he indicated that he would accept the presidency, Chilton made a motion that the body adjourn and then reconvene on the front steps of the capitol, making possible the well-known photos of Davis taking his oath of office. Members of the Provisional Congress were divided on the choice of a permanent capital. Chilton advocated for Montgomery so forcefully that earned disaffection of colleagues who advocated for [[Richmond, Virginia]], which was eventually chosen.

Chilton won election to the [[1st Confederate States Congress|First]] and [[2nd Confederate States Congress]]. After the war he returned to Montgomery, both physically worn out from his legislative service and in constrained financial circumstances. When the Confederate Congress was not in session Chilton served as a private in Harrison's Company of Alabama Rebels, a home guard unit.

==Later life and death==
After the war Chilton returned to practicing and teaching law; by 1870 he had managed to recoup most of his financial losses. He was also elected Grand Master of Alabama's Masonic Grand Lodge. In late 1870 or early 1871 Chilton was injured in a fall down the stairs. He died at his home in Montgomery on January 20, 1871.  He was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Findagrave|8025338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Chilton's descendants included:

* [[Bart Chilton]] (great-great-grandson), U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission member
* [[Thomas H. Chilton]] (grandson), chemical engineer and professor
* [[Robert A. Lovett]] (great-grandson), U.S. Secretary of Defense

==Legacy==
[[Chilton County, Alabama]] (established 1868 as Baker County, renamed Chilton in 1874), is named after him.

==Biography==
Wovoka was born in the [[Smith Valley]] area southeast of [[Carson City, Nevada]], around 1856. Quoitze Ow was his birth name.&lt;ref&gt;Hittman,"Wovoka And The Ghost Dance:Expanded Edition" (Lincoln, Nebraska:University of Nebraska:Press 1997) 47&lt;/ref&gt; Wovoka's father was Numu-tibo'o (sometimes called Tavibo), who for several decades was incorrectly believed to be [[Wodziwob]], a religious leader who had founded the Ghost Dance of 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, Cora "The 1870 Ghost Dance"  ''Anthropological Records'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (1939) (Berkeley, California; University of California Press) 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; From the age of eight until almost thirty Wovoka often worked for David Wilson, a [[rancher]] in the [[Yerington, Nevada]] area, and his wife Abigail, who gave him the name Jack Wilson when dealing with European Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Hittman, Michael ''Wovoka And The Ghost Dance: Expanded Edition'' (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press 1997) 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; David Wilson was a devout [[Christian]], and Wovoka learned [[Christian theology]] and [[Bible stories]] while living with him.&lt;ref&gt;Hittman, ''Wovoka'' 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his chief sources of authority among Paiutes was his alleged ability to control the weather.  He was said to have caused a block of ice to fall out of the sky on a summer day, to be able to end drought with rain or snow, to light his pipe with the sun, and to form icicles in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wovoka and the ghost dance|last=Hittman |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8032-7308-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wovoka claimed to have had a [[prophet]]ic vision during the [[solar eclipse of January 1, 1889]]. Wovoka's vision entailed the [[resurrection]] of the Paiute dead, and the removal of whites and their works from [[North America]]. Wovoka taught that in order to bring this vision to pass, the Native Americans must live righteously and perform a traditional round dance, known as the [[Ghost Dance]].

Anthropologists, historians, and theologians alike provide conflicting accounts on when and how Wovoka had his vision. One scholar of religions, Tom Thatcher, cites James Mooney's Smithsonian-sponsored anthropological report to claim that Wovoka received his first vision while chopping wood for David Wilson in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thatcher|first=Tom|date=Autumn 1998|title=Empty Metaphors and Apocalyptic Rhetoric|jstor=1466133|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=66|pages=549–570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, historian Paul Bailey utilized Mooney's work along interviews with Wovoka's contemporaries and interpreters to assert that he received the vision after entering a two-day trance, awaking in tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wovoka: The Indian Messiah|last=Bailey|first=Paul|publisher=Westernlore Press|year=1957|isbn=9781258823382|location=Los Angeles|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, shortly after receiving the vision and its message, it moved quickly beyond his local Paiute community by word of mouth to Native American tribes further east, notably the [[Lakota people|Lakota]].

The Ghost Dance movement is known for being practiced by the victims of the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. Before the Ghost dance reached Native Americans on South Dakota plains reservations, interest in the movement came from U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Office]],  [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department,]] and multiple Native American tribal delegations. Many tribes would arrive in Mason to listen to Wovoka intently, but language barriers existed. Visiting tribes came from different cultures, geographies, and linguistic traditions. Few delegation members could speak Wovoka's mother tongue of Paiute. This led to tribes adopting a militant form of Wovoka's teachings that emphasized an impending battle leading to the creation of the [[Ghost shirt|Ghost Shirts]] worn by Sioux and Lakota at the subsequent massacre.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCann Jr.|first=Frank D.|year=1966|title=The Ghost Dance, Last hope of Western Tribes, Unleashed the Final Tragedy|jstor=4517018|journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=16|pages=25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Native American Leaders, such as  [[Miniconjou]], [[Arnold Short Bull|Short Bull]] and [[Kicking Bear]] allegedly adopted violent interpretations that emphasized the possible elimination of whites. However, Wovoka never left his home in Nevada to become an active participant in the dance's dissemination in the U.S. interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wovoka: The Indian Messiah|last=Bailey|first=Paul|publisher=Westernlore Press|year=1957|isbn=9781258823382|location=Los Angeles|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Agents, soldiers, and other federal officials were predisposed towards a militaristic posture and outright violence upon encountering the movement.

==Post-Wounded Knee Life and Death==
Wovoka was disheartened by how events unfolded at the massacre. He still remained a prominent Native American leader until his death.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;  Sometime between 1894-1896, he was reported to have been a sideshow attraction at a San Francisco Midwinter Fair Carnival. In 1917, an agent for the Nevada Agency named L.A. Dorrington tracked down Wovoka to report on his whereabouts to Washington. Curious to see if the former Native American messiah had any ties to Native American [[Peyotism]], Dorrington found that Wovoka was instead living a humble life in Mason. He abstained from the practice, worked as an occasional medicine man, and traveled to events on reservations across the United States.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Omer C.|year=1977|title=Contemporary Document on Wovoka (Jack Wilson_ Prophet of the Ghost Dance in 1890|jstor=481696|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=24|pages=219–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wovoka died in Yerington on September 20, 1932, and is interred in the Paiute Cemetery in the town of [[Schurz, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-wovoka.html |title= Wovoka - Paiute Medicine Man &amp; the Ghost Dance|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Native American band [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]] named their 1973 album [[Wovoka (album)|''Wovoka'']], and the title song, after the prophet.

Wowaus was the son of William Sudbury, a Christian Indian leader&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/node/479|title=Literacy and the Printing Press|last=|first=|date=|website=Peabody museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard University|publisher=Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard University|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Hassanemesit (today Grafton, Massachusetts). Wowaus became fluent in English as a student at an Indian charity school. He attended Harvard's [[Indian College]] and worked as an apprentice at [[Samuel Green (printer)|Samuel Green]]'s printing press, "The Cambridge Press",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanantiquarian.org/EnglishtoAlgonquian/cambridgepress|title=Cambridge Press|last=|first=|date=|website=From English to Algonquin: Early New England Translations|publisher=americanantiquarian.org|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in 1659. There, he became known by the English name, James Printer. In addition to the Indian Bible, Wowaus assisted Samuel Green in printing many of the Algonquian-language texts that were in circulation throughout the American colonies from 1658 to 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanantiquarian.org/EnglishtoAlgonquian/jamesprinter|title=Wowaus, or James Printer (d. 1717)|last=|first=|date=|website=From English to Algonquin: Early American Translations|publisher=americanantiquarian.org|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne''' (9 October 1727 &amp;ndash; 19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346774/Etienne-Charles-de-Lomenie-de-Brienne|title=Étienne-Charles de Loménie de Brienne - French cardinal and statesman|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; February 1794) was a [[France|French]] churchman, [[politician]] and [[List of Finance Ministers of France|finance minister]] of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Paris]], of a [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] family traceable back to the 15th century. After a brilliant career as a student, he entered the Church, this being the best way to attain a distinguished position. In 1751 he became a doctor of [[theology]], though there were doubts as to the orthodoxy of his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09340a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1752 he was appointed grand vicar to the [[Archbishop of Rouen]]. After visiting [[Rome]], he was made [[Bishop of Condom]] (1760), and in 1763 was translated to the [[archbishopric of Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09340a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His many famous friends included [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|A. R. J. Turgot]], [[André Morellet]] and [[Voltaire]], and in 1770 he was elected to the [[Académie française]]. He was three times head of the ''bureau de jurisdiction'' at the general assembly of the clergy. He also took an interest in political and social questions of the day, and addressed to Turgot a number of ''memoires'' on these subjects, one of them, treating of pauperism, being especially remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783/The_French_Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, in the Assembly of Notables, he led the opposition to the fiscal policy of [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]]. He was then appointed head of the ''conseil des finances'' in April. Once in power, he succeeded in making the ''[[parlement]]'' register edicts dealing with internal [[free trade]], the establishment of provincial assemblies and the redemption of the [[corvée]].  In May 1788 the process of tax collection was faulting and the loyalty of the army was slipping.  As a result, Louis XVI suspended parliaments in May 1788 and created 47 courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=72|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''parlement'' refused to register edicts on the stamp duty and the proposed new general land-tax, he persuaded Louis XVI to hold a ''[[Bed of Justice|lit de justice]]'', to enforce their registration. To crush the opposition to these measures, he persuaded Louis to exile the ''parlement'' to [[Troyes]] (18 August 1787). When the ''parlement'' agreed to prolong the direct tax on all kinds of income, he recalled the councillors to Paris. A further attempt to force the ''parlement'' to register an edict for raising a loan of 120 million livres met with determined opposition. The struggle of the ''parlement'' against the incapacity of Brienne ended on 8 May in its consenting to an edict for its own abolition, with the proviso that the [[French Estates-General|Estates-General]] should be summoned to remedy the disorders of the state.  He resigned as finance minister on 25 August 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brienne, who had in the meantime been made [[Archbishop of Sens]], now faced almost universal opposition. He was forced to suspend the ''Cour plenière'' which had been set up to take the place of the ''parlement'', and to promise that the States-General should be summoned. Even these concessions were not enough to keep him in power, and on 29 August he had to retire, leaving the treasury empty. On 15 December following, he was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and went to [[Italy]], where he spent two years. After the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] he returned to France, and took the oath of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] in 1790. He was repudiated by [[Pope Pius VI]], and in 1791 had to give up the [[biretta]]. He was also one of the few prelates of the [[Ancien regime|old regime]] to swear the civic oath required by the [[French Constitution of 1791|revolutionary civil constitution]].&lt;ref name="Schama240"&gt;Schama, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired to an abbey confiscated in the Revolution. He repudiated Catholicism in 1793, at the height of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Etienne-Charles de Loménie de Brienne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both his past and present conduct made him an object of suspicion to the revolutionaries; he was arrested at Sens on 9 November 1793, and died in prison, either of an apoplectic stroke or by poison.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tombes-sepultures.com/crbst_1064.html&lt;/ref&gt;
