[[File:Abrogans 1stpage.jpg|thumb|First page of the St. Gall Codex Abrogens (Stiftsbibliothek, cod. 911) Heading: INCIPIUNT CLOSAS EX VETERE TESTAMENTO ("Here begins the commentary on the Old Testament")]]
'''''Abrogans''''', also '''''German Abrogans''''' or '''''Codex Abrogans''''' (St Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. 911), is a [[Middle Latin]]–[[Old High German]] [[glossary]], whose preserved copy in the [[Abbey Library of St Gall]] is regarded as the oldest preserved book in the German language.

Dating from the 8th century {{daterange|(765{{ndash}}775)}}, the glossary contains approximately 3,670 Old High German words in over 14,600 examples and is therefore a valuable source for the knowledge of the oldest Upper German language. It was named by German researchers after [[Incipit|its first entry]]: ''abrogans = dheomodi'' ([[Modern German]]: ''demütig'' = modest, humble).

On several occasions the South Tyrolean bishop [[Arbeo of Freising]] († 783 or 784) or the Benedictine monk [[Kero (Monk)|Kero]] are named as authors.

==General Information==
The German Abrogans is a [[Latin]]-[[Old High German]] [[thesaurus]], which was not, however, produced from a collection of Latin-Old High German translations, but structured on a pure Latin, alphabetically sorted thesaurus. This Latin-Latin glossary, the Latin Abrogans, was probably compiled in Italy (possibly in the important southern Italian monastery [[Cassiodorus#Monastery at Vivarium|Vivarium]]) of numerous older late-antiquity and early medieval glossaries. Thus arose a dictionary in which rare expressions, above all from biblical Latin, were explained.

The dictionary was likely finally translated into German in the second half of the 8th century in the old Bavarian [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|bishopric Freising]], which came under control of the bishop Arbeo (he was bishop here from 764 to 783). At the same time both the Latin key word and its Latin reproduction were entered with the Old High German equivalents. For example:

{| border="1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8"
| faterlih
| fater
|-
| abba
| pater
|}

This was a process which around the middle of the 8th century many times had to lead to poor translations, for example lapsing into other parts of speech. Nevertheless, the Abrogans offers tremendous material for [[linguistics]], which still today is not yet completely analyzed. So there are about 700 words that otherwise no longer appear in any other Old High German texts.

==Tradition==
No specimens from the time of origin of the glossary in the 8th century have been saved. Only three younger [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] copies of the Bavarian document are preserved. The best, albeit mangled handwriting is the direct copy of the [[archetype]] that was made around 810 in [[Murbach]] for [[Charlemagne]] (Baesecke) or in [[Regensburg]] under Bishop [[Baturich]] ([[Bernhard Bischoff]]). (Paris, Bibl. Nat., cod. lat. 7640, f. 124r-132v).

An '''anacoluthon''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ə|k|ə|ˈ|lj|uː|θ|ɒ|n}} {{respell|AN|ə|kə|LEW|thon}}; from the Greek ''anakolouthon'', from ''an-'': "not" and ἀκόλουθος ''akólouthos'': "following") is an unexpected discontinuity in the expression of ideas within a sentence, leading to a form of words in which there is logical incoherence of thought. Anacolutha are often sentences interrupted midway, where there is a change in the syntactical structure of the sentence and of intended meaning following the interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |title=Anacoluthon - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425165000/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the Italian proverb "The good stuff – think about it."&lt;ref&gt;''Alla buona derrata, pensaci su'', from {{cite book | last1 = Mawr | first = E.B. | year = 1885 | title = Analogous Proverbs in Ten Languages | page = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb urges people to make the best choice. When anacoluthon occurs unintentionally it is considered to be an error in sentence structure, and results in incoherent nonsense. However, it can be used as a rhetorical technique to challenge the reader to think more deeply, or in "[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]" literature to represent the disjointed nature of associative thought. Anacoluthon is very common in informal speech, where a speaker might start to say one thing, then break off and abruptly and incoherently continue, expressing a completely different line of thought. When such speech is reported in writing, a dash (—) is often included at the point of discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gowers | first = E. | year = 1973 | title = The Complete Plain Words | page = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The listener is expected to ignore the first part of the sentence, although in some cases it might contribute to the overall meaning in an impressionistic sense.

==Examples==
*"Had ye been there – for what could that have done?" ([[John Milton]] in ''Lycidas'')

In [[Paradise Lost]], [[John Milton]] uses an anacoluthon with Satan's first words to illustrate his initial confusion:
*"If thou beest he; but O how fallen! How changed" (I.83)

[[William Shakespeare]] uses anacoluthon in his history plays such as in this (''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' IV iii 34-6):
*"Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
*:That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
*:Let him depart."

Additionally, [[Conrad Aiken]]'s ''Rimbaud and Verlaine'' has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:
*"Discussing, between moves, [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] and [[spondee]]
*:Anacoluthon and the open vowel
*:God the great peacock with his [[angel]] peacocks
*:And his dependent peacocks the bright stars..."

[[Franz Kafka]] uses perhaps the most famed example of anacoluthon as the first line of [[The Metamorphosis]]:
"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin."

==Etymology==
The word ''anacoluthon'' is a [[transliteration]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακόλουθον}} (''anakólouthon''), which derives from the [[privative]] prefix {{lang|el|ἀν-}} (''an-'') and the root adjective {{lang|el|ἀκόλουθος}} (''akólouthos''), "following". This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase ''[[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]'' in [[logic]].  However, in Classical rhetoric anacoluthon was used ''both'' for the logical error of ''non sequitur'' and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.

==Use of the term==

The term "anacoluthon" is used primarily within an academic context.  It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry.  For example ''[[The King's English]]'', an English [[style guide]] written by [[H. W. Fowler]] and [[F. G. Fowler]], mentions it as a major grammatical mistake.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can hardly conclude even so desultory a survey of grammatical misdemeanours as this has been without mentioning the most notorious of all. The anacoluthon is a failure to follow on, an unconscious departure from the grammatical scheme with which a sentence was started, the getting switched off, imperceptibly to the writer, very noticeably to his readers, from one syntax track to another."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term does occasionally appear in popular media as well.  The word, though not the underlying meaning (see [[malapropism]]), has been popularized, due to its use as an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] by [[Captain Haddock]] in the English translations of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series of books.

'''Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached''' is a slogan popularized in the late 19th century by Indian Hindu monk [[Swami Vivekananda]], who took inspiration in a ''[[shloka|sloka]]'' of ''[[Katha Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref name="CCMT"&gt;{{Harvnb|CCMT|2007|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his message to the [[Hindu]]s to get out of their hypnotized state of mind.{{sfn|Vivekananda|2009|p=166}}

== In Katha Upanishad ==
{{See also|Nachiketa|Katha Upanishad}}
[[Nachiketa]], the child protagonist of Katha Upanishad, was sent to [[Yama]], the Hindu god of death, by his father [[Vajashrava]]. In the abode of Yama, he answered Nachiketa's questions and taught him Self-knowledge and the methods of ''[[Yoga]]''. The words "Arise, awake..." can be found in the 1.3.14 chapter of the book, where Yama is advising Nachiketa—&lt;ref name="Krishnananda Kath Upanishad"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kath Upanishad|url=http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/katha1/katha1_verses1-3.html|publisher=Swami Krishnanda The Divine Life Society|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Swami Vivekananda's teachings ==
[[File:Swami Vivekananda in London 1895.jpg|thumb|180px|Swami Vivekananda widely used this quote in his teachings.]]
The inspirational ''sloka'' was [[Swami Vivekananda]]'s message to the [[Hindu]]s to get out of their hypnotized state of mind.{{sfn|Vivekananda|2009|p=166}} The ''sloka'' was meant as a call to his countrymen to awaken their "sleeping soul" and propagate the message of peace and blessings given by the "ancient Mother" to the world. &lt;!-- "Awake" also refers to awakening of god resident in one's self as soul is "infinite, omnipotent, and omniscient."  --&gt;"Awake" also denotes the awakening of one's real nature and the consequent ushering in of prosperity.{{sfn|Vivekananda|2009|p=166}}

On 24 April 1897 Vivekananda wrote a letter to Sarala Ghoshal. In that letter he stressed giving the public only positive education, because of his belief that negative thoughts weaken men. In that letter, he also reiterated this ''sloka''.&lt;ref name="The Education That India Needs"&gt;[[Wikisource:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Translation: Prose/The Education that India needs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda quoted this ''sloka'' in several lectures and discourses. In a lecture delivered on 12 November 1896 at Lahore, he said:&lt;ref name="12 November 1897 lecture"&gt;[[Wikisource:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 3/Lectures from Colombo to Almora/The Vedanta]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, young men of Lahore, raise once more that mighty banner of Advaita, for on no other ground can you have that wonderful love until you see that the same Lord is present everywhere. Unfurl that banner of love! "Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached." Arise, arise once more, for nothing can be done without renunciation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her essay ''Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda'', [[Sister Christine]] wrote that Vivekananda wanted to see men striving to find [[God|the Supreme]]. She wrote:&lt;ref name="Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda Christine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/reminiscences/146_sc.htm|accessdate=9 September 2013|author=Sister Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; All else might be false, this alone was true. He realized it. After his own great realization, life held but one purpose — to give the message with which he was entrusted, to point out the path and to help others on the road to the same supreme goal. "Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Arise" was meant as a passionate call for national awakening to obtain political freedom for the country from [[colonialism]], and to not to "stop" until the "goal" was achieved. This was essential in the social, economic and political fields. "Arise" was also intended to mean to get out of the state of helplessness. &lt;!-- The indomitable energy within each individual would need to be aroused which would assure freedom from miseries and ensure prosperity.  --&gt;His emphasis was on freedom to the nation, as in the US on 4 July 1776.{{sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=308}} Swamiji also urged people to learn from Hindu sacred scriptures, which he felt contained all the instructions to arise out of the "hypnotism of weakness" and which indicated that no individual is inherently weak.{{sfn|Natesan|1948|p=150}}

== Influence ==
The 1998 film ''[[Swami Vivekananda (1998 film)|Swami Vivekananda]]'', directed by G. V. Iyer, ends with this quote where [[Mammootty]] gives a brief speech on Vivekananda and his ideals and concludes the speech with this quote. On 12 January 2013, on the 150 birth anniversary, then [[Gujarat]] Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and now prime minister of India, wrote a blog post on his personal website to pay tribute to Vivekananda. He named the post "Commemorating Swami Vivekananda: Arise, Awake and stop not till the goal is reached".&lt;ref name="Modi blog post 12 Jan 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Commemorating Swami Vivekananda: Arise, Awake and stop not till the goal is reached |url=http://www.narendramodi.in/opeds/commemorating-swami-vivekananda-arise-awake-and-stop-not-till-the-goal-is-reached/ |publisher=Narendra modi official website |accessdate=9 September 2013 |author=Narendra Modi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901093933/http://www.narendramodi.in/opeds/commemorating-swami-vivekananda-arise-awake-and-stop-not-till-the-goal-is-reached/ |archivedate=1 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sloka'' is inscribed on the main stage of an auditorium of [[Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture]], Kolkata, a branch of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, an Indian author, called this a "life-transforming line" and wrote a book named ''Stop Not Till the Goal is Reached'' in 2010.&lt;ref name="Kumar preface"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kumar|2010|pp=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacquot elie 1931 brevet etat major ecole superieure guerre.jpg|thumb|200px|A "Brevet d'état-major" certificate awarded to [[Pierre-Elie Jacquot]] in 1931]]

A '''''Brevet d'état-major''''' ([[French language|French]]; literally "Staff Officer Brevet"), commonly abbreviated to '''BEM''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;This form is most commonly seen in titles, where it replaces the [[Adjective|adjectival]] form ("''Breveté d'état-major''"). It is placed after the rank in formal titles, for example "Colonel BEM P. Verbruggen".[http://www.mil.be/ops-trg/units/index.asp?LAN=fr&amp;FILE=&amp;ID=792&amp;MENU=756&amp;PAGE=1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; is a military distinction in [[France]] and [[Belgium]] which denotes that an officer has passed [[Staff College]]. Though it is usually only seen in French, it can be abbreviated to '''SBH''' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Various|title=Geschiedenis van het Belgisch Leger|volume=II: van 1920 tot heden|publisher=Centrum voor historische dokumentatie van de Krijgsmacht|year=1988|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===France===
In France, the distinction was awarded between 1870 and 1940 after passing a course at the [[Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|then-''École Supérieure de Guerre'']].

===Belgium===
A BEM was awarded for studying a one-year course known as a "''Cycle d'études supérieures d'état-major''" at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|then-''École de Guerre'']] in Brussels, however, this was changed to a much more lengthy course and its bestowal only after being considered by a military panel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mil.be/rdc/subject/index.asp?LAN=fr&amp;FILE=&amp;ID=738&amp;PAGE=4&amp;MENU=0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornhole''' (sometimes '''corn hole''') is a [[sexual slang]] [[vulgarism]] for [[anus]].&lt;ref name="Munier"&gt;Munier, Alexis (2010).
''The Big Black Book of Very Dirty Words.'' Adams Media, {{ISBN|9781440509605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term came into use in the 1910s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Jonathon (2006). ''Cassell's Dictionary of Slang: A Major New Edition of the Market-Leading Dictionary of Slang.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., {{ISBN|9780304366361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[verb]] form ''to cornhole'', which came into usage in the 1930s, means to have [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;Burke, David (2003). ''The Slangman Guide to Dirty English: Dangerous Expressions Americans Use Every Day.'' Slangman Publishing, {{ISBN|9781891888236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connotations and variants==

The term is apparently derived "from the practice in the days of the [[outhouse]] of using dried [[corn cob]]s for [[toilet paper]]."&lt;ref name="McConville"&gt;McConville, Brigid; Shearlaw, John (1984). ''The Slanguage of Sex.'' Macdonald, {{ISBN|9780356103402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richter"&gt;Richter, Alan (1987). ''The Language of Sexuality.'' McFarland, {{ISBN|9780899502458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 20th century, the term was used among American criminals.&lt;ref name="Monteleone"&gt;Monteleone, Vincent Joseph (1949). ''Criminal Slang: The Vernacular of the Underground Lingo.'' The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., {{ISBN|9781584773009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1944 report on same-sex [[prison rape]], the term had taken on a more specific meaning of taking the [[sexual penetration|penetrative]] role in anal sex.&lt;ref name="greco"&gt;Greco, MC; Wright, JC (1944). The correctional institution in the etiology of chronic homosexuality. ''[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]'', Volume 14, Issue 2, pages 295–307, April 1944 DOI: 10.1111/j.1939-0025.1944.tb04878.x&lt;/ref&gt; It was also popularized in part through use in [[gay culture]].&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, Paul (2004). ''Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|9780826473431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;Reuter, Donald F. (2006). ''Gay-2-Zee: A Dictionary of Sex, Subtext, and the Sublime.'' Macmillan, {{ISBN|9780312354275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar context, a ''corn husk'' is a "[[condom]]", especially one manufactured for anal intercourse."&lt;ref name="partridge"&gt;Victor/Dalzell eds (2007). ''The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English.'' Psychology Press, {{ISBN|9780415212595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to linguist Jonathan Lighter, ''to cornhole'' and variant non-derived [[synonyms]] have developed as [[compound verbs]]: ''to corncob'' [1975] and ''to corndog'' [1985].&lt;ref name="lighter"&gt;Lighter, Johnathan E. (1997). ''Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, Vol. 2: H-O.'' Random House Reference, {{ISBN|9780679434641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists have noted the verb form as an example of possible compound verbs in English. There is debate whether such words are genuine compounds or pseudo-compounds.&lt;ref name="Dekeyser"&gt;Erdmann, Peter (1999). Compound verbs in English: are they pseudo? In Dekeyser  Xavier; Tops, Guy A. J.;  Geukens, Steven ''Thinking English Grammar: To Honour Xavier Dekeyser, Professor Emeritus.'' Volume 12 of ''Orbis / Supplementa.'' Peeters Publishers, {{ISBN|9789042907638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornholio, the alter ego of [[Beavis]] from ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', is a play on the word ''cornhole'', as his [[catch phrase]] is  “I am the Great Cornholio! I need [[Toilet paper|TP]] for my [[bunghole]]!"&lt;ref name="weinstock"&gt;Weinstock, Jeffrey Andrew (2008). "''Simpsons'' Did It!" ''South Park'' as differential signifier. in ''Taking South Park Seriously''. SUNY Press, {{ISBN|9780791475669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;Kellner, Douglas (2004). ''Beavis and Butt-Head'': No Future for Postmodern Youth. In Steinberg, Shirley R.; Kincheloe, Joe. ''Kinderculture: The Corporate Construction Of Childhood. Westview Press, {{ISBN|9780813391540}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornholio in turn became inspiration for the cocktail the Flaming Cornholio.&lt;ref name="Gatti"&gt;Gatti, Susan Irvin (2003). Fuzzy navels and slippery nipples: A sociolinguistic reading of the cocktail menu. The Journal of American Culture, Volume 26, Issue 1, pages 104–110, March 2003 DOI: 10.1111/1542-734X.00078&lt;/ref&gt;

'''@dril''' is a [[pseudonym]]ous [[Twitter]] user best known for his idiosyncratic style of [[absurdist humor]] and [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]]. The account, its author, and the character associated with the tweets are all commonly referred to as '''dril''' (the handle without the [[at sign]]) or '''wint''' (the account's display name), both rendered lowercase but often capitalized by others. Since his first tweet in 2008, dril has become a popular and influential Twitter user with more than one million followers.

dril is one of the most notable accounts associated with "[[Weird Twitter]]", a subculture on the site that shares a surreal, ironic sense of humor. The character associated with dril is highly distinctive, often described as a bizarre reflection of a typical male American Internet user. dril's tweets are frequently [[satirical]]. Other social media users have repurposed dril's tweets for humorous or satiric effect in a variety of political and cultural contexts. Many of dril's tweets, phrases, and tropes have become familiar parts of [[Internet slang]].

The author behind dril remained unknown for years, with the few available details about the author's life fueling speculation about his identity. In 2017, dril's author was "[[doxxed]]" (in other words, his identity was exposed) in a post that went viral and received media attention. After the doxxing, many Twitter users and journalists preferred to preserve dril's pseudonymity out of respect for the author's personal privacy and the character's mystique.

Beyond tweeting, dril has created [[Animated cartoon|animated short films]] and contributed illustrations and writing to other artists' collaborative projects. dril's first book, ''[[Dril Official "Mr. Ten Years" Anniversary Collection]]'' (2018), is a compilation of the account's "greatest hits" alongside new illustrations. Writers have praised dril for the originality and humor of his tweets; for example, the poet [[Patricia Lockwood]] called dril "a master of tone [and] character,"&lt;ref name="lockwood lecture" /&gt; and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' dubbed him "arguably the most [[iconic]] Twitter account in the history of [[social media]]."&lt;ref name="AV unmasked" /&gt;

== Biography and identity ==
Before the [[Twitter]] account, dril was a poster at the [[Something Awful]] [[Internet forum|forums]] under the name "gigantic drill".&lt;ref name="weird survey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; According to former Something Awful admin David Thorpe, dril was "just a guy who was posting funny stuff on there," but never one of the site's featured front page writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to Will Oremus at ''Slate'', the popularity of the "no" tweet is an example of how "[[The medium is the message|the]] [[metadata]] [[The medium is the message|is the message]]" on social media, as metrics like retweets provide important context and carry independent meaning, akin to a [[laugh track]] on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Critics have described dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, most of all those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to ''[[The A.V.

In a lecture given at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], American poet [[Patricia Lockwood]] described dril as a literary [[alter ego]] of Twitter users and the Internet in general. Comparing the account's persona to Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist of [[John Kennedy Toole]]'s novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980), Lockwood cited dril as an example of new possibilities in [[first-person narrative]] that could be explored online. Lockwood said of dril:

{{quote|He is a master of [[Tone (literature)|tone]], he is a master of [[Character (arts)|character]]; his accidents are not accidents and his spelling mistakes are not mistakes. His character is the anonymous psycho of the [[Comments section|comments box]]. He has been banned from every forum. He is all-present and nothing-knowing. He is the [[corn syrup]] addiction of America and he is an expired [[Applebee's]] coupon. We worship him in a big, nude church while the police blast [[Kenny Loggins]] and wait for us to come out. We will never come out. We like Kenny Loggins.&lt;ref name="lockwood lecture"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://media.sas.upenn.edu/watch/144691 |people=[[Patricia Lockwood|Lockwood, Patricia]] (lecturer) | date=April 11, 2013 | title=Launch Event for Twit Crit | medium=videotaped lecture | location=The United States | publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]| time=11:14–14:30 |accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Comparisons to Donald Trump===
{{See also|Donald Trump on social media}}
[[File:Donald Trump "Putting our MINORS back to work" (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=Trump at a rally. A video caption promises that "we are putting our minors back to work", misspelling "miner" (mine worker) as "minor" (underage person).|Screenshot of a [[Donald Trump]] video post on [[Facebook]] with a typo. Commentators have frequently drawn comparisons between [[Donald Trump on social media|Trump's social media presence]] and dril.]]

There are several people whose voices on social media are often compared to dril's—the musician and actor [[Ice-T]] is one&lt;ref name="DD Ice-T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ice Vice Baby" /&gt;—but [[Donald Trump]] is likely the most common comparison. Commentators have frequently compared dril to Trump (and vice versa), particularly [[Donald Trump on social media|Trump's voice on Twitter and other social media platforms]].&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; "Both," according to Purdom, "are aging, endlessly aggrieved white men who seemingly do not understand core components of the internet, yet they perfectly embody its anonymous rage, its ability to turn people into lunatics being swarmed and eaten alive by enemies and trolls."&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; 

In a 2016 article for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Brian Feldman argued that Trump should choose dril as his vice-presidential running mate—a position that was later filled by then-[[Governor of Indiana]] [[Mike Pence]]—because the writer perceived commonalities between dril's "incoherent, [[libidinous]], [[authoritarian]] [[Spamming|comment-spam]]" and Trump's own campaign tweeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Motivation and satirical elements ===
Most of dril's writing is understood to be absurd, surreal, ironic, or nonsensical. Yohann Koshy in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' said dril's writing "reads like [[obscene]] [[nonsense verse]]—the syntax mutilated, the humour irredeemable."&lt;ref name="vice satire"&gt;{{cite web

Providing a (supposedly) out-of-character statement to ''BuzzFeed'' for an [[oral history]] on "Weird Twitter," dril commented on the nature of his work and motivation:

{{quote|Twitter, as I understand it, is a sort of "Hell" that I was banished to upon death in my previous life. In this abstract realm, the only thing I am certain of is that my cries are awarded "Favs" or "RTs" when they are particularly miserable or profane. These ethereal merits do nothing to ease my suffering, but I have deliriously convinced myself that gathering enough of them will impress my unseen superiors and grant me a promotion to a higher plane of existence. This is my sole motivation.&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt;}}

Dan Hitchens at Christian journal ''[[First Things]]'' noted, in an article about the use of [[irony]] on social media, that "[m]uch of the art of Twitter consists in appearing to put forward a position while giving the impression that you might be kidding," citing American author [[David Foster Wallace]]'s warnings about the pervasiveness of irony in modern culture.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web

 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hitchens, dril is the "cult account that towers above the rest" in his mastery of irony, and dril's "inspired errors in spelling, logic, and decorum can only be produced by a clever creator, but the creator never lets the mask slip. Half the joke is our joint awareness of @dril's lack of self-awareness."&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

Although dril's content is typically absurd or nonsensical, some have noted an undercurrent of [[satire]] or [[social commentary]] in dril's tweets.&lt;ref name="oxstud" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AV" /&gt; Surveying Weird Twitter for ''Complex'', Gallagher commented that dril's "vicious satire of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], [[gamer]]s, [[conspiracy theorist]]s, and other less savory aspects of the Internet is always on point, always hilarious, always in character."&lt;ref name="weird survey" /&gt; Fellow Weird Twitter user @rare_basement said dril's "[[trolling]] [of] [[Penn State]] fans during [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|the molestation scandal]] was so brilliant, always on the right side of the issue, but super funny and subtle about it."&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt; Although dril does not avow an explicit political identity, the account's politics are generally identified as [[Left-wing politics|leftist]], an alignment common among Weird Twitter users.&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; However, the abstraction and vagueness of dril's tweets have allowed them to be spread and repurposed by people of varying ideologies across the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; Celebrities, journalists, and former members of both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential administrations follow dril,&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt; and even the [[far-right]] ''[[Breitbart News]]'' has quoted dril on its Twitter feed.&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt;

As described by Purdom, finding the dril tweet that matches an event or statement has become an online [[parlor game]], made possible because dril had "rendered a tightly written comedic exaggeration of every daily outrage and conflict from the [[news cycle]] in which we find ourselves trapped."&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; Purdom also found that dril's early preoccupations and sensibility had an outsized, "[[Velvet Underground]]-like influence on the tenor of the internet to come."&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; By the end of 2017, the staff of ''[[Deadspin]]'' declared that "comparing everything to @dril" was a trend that "should die" in 2018, asserting that dril himself remained funny but dril comparisons had become an overused, lazy trope, because too many Twitter users were relying on dril references "as a substitute for an actual joke."&lt;ref name="Kalaf" /&gt;

=== Satirical recontextualization ===
Other social media users frequently quote, [[Recontextualisation|recontextualize]], or [[remix]] dril tweets for their own satirical purposes, and some accounts are even exclusively dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref name="oxstud" /&gt; One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, shares screenshots of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice.&lt;ref name="oxstud" /&gt; Another, "wint MP" or @parliawint, attaches dril tweets styled like [[teletext]] [[closed caption]]s to images from [[BBC News]] of British politicians and journalists speaking.&lt;ref name="vice satire" /&gt; Although seemingly [[Niche market|niche]], the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: "there are people who get the in-jokey references; there's a broader level of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond that there are people who just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous. It's an onion of silliness."&lt;ref name="vice satire" /&gt; Koshy commented that wint MP "stands out from traditional forms of satire because it has no [[Normative ethics|normative force]]. It recommends nothing about [[Is–ought problem|the way things should be]]. The political field it presents is slack-jawed, demented, putrid and amoral – there is no value beyond the scope of its image."&lt;ref name="vice satire" /&gt; According to Shaw in ''The Oxford Student'', the absurd political atmosphere of the mid to late 2010s made it "the Age of Dril":

{{quote|Artefacts like [@parliawint tweets] are perfect satirical tools for the new age of [[reactionism]]. Gluts of nonsense are a political tool; it's been remarked that the Trump administration seems to be trying to exhaust and befuddle the opposition through the sheer volume of bad policies and public scandals, and our political vocabulary is vulgarising at hyperspeed. It's hard to think of a more Dril-like phrase than 'The [[Bowling Green massacre|Bowling Green Massacre]]' [said by [[Kellyanne Conway]]], or indeed '[[Brexit]] Means Brexit' [said by [[Theresa May]]].&lt;ref name="oxstud" /&gt;}}

Not all satirical riffing on dril is political in nature; for example, the account @drilmagic attracted thousands of followers presenting mashups of dril tweets and cards from the game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.&lt;ref name="mic magic"&gt;{{cite web

=== "Corncob" ===
[[File:Cornheap.jpg|thumb|A large heap of [[corncob]]s. A misunderstanding over a reference to dril's "corncob" tweet led one journalist to quip: "The lesson here is clear. Always check for @dril references before you send that tweet."&lt;ref name="ddcc" /&gt;]]

In 2011, dril tweeted the following:

{{tweet

|block         = yes

The tweet describes an argument or similar situation in which one participant has clearly been "[[owned]]" but refuses to acknowledge it or to take a break, instead doubling down and insisting beyond any credibility that they have not been owned.&lt;ref name="Singal"&gt;{{cite web

 |archive-date=September 1, 2017
 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Knibbs, "the ''condition'' of being a corn cob—of allowing yourself to be defined by and reduced to a piercing insistence that a perceived slight has not diminished you—[has] spread far beyond a small corner of Twitter."&lt;ref name="Ringer" /&gt; Among public figures whose recent behavior fit the "corncob" archetype, Knibbs listed Donald Trump, [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]], actress [[Louise Linton]], [[Kim Kardashian]]'s friend [[Jonathan Cheban]], [[Kanye West]] (noting his numerous outbursts and 2016 song "[[Famous (Kanye West song)|Famous]]"), and [[Taylor Swift]] (noting her 2017 song "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]").&lt;ref name="Ringer" /&gt;

The term "corncob" became controversial after the reference was used in a meme with leftist criticisms of [[Kamala Harris]], a Democrat and Californian Senator who is widely believed to be a [[United States presidential election, 2020|2020 presidential]] contender.&lt;ref name="Singal" /&gt; The political commentator [[Al Giordano]] incorrectly asserted, citing a dated [[Urban Dictionary]] definition of "corncobbed," that "[e]very cretin who has spread this meme needs to reckon with how it uses 'corncob,' a [[rape culture]] and [[homophobic]] term popular among dudebros."&lt;ref name="Singal" /&gt; [[Neera Tanden]], the president of the [[Center for American Progress]] and an advisor on Hillary Clinton's [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign]], called on a Twitter user—an [[Ohio State]] student—to "denounce" the corncob meme.&lt;ref name="Singal" /&gt; Various news publications reported on the story, and noted that the fast pace of Twitter discourse and unusual [[slang]] and in-jokes meant that a misunderstanding — or failure to properly look up a term — risked embarrassment and mocking for prominent Twitter users like Giordano and Tanden;&lt;ref name="ddcc"&gt;{{cite web

=== "Large adult sons" ===
dril tweets often riff on his relationships with family members—particularly an unnamed wife, ex-wife, and multiple sons—in a manner reminiscent of father figures in American sitcoms like ''[[Married… With Children]]''.&lt;ref name="Purdom" /&gt; [[Jia Tolentino]], a staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', credited dril as an originator of the "large adult son" [[Trope (literature)|trope]].&lt;ref name="son"&gt;{{cite web

}}

Triple parentheses, or "echoes," are used online by the [[alt-right]] as an [[antisemitic]] symbol to highlight the names of [[Jews]]. Journalist Jay Hathaway wrote that most of dril's followers understood the tweet to be an ironic joke exploring the uncertain "etiquette around this very 2016 expression of bigotry ... Can a non-Jew apply the (((echoes))) to his own name as a show of allyship? Is it OK to use the parentheses in a joke at the white supremacists' expense? There’s no clear consensus."&lt;ref name="triple p" /&gt;

As the "(((Keebler Elves)))" tweet spread, some far-right accounts praised dril, interpreting the tweet as a [[Dog-whistle politics|covert signal]] of genuine antisemitic views.&lt;ref name="triple p" /&gt; Others criticized the tweet as bigoted, even if the intent was [[Hipster racism|ironic]], or at least in [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]].&lt;ref name="Mcdonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="triple p" /&gt; In response to the controversy, dril alternated between dismissing those who believed he was a Nazi and making sarcastic promises to become "less racist" with the help of donations.&lt;ref name="Mcdonough" /&gt;&lt;ref group="dril"&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=dril |number=749438005706883072 |date = July 2, 2016 |title=trying to heal..... please donate to my go fund me... $10 will make me less racist... $100 will make me extremely less racist...thank you... |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211215601/https://twitter.com/dril/status/749438005706883072 |archive-date=December 11, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Alexander Mcdonough said dril's "refusal to clarify his views speaks to his trust in his audience to 'get' his jokes" and to dril's confidence in his [[Internet privacy|privacy]].&lt;ref name="Mcdonough" /&gt; "Likewise," Mcdonough wrote, "[dril's] audience trusts him to make pointed satire that crosses boundaries but is never hateful. The joke is always on himself or an entrenched elite, dril never [[wiktionary:punch down|punches down]]."&lt;ref name="Mcdonough" /&gt; According to Mcdonough, the controversy did not seem to have any long-term impact on dril's popularity.&lt;ref name="Mcdonough" /&gt; In the Jewish magazine ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'', Armin Rosen called the tweet "an obviously satirical performance of anti-Jewish bigotry" and "the only funny anti-Semitism meta-controversy in the history of the internet."&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">'''Duro Ladipọ''' (1931–1978) was one of the best known and critically acclaimed [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] dramatists who emerged from postcolonial Africa. Writing solely in the [[Yoruba language]], he captivated the symbolic spirit of [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] mythologies in his plays, which were later adapted to other media such as photography, television and cinema. His most famous play, ''[[Ọba kò so]]'' (The King did not Hang), a dramatization of the traditional Yoruba story of how [[Shango|Ṣango]] became the [[Orisha]] of Thunder, received international acclaim at the first Commonwealth Arts Festival in 1965 and on a [[Europe]]an tour, where a [[Berlin]] critic, [[Ulli Beier]], compared Ladipọ to [[Herbert von Karajan|Karajan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulli Beier, p.c. (1965) to Prof. Herbert F. W. Stahlke.&lt;/ref&gt; Ladipo usually acted in his own plays.

==Early life==
Duro Ladipo was raised in a Christian family. His father was a minister at an Anglican church in [[Osogbo|Oṣogbo]]. However, Ladipo may have been influenced by his grandfather, who migrated to Oṣogbo after the [[Jalumi war]]. His grandfather was well versed in Yoruba mythology, especially those emanating from Old [[Oyo Empire|Ọyọ]], and was known to have worshipped [[Shango|Ṣango]] and [[Oya|Ọya]].

==Career==
Ladipọ tried hard and succeeded in exposing himself to traditional and Yoruba cultural elements, especially when living under the veil of a Christian home. At a young age, he would sneak out of the vicarage to watch Yoruba festivals. This fascination with his culture goaded him into researching and experimenting with theatrical drama and writing. After leaving Oṣogbo, he went to [[Ibadan]], where he became a teacher. While in [[Ibadan]] he became one of the founding members of an artist club called [[Mbari Mbayo]] and became influenced by Beier. He later replicated the club in Oṣogbo, and it became the premier group for promoting budding artists and dramatists in Oṣogbo. Throughout his career, Duro Ladipọ wrote ten Yoruba folk operas combining dance, music, mime, proverbs, drumming and praise songs.

Ladipo started his personal theatre group in 1961, but he became fully established with the founding of the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oṣogbo. His popularity as the leader of a folk opera group rests on his three plays: Ọ''bamoro'' in 1962, Ọ''ba ko so'' and Ọ''ba Waja'' in 1964. (Ọ''ba Waja'' - "The King is Dead" - is based on the same historical event that inspired fellow Nigerian playwright [[Wole Soyinka|Wọle Ṣoyinka]]'s ''[[Death and the King's Horseman]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death and the King's Horseman |last=Soyinka |first=Wole |authorlink=Wole Soyinka |year=2002 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=0-393-32299-8 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also promoted ''Mọremi'', a play about the Yoruba ancestress of the same name. He later transformed Mbari Mbayo into a cultural center, an arts gallery and a meeting point for young artists seeking to develop their talents. Duro Ladipọ wrote quite a number of plays, such as ''Suru Baba Iwa" and "Tanimowo Iku." Some of his plays were also produced for television. In fact, he created ''Bode Wasinimi'' for the Nigerian Television Authority, Ibadan.

In 1977, Duro Ladipo participated in [[Festac '77]], the second world Festival of Black and African Arts and Culture, in Lagos, Nigeria.

They most likely were originally put at the front of the parade for logistical reasons and have remained there as a symbol of LGBT pride, defiance, liberation&lt;ref name="Changing The Subject"&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Jodi |title=Changing The Subject |publisher=Echo NYC |url=http://www.echonyc.com/~women/Issue17/art-obrien.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604124424/http://www.echonyc.com/~women/Issue17/art-obrien.html |archivedate=June 4, 2004 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and empowerment. The contingents are fiercely independent and self-reliant in the [[Do it yourself|DIY]] and [[feminist]] traditions and have been studied as a social phenomenon as a "complex, multilayered form of consumption-related cultural resistance that raises awareness of social injustice and discursively informs social meanings in everyday life outside the festivals."&lt;ref name="The Meanings of Lesbian and Gay"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/089124101030004003 |last=Kates (Monash University) |first=Steven M. |first2=Russell W. |last2=Belk (University of Utah) |title=The Meanings of Lesbian and Gay Pride Day: Resistance through Consumption and Resistance to Consumption |journal=Journal of Contemporary [[Ethnography]] |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2001 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=392–429 |url=http://jce.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/30/4/392 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[drag queen]]s, the DOB have been criticized for not portraying a more acceptable image of LGBT culture but supporters counter that they are seen as highly visible icons of gay pride who refuse to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] and conform to mainstream society [[gender roles]] and indeed remind of the [[Butch and femme|butches]] and queens who helped lead the [[Stonewall riots]] launching the modern [[LGBT social movements|gay-rights movement]].&lt;ref name="Homo Economics: Capitalism, Community"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gluckman |first=Amy |first2=Betsy |last2=Reed |title=Homo Economics: Capitalism, Community, and Lesbian and Gay Life |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2_AggzryxYC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22dykes+on+bikes%22+OR+%22dyke+on+a+bike%22 |accessdate=2007-08-19 |isbn=978-0-415-91379-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dykes on Bikes have been criticized for using the term [[Dyke (slang)|''dyke'']] in their name rather than lesbian but the group has registered the mark in the United States, after a battle to demonstrate that the terms ''diesel-dyke,'' ''bull-dyke,'' ''bull-dagger'' and dyke all have historically negative connotations but have been re-appropriated as self-referential terms of endearment and empowerment distinct from ''lesbian'' and indeed awards and events utilizing those names are now used by the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="Dykes on Bikes and the Regulation"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ilyasova |first=K.

As the US entered World War II in 1941, women were provided opportunities to volunteer for their country and almost 250,000 women served in the armed forces, mostly in the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC), two-thirds of whom were single and under the age of twenty-five.&lt;ref name="The Roots of Gay Oppression"/&gt; Women were recruited with posters showing muscular, short-haired women wearing tight-fitting tailored uniforms.&lt;ref name="The Roots of Gay Oppression"/&gt; [[Bessie Stringfield]], a pioneer African-American female motorcyclist, joined a motorcycle dispatch unit of the army.&lt;ref name="Explore The History: Bessie Stringfield"&gt;{{cite web |title=Explore The History: Bessie Stringfield |publisher=[[Harley-Davidson]] |date=2001 |url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/Women/women_history_4.jsp?locale=en_US |accessdate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first formal appearance of the Dykes on Bikes was in 1976 at San Francisco's Pride parade where the riders were placed first as motorcycles don't always run reliably at the walking pace of the rest of the parade and as first contingent they can move faster. Although the original group self-identified as ''Dykes on Bikes'' and they were known as such, over the years they used ''the Women’s Motorcycle Contingent/ Dykes on Bikes'' to encompass those who identified as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] or any of the newer [[gender-bending]] terms like [[femme]], [[androgyne]] and [[boi (slang)|boi]].&lt;ref name="wmc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dykes on Bikes |work=SF Women's Motorcycle Contingent Dykes on Bikes website |url=http://www.sfwmc.org/ |accessdate=2006-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106185333/http://www.sfwmc.org/ |archivedate=January 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founding member [[Soni Wolf]] was to be the Community Grand Marshal during the [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco Pride parade]] in 2018. Unfortunately, Wolf passed away in April 2018. Her close friends will represent her in the 2018 parade by carrying the custom-painted motorcycle tank from the bike she rode during the inaugural ride in 1976.&lt;ref name="MarkerRideApart"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marker|first1=Jason|title=Dykes on Bikes Founding Member Soni Wolf Passes Away|url=https://rideapart.com/articles/soni-wolf-dead-at-69|website=Ride Apart|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dykes on Bikes have been leading marches such as [[Gay pride parade]]s, [[Gay Games]] events and protests. "[[Dyke March]]es" have become a popular Pride event nationwide with the Dykes on Bikes often leading the marches. The Dyke March events are generally non-commercial, often in sharp contrast to corporate-sponsored pride events, and are usually inclusive of lesbian, bi, and trans women.

==Legal battle to register DOB as a trademark==

Normally the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO), under Section 2(a) of the [[Lanham Act]], will not consider registration of a proposed trademark which contains a term that is [[Disparagement|disparaging]] to a group of people. This presents a problem for the PTO when an attempt is made by a group to register a mark containing a self-disparaging term, as was done with DOB.&lt;ref name="Anten"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anten |first=Todd |title=Self-Disparaging Trademarks and Social Change: Factoring the Reappropriation of Slurs into Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act |journal=Columbia Law Review |volume=106 |issue= |page=338 |year=2006 |url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=106+Colum.+L.+Rev.+388&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=76a90b824fbaa021c4c8bf030fc6220d |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216062507/https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=106+Colum.+L.+Rev.+388&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=76a90b824fbaa021c4c8bf030fc6220d |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; "On February 20, 2004, the PTO refused the registration of the [[Trademark|mark]] 'Dykes on Bikes' under Trademark Act Section 2(a), explaining that a [[reasonable person]] of ordinary sensibilities would recognize that the term “dyke” is disparaging and objectionable to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities."&lt;ref name="Dykes on Bikes and the Regulation"/&gt;

McDermott stated his opposition against any group associated with the annual [[Dyke March]], which he dubbed "the Annual Illegal San Francisco Dyke Hate Riot" in which he and all men are subject to criminal attacks and civil right violations.

An '''Exhibition Designer''' is a professional who creates fixtures and [[display stand]]s for events such as large public [[exhibition]]s, [[Academic conference|conferences]], [[trade show]]s and temporary displays for businesses, [[Museum|museums]], [[Library|libraries]] and [[Art Gallery|art galleries]].

==Duties==

An exhibition designer's work can include:

*presenting their ideas as sketches, scale plans, computer-generated visuals and models
*discussing their ideas with clients
*producing final specifications
*in smaller companies, overseeing the construction of the components (usually in workshops) and assembly and installation at the exhibition venue
*handling orders for supplies
*liaising with technical specialists such as lighting staff
*understanding and interpreting the correct materials and costs involved in constructing the design
*creating large format artwork for backdrops and stand components
*designing vector based artwork for portable displays such as popup stands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition designer {{!}} Job profiles {{!}} National Careers Service|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/exhibition-designer|website=nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
An exhibition designer might be employed as part of a team by an independent studio. Other employers include national and local government, and large organisations such as museums with their own design departments. There is a steady demand for the services of talented and experienced professionals. The work is studio or office based, but will usually also involve visiting clients or exhibition sites and in some cases may also involve being outside (i.e. outdoor zoos, parades).

==Education and Training==
Exhibition Designers may come from many different backgrounds such as [[industrial design]]/[[product design]], [[architecture]], [[interior design]] or [[graphic design]]. Exhibition Designers are responsible for an exhibit from conception to completion and will incorporate many of the following knowledge and skills:

* Conceptual design
* [[computer-aided design|Computer Aided Design]] (CAD) and [[3D visualisation]]
* Knowledge of safety, regulations and applicable standards
* Knowledge of current build methods
* Expertise in [[Mathematics]]
* [[Model making]] skills
* Programming of [[CNC router|CNC]] devices

Many different companies will have their own multi-purpose system that may be used for the construction of smaller Exhibition stands, there are several different systems available and training into the specifics of each is usually conducted on a case by case basis.
For larger stands such as double or triple deckers, a good knowledge of architectural build methods is useful. An exhibition designer will usually work in conjunction with a [structural engineer] to ensure the safe implementation of structural columns and beams. When designing larger stands the designer will take into account all local safety regulations, budget constraints, logistics, design aesthetics and any requirements for electrical and water supply.

'''Final-obstruent devoicing''' or '''terminal devoicing''' is a systematic [[phonological process]] occurring in languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Wolof language|Wolof]]. In such languages, [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[obstruent]]s become voiceless before voiceless consonants and in [[pausa]].

==Dutch and Afrikaans==
In Dutch and [[Afrikaans]], terminal devoicing results in homophones such as {{lang|nl|hard}} 'hard' and {{lang|nl|hart}} 'heart' as well as differences in consonant sounds between the singular and plural forms of nouns, for example {{lang|nl|golf–golven}} (Dutch) and {{lang|af|golf–golwe}} (Afrikaans) for 'wave–waves'.

The history of the devoicing phenomenon within the [[West Germanic languages]] is not entirely clear, but the discovery of a [[Bergakker inscription|runic inscription]] from the early fifth century suggests that this terminal devoicing&lt;ref&gt;B. Mees, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W91nBn0l96wC&amp;pg=PA23 ''The Bergakker inscription and the beginnings of Dutch''], in: Amsterdamer beiträge zur älteren Germanistik: Band 56- 2002, edited by Erika Langbroek, Annelies Roeleveld, Paula Vermeyden, Arend Quak, Published by Rodopi, 2002, {{ISBN|90-420-1579-9}}, {{ISBN|978-90-420-1579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; originated in Frankish. Of the old West Germanic languages, Old Dutch, a descendant of Frankish, is the earliest to show any kind of devoicing, and final devoicing also occurred in Frankish-influenced [[Old French]].

==English==
[[English language|English]] does not have phonological final-obstruent devoicing of the type that neutralizes phonemic contrasts; thus pairs like ''bad'' and ''bat'' are distinct in all major [[regional accents of English speakers|accents of English]]. Nevertheless, voiced obstruents are devoiced to some extent in final position in English, especially when phrase-final or when followed by a voiceless consonant (for example, ''bad cat'' {{IPA|[bæd̥ kʰæt]}}).

[[Old English]] had final devoicing of {{IPA|/v/}}, although the spelling did not distinguish {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[v]}}. It can be inferred from the modern pronunciation of ''half'' with a voiceless {{IPA|/f/}}, from an originally voiced fricative {{IPA|[β]}} in Proto-Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*halbaz}} (preserved in German {{lang|de|halb}} and Gothic {{lang|got-Latn|halba}}). There was also final devoicing of {{IPA|[ɣ]}} to {{IPA|[x]}} finally, evidenced by spellings like {{lang|ang|burh}} alongside {{lang|ang|burg}}.

==German==
Final-obstruents devoicing occurs in the varieties from Northern Germany.{{refn|See {{harvtxt|Ammonn|Bickel|Ebner|Esterhammer|2004|page=LVII}}.}}
The German contrast between [[homorganic]] obstruents is more properly described as a [[fortis and lenis]] opposition than an opposition of voiceless and voiced sounds. Therefore, the term ''devoicing'' may be misleading, since voice is only an optional feature of German lenis obstruents. By contrast, the German term for the phenomenon, {{lang|de|Auslautverhärtung}} ("final-sound hardening"), refers to [[fortition]] rather than devoicing. However, the German phenomenon is similar to the final devoicing in other languages in that the opposition between two different kinds of obstruents disappears at the ends of words, making homophones of such pairs as {{lang|de|Rad}} ("wheel") and {{lang|de|Rat}} ("council, counsel"), both pronounced {{IPA|[ʁaːt]}}. The German varieties of the north, and many pronunciations of Standard German, optionally involve voice in the distinction between fortis and lenis obstruents however.

Some examples from Northern German include:

|}

==Russian==
Final-obstruent devoicing can lead to the [[phonemic differentiation|neutralization]] of [[phonemic contrast]]s in certain environments. For example, Russian {{lang|ru|бес}} ('demon', phonemically {{IPA|/bʲes/}}) and {{lang|ru|без}} ('without', phonemically {{IPA|/bʲez/}}) are pronounced identically in isolation as {{IPA|[bʲes]}}.

The presence of this process in Russian is also the source of the seemingly variant transliterations of Russian names into ''-off'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|-ов}}), especially by the French, as well as older English transcriptions.

==Devoicing in compounds==

In compounds, the behavior varies between languages:
* In some languages, devoicing is [[lexicalized]], which means that words that are devoiced in isolation retain that final devoicing when they are part of a compound. In German, for example, the devoicing of the word {{lang|de|Abend}} {{IPA|[ˈaːbn̩t]}} "evening" is preserved in the compound {{lang|de|Abendsonne}} [ˈaːbn̩tzɔnə]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Abendsonne&lt;/ref&gt;  "evening sun", while the final {{IPA|/d/}} in the plural {{lang|de|Abende}} {{IPA|[ˈaːbn̩də]}} "evenings" retains the voice.
* In other languages, it is purely phonological. which means that voicing depends solely on position and on assimilation with adjacent consonants. Example: Slovene.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} &lt;!-- or provide another language for which we actually have an example. --&gt;

==Languages with final-obstruent devoicing==

===Germanic languages===
Most modern continental [[West Germanic languages]] developed final devoicing, the earliest evidence appearing in Old Dutch around the 9th or 10th century. However, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] notably does not alter final voiced sounds; this appears to be a later reversal.

* [[Afrikaans]]
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]], also [[Old Dutch|Old]] and [[Middle Dutch]]
* [[German language|(High) German]], also [[Middle High German]]&lt;ref&gt;In normalised Middle High German as opposed to modern New High German, devoicing is represented in writing, thus {{lang|de|Kriemhilt}} is the shortened form of {{lang|de|Kriemhilde}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (for fricatives)
* [[Limburgish]] (only for {{IPA|/v, z, ɣ/}})
* [[Low German language|Low German]], also [[Middle Low German]]
* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (only when not [[Syllabification|resyllabified]])
* [[Old English language|Old English]] (for fricatives, inconsistently for   {{IPA|/ɣ/}})
* [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=van der Veen|first=Klaas F.|editor-last1=Munske|editor-first1=Horst Haider|editor-last2=Århammar|editor-first2=Hans|year=2001|chapter=13. West Frisian Dialectology and Dialects|title=Handbook of Frisian studies|publisher=Max Niemeyer Verlag GmbH|place=Tübingen|page=104|isbn=3-484-73048-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nx-GUm-0OIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (and some Low German dialects in North Frisia that have a Frisian substratum) does not have final devoicing.

Of the [[North Germanic languages]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] (the latter of which has no voiced obstruents) do not have final devoicing. As in Danish, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] stops are voiceless, but it has voiced fricatives which may also occur word-finally.

Gothic (an [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]]) also developed final devoicing independently.

===Romance languages===
Among the [[Romance languages]], word-final devoicing is common in the [[Gallo-Romance languages]], which tend to exhibit strong [[Old Frankish|Frankish]] influence (itself the ancestor of Old Dutch, above).
* [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
* [[Old French]] and [[Middle French]] (preserved in certain [[Modern French]] inflections such as {{lang|fr|-if}} vs. {{lang|fr|-ive}}, {{lang|fr|grand}} when applying [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃t]}} vs. {{lang|fr|grande}} {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃d(ə)]}})
* [[Lombard language|Lombard]]
* [[Occitan language|Occitan]]
* [[Romansh language|Romansh]]

[[Romanian language|Romanian]] does ''not'' have it. Other Romance languages such as and [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] rarely have words with final voiced consonants, but borrowings from English into French or Italian that have a voiced final consonant (such as ''weekend'') are not devoiced either.

===Slavic languages===
Most [[Slavic languages]] exhibit final devoicing, but notably standard ([[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian]]) [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] do not.
* [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]
* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]
* [[Czech language|Czech]]
* [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]
* [[Polish language|Polish]]
* [[Russian language|Russian]]
* [[Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] and [[Chakavian dialect|Čakavian]] dialects)
* [[Slovak language|Slovak]]
* [[Slovenian language|Slovene]]
* [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]]

===Other languages===
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]] – certain dialects, notably the dialects of certain areas of the Berati and Korça counties
* [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (for [[stop consonant|stop]]s)
* [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]
* [[Breton language|Breton]]
* [[Cypriot Greek]] as opposed to [[Standard Modern Greek]]
* [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (for stops)
* [[Korean language|Korean]] (nuanced; see [[Korean phonology]])
* [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]
* [[Maltese language|Maltese]]
* [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* [[Tok Pisin]]
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (for [[stop consonant|stops]])
* [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]]

Note: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], which lies geographically between Germanic and Slavic languages, does ''not'' have it. Terminal devoicing is indicated in the orthography in Turkish, but it isn't in Azeri (i.e. the personal name {{IPA-tr|mɛh.ˈmɛt|}} would be spelled {{lang|tr|Mehmet}} in Turkish, but {{lang|az|Məhməd}} {{IPA-az|mæh.ˈmæt|}} in Azeri).

'''Günther Anders''' (born '''Günther Siegmund Stern'''; [[Wrocław|Breslau]], 12 July 1902 – [[Vienna]], 17 December 1992) was a [[German Jewish]] [[philosopher]], journalist, essayist and poet. 

Trained in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition, he developed a [[Philosophical anthropology|philosophical anthropology]] for the age of technology, focusing on such themes as the effects of mass media on our emotional and ethical existence, the illogic of religion, the nuclear threat, the [[Shoah]], and the question of being a philosopher. 

In 1992, shortly before his death, Günther Anders was awarded the [[Sigmund Freud Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sigmund-Freud-Preis|url=http://www.deutscheakademie.de/preise_freud.html|publisher=[[Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung]]|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:GunterAndersGrave.jpg|thumb|Günther Anders' grave in [[Vienna]]|216x216px]]
At the time of his birth his native Breslau (now [[Wrocław]] in [[Poland]]) had become the 6th largest city in the [[German Empire]], with a Jewish population of about 20,000, 5% of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;Baedeker, Karl, ''Northern Germany'', 14th revised edition, Leipzig &amp; London, 1904, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of founders of child psychology Clara and [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] as well as a cousin of [[Walter Benjamin]]. Anders was married three times, to the German philosopher and political scientist [[Hannah Arendt]] from 1929 to 1937, to the Austrian writer [[Elisabeth Freundlich]] from 1945 to 1955, and to American pianist [[Charlotte Lois Zelka]] in 1957. Zelka was born in California in 1930, toured Europe for two decades, and died of lung cancer in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Zelka (1930 - Oct. 6, 2001); http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/projects/anders/zelka044.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Marcuse&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Anders obtained a PhD in philosophy; [[Edmund Husserl]] was his dissertation advisor. Anders' sister Hilde Stern was at one time married to the German philosopher [[Rudolf Schottlaender]], who was also a student of Husserl. However Anders' own father was arguably the most significant intellectual influence in his life.

While he was working as a journalist in Berlin, an editor did not want so many Jewish-sounding bylines in his paper, so Stern chose the name "Anders" (meaning other or different). He used that nom-de-plume for the rest of his life.

In the late 1920s Anders studied with the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in Freiburg. He married fellow Heidegger student [[Hannah Arendt]], who had engaged in an affair with their common mentor. Anders fled Nazi Germany in 1933, first to France (where he and Arendt divorced amicably in 1937), and later to the United States.

Anders returned to Europe in 1950 with his second wife [[Elisabeth Freundlich]] (1906-2001), whom he had met in New York, to live in her native Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Marcuse's university website, http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/anders.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There Anders wrote his main philosophical work, whose title translates as ''The Obsolescence of Humankind'' (1956), became a leading figure in the anti-nuclear movement, and published numerous essays and expanded versions of his diaries, including one of a trip to Breslau and Auschwitz with his wife. Anders' papers are held by the University of Vienna, and his [[literary executor]] is former [[FORVM]] editor [[Gerhard Oberschlick]].

Anders was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=rot3BU9rB_wC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=G%C3%BCnther+Anders+atheist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gUA30j7a-7&amp;sig=ci_hRxIQzD9OYiGqCS7tMmRea1k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiprZbx35TPAhVE7iYKHZFQD8cQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=G%C3%BCnther%20Anders%20atheist&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=KgU8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=G%C3%BCnther+Anders+atheist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuaCjrZVvJ&amp;sig=WtSTr_X8Pv3pkkiQDdb1VQk6mXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiprZbx35TPAhVE7iYKHZFQD8cQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=G%C3%BCnther%20Anders%20atheist&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Günther Anders was an early critic of the role of technology in modern life and in this context was a trenchant critic of the role of television. His essay "The Phantom World of TV," written in the late 1950s, was published in an edition of Bernard Rosenberg and David Manning White's influential anthology ''Mass Culture'' as "The Phantom World of Television." In it he details how the televisual experience substitutes images for experience, leading people to eschew first-hand experiences in the world and instead become "voyeurs," His dominant metaphor in this essay centers on how television interposes itself between family members "at the dinner table." See "''Die Welt als Phantom und Matrize. Philosophische Betrachtungen über Rundfunk und Fernsehen''" (The World as Phantom and Matrix. Philosophical Observations on Radio and Television) (1956).

===''The Obsolescence of Humankind''===
His major work, of which only a few essays have been translated into English,&lt;ref&gt;'On Promethean Shame', in Christopher Müller, ''Prometheanism: Technology, Digital Culture and Human Obsolescence'' (Rowman and Litlefield, 2016), pp. 29-95; Gunther Anders, 'The Obsolescence of Privacy', ''CounterText'' 3:1&lt;/ref&gt; is acknowledged to be ''Die Antiquiertheit des Menschen'' (literally "The Outdatedness of the Human Species," 1956; vol. 2 1980). It argues that a gap has developed between humanity's technologically enhanced capacity to create and destroy, and our ability to imagine that destruction. Anders devoted a great deal of attention to the nuclear threat, making him an early critic of this technology as well.

The two volume work is made up of a string of philosophical essays that start with an observation often found in Anders' diary entries dating back to his exile in the U.S. in the 1940s.

To provide an example from the first chapter of volume one: "First Encounter with Promethean Shame – Today's Prometheus asks: 'Who am I anyway?'"; 
11 March 1942.
"Shame about the 'embarrassingly' high quality of manufactured goods."  What are we embarrassed about? Anders' answer to this question is simply "that we were born and not manufactured."&lt;ref&gt;for a full translation see: Gunther Anders, 'On Promethean Shame', in Christopher Müller, ''Prometheanism: Technology, Digital Culture and Human Obsolescence'' (Rowman and Litlefield, 2016), pp. 29-95&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Open Letter to Klaus Eichmann''===
Just as Arendt in her ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' elucidated the [[Banality of Evil]] by declaring that horrendous crimes can be committed by quite ordinary people, Anders explores the moral and ethical ramifications of the facts brought to light in the 1960-61 trial of Adolf [[Eichmann]] in ''We Sons of Eichmann: Open Letter to Klaus Eichmann'' (the son of the noted Nazi bureaucrat and genocidaire). He suggests that the appellation "Eichmann" properly designates any person who actively participated in, ignored or failed to learn about, or even knew about but took no action against the Nazis' mass murder campaigns against Jews and others. He explained to his audience in Austria and Germany, among them young writers searching for ways to empathize with their parents' generation, that "there was but one viable alternative not only for Eichmann's son Klaus but all 'Eichmann sons,' namely to repudiate their fathers since mourning them was not an option."&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Lorenz.

== Quotes by and about Anders==
'''Foreword'''. "Outdatedness of Human Beings 1", 5th edition &lt;br /&gt;
"The three main theses: that we are no match for the perfection of our products; that we produce more than we can visualize and take responsibility for; and that we believe, that, what we can do, are allowed to do, no: should do, no: must do – these three basic theses, in light of the environmental threats emerging over the last quarter century, have become more prevailing and urgent than they were then."

'''Changing the world'''&lt;br /&gt;
"It does not suffice to change the world. We do that anyway. And to a large extent that happens even without our involvement. In addition we have to interpret this change. Precisely because to change it. That therefore the world does not change without us. And ultimately into a world without us."

'''Introduction.''' "Outdatedness of Human Beings 2"&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is "...a philosophical anthropology in the age of technocracy". With "technocracy" I do not mean the rule of technocrats (as if they were a group of specialists, who dominate today's politics), but the fact, that the world, in which we live and which determines us, is a technological one – which extends so far, that ''we are not allowed to say, that in our historical situation there is among other things technology, rather do we have to say: within the world's status called "technology" history happens, in other words technology has become the subject of history'', in which we are only "co-historical".

'''Dedication'''. "Outdatedness of Human Beings 1", 5th edition

Exactly half a century ago, in nineteen hundred and six, my father William Stern published, then twenty years younger and generations more confident than his son today, the first volume of his work "Person and Thing." His hope, to rehabilitate the "Person" through his struggle against an impersonal Psychology, he only unwillingly would have seen dashed. His very own kindness and the optimism of the times, to which he belonged, prevented him for many years, to understand that what makes a "Person" a "Thing", is not its scientific treatment; but the actual treatment of one human being by another. When overnight he was dishonored and chased away by the spurners of humanity, he was not spared the grief that comes from a better understanding into a world worse off.

In memory of him, who indelibly implanted the idea of human dignity in his son, these mournful pages on the devastation of human beings were written.

'''Love Yesterday.''' Notes on the History of Feelings. 1986.&lt;br /&gt;
Without knights no chivalry, without court no courtliness, without salon no charm, without material support no deference will last indefinitely, not even as make-believe. In the same manner what shrinks in a world that cheats us out of leisure and other preconditions of our privacy, are the subtleties of our emotional private lives.

'''Jewish Origins.''' In: Paul van Dijk, Anthropology in the Age of Technology.&lt;br /&gt;
"His Jewish self-consciousness reveals itself in the acknowledgment that he is never more ashamed than when meeting a Jew who is ashamed to be a Jew. The Judaism that Anders represents with the fierceness and decisiveness that is so characteristic of him is, however, a modern, secular, and humanistic Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Dijk|first1=Paul|title=Anthropology in the Age of Technology. The Philosophical Contribution of Günther Anders|date=2000|publisher=Rodopi Bv Editions|isbn=9789042014022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heuriger'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/wine/heurige-2 The Viennese Heurige]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|ˈhɔʏʁɪɡɐ}}; Austrian dialect pronunciation: Heiriga) is the name given to taverns in Eastern [[Austria]] at which local winemakers serve their new wine under a special licence in alternate months during the growing season. The ''Heurige'' are renowned for their atmosphere of ''[[Gemütlichkeit]]'' shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and - in some places - [[Schrammelmusik]]. They correspond to the [[Straußwirtschaft|Straußwirtschaften]] in the German [[Rheinland]], the ''Frasche'' in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], and ''Osmiza'' in [[Slovenia]].

''Heuriger'' is the abbreviation of "heuriger Wein" (this year's wine) in [[German language| Austrian]] and Bavarian German. Originally, they were simple open-air taverns on the premises of winemakers, where people would bring along food and drink the new wine. Nowadays, the taverns are often situated at a distance from the wineyards and offer both food and drinks. ''Heurige'' where apple or pear [[cider]] is served are called a ''Mostheurige''. In the well-known wine-growing areas of the city of Vienna (Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift, Liesing) many eating establishments have a rustic interior design similar to ''Heurige'', yet they have a normal licence and sell wine they buy from outside sources.

== History ==
On 17 August 1784 Austrian [[Emperor Joseph II]] issued a decree that permitted all residents to open establishments to sell and serve self-produced ''wine and juices.'' At first no food could be sold in order to prevent competition with restaurants, but over time these restrictions lessened. 

Over the years well-known areas for ''Heurigen'' developed, including [[Grinzing]], [[Sievering]], [[Neustift am Walde]], [[Perchtoldsdorf]], [[Mauer, Vienna|Mauer]], [[Stammersdorf]], [[Guntramsdorf]], [[Gumpoldskirchen]], [[Traiskirchen]], [[Gainfarn]], [[Dürnstein]], [[Langenlois]], the [[Wachau (wine)|Wachau]] region, [[Rust, Austria|Rust]], [[Königstetten]], [[Gamlitz]], and [[Kitzeck]].

Similar establishments exist in [[wine-producing region]]s elsewhere in Austria, known as ''Buschenschank'' in [[Styria]], and ''[[Strausse|Straußen]]'', ''[[Besenwirtschaft]]'', or ''Heckenwirtschaft'' in Germany and other German-speaking areas.

== Atmosphere ==
A ''Heuriger'' is prized both for the charms of what it offers and its limitations.  Each ''Heuriger'' is only open briefly, usually 2 or 3 weeks during a four month season in the Fall, although it may reopen again later in the season when more wine has been produced. It serves only its own wine, and but a limited selection of food as an evening meal, generally local, homemade products offered as small dishes such as [[Liptauer]] spread, various meat or sausage and [[Semmel]] combinations, or [[cheese board]]s.

Typical drinks found at ''Heurigen'' include [[Federweisser|Sturm]], a partially fermented wine sold at the beginning of fall that still contains a fair amount of grape, and [[Grüner Veltliner|Gruner Veltliner]], which is one of the most popular types of Austrian wine. [[Almdudler]] and [[Spritzer|Gespritzer]] are also commonly found at modern ''Heurigen.'' Lucky patrons will sometimes find [[Ice wine|Eiswein]] to enjoy with dessert. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boomertravelpatrol.com/heurigen-austria|title=Visit a Heurigen When in Austria|website=www.boomertravelpatrol.com|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Heurigen'' indicate that they are open and guests welcome by displaying a handful of conifer or fir twigs bound in a circlar ''Buschen'' hung above the entrance door. Until the 20th century, it was customary for guests to bring along their own food when enjoying wine at a ''Heuriger''.  To make an establishment more profitable, in many places the tavern was leased to other winemakers (''Winzer'' in German), known as ''Winzerstuben''.

''[[Gemütlichkeit]]'' shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and traditional music is one of the greatest appeals of a ''Heuriger''.  As a result, many establishments elsewhere, such as in Vienna, are made to look like ''Heurigen'' but in fact are licensed restaurants selling wines from outside sources; these even serve beer and coffee, unthinkable at an authentic ''Heuriger''.

== Music ==
Music has traditionally been part of the ''Heuriger'' ambiance and contributes greatly to its ''Gemütlichkeit''.  When present today it is typically provided by a pair of ''Heurigensänger'' who serenade from table to table for [[tip (gratuity)|tips]].  Playing a [[guitar]] and [[accordion]], they take requests for songs from their repertoire of ''[[Wienerlied]]er'' and [[Music of Vienna#Schrammelmusik|Schrammelmusik]].

These songs' themes invariably revolve around the quality of the [[wine]], its consumption and consequences, [[Vienna]]'s beauty, a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] longing for the past, the [[wikt:transience|transience]] of life, the inevitability of [[suffering]] and death at [[God's will]], and, to a somewhat lesser degree, [[romantic love]].

Even trying to honor the ''Heuriger'' tradition, music has changed dramatically since performers such as [[The Third Man]] sensation [[Anton Karas]] earned a living by playing his [[zither]] or [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]] sang a ''Wienerlied'' from his movies. Visitors from [[Germany]] will hope to hear songs from their native land, as will those from others; the ''Heurigensänger'' will try their best.

'''Ideal managerial climate''' ('''IMC''') is a concept within [[organizational communication]].&lt;ref name="redding1"&gt;Redding, W. C. (1972). Communication within the organization: An interpretive review of theory and research. New York, N.Y.: Industrial Communication Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by [[W. Charles Redding]] in 1972, this theoretical concept serves as a comprehensive model for management, and organizations as a whole, that places emphasis on relationships, interactions, and leadership functions. IMC furthers discussion in organizational communication beyond formal relations and structures, and assesses those characteristics that can produce the most ideal environment in an organization, and/or its management. This model presents an ideal situation rather than an attainable one, and should be a used as a tool for comparison, self-assessment, and improvement for organizations.&lt;ref name="redding1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzanell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buzzanell | first1 = P. | last2 = Stohl | first2 = C. | year = 1999 | title = The redding tradition of organizational communication scholarship: W. charles redding and his legacy | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3669/is_199901/ai_n8852242/ | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 324–336 | doi=10.1080/10510979909388503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheney"&gt;[[George Edward Cheney|Cheney, G.]], Christensen, L.T., Zorn, Jr., T.E., Ganesh, S. (2011). Organizational communication in an age of globalization. Long Grove, I.L.: Waveland Press, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Theoretical perspective==

W. Charles Redding, commonly credited as the father of organizational communication, conducted significant research that made substantial contributions to organizational and managerial communication.&lt;ref name="buzzanell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, P. (1994, September). W. charles redding. Spectra, p. 2. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding was one of the first to investigate the [[Organisation climate|climates of organizations]]. His quantitative studies examined communicative dynamics among the members of organizations across various structures. Prior to Redding’s contributions, research pertaining to organizational climate was limited specifically to the analysis of events or isolated messages rather than the larger dynamics of the organization. Based on his findings, Redding developed a prescriptive model for managers known as the ''ideal managerial climate'', which connects leadership functions to the organizational communication climate.&lt;ref name="cheney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetorical"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redding | first1 = W. C. | year = 1999 | title = Communication research and the 'rhetorical environment.' | doi = 10.1080/10510979909388504 | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 337–351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redding claimed that any experience in an organizational setting is a [[message]], including both [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal and verbal communication]].&lt;ref name="prospects"&gt;Tompkins, P.K. &amp; Wanca-Thibault, M. (2001) Organizational communication: prelude and prospects. In Pace, R. W., Fauls, D. F. (3rd Ed.). (1994). Organizational communication. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: A Paramount Communications Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Message and message-related practices are the basic premise by which organizational environments and climates are created. Climate can be defined as “the psychological environment in which organizational behavior occurs.” &lt;ref name="cheney" /&gt; As this applies to organizational communication, “organizational climate” can be defined as the relationships and interactions that contribute to the formation of workplace environments among and across various organizational structures.&lt;ref&gt;Falcione, R. L., Sussman, L, &amp; Herden, R. P. (1987). Communication climate in organizations. In F.M. Jablin, L.L. Putnam, K.H. Roberts, &amp; L W. Porter (Ed.), Handbook of organizational communication (pp. 195–227). Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pace"&gt;Pace, R. W., Fauls, D. F. (3rd Ed.). (1994). Organizational communication. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: A Paramount Communications Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding states that “the communication ‘climate’ of the organization is more crucial than are communication skills or techniques (taken by themselves) in creating an effective organization.” &lt;ref name="buzzanell" /&gt; When evaluating organizational climate using IMC, the ideal productive environment of an organizational is related to the culture and values an organization possesses.&lt;ref name="redding1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cheney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetorical" /&gt;

==Components of IMC==

Based on Redding’s research and consultation experience, he found five dynamics to be key in the attempt to produce a stable, satisfying, and content atmosphere in the workplace. These characteristics were reflective on organizational productivity, preventing workplace conflicts, and positive influence and fluency in organizational structure.

1. Trust: Trust, confidence, and credibility should be maintained in the relationships between members of the organization at all levels of the hierarchy.

2. Supportiveness: Personnel should feel free to speak what is on their minds in an atmosphere of acceptance, regardless of their positioning as superior or subordinate.

3. Openness: The dynamics in an organizational setting should be clear and free of confusion. However, although there may be formal [[hierarchical structure]]s, communication should be not limited by rigid boundaries.

4. Emphasis on [[Goal setting|high-performance goals]]: All members of an organization should be committed to high-performance goals such as high productivity, high quality, low cost, and a concern for other members.

5. [[Participative decision making|Participative decision-making]]: Employees at all levels in the organization should be communicated to and consulted with in decision-making and goal-setting relevant to their positions.&lt;ref name="pace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redding, W.C. (1979). Organizational communication theory and ideology: an overview. In D. Nimmo (Ed.), Communication Yearbook 3 (pp. 321–322). New Brunswick, N.J.: International Communication Association. https://books.google.com/books?id=rWBCpXlOLqsC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=jn3xTJG-m8&amp;dq=W.%20Charles%20redding&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA309#v=onepage&amp;q=W.%20Charles%20redding&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

6.Emotional connections: If employees feel an emotional connection to the work that is facilitated through the manager, work will be done more effectively and the employees will be able to be more productive.

==Expansion of IMC==

In 1976, Peterson and Pace expanded on the IMC model with the development of the communication climate inventory (CCI). Similar to Redding’s, this model was designed to analyze the communication dynamics of an organizational setting according to six categories of “communication effects.” Peterson and Pace used the five components of IMC as a foundational premise upon which to base their model.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, B.D., Pace, R..W. (1976). Communication climate and organizational
satisfaction. Unpublished manuscript. {{doi|10.1177/0893318988001004003}}

As a poet he is known mostly for his poetry collections, ''Asle to Ohle Tak'' (Illusion and Reality, 1955) and autobiographical, ''Koi Naon Na Jane Mera'' (2000). He was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in Punjabi in 1979 for his work, ''Karuna Di Chuh Ton Magron''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/searchAwards.jsp Awardees] [[Sahitya Akademi]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Modern Indian literature" /&gt; His long autobiographical poem ''Simriti De Kiran Ton Pehlan'' (Before Shedding Memory) published in 1975, is considered among the masterpieces of [[Indian literature]].&lt;ref name=mast /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbook of twentieth-century literatures of India" /&gt; His works as a scholar of [[Sikhism]] include, ''Ardaas: Darshan Roop Te Abhiyas'', ''Sada Vigas'', ''Achetan di Leela'', ''Divine Intimations'', ''Prophet of Devotion'' and ''Pilgrimage to Hemkunt''.

==Early life and education==

He was born in the village of Murid, District of [[Jhelum District|Jhelum]] (in present-day [[Pakistan]]). His father was S. Hari Gulab Singh and his mother was Smt. Sita Wanti. When he was still an infant, his parents moved to [[Quetta]] in ([[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]]) in present-day [[Pakistan]].

==Education==

It was in [[Quetta]] that he joined Khalsa High School whence he matriculated in 1941 securing the highest marks in [[Baluchistan]] and setting up a new record. He joined the [[Forman Christian College]], Lahore, for his premedical studies.

There he enjoyed two merit scholarships – one granted by the University and the other by the college. In his FSc (Medical) exam, he stood second in the university. For his graduate course in medicine and surgery, he joined [[King Edward Medical College]], [[Lahore]], where he also received a merit scholarship granted by the Government of Baluchistan.

In 1947 when the country was partitioned, he left Lahore and joined [[Government Medical College, Amritsar]], where he completed his medical studies to graduate in 1949. He worked first as a House Physician, then as an Assistant Registrar, and then as a Demonstrator in Medical College, Amritsar, with a short stint, in between, as Demonstrator in [[Christian Medical College Ludhiana]]. While teaching there, he passed his M.A. (Psychology) exam as a teacher candidate from [[Aligarh Muslim University]], securing First Division and first position in the University. He passed his DPM exam from [[National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences|All India Institute of Mental Health]], [[Bangalore]], and [[Mysore University]], in 1958 with double distinction and setting up a new record. Thus he qualified as a psychiatrist.

==Professional career==

As a psychiatrist, rising through the ranks, he became Professor &amp; Head of Psychiatry Department at the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]], New Delhi and occupied that chair for about a decade (1968–1978). He was then appointed Director of the [[Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research]], Chandigarh (PGI) where he spent three years (1978–1981). From there, he was picked up by the [[World Health Organization]], Geneva, as a consultant for a project in Africa where he served for over four years (1981–1985). He came back home in 1985, and then engaged in private practice. In between, he had a short engagement with the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse (South-East Asia).

He also served as Chairman of the Board of Consultants constituted by the [[Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee]] for setting up of an Institute of Medical Sciences. In 1974, he was elected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Medical Sciences&lt;ref name="List of Fellows - NAMS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nams-india.in/downloads/fellowsmembers/ZZ.pdf | title=List of Fellows - NAMS | publisher=National Academy of Medical Sciences | date=2016 | accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1989, he received Kohli Memorial Award for being the Best Professional of the Year.

==Literary activities==

He is a well-recognized metaphysical poet in Punjabi who has contributed ten volumes of original verse. His opus magnum is his autobiography in verse. He also writes powerful, inspiring prose as evidenced by his books Achetan di Leela, Meri Sahitak Swaijeevani and Ardas. He has won several prestigious awards in literature. These include: [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], Asan Memorial Award, Shiromani Sahitkar Award (Languages Deptt.), Sarvotam Sahitkar Award (Punjabi Akademy, Delhi) in 2009 for ''Sada Vigaas'' (prose).,&lt;ref name="Punjabi Academy Literary Award" /&gt; Bhai Vir Singh Award, KS Dhaliwal Award, Puran Singh Memorial Award. Guru Nanak Dev University conferred on him Ph.D. honorous causa for his contribution to literature. He has been a member of the jury (Punjabi) for Sahitya Akademy Awards and member of the Advisory Committee (Punjabi) for Jnan Peeth Award. He is one of the past Chairmen of Punjabi Akademy, Chandigarh.

He also served as Honorary General Secretary of Bhai Vir Singh Sahitya Sadan, New Delhi.

==Religious activities==

Belonging to a devout religious family, Dr Neki always evinced keen interest in religion. Like his family, he also observed unbigoted, liberal views. During his student life, he became President of the [[All India Sikh Students Federation]] and organised training camps for the Sikh youth in the Sikh lore. He produced two authentic books. One is ''Ardas – Darshan'', ''Roop te Abhias'' which has been evaluated as an 'all-time classic'. The second one, ''Vishva Ardas'', is a collection of over 300 prayers from different religious groups, tribes and communities of different times and places, translated into Punjabi verse.This has been called "a landmark piece of work". Commissioned by [[Guru Nanak Dev University]], he wrote The Spiritual Heritage of the Punjab which traces the evolution of spiritual thought and practice from the pre-Aryan times up to Guru Gobind Singh. Lately, he has produced an exquisitely produced book Pilgrimage to [[Hemkunt]] that compares with high international standards.

For several years, he was a member of the Dharam Prachar Committee of [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]], the elected body that administers Sikh shrines. He was honoured with the 'Order of the Khalsa' Award on the 300th Anniversary of the Khalsa, celebrated in [[Anandpur Sahib]] on 13 April 2000. He represented his community at various international forums including The Parliament World Religions 1993, Unesco Conference on Religion and World Peace 1998, Unesco Center Catalunya Conference on Universal Ethics 1998, World Thanksgiving Conference 1999

In 2001, he received the Giani Lal Singh memorial award for his work in the field of poetry.&lt;ref name="Giani Lal Singh memorial award" /&gt;

==Personal life==

In 1955, he married Kanwerjit, the eldest daughter of his own Professor, Lt. Col. Dr. Gurbuxsh Singh. Neki died on September 11, 2015 In New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaswant Singh Neki:  Eminent Punjabi Poet, Sikh Theologian, Psychiatrist|url=https://www.sikhchic.com/article-detail.php?cat=8&amp;id=5978|publisher=Sikh Chic|accessdate=16 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923140038/https://www.sikhchic.com/article-detail.php?cat=8&amp;id=5978|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl-Otto Apel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːpl̩|lang}}; 15 March 1922 – 15 May 2017) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]] and Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. He developed a distinctive philosophical approach which he called '''transcendental pragmatics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''Transzendentalpragmatik'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]] (ed.), ''Transzendentalpragmatik'', Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main 1993. [http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/transzendentalpragmatik-_28681.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Apel grew up during the political crises of the [[Weimar Republic]]. In 1940, he was a war volunteer with his entire graduating class. After the [[Second World War]], Apel studied from 1945 to 1950 at the [[University of Bonn]], first history and intellectual history, before he committed himself as a student of Erich Rothacker on philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hösle|first1=Vittorio|title=Die Krise der Gegenwart und die Verantwortung der Philosophie|date=24 September 1997|publisher=C.H.Beck|isbn=978-3406392740|pages=110–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reese-Schäfer|first1=Walter|title=Karl-Otto Apel zur Einführung|date=1990|publisher=Junius Verlag|location=Hamburg|isbn=978-3885068617|pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he received his doctorate from Bonn with a thesis on [[Martin Heidegger]].

==Academic positions==
Apel was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Mainz]] in 1961. He was a full professor of philosophy at the [[University of Kiel]] from 1962 to 1969, at the [[University of Saarbrücken]] from 1969 to 1972, and at the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]] from 1972 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deutsche National Bibliothek|title=Apel, Karl-Otto|url=http://d-nb.info/gnd/118503596/about/html|website=d-nb.info|publisher=Deutsche National Biblothek|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he transferred to [[emeritus]] status. He has held a number of visiting and guest professorships at universities around the world.

He was made a Member of the [[Academia Europaea]] in 1989 and a Full Member of the [[Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea]] in 1993. In 2001, he was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]].

==Philosophy==
Apel worked in [[ethics]], the [[philosophy of language]] and human sciences. He wrote extensively in these fields, publishing mostly in German. Apel's work brings together the [[analytical philosophy|Analytical]] and [[continental philosophy|Continental]] philosophical traditions, especially [[pragmatism]] and the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]].

In ''Understanding and Explanation: A Transcendental-Pragmatic Perspective'',&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Apel reformulated the difference between understanding (''[[Verstehen]]'') and explanation (''Erklärung''), which originated in the [[hermeneutics]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[interpretive sociology]] of [[Max Weber]], on the basis of a Peircean-inspired transcendental-pragmatic account of language. This account of the "[[lifeworld]]" would become an element of the theory of communicative action&lt;ref&gt;Witzany, Guenther (1991). Transzendentalpragmatik und Ek-sistenz. Normenbegruendung - Normendurchsetzung. Verlag Die Blaue Eule, Essen.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[discourse ethics]], which Apel co-developed with [[Jürgen Habermas]]. Strategic rationality both claim to stand in need of communicative rationality that is seen as, in several regards, more fundamental.&lt;ref&gt;For an assessment of this claim: Andreas Dorschel, 'Ist strategisches Handeln ergänzungsbedürftig? Karl-Otto Apels These und ihre Begründung', in: ''Archives européenes de sociologie'' XXX (1989), pp. 123-149. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5461532/]&lt;/ref&gt; While sympathetic to Habermas's ''Theory of Communicative Action'', Apel has been critical of aspects of Habermas's approach. Apel has proposed that a theory of communication should be grounded in the transcendental-pragmatic conditions of communication. After taking his point of departure from Apel, Habermas has moved towards a "weak transcendentalism" that is more closely tied to empirical social inquiry.

Apel also wrote works on [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and is a past president of the C. S. Peirce Society.

An early German-speaking adversary of so-called critical rationalism, Apel published a critique of the philosophy of [[Karl Popper]]: In ''Transformation der Philosophie'' (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;"Apel, Karl-Otto", ''La philosophie de A à Z'', by Elizabeth Clement, Chantal Demonque, Laurence Hansen-Love, and Pierre Kahn, Paris, 1994, Hatier, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Towards a Transformation of Philosophy |series=Marquette Studies in Philosophy |volume=No 20 |first=Karl-Otto |last=Apel |translator-first1=Glyn |translator-last1=Adey |translator-first2=David |translator-last2=Fisby |location=Milwaukee |year=1998 |publisher=Marquette University Press |isbn=0-87462-619-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s to the 1990s, Apel influenced other philosophers writing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Apel died on 15 May 2017 at the age of 95.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2017-05/philosoph-karl-otto-apel-tot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://science.orf.at/stories/2843480/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sprachen Osttimors-en.png|thumb|350px|Biggest language groups in [[sucos of East Timor]].]]

The '''languages of East Timor''' include both [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and [[Papuan languages]]. (See [[Timor–Flores languages]] and [[Timor–Alor–Pantar languages]].) The [[lingua franca]] and national language of [[East Timor]] is [[Tetum]], an Austronesian language influenced by [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with which it has equal status as an official language. The language of the [[Oecussi-Ambeno|Ocussi]] exclave is [[Uab Meto]] (Dawan). [[Fataluku]] is a [[Papuan language]] widely used in the eastern part of the country (often more so than Tetum). Both Portuguese and Tetum have official recognition under the [[Constitution of East Timor]], as do other indigenous languages, including: [[Bekais language|Bekais]], [[Bunak language|Bunak]], [[Galoli language|Galoli]], [[Habun language|Habun]], [[Idalaka language|Idalaka]], [[Kawaimina language|Kawaimina]], [[Kemak language|Kemak]], [[Lovaia language|Lovaia]], [[Makalero language|Makalero]], [[Makasae language|Makasae]], [[Mambai language (Timor)|Mambai]], [[Tokodede language|Tokodede]] and [[Wetarese language|Wetarese]].

The rise of lingua francas in the linguistically diverse East Timor and the domination of several clans over others have led to the extinction of many smaller languages. However, some of them are still in use as ritual languages or cants. Research done in the mid-2000s by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist [[Aone van Engelenhoven]], for example, revealed that the [[Makuva language]], formerly spoken by the [[Makuva]] tribe but believed to have been extinct since the 1950s, was still used occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noorderlicht.vpro.nl/artikelen/34024406/ Noorderlicht Noorderlicht Nieuws: Raadselachtig Rusenu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Van Engelenhoven discovered the existence of another language that was essentially extinct, called [[Rusenu language|Rusenu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noorderlicht.vpro.nl/artikelen/36635727/ Noorderlicht Noorderlicht Nieuws: Sprankje hoop voor talenvorsers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official languages==
[[File:Línguas timorenses.JPG|thumb|right|An East Timorese girl speaking (from clockwise) [[Bunak language|Bunak]], [[Tetum language|Tetum]], [[Fataluku language|Fataluku]], and Portuguese. Translation: In Bunak/Tetum/Fataluku/Portuguese, we say: I '''am in''' Dili. I '''have''' some money. I '''do not have''' any money.]]

Section 13(1) of the 2002 constitution designates Portuguese and Tetum as East Timor's two official languages. The same section also provides that "Tetum and the other national languages shall be valued and developed by the State." English and Indonesian are sometimes used and section 159 of the constitution provides that these languages serve as "working languages within civil service side by side with official languages as long as deemed necessary".&lt;ref&gt;http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Portuguese rule, all education was through the medium of Portuguese, although it coexisted with Tetum and other languages. Portuguese particularly influenced the dialect of Tetum spoken in the capital, [[Dili]], known as ''Tetun Prasa'', as opposed to the more traditional version spoken in rural areas, known as ''Tetun Terik''. ''Tetun Prasa'' is the version more widely used, and is now taught in schools.

Under Indonesian rule, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] was the official language. Along with [[English language|English]], it has the status of a 'working language' under the [[Constitution]].

For many older East Timorese, the Indonesian language has negative connotations with the [[Suharto]] regime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Languages in East Timor  | work = Interview  | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation  | date = 26 June 2004  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/linguafranca/stories/2004/1138367.htm  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but many younger people expressed suspicion or hostility to the reinstatement of Portuguese, which they saw as a 'colonial language' in much the same way that Indonesians saw [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and how the Filipinos saw Spanish and,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = East Timor Sebastião da Silva Foundation  | title = East Timor: Identity, Language and Educational Policy  | publisher = East Timor Sebastião da Silva Foundation  | date =  25 August 2000  | url = http://www.asianlang.mq.edu.au/INL/cnrtenglish.html

Portuguese was also a working language of the resistance against Indonesia.

Some young East Timorese felt at a disadvantage by the adoption of Portuguese as an official language, and accused the country's leaders of favouring the older generations who speak Portuguese and educated Timorese who had only recently returned from overseas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Portugal]] and other Portuguese language countries such as [[Brazil]] have supported the teaching of Portuguese in East Timor. Some people in East Timor complained that teachers from Portugal and Brazil were poorly equipped to teach in the country, as they did not know local languages, or understand the local culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nevertheless, the late [[Sérgio Vieira de Mello]], who headed the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]], was a Brazilian who established a close working relationship with [[Xanana Gusmão]], the country's first president, as a fellow Portuguese-speaker but was respected by many East Timorese because of his efforts to learn Tetum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''[[Swaziland]]''' is home to several '''languages'''.  Native languages are [[Swazi language|Swazi]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Afrikaans]], and [[English language|English]].  Recent immigrant languages include [[Chichewa]] and [[Southern Sotho]].&lt;ref name=ethn&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis et al.|2015}}, [http://www.ethnologue.com/country/SZ Swaziland] at [[Ethnologue]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== National and official languages ==
[[Swazi language|Swazi]] (Swati or siSwati), a [[Southern Bantu languages|Southern Bantu]] language, is the [[national language]] of Swaziland,&lt;ref name="Austin 2008: 108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2008|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalby|2004|p=596}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is spoken by approximately 95 percent of Swazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stokes|2009|p=673}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Swazi and [[English language|English]] are the country's two [[official language]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and proceedings of the [[Parliament of Swaziland]] take place in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzpatrick|2004|p=615}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swazi [[language education]] is present in all national schools, and [[literacy]] in Swati, defined as the ability to read and write the language, is "very high" in Swaziland.&lt;ref name="Austin 2008: 108"/&gt;  Swazi is also used in [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Austin 2008: 108"/&gt;

English is the [[medium of instruction]],&lt;ref name="Kanduza &amp; Mkhonza 2003: 56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanduza|Mkhonza|2003|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is taught in all [[state school|state]] and [[private school]]s.&lt;ref name=ethn/&gt;  Competency in English is a prerequisite for admission into most [[post-secondary]] institutions.&lt;ref name="Kanduza &amp; Mkhonza 2003: 56"/&gt;

== Minority and immigrant languages ==
A minority of [[Swazi people|Swazi]], estimated to number 76,000 {{as of|1993|lc=on}}, speak [[Zulu language|Zulu]], one of [[Languages of South Africa|the eleven official languages]] of [[South Africa]].  [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], a [[Tswa–Ronga languages|Tswa–Ronga language]] and also an official language of South Africa, is spoken by 19,000 Swazis ({{as of|1993|lc=on}}).  [[Afrikaans]], another official language of South Africa and descended from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], is spoken by 13,000 people in Swaziland.&lt;ref name=ethn/&gt;

[[Chewa language|Chewa]] (or Nyanja), the [[national language]] of [[Malawi]], and [[Sotho language|Sotho]] (Sesotho or Southern Sotho), spoken mainly in [[Lesotho]] and [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], [[South Africa]], are [[immigrant language]]s with 5,700 and 4,700 speakers, respectively, in Swaziland.  [[Shimaore dialect|Shimaore]] is also an immigrant language, and is spoken by 600 inhabitants of the country.&lt;ref name=ethn/&gt;

Prior to [[History of Swaziland#Independence|Swaziland's independence]] in 1968, [[French language|French]] was taught in the colony's three [[White people|White]]-only high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanduza|Mkhonza|2003|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28239">'''Liet International''' (West Frisian: ''Liet Ynternasjonaal''), formerly '''Liet-Lávlut''', is a song contest for musicians who speak any of Europe's regional or [[minority language]]s that was held the first time in [[Friesland]] in 2002. The goal of the festival is to boost interest in Europe's [[minority language]]s, especially with young people.

Liet International began in 2002 as a spinoff of the Frisian-language song contest Liet (West Frisian for "song"), held annually in [[Leeuwarden|Leeuwarden/Ljouwert]] since 1991.  The first three editions of Liet International likewise took place in Leeuwarden.  Since 2006 it has been held in a different city each year.  The 2006 and 2008 contests, held in the Swedish [[Sápmi]], were titled Liet-Lávlut (''lávlut'' is [[Northern Sami]] for "sing").  

Since 2008 Liet International has been organized under the patronage of the Council of Europe.

Contests were cancelled in 2007 and 2013 when the hosting organizations, in [[Narbonne]] and [[Corsica]] respectively, backed out at a late stage.  No Liet International was held in 2015.

==Qualification==

The winners of certain song contests for particular languages or groups of languages automatically qualify as entrants for Liet International.  These contests thus function as selection rounds for the international contest. They have included:

* Liet (West Frisian)
* Premiu al Meyor Cantar (Asturian)
* [[Sámi Grand Prix]] (Sámi)
* SUNS (minority languages of Italy and the Alpine region)
* Laulun Laulut (minority languages of the Nordic and Baltic regions, 2007)
* Nós Úr (Celtic languages and Scots, 2008-2009)
* Liet Corsica (Corsican, 2012)

Additional entrants are chosen from applying artists by a selection committee.

==Liet Ynternasjonaal 2002==

The first Liet International song contest was held on April 28, 2002 at the {{illm|De Harmonie|nl|De Harmonie (Leeuwarden)|}} theatre in [[Leeuwarden|Leeuwarden/Ljouwert]], [[Friesland]], the [[Netherlands]].  The West Frisian-language Liet contest was held on the previous night, and in a pattern that would be repeated in future editions the winner of Liet went on to represent Friesland in the international contest.  However in later years Liet International would be held some months after Liet.

Both the jury and public awards were won by the Catalan band Pomada for their song "En Pere Galleri".

The second Liet International contest was again held at the De Harmonie theatre in Leeuwarden, on November 23, 2003.

Transjoik, a Sámi group from Norway, won the jury award with their song "Mijjajaa".  The public award was won by Welsh/Cornish singer Gwenno for her song in Cornish, "Vodya".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48366">The following is a '''list of [[language families]]'''. It also includes language isolates, unclassified languages and other types.

==Major language families==

===By number of languages===
''[[Ethnologue]]'' 18 lists the following families as containing at least 1% of the 7,472 known languages in the world:

#[[Niger-Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] (1,538 languages) (20.6%)
#[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] (1,257 languages) (16.8%)
#[[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] (480 languages) (6.4%)
#[[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] (457 languages) (6.1%)
#[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (444 languages) (5.9%)
#[[Australian languages|Australian]] (378 languages) (5.1%)
#[[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] (375 languages) (5.0%)
#[[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] (205 languages) (2.7%)
#[[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] (177 languages) (2.4%)
#[[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (169 languages) (2.3%)
#[[Volta–Congo languages|Volta–Congo]] (108 languages) (1.5%)
#[[Kra-Dai languages|Tai–Kadai]] (95 languages) (1.3%)
#[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (85 languages) (1.1%)
#[[Tupian languages|Tupian]] (76 languages) (1.0%)

''[[Glottolog]]'' 2.4 lists the following as the largest families:

# [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] (1,544 languages) 
# [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] (1,276 languages) 
# [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (585 languages) 
# [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] (472 languages)
# [[Atlantic-Congo languages|Atlantic–Congo]] (432 languages)
# [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] (372 languages)
# [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] (315 languages) 
# [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] (240 languages)
# [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] (178 languages)
# [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (164 languages)
# [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]] (96 languages)
# [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (81 languages)
# [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] (76 languages)
# [[Mande languages|Mande]] (74 languages)
# [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] (71 languages)

Language counts can vary significantly depending on what is considered a dialect; for example [[Lyle Campbell]] counts 27 Otomanguean languages, although he, ''Ethnologue'' and ''Glottolog'' disagree as to which languages belong in the family.

==Language families (non-sign)==
{{See also|Language family|List of languages by number of native speakers}}
In the following, each bullet item is a known or suspected language family.  Phyla with historically wide geographical distributions but comparatively few current-day speakers include [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]], [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]. 

The geographic headings over them are meant solely as a tool for grouping families into collections, more comprehensible than an unstructured list of a few hundred independent families.  Geographic relationship is convenient for that purpose, but these headings are ''not'' a suggestion of any "super-families" phylogenetically relating the families named. 

The number of individual languages in a family and the number of their speakers are only rough estimates: see [[Language or dialect|dialect or language]] and [[linguistic demography]] for further explanation.

==Unclassified languages==
Languages are considered unclassified either because, for one reason or another, little effort has been made to compare them with other languages or more commonly, because they are too poorly documented to permit reliable classification: most such languages are extinct and, most likely, will never be known well enough to classify.

==Extinct families and unclassified languages==
This section lists extinct languages and families which have no known living relatives; while a minority of these is well known but is still classified as genetically independent (like the ancient [[Sumerian language]]), the lack of [[Attested language|attestation]] makes many of these hard to put into larger groups.

==Other language classifications==
The classification of languages into families, assumes that all of them develop from a single parent proto-language and evolve over time into different daughter language(s). While the vast majority of tongues fit this description fairly well, there are exceptions.
A [[mixed language]] often refers to a particular combination of existing ones, which may stem from different families: a [[pidgin]] is a simple language used for communication between groups; this may involve simplification and/or mixing of multiple languages. When a pidgin develops into a more stable language which children learn from birth, it is usually called a "creole".
Whether for ease of use or created for use in fiction, languages can also be constructed from the ground up, rather than develop from existing ones; these are known as [[constructed languages]].

== Sign languages ==
{{See also|List of sign languages|Sign Language#Classification}} 
The family relationships of [[sign languages]] are not well established due to a lagging in linguistic research, and many are [[:Category:Sign language isolates|isolates]] (cf. [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann, Henri (1991). "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215-88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Inuit Sign Language]]
* [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]
* [[Peruvian Sign Language]]
* [[Mauritian Sign Language]]
* [[Chinese Sign Language]]
* [[Hawaiʻi Sign Language]]

== Proposed families ==
{{Unreferenced|date=April 2018}}
The following is a list of proposed language families, which connect established families into larger genetic groups; support for these proposals varies; the [[Dené–Yeniseian languages]] for example, are a recent proposal which has been generally well received, whereas reconstructions of the [[Proto-World language]] are often viewed as [[fringe science]]; proposals which are themselves based on other proposals have the likelihood of their parts noted in parentheses.

* works inadvertently left unfinished or never completed by their authors
* surviving extracts of larger works subsequently lost as wholes
* works deliberately constructed as fragmentary pieces

The deliberately undeveloped literary sort of fragment played an especially important role in literary [[Romanticism]]. German literature of the Romantic period has left many such fragments. In English literature, note [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s unfinished (but published as a fragment in 1816) "[[Kubla Khan]]; or, A Vision in a Dream: A Fragment".
In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]] employs fragment sequences in order to develop an elliptical narrative alluding to a universe of unattainability and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Fran Mason.

==History==
The sexual connotations of the phrase "make out" appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase's other meanings of "to succeed". Originally, it meant "to seduce" or "to have sexual intercourse with".&lt;ref&gt;Moe, Albert F. (1966) "'Make out' and Related Usages". ''American Speech'' 41(2): 96–107.&lt;/ref&gt; When performed in a car, it may be euphemistically referred to as ''parking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindeke|first1=Bill|title=The unwritten rules of making out in parks|url=https://www.minnpost.com/cityscape/2015/09/unwritten-rules-making-out-parks|accessdate=16 March 2018|work=MinnPost|date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olsen|first1=Hannah Brooks|title=How to Hook Up in Public|url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2015/09/how-to-hook-up-in-public/407392/|website=CityLab|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century, [[premarital sex]] increased, and with it, petting behavior in the 1920s.{{fact|date=July 2013}} The Continental experience at that time is amusingly illustrated by a letter that [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote to [[Sándor Ferenczi]] in 1931 playfully admonishing him to stop kissing his patients, in which Freud warned lest "a number of independent thinkers in matters of technique will say to themselves: Why stop at a kiss? Certainly one gets further when one adopts 'pawing' as well, which, after all, doesn't make a baby. And then bolder ones will come along who will go further, to peeping and showing – and soon we shall have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of ''demi-viergerie'' and petting parties".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malcolm, Janet. ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 37-8&lt;/ref&gt;

By the postwar period, necking and petting became accepted behavior in mainstream American culture, as long as the partners were dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Breines| first = Wini| title = Young, White, and Miserable: Growing Up Female in the Fifties| publisher = University of Chicago Press  | year = 2001| isbn = 0-226-07261-4| pages= 117–118|quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Making out is usually considered an expression of affection or [[sexual attraction]]. An episode of making out is frequently referred to as a "make-out session" or simply "making out," depending on the speaker's vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Cann, Kate. ''Hard Cash'' (London 2000) p. 262 and p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; It covers a wide range of sexual behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lafollette  | first = Hugh  | title = Ethics in Practice  | publisher = Blackwell  | location = Oxford  | year = 2002  | isbn = 0-631-22834-9  | quote = "making out," which can comprise a rather wide variety of activities  | page = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and means different things to different age groups in different parts of the United States.&lt;ref name = Lief/&gt; It typically refers to [[kiss]]ing,&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt; including prolonged, passionate, open-mouth kissing (also known as [[French kiss]]ing), and intimate skin-to-skin contact.&lt;ref name = Lief/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt; The term can also refer to other forms of [[foreplay]] such as heavy petting,&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"/&gt; which typically involves some [[genital stimulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/heavy%2Bpetting|title=heavy petting - definition of heavy petting in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but usually not the direct act of penetrative [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Crownover  | first = Richard  | title = Making out in English  | publisher = Tuttle Publishing  | location = Boston  | year = 2005  | isbn = 0-8048-3681-7  |quote = "Making out," used in the title of this book is a colloquialism that can mean engaging in sexual intercourse, ...  | page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived significance of making out may be affected by the age and relative sexual experience of the participants. Teenagers sometimes play [[party game]]s in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration. Games in this category include [[seven minutes in heaven]] and [[spin the bottle]].&lt;ref&gt;“Notes From the State of Virginia,” with Wesley Hogan, in First of the Year, vol. II, edited by Benj DeMott (New York:  Transaction Publishers, 2010) p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenagers may have had [[social]] gatherings in which making out was the predominant event. In the United States, these events were referred to as "make-out parties" and would sometimes be confined to a specific area, called the "make-out room".&lt;ref&gt;''From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century'' by Mansour, David. (2005) {{ISBN|978-0740751189}}. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; These make-out parties were generally not regarded as [[Group sex|sex parties]], though heavy petting may have been involved, depending on the group.

'''Medieval Latin''' was the form of [[Latin]] used in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Western Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. In this region it served as the primary written language, though local languages were also written to varying degrees. Latin functioned as the main medium of scholarly exchange, as the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], and as the working language of science, literature, law, and administration.

Medieval Latin represented, in essence, an attempt to continue [[Classical Latin]] and [[Late Latin]], with enhancements for new concepts as well as for the increasing integration of Christianity. Despite some meaningful differences from Classical Latin, Medieval writers did not regard it as a fundamentally different language. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where [[Late Latin]] ends and Medieval Latin begins. Some scholarly surveys begin with the rise of early [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] in the middle of the 4th century, others around 500,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Jan M.|last= Ziolkowski|contribution= Towards a History of Medieval Latin Literature|editor-first= F. A. C. |editor-last= Mantello|editor2-first= A. G. |editor2-last= Rigg |title= Medieval Latin: An Introduction and Bibliographical Guide|location= Washington, D.C.|year= 1996|pages= 505-536 (pp. 510-511)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still others with the replacement of written Late Latin by written [[Romance language]]s starting around the year 900.

The terms ''Medieval Latin'' and ''Ecclesiastical Latin'' are often used synonymously, though some scholars draw distinctions. ''Ecclesiastical Latin'' refers specifically to the form that has been used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], whereas ''Medieval Latin'' refers more broadly to all of the (written) forms of Latin used in the Middle Ages. The [[Romance languages|'''Romance languages''']] spoken in the Middle Ages were often referred to as ''Latin'', since the Romance languages were all descended from Classical, or Roman, Latin itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romance-languages|title=Romance languages|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

===Christian Latin===
Medieval Latin had an enlarged vocabulary, which freely borrowed from other sources. It was heavily influenced by the language of the [[Vulgate]], which contained many peculiarities alien to Classical Latin that resulted from a more or less direct translation from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]; the peculiarities mirrored the original not only in its vocabulary but also in its grammar and syntax. [[Greek language|Greek]] provided much of the technical vocabulary of [[Christianity]]. The various [[Germanic languages]] spoken by the Germanic tribes, who invaded southern Europe, were also major sources of new words. Germanic leaders became the rulers of parts of the Roman Empire that they conquered, and words from their languages were freely imported into the vocabulary of law. Other more ordinary words were replaced by coinages from [[Vulgar Latin]] or Germanic sources because the classical words had fallen into disuse.

[[File:MilanBTCod470BookOfHours2FoliosAnnuncShepherdsDecortatedInit2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|An [[illuminated manuscript]] of a [[Book of Hours (Milan, Biblioteca Trivulziana, Cod. 470)|Book of Hours]] contains prayers in medieval Latin.]]

Latin was also spread to areas such as [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]], where [[Romance languages]] were not spoken, and which had never known [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule. Works written in those lands where Latin was a learned language, having no relation to the local vernacular, also influenced the vocabulary and syntax of medieval Latin.

Since subjects like science and philosophy, including [[Argumentation theory]] and [[Ethics]] (pre-law), were communicated in Latin, the Latin vocabulary that developed for them became the source of a great many technical words in modern languages. English words like ''abstract'', ''subject'', ''communicate'', ''matter'', ''probable'' and their [[cognates]] in other European languages generally have the meanings given to them in medieval Latin.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/mental.pdf Mental furniture from the philosophers], ''Et Cetera''  40 (1983), 177-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulgar Latin===
The influence of [[Vulgar Latin]] was also apparent in the [[syntax]] of some medieval Latin writers, although Classical Latin continued to be held in high esteem and studied as models for literary compositions. The high point of the development of medieval Latin as a literary language came with the [[Carolingian renaissance]], a rebirth of learning kindled under the patronage of [[Charlemagne]], king of the [[Franks]]. [[Alcuin]] was Charlemagne's Latin secretary and an important writer in his own right; his influence led to a rebirth of Latin literature and learning after the depressed period following the final disintegration of the authority of the Western Roman Empire.

Although it was simultaneously developing into the Romance languages, Latin itself remained very conservative, as it was no longer a native language and there were many ancient and medieval grammar books to give one standard form. On the other hand, strictly speaking there was no single form of "medieval Latin". Every Latin author in the medieval period spoke Latin as a second language, with varying degrees of fluency and syntax. Grammar and vocabulary, however, were often influenced by an author's native language. This was especially true beginning around the 12th century, after which the language became increasingly adulterated: late medieval Latin documents written by French speakers tend to show similarities to medieval French grammar and vocabulary; those written by Germans tend to show similarities to German, etc. For instance, rather than following the classical Latin practice of generally placing the verb at the end, medieval writers would often follow the conventions of their own native language instead. Whereas Latin had no definite or indefinite articles, medieval writers sometimes used forms of ''unus'' as an indefinite article, and forms of ''ille'' (reflecting usage in the Romance languages) as a definite article or even ''quidam'' (meaning "a certain one/thing" in Classical Latin) as something like an article. Unlike classical Latin, where ''esse'' ("to be") was the only auxiliary verb, medieval Latin writers might use ''habere'' ("to have") as an auxiliary, similar to constructions in Germanic and Romance languages. The [[accusative and infinitive]] construction in classical Latin was often replaced by a subordinate clause introduced by ''quod'' or ''quia''. This is almost identical, for example, to the use of ''que'' in similar constructions in French.

In every age from the late 8th century onwards, there were learned writers (especially within the Church) who were familiar enough with classical [[syntax]] to be aware that these forms and usages were "wrong" and resisted their use. Thus the Latin of a theologian like St [[Thomas Aquinas]] or of an erudite clerical historian such as [[William of Tyre]] tends to avoid most of the characteristics described above, showing its period in vocabulary and spelling alone; the features listed are much more prominent in the language of lawyers (e.g. the 11th century English [[Domesday Book]]), physicians, technical writers and secular chroniclers. However the use of ''quod'' to introduce subordinate clauses was especially pervasive and is found at all levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Changes in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar==

Medieval Latin had ceased to be a living language and was instead a scholarly language of the minority of educated men in medieval Europe used in official documents more than for everyday communication. This resulted in two major features of Medieval Latin compared with Classical Latin, though when it is compared to the other vernacular languages, Medieval Latin developed very few changes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Latin: An Introduction and Bibliographical Guide|last=Mantello, F. A. C.|first=Rigg, A. G.|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press|year=1996|isbn=0813208416|location=United States of America|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, many authors attempted to "show off" their knowledge of Classical Latin by using rare or archaic constructions, sometimes anachronistically (haphazardly mixing constructions from Republican and Imperial Latin, which in reality existed centuries apart). Second, many lesser scholars had a limited grasp of "proper" Latin or were increasingly influenced by Vulgar Latin, which was mutating into the Romance languages.

*Word order usually tended towards that of the vernacular language of the author, not the artificial and polished word order of Classical Latin. Conversely, an erudite scholar might attempt to "show off" by intentionally constructing a very complicated sentence. Because Latin is an inflected language, it is technically possible to place related words at opposite ends of a paragraph-long sentence, and owing to the complexity of doing so, it was seen by some as a sign of great skill.
*Typically, prepositions are used much more frequently (as in modern Romance languages) for greater clarity, instead of using the ablative case alone. Further, in Classical Latin the subject of a verb was often left implied, unless it was being stressed: ''videt'' = "he sees". For clarity, Medieval Latin more frequently includes an explicit subject: ''is videt'' = "he sees" without necessarily stressing the subject.
*Various changes occurred in vocabulary, and certain words were mixed into different declensions or conjugations. Many new compound verbs were formed. Some words retained their original structure but drastically changed in meaning: ''animositas'' specifically means "wrath" in Medieval Latin while in Classical Latin, it generally referred to "high spirits, excited spirits" of any kind.
*Owing to heavy use of biblical terms, there was a large influx of new words borrowed from Greek and Hebrew and even some grammatical influences. That obviously largely occurred among priests and scholars, not the laity. In general, it is difficult to express abstract concepts in Latin, as many scholars admitted. For example, Plato's abstract concept of "the Truth" had to be expressed in Latin as "what is always true". Medieval scholars and theologians, translating both the Bible and Greek philosophers into Latin out of the Koine and Classical Greek, cobbled together many new abstract concept words in Latin.

===Syntax===
*Indirect discourse, which in Classical Latin was achieved by using a subject accusative and infinitive, was now often simply replaced by new conjunctions serving the function of English "that" such as ''quod'', ''quia'', or ''quoniam''. There was a high level of overlap between the old and new constructions, even within the same author's work, and it was often a matter of preference. A particularly famous and often cited example is from the [[Venerable Bede]], using both constructions within the same sentence: "''Dico me scire et quod sum ignobilis''" = "I say that I know [accusative and infinitive] and that I am unknown [new construction]". The resulting subordinate clause often used the subjunctive mood instead of the indicative. This new syntax for indirect discourse is among the most prominent features of Medieval Latin, the largest syntactical change.
*Several substitutions were often used instead of subjunctive clause constructions. They did not break the rules of Classical Latin but were an alternative way to express the same meaning, avoiding the use of a subjunctive clause.
**The present participle was frequently used adverbially in place of ''qui'' or ''cum'' clauses, such as clauses of time, cause, concession, and purpose. That was loosely similar to the use of the present participle in an ablative absolute phrase, but the participle did not need to be in the ablative case.
**''Habeo'' (I have [to]) and "Debeo" (I must) would be used to express obligation more often than the gerundive.
***Given that obligation inherently carries a sense of futurity ("Carthage must be destroyed" at some point in the future), it anticipates how the Romance languages such as French would use "habeo" as the basis for their [[future tense]]s (abandoning the Latin forms of the future tense).  While in Latin "amare habeo" is the indirect discourse "I have to love", in the French equivalent,"aimerai" (habeo &gt; ayyo &gt; ai, aimer+ai), it has become the future tense, "I will love", losing the sense of obligation. In Medieval Latin, however, it was still indirect discourse and not yet used as simply a future tense.
**Instead of a clause introduced by ''ut'' or ''ne'', an infinitive was often used with a verb of hoping, fearing, promising, etc.
*Conversely, some authors might haphazardly switch between the subjunctive and indicative forms of verbs, with no intended difference in meaning.
*The usage of ''sum'' changed significantly: it was frequently omitted or implied. Further, many medieval authors did not feel that it made sense for the perfect passive construction "''laudatus sum''" to use the present tense of ''esse'' in a past tense construction so they began using ''fui'', the past perfect of ''sum'', interchangeably with ''sum''.
*Chaos in the usage of demonstrative pronouns. ''Hic'', ''ille'', ''iste'', and even the intensive ''ipse'' are often used virtually interchangeably. In anticipation of Romance languages, ''hic'' and ''ille'' were also frequently used simply to express the definite article "the", which Classical Latin did not possess. ''Unus'' was also used for the indirect article "a, an".
*Use of reflexives became much looser. A reflexive pronoun in a subordinate clause might refer to the subject of the main clause. The reflexive possessive ''suus'' might be used in place of a possessive genitive such as ''eius''.
*Comparison of adjectives changed somewhat. The comparative form was sometimes used with positive or superlative meaning. Also, the adverb "magis" was often used with a positive adjective to indicate a comparative meaning,and ''multum'' and ''nimis'' could be used with a positive form of adjective to give a superlative meaning.
*Classical Latin used the ablative absolute, but as stated above, in Medieval Latin examples of nominative absolute or accusative absolute may be found. This was a point of difference between the ecclesiastical Latin of the clergy and the "Vulgar Latin" of the laity, which existed alongside it. The educated clergy mostly knew that traditional Latin did not use the nominative or accusative case in such constructions, but only the ablative case. These constructions are observed in the medieval era, but they are changes that developed among the uneducated commoners.
*Classical Latin does not distinguish progressive action in the present tense, thus ''laudo'' can mean either "I praise" or "I am praising". In imitation of Greek, Medieval Latin could use a present participle with ''sum'' to form a [[periphrastic]] tense equivalent to the English progressive. This "Greek Periphrastic Tense" formation could also be done in the past and future tenses: ''laudans sum'' ("I am praising"), ''laudans eram'' ("I was praising"), ''laudans ero'' ("I will be praising").
*Classical Latin verbs had at most two voices, active and passive, but Greek (the original language of the New Testament) had an additional "middle voice" (or reflexive voice). One use was to express when the subject is acting upon itself:  "Achilles put the armor onto himself" or "Jesus clothed himself in the robe" would use the middle voice. Because Latin had no middle voice, Medieval Latin expresses such sentences by putting the verb in the passive voice form, but the conceptual meaning is active (similar to Latin deponent verbs). For example, the Medieval Latin translation of Genesis states literally, "God was moved over the waters" ("spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas", Genesis 1:2), but it is just expressing a Greek middle-voice verb: "God moved ''[himself]'' over the waters".
*Overlapping with orthography differences (see below), certain diphthongs were sometimes shortened:  "oe" to "e", and "ae" to "e". Thus, "oecumenicus" becomes the more familiar "ecumenicus" (more familiar in this later form because religious terms such as "ecumenical" were more common in medieval Latin). The "oe" diphthong is not particularly frequent in Latin, but the shift from "ae" to "e" affects many common words, such as "caelum" (heaven) being shortened to "celum"; even "puellae" (girls) was shortened to "puelle".
*Often, a town would lose its name to that of the tribe which was either accusative or ablative plural; two forms that were then used for all cases, or in other words, considered "indeclinable".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Primer of Medieval Latin: an anthology of prose and poetry|last=Beeson|first=Charles Henry|date=|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|others=|year=1986|isbn=0813206359|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] of 1119, composed in medieval Latin.]]

Many striking differences between classical and medieval Latin are found in [[orthography]]. Perhaps the most striking difference is that medieval manuscripts used a wide range of abbreviations by means of superscripts, special characters etc.: for instance the letters "n" and "s" were often omitted and replaced by a diacritical mark above the preceding or following letter. Apart from this, some of the most frequently occurring differences are as follows. Clearly many of these would have been influenced by the spelling, and indeed pronunciation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, of the vernacular language, and thus varied between different European countries.

*Following the Carolingian reforms of the 9th century, [[Carolingian minuscule]] was widely adopted, leading to a clear differentiation between capital and lowercase letters.
*A partial or full differentiation between ''v'' and ''u'', and between ''j'' and ''i''.
*The diphthong ''ae'' is usually collapsed and simply written as ''e'' (or ''[[e caudata]]'', ''ę''); for example, ''puellae'' might be written ''puelle'' (or ''puellę''). The same happens with the diphthong ''oe'', for example in ''pena'', ''Edipus'', from ''poena'', ''Oedipus''. This feature is already found on coin inscriptions of the 4th century (e.g. ''reipublice'' for ''reipublicae''). Conversely, an original ''e'' in Classical Latin was often represented by ''ae'' or ''oe'' (e.g. ''aecclesia'' and ''coena''), also reflected in English spellings such as ''foetus''.
*Because of a severe decline in the knowledge of Greek, in loanwords and foreign names from or transmitted through Greek, ''y'' and ''i'' might be used more or less interchangeably: ''Ysidorus'', ''Egiptus'', from ''Isidorus'', ''Aegyptus''. This is also found in pure Latin words: ''ocius'' ("more swiftly") appears as ''ocyus'' and ''silva'' as ''sylva'', this last being a form which survived into the 18th century and so became embedded in modern [[botanical Latin]] (also cf. ''Pennsylvania'').
*''h'' might be lost, so that ''habere'' becomes ''abere'', or ''mihi'' becomes ''mi'' (the latter also occurred in Classical Latin); or ''mihi'' may be written ''michi'', indicating that the ''h'' had come to be pronounced as ''k'' or perhaps ''kh''. This pronunciation is not found in Classical Latin.
*The loss of ''h'' in pronunciation also led to the addition of ''h'' in writing where it did not previously belong, especially in the vicinity of ''r'', such as ''chorona'' for ''corona'', a tendency also sometimes seen in Classical Latin.
*''-ti-'' before a vowel is often written as ''-ci-'' [tsi], so that ''divitiae'' becomes ''diviciae'' (or ''divicie''), ''tertius'' becomes ''tercius'', ''vitium'' ''vicium''.
*The combination ''mn'' might have another plosive inserted, so that ''alumnus'' becomes ''alumpnus'', ''somnus'' ''sompnus''.
*Single consonants were often doubled, or vice versa, so that ''tranquillitas'' becomes ''tranquilitas'' and ''Africa'' becomes ''Affrica''.
*Syncopation became more frequent:  ''vi'', especially in verbs in the perfect tense, might be lost, so that ''novisse'' becomes ''nosse'' (this occurred in Classical Latin as well but was much more frequent in medieval Latin).

These orthographical differences were often due to changes in pronunciation or, as in the previous example, morphology, which authors reflected in their writing. By the 16th century, [[Erasmus]] complained that speakers from different countries were unable to understand each other's form of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;See Desiderius Erasmus, ''De recta Latini Graecique sermonis pronunciatione dialogus'', Basel (Frobenius), 1528.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradual changes in Latin did not escape the notice of contemporaries. [[Petrarch]], writing in the 14th century, complained about this linguistic "decline", which helped fuel his general dissatisfaction with his own era.

==Medieval Latin literature==
The corpus of medieval Latin literature encompasses a wide range of texts, including such diverse works as [[sermons]], [[hymns]], [[hagiography|hagiographical]] texts, [[travel literature]], [[Histories (history of the novel)|histories]], [[Epic poetry|epics]], and [[lyric poetry]].

The first half of the 5th century saw the literary activities of the great Christian authors [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420) and [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), whose texts had an enormous influence on theological thought of the Middle Ages, and of the latter's disciple [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] (c. 390-455). Of the later 5th century and early 6th century, [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] (c. 430 – after 489) and [[Magnus Felix Ennodius|Ennodius]] (474–521), both from Gaul, are well known for their poems, as is [[Venantius Fortunatus]] (c. 530–600). This was also a period of transmission: the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] patrician [[Boethius]] (c. 480–524) translated part of [[Aristotle]]'s [[logical]] corpus, thus preserving it for the [[Latin West]], and wrote the influential literary and philosophical treatise ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De consolatione Philosophiae]]''; [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 485–585) founded an important library at the monastery of Vivarium near [[Squillace]] where many texts from Antiquity were to be preserved. [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560-636) collected all scientific knowledge still available in his time into what might be called the first [[encyclopedia]], the ''[[Etymologiae]]''.

[[Gregory of Tours]] (c. 538–594) wrote a lengthy history of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kings. Gregory came from a Gallo-Roman aristocratic family, and his Latin, which shows many aberrations from the classical forms, testifies to the declining significance of classical education in Gaul. At the same time, good knowledge of Latin and even of [[Greek language|Greek]] was being preserved in [[monastic]] culture in [[Ireland]] and was brought to [[England]] and the European mainland by [[missionaries]] in the course of the 6th and 7th centuries, such as [[Columbanus]] (543–615), who founded the monastery of [[Bobbio]] in Northern Italy. Ireland was also the birthplace of a strange poetic style known as [[Hiberno-Latin|Hisperic Latin]]. Other important Insular authors include the historian [[Gildas]] (c. 500–570) and the poet [[Aldhelm]] (c. 640–709). [[Benedict Biscop]] (c. 628–690) founded the monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Priory|Wearmouth-Jarrow]] and furnished it with books which he had taken home from a journey to [[Rome]] and which were later used by [[Bede]] (c. 672–735) to write his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.

Many medieval Latin works have been published in the series [[Patrologia Latina]], [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum]] and [[Corpus Christianorum]].

== Medieval Latin and Everyday Life ==
Medieval Latin was separated from [[Classical Latin]] around 800 AD and at this time was no longer considered part of the everyday language. Spoken Latin became a practice used mostly by the educated high class population. Even then it was not frequently used in casual conversation. An example of these men includes the churchmen who could read Latin, but could not effectively speak it. Latin's use in universities was structured in lectures and debates, however, it was highly recommended that students use it in conversation. This practice was only kept up due to rules.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;One of Latin's purposes, writing, was still in practice; the main uses being charters for property transactions and to keep track of the pleadings given in court. Even then, those of the church still used Latin more than the rest of the population. At this time, Latin served little purpose to the regular population but was still used regularly in ecclesiastical culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Medusa complex''' is a psychological [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] revolving around the petrification or freezing of human emotion, and drawing on the classical myth of the [[Medusa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Concise-Corsini-Encyclopedia-Psychology-Behavioral/dp/0471220361/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529846981&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780471220367|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|date=2004-04-19|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471220367|editor-last=Craighead|editor-first=W. Edward|edition= 3rd|location=New York Chichester|language=English|editor-last2=Nemeroff|editor-first2=Charles B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term Medusa Complex was coined in 1948 by [[Gaston Bachelard]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Gleyzon, ''Shakespeare's Spiral'' (2010) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; to cover the feeling of petrification induced by the threat of the parental [[gaze]].&lt;ref&gt;J-P Sartre, ''Saint Genet'' (2012) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; A mute, paralysed fury responds to the danger of the obliteration of an individual consciousness by an external Other (and perhaps by the corresponding internalised desire to obliterate the subjectivity of others in turn).&lt;ref&gt;A. Passo, ''Novel Configurations'' (1994) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Later writers have developed Bachelard's idea in various ways.
* [[Attachment theory]] uses the Medusa Complex to refer to a self-destructive early state of inwardly directed aggression produced by a disruption of the mother/child mutual gaze.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craighead ed. ''The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioural Science'' (2014) p. 1044&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marion Woodman]] saw the Medusa Complex as a dissociated state produced by paralysis of the [[fight-or-flight response]] in a state of petrified fear.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bennett ed., ''Montreal 2010'' (2012) p. 1593&lt;/ref&gt;  She also saw it as the possible by-product of a conflict between an idealised, [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfect]] state and the actual reality of one's feelings and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://truebeautyalways.com/2013/03/03/waltzing-with-medusa/ Waltzing with Medusa]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marjorie Garber]] saw the Medusa Complex pervading [[Macbeth]] in the form of [[Medusa's Head|gender trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamas, ''We Three'' (2007) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Francois-Xavier Gleyzon]] used the Medusa Complex in reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Spiral-Tracing-Renaissance-Painting-ebook/dp/B009W3W2JI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529847384&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780761848936|title=Shakespeare's Spiral: Tracing the Snail in King Lear and Renaissance Painting|last=results|first=search|date=2010-03-19|publisher=UPA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mesmes language''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[West Gurage languages|West Gurage]] language, one of the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]]. There are still many people who claim the Mesmes ethnic identity, but none who speak the language.  The [[Terminal speaker|last speaker]] of the language was interviewed by a [[language survey]] team when he was approximately 80 years old. He had not spoken the language for 30 years, having nobody to speak it with since his brother died.

The Mesmes have [[Language shift|shifted]] to speaking the [[Hadiyya language]]. However, they still maintain some cultural distinctives, including their own style of  house architecture.

The [[comparative method]] has shown that the language is most closely related to the [[Inor language|Inor]] variety of Gurage.&lt;ref&gt;Ahland (2010), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mill scale''', often shortened to just '''scale''', is the flaky surface of [[Rolling (metalworking)|hot rolled]] [[steel]], consisting of the mixed [[iron oxide]]s [[iron(II) oxide]] (FeO), [[iron(III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[iron(II,III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, magnetite). 

Mill scale is formed on the outer surfaces of plates, sheets or profiles when they are being produced by rolling red hot iron or steel billets in [[rolling mill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunha|first=Adriano Ferreira da|last2=Mol|first2=Marcos Paulo Gomes|last3=Martins|first3=Máximo Eleotério|last4=Assis|first4=Paulo Santos|date=March 2006|title=Caracterização, beneficiamento e reciclagem de carepas geradas em processos siderúrgicos|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0370-44672006000100014&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Rem: Revista Escola de Minas|volume=59|issue=1|pages=111–116|doi=10.1590/S0370-44672006000100014|issn=0370-4467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill scale is bluish-black in color. It is usually less than {{convert|0.1|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and initially adheres to the steel surface and protects it from atmospheric corrosion provided no break occurs in this coating. 

Because it is electrochemically cathodic to steel, any break in the mill scale coating will cause accelerated corrosion of steel exposed at the break. Mill scale is thus a boon for a while until its coating breaks due to handling of the steel product or due to any other mechanical cause. 

Mill scale becomes a nuisance when the steel is to be processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since it will come off with the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by [[flame cleaning]], [[pickling (metal)|pickling]], or [[abrasive blasting]], which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and [[steel fixer]]s used to leave steel and [[rebar]] delivered freshly rolled from mills out in the open to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays, most [[steel mill]]s can supply their product with mill scale removed and steel coated with shop [[Primer (paint)|primers]] over which [[welding]] or painting can be done safely.

Mill scale generated in rolling mills will be collected and sent to a [[sinter plant]] for [[recycling]].

==In art== 
Mill scale is sought after by select [[abstract expressionist]] artists as its effect on steel can cause unpredicted and seemingly random abstract organic visual effects. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Although the majority of mill scale is removed during its passage through scale breaker rolls during manufacturing, smaller structurally inconsequential residue can be visible. Leveraging this processing vestige by accelerating its corrosive effects through the metallurgical use of [[phosphoric acid]] or in conjunction with [[selenium dioxide]] can create a high contrast visual [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] onto which other compositional elements can be added.  

==In refractory production== 
Mill scale can be used as a raw material in granular refractory. When this refractory is cast and preheated, these scales provide escape routes for the evaporating water vapor, thus preventing cracks and resulting in a strong, monolithic structure.

Korzhavin was given the Big Book National Award-2006 for his contribution to literature. He was the only Big Book finalist to get into the short-list with a book of memoirs.

Korzhavin created a vivid detailed picture of his life and his country in his prose work under the expressive title ''In Temptations of the Bloody Epoch''.

In 2005 Korzhavin participated in ''[[They Chose Freedom]]'', a four-part television documentary on the history of the Soviet dissident movement.

'''Open education''' is education without academic admission requirements and is typically offered [[Distance education|online.]] Open education broadens access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/open-education-for-a-global-economy/ Open education for a global economy]&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifier "open" refers to the elimination of barriers that can preclude both opportunities and recognition for participation in institution-based learning. One aspect of [[openness]] or "opening up" education is the development and adoption of [[open educational resources]].

Institutional practices that seek to eliminate [[barriers to entry]], for example, would not have academic admission requirements. Such universities include the [[Open University]] in Britain, and [[Athabasca University]], [[Thompson Rivers University, Open Learning]] in Canada. Such programs are commonly (but not necessarily) [[distance learning]] programs like [[e-learning]], [[Massive open online course|MOOC]] and [[OpenCourseWare]]. Whereas many e-learning programs are free to follow, the costs of acquiring a [[certification]] may be a barrier. Many open education institutes offer free certification schemes [[Accreditation|accredited]] by organisations like [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service|UKAS]] in the UK and ANAB in the United States; others offer a [[digital badges|badge]].

==History==
Even before the computer was developed, researchers at public universities were working at educating citizens through informal education programs. In the early 1900s, 4-H clubs were formed which taught youth the latest in technological advances in agriculture and home economics.  The success that the youth had in utilizing "new" methods of farming and home economics, caused their parents to adopt the same practices.

As the 4-H club idea was spreading across the country, Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act. which created the Cooperative Extension Service in the United States Department of Agriculture.  The Cooperative Extension Service is a partnership between the USDA, land grant universities in each state, and counties throughout the United States.  Through the work of the Cooperative Extension Services and 4-H, people throughout the United States have easy and inexpensive (most often free) access to the latest research done at [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] without having to visit a college campus or attend college courses.  The educational programs and resources offered by 4-H and the Cooperative Extension Service meet people where they are, and offer them the opportunity to learn what they want to learn, on their own schedules.  In order to meet the changing needs of citizens and the use of new technology, the Cooperative Extension Service has created eXtension, which provides research based, non-biased information on a wide variety of topics to people through the use of the internet.

The ability to share resources on the web at little cost compared to the distribution of hard copies can facilitate open education. An early example of this is the [[opencourseware]] program, established in 2002 by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which was followed by more than 200 [[University|universities]] and organizations. Similar to the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] from the Open Access movement, are the goals and intentions from open education specified in the [[Cape Town Open Education Declaration]]. [[MOOC]] is a more recent form of online course development getting more attention since the fall of 2011 which was followed by a number of non-certificate-granting programs, including [[edX]], [[Coursera]] and [[Udacity]].

== Learning philosophies ==
{{Main|Open learning}}

[[File:Open education and flexible learning.svg|thumbnail|Open education and flexible learning]]
Open education is motivated by a belief that learners want to exercise agency in their studies. Specifically, people engaged in the learning process want to conduct inquiries about potential topics of study, to have a hands-on educational experience instead of a strictly textbook-focused education, to take responsibility for their educational decisions, to experience the emotional and physical side of education, to understand how education and community are related, and to have personal choice in the focus of their classroom studies.&lt;ref name=OE1&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Education - The Classroom, Philosophical Underpinnings, English Beginnings, The American Experience, Controversies Questions and Criticisms|url=http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2303/Open-Education.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These learners do a great deal for one another in promoting learning. Learning in a group environment or contributing to a group is beneficial to each learner. Collaborative group work has substantial benefits, such as increased participation by all group members, better understanding and retention of material, mastery of skills, and increased enthusiasm that can spur the participant on to independent learning. The philosophy of an open education centers on student learning and sees the teacher become the learning assistant.  Teachers are to observe, guide, and provide materials for the learners. The teachers should facilitate, not dominate, the learning process.  Open education is optimistic in the belief that the freedom of choice and student direction will promote a better quality of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cooperative Learning: Students Working in Small Groups|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/CTL/Newsletter/cooperative.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for the learning philosophies of open education can be traced back to the work of educational reformer [[John Dewey]] and developmental psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

== Technology utilized ==

Available technologies for open education are important in the overall efficiency of the program.  After available technologies have been found, there need to be appropriate applications on the technologies for the specific online education program.

Since open education usually occurs at a different time and different place for most individuals across the world, certain technologies need to be utilized to enhance the program.   These technologies are primarily online and serve a variety of purposes.  Websites and other computer-based training may be used to provide lecture notes, assessments, and other course materials.  Videos are provided and feature speakers, class events, topic discussions, and faculty interviews.  YouTube and iTunesU are often used for this purpose.  Students may interact through computer conferencing with Skype or Google+, e-mail, online study groups, or annotations on social bookmarking sites.  Other course content may be provided through tapes, print, and CDs.

Governments, institutions, and people realize the importance of education. Human knowledge is crucial to producing competent leaders, innovators, and teachers. Educational systems must provide each individual the chance in building a better life. Technology has made the expansion of educational opportunities easier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://online.purdue.edu/ldt/learning-design-technology/resources/how-has-technology-changed-education|title=How Has Technology Changed Education?|date=2015-09-21|work=Purdue University Online|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Through the Internet, students can easily find information practically on any topic while mentors are capable of sharing their expertise with any student within seconds. Educational materials are disseminated to a global audience without additional costs. Evolving technology makes it possible for learners to interact with the global community in the comfort of their homes. Under distance learning, universities and colleges expand their impact through online courses that people in any country can take&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/how-can-technology-improve-school-education/|title=How can technology improve school education?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Open education includes resources such as practices and tools that are not hampered by financial, technical, and legal impediments. These resources are used and shared easily within the digital settings. Technology revolutionized techniques in sending receiving information on a daily basis particularly in education. Availability of web resources has transformed everything&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/media/files/copyrightandeducation.html|title=The Digital Learning Challenge: Obstacles to Educational Uses of Content in the Digital Age A Foundational White Paper|website=cyber.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Open education is founded on Open Educational Resources (OER) comprised or learning, teaching, and research sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/|title=Open educational resources {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With Open Education, the costs of textbooks which surged over three times the rate of inflation for many years must not hinder education. Based on the NBC News review of the Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics data, prices of student books increased three times inflation rates from January 1977 until June 2015 reflecting an increase of 1,041 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/freshman-year/college-textbook-prices-have-risen-812-percent-1978-n399926|title=College Textbook Prices Have Risen 1,041 Percent Since 1977|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/college-textbook-prices-increase_n_2409153.html|title=College Textbook Prices Increasing Faster Than Tuition And Inflation|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2013-01-04|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

OER can possibly address this problem since materials are free online and economical in printed form. Resources intended for buying textbooks can be rechanneled towards technology, enhancing the medium of instructions, and lowering debt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://library.educause.edu/topics/teaching-and-learning/open-educational-resources-oer|title=Open Educational Resources (OER)|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Research studies also showed many students learn more because of their access to quality materials. Technology also has unlimited potentials in raising teaching and learning to a higher level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sparcopen.org/open-education/|title=Open Education - SPARC|work=SPARC|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Drawbacks ==

There are a number of concerns regarding the implementation of open education systems, specifically for use in developing countries. These include a potential lack of administrative oversight and quality assurance systems for educators/materials in some programs, infrastructure limitations in developing countries, a lack of equal access to technologies required for students' full participation in online education initiatives, and questions regarding the use of copyrighted materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">A '''pauper's oath''' is a sworn statement or [[oath]] by a person of being completely destitute or a [[pauperism|pauper]], without much [[money]] or [[property]].

A person without the ability to pay court costs has the option to swear a pauper's oath to file a [[lawsuit]] without paying filing fees. Prisoners filing legal actions often use a pauper's oath because persons in [[prison]] are often completely without money or any means of acquiring any.

Historically, especially during the [[Great Depression]], the pauper's oath was required as a prerequisite for receiving [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] in the [[United States]].

One pauper's oath used when establishing indigent status under US federal law is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|3569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have not any property, real or personal, exceeding $20, except such as is by law exempt from being taken on civil process for debt; and that I have no property in any way conveyed or concealed, or in any way disposed of, for my future use or benefit.}}

"So help me God," at the end, is optional.

A '''presentation''' is the process of presenting a topic to an [[audience]]. It is typically a demonstration, introduction, [[lecture]], or speech meant to inform, persuade, inspire, motivate, or to build good will or to present a new idea or product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/presentation|title=presentation {{!}} Definition of presentation in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also be used for a formal or ritualized introduction or offering, as with the presentation of a [[debutante]]. Presentations in certain formats are also known as [[keynote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/keynote|title=keynote {{!}} Definition of keynote in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; address.

A [[presentation program]] is often used to generate the presentation content, some of which also allow presentations to be developed [[Collaboration|collaboratively]], e.g. using the Internet by geographically disparate collaborators. Presentation viewers can be used to combine content from different sources into one presentation. Some of the popular presentation products used across the globe are offered by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Microsoft]].

      <comment>Removed external link to an archive of "Recent Proxy Statements" published by the SEC. This link takes the user to an archive of 2009 proxy statements and surfing the URL screenshots to more recent archives only go through 2012. These screenshot archives are therefore irrelevant and certainly not "recent." Perhaps a new web URL now houses recent proxy statements.</comment>

A '''proxy statement''' is a statement required of a firm when soliciting shareholder votes. This statement is filed in advance of the annual meeting. The firm needs to file a proxy statement, otherwise known as a Form DEF 14A (Definitive Proxy Statement), with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].  This statement is useful in assessing how management is paid and potential conflict-of-interest issues with auditors.  The statement includes:
* Voting procedure and information.
* Background information about the company's nominated directors including relevant history in the company or industry, positions on other corporate boards, and potential conflicts in interest.
* Board compensation.
* Executive compensation, including salary, bonus, non-equity compensation, stock awards, options, and [[deferred compensation]]. Also, information is included about perks such as personal use of company aircraft, travel, and tax gross-ups. Many companies will also include pre-determined payout packages for if an executive leaves the company.
* Who is on the audit committee, as well as a breakdown of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor.

SEC proxy rules: The term "proxy statement" means the statement required by Section 240.14a-3(a) whether or not contained in a single document.

In many cases, shareholder votes—particularly institutional shareholder votes—are determined by [[proxy firm]]s which advise the shareholders...

Traditionally, [[broker-dealer]]s have been permitted to vote for "routine" proposals on behalf of their shareholders if the shareholders do not return the proxy statement. This has been controversial, and in 2006 the NYSE Proxy Working Group recommended that the rules be modified so that uncontested director elections were not considered routine.&lt;ref&gt;NYSE Working Group. (June 5, 2006). [https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/REVISED_NYSE_Report_6_5_06.pdf REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PROXY WORKING GROUP TO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE].&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC approved the rule on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2009/34-60215.pdf Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Amendment No. 4, to Amend NYSE Rule 452 and Corresponding Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 to Eliminate Broker Discretionary Voting for the Election of Directors, Except for Companies Registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to Codify Two Previously Published Interpretations that Do Not Permit Broker Discretionary Voting for Material Amendments to Investment Advisory Contracts with an Investment Company]. Release No. 34-60215; File No. SR-NYSE-2006-92. Discussed by the NY Times Dealbook at: [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/sec-split-on-broker-voting-change/ Curbs on Broker Voting Are Approved].&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the SEC announced that it was seeking public comment on the efficiency of the proxy system.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-122.htm SEC Votes to Seek Public Comment on U.S. Proxy System].&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some controversy over "proxy access" which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement. Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the proxy statement. The United States [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-155.htm SEC Adopts New Measures to Facilitate Director Nominations by Shareholders].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the rule was struck down by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120403125211/http://corpgov.proxyexchange.org/2011/07/what-would-proxy-access-look-like-if-done-right/ What Would Proxy Access Look Like if Done Right?].

'''Pseudo-Apuleius''' is the name given in modern scholarship to the author of a 4th-century [[herbal]] known as '''''Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius''''' or '''''Herbarium Apuleii Platonici'''''. Whoever the author of the text was apparently wished readers to think that it was by [[Apuleius|Apuleius of Madaura]] (124–170 CE), the Roman poet and philosopher, but modern scholars do not believe this attribution. Little or nothing else is known of Pseudo-Apuleius apart from this.

The oldest surviving [[manuscript]] of the ''Herbarium'' is the sixth-century [[Leiden]], MS. Voss. Q.9. Until the twelfth century it was the most influential herbal in Europe, with numerous extant copies surviving into the modern era, along with several copies of an [[Old English]] translation. Thereafter it was more or less displaced by the ''[[Matthaeus Platearius|Circa instans]]'', a herbal produced at the school of [[Salerno]]. "Pseudo-Apuleius" is also used as a shorthand generic term to refer to the manuscripts and derived works.

=== Text ===
The text of ''Pseudo-Apuleius herbarius'' is based on [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] sources, especially on ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|historia naturalis]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and on ''[[De Materia Medica|de materia medica]]'' of [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]]. Scholars agree that the herbarius was compiled in the 4th century, according to Sigerist (1930, p.&amp;nbsp;200) from Latin, according to Singer (1927, p.&amp;nbsp;37) from Greek sources. Each of the 128 up to 131 chapters of the book (the number varying between manuscripts) dealt with one medical plant. In these chapters the name of the plant was followed by the enumeration of [[indication (medicine)|indications]] in the form of [[recipe]]s and by [[synonym]]s of the plants name.
 
For example: Chapter 89, Herba millefolium (Edition of Howald/Sigerist 1927):

[[File:singer-a.png|thumb|right|Simplified schedule by Singer 1927.]]
Howald and Sigerist (edition 1927, V–XVI) divided the codices into 3 classes (α, β and γ) according to the varying mixture of associated texts in the codices: 
*α-class containing parts 1, 2, 3, 4a and 5, moreover better synonyms than in the β-class-texts and no [[interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. The α-class is considered to be the class with the best text-tradition.
*β-class containing parts 1, 2, 3, 4b, 5 and 6, moreover [[interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. The ß-class is considered to be the class with the best illustrations.
*γ-class containing parts 1, 2 and 6, without the [[interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]] of the β-class. γ-class contains the oldest manuscripts.

== Translation: the ''Old English Herbarium'' ==
[[File:Herbarium.Apuleii.jpg|thumb|Page of the Old English Herbarium in Cotton Vitellius C. iii.]]
A version of the ''Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius'' was translated into Old English, surviving now in four manuscripts:

* London, British Library Cotton Vitellius C. iii (illustrated)
* Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 76
* London, British Library Harley 585
* London, British Library Harley 6258B (updated into early Middle English)

Like many of the Latin manuscripts, it includes the ''Herbarium of Pseudo-Apuleius'', ''De herba vetonica'', ''De taxone'', ''medicina de quadrupedibus'', and the ''Liber medicinae ex herbis feminis''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Anne Van Arsdall (trans.), ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FY8kw-k8j1gC Medieval Herbal Remedies: The Old English Herbarium and Anglo-Saxon Medicine]'' (New York: Routledge 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; It was first edited and translated by [[Oswald Cockayne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/leechdomswortcun01cock#page/n15/mode/2up|title=Leechdoms Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England Being a Collection of Documents, for the Most Part Never Before Printed Illustrating the History of Science in this Country Before the Norman Conquest|last=Cockayne|first=Oswald|work=Rerum Britannicarum Medii Ævi Scriptores (Rolls Series)|year=1864|volume=I|location=London}} (Based on London, British Library, MS Cotton Vitellius C. iii.)&lt;/ref&gt; re-edited in 1984 by Jan de Vriend,&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jan de Vriend (ed.), ''The Old English Herbarium and Medicina de Quadrupedibus'', The Early English Text Society, 286 (London: Oxford University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; and re-translated in 2002 by Anne Van Arsdall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A variety of dates and places have been suggested for the production of this translation, ranging from eighth-century Northumbria to late-tenth-century Winchester, with recent scholarship tending towards tenth-century [[Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;Article Hall (2013), '[http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/78178/ ''Elleborus'' in Anglo-Saxon England, 900–1100: ''Tunsingwyrt'' and ''Wodewistle'']', ''Leeds Studies in English'', new series, 44 (2013), 70-93 (p. 73). &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3695">'''Rafiq Hilmi''' (1898–1960) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] historian, writer and politician born in [[Kirkuk]]. He was founder of the Kurdish party ''Hîwa'' in 1938 and author of many books on the history of Kurdistan and Kurdish language. After attending school in [[Sulaymaniyah|Sulaimania]] and [[Baghdad]], he continued his studies at the Military Academy and Technical School of [[Istanbul]].

==Literary Life==
Early in his career as a writer, he worked for two Kurdish newspapers: ''Rojî Kurdistan'', the official newspaper of [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]], and ''Bangî Kurdistan''.He became recognized as a talented literary critic after publication of the second volume of his ''Kurdish Poetry and Literature'' in 1956. In this work for the first time [[Abdulla Goran|Goran]]'s poetry and characteristics of the modernist literary movement which he represented were studied and analyzed in depth.&lt;ref&gt;F. Shakely, ''The Kurdish Qasida'', pp.327-338, in ''Qasida Poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa'', By C. Shackle, S. Sperl, BRILL Publishers, 1996, {{ISBN|90-04-03587-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also written several others books on Kurdish history and politics.

==Political life==

Rafiq Hilmi is well known in Kurdish politics as the founder of a party called ''Hîwa'' (Hope) in 1938. This party was first organized in [[Kirkuk]] and then its activities were expanded to north and central [[Iraq]]. It was initially a secret organization and there were Kurdish intellectuals and civil servants among its rank. While the political program of Hîwa was a mainly nationalist one and focused on securing [[autonomy]] for [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], many members were also leftist-minded.&lt;ref&gt;G.R.V. Stansfield, ''Iraqi Kurdistan: Political Development and Emergent Democracy'', 224 pp., Routledge Publishers, 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-30278-1}} (see p.64)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafiq Hilmi, himself was more supportive of a pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] line within the party. ''Hîwa'' had established links with activists of ''Komala JK''&lt;ref&gt;''The Committee for the Revival of Kurdistan'', D. McDowall, ''A Modern History of the Kurds'', I.B. Tauris, 504 pp., 2004, {{ISBN|1-85043-416-6}} (see p.237)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Mahabad]] and it sent two army officers ''Mustafa Khushnaw'' and ''Mir Haj Ahmad'' to the founding ceremony of Komala JK in September 1942. Hîwa maintained its links with Mahabad movement until the collapse of [[Republic of Mahabad]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;D. McDowall, ''A Modern History of the Kurds'', pp.290,294&lt;/ref&gt;
Rafiq Himli also served in many posts under various Iraqi administrations, including Director of Education in [[Sulaimaniya]] in 1943, Deputy Governor of [[Baghdad]] in 1954 and Iraqi Cultural Attaché in [[Ankara]] in 1959.

'''Sagara''' (Sagala) is a [[Bantu language]] of the [[Morogoro]] and [[Dodoma Region|Dodoma]] regions of [[Tanzania]]. It is sometimes called ''Southern Sagala'' to distinguish it from the [[Sagalla language]] of Kenya (''Northern Sagala''); the similarity of the names is a coincidence.

The '''silent holocaust''' is a phrase that is used to refer to multiple unrelated items.
* The [[Guatemalan genocide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GUATEMALA 1982|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_guatemala1.html|website=Peace Pledge Union Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 166,000&lt;ref name ="GHCC"&gt;83% of the "fully identified" 42,275 civilians killed by human rights violations during the Guatemalan Civil War were Mayan and 17% ere Ladino.

* [[Abortion]], among some involved in [[pro-life activism]]. One group is the "[[Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=The New Face of the Anti-Abortion Movement|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-face-of-the-anti-abortion-movement|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Vice|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referring to assimilation of Jews==
{{see also|The Holocaust}}
Concerned Jewish people sometimes refer to assimilation (along with abortion within the Jewish community) as a type of Holocaust. This is because assimilation is the leading cause for the shrinkage of almost all Jewish populations in [[Western world|Western countries]] since World War II. This shrinkage has been called the ''Silent Holocaust'' [http://www.njop.org/html/Newsletters_and_articles.html#a1] (in comparison to [[The Holocaust|the genocide against Jews]] during World War II) by communal leaders such as [[Rabbi]] [[Ephraim Buchwald]] of the National Jewish Outreach Program, perhaps the best-known popularizer of the phrase. The Jewish community will not be recognizable in 25 to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://njop.org/resources/publications-archive/articles/the-holocaust-is-killing-americas-jews/&lt;/ref&gt; 50% of American Jews marry a non-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/Silent-Holocaust-Gets-a-Voice.html&lt;/ref&gt; Better education is associated with lower levels of intermarriage because Jews with a higher education level encounter a marriage market with more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=83913 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815001511/http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=83913 |archivedate=2004-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in pro-life circles==
To pro-life activists, the "silent holocaust" refers to the estimated 60,000,000 [[fetuses]] that have been aborted in the [[United States]] since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=The New Face of the Anti-Abortion Movement|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-face-of-the-anti-abortion-movement|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Vice|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Tim|title=Mention of Holocaust in SC abortion debate sparks anger|url=http://www.thestate.com/2014/05/02/3421686/mention-of-holocaust-in-sc-abortion.html|newspaper=The State|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Are the Survivors?|url=http://www.survivors.la/who-are-the-survivors/|publisher=Survivors LA|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One activist group, known as the "[[Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust]]," feels that everyone has been directly affected by this holocaust because all people have been denied the company of aborted individuals. This group believes it is their job to "defend the right to life of future generations and end America's [[genocide]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=The New Face of the Anti-Abortion Movement|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-face-of-the-anti-abortion-movement|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Vice|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=The liberal professor who stepped right into an anti-abortion trap|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-the-liberal-professor-antiabortion-trap-20140331,0,5627786.story#ixzz30JJagBGn|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Are the Survivors?|url=http://www.survivors.la/who-are-the-survivors/|publisher=Survivors LA|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a pro-life politician, Senator [[Mike Fair]], brought this terminology into the political domain, during a debate in the [[South Carolina State Senate]].  The debate was over a proposed bill which would ban abortions past 20 weeks. Fair said, "This Holocaust of our making in our country is 60 million and counting," referring to the estimated number abortions performed since ''[[Roe vs Wade]]'' legalized abortion in the US.  Fair also said [[Hitler]] believed "because you're a Jew you had no right to live. In essence, some people are more qualified to live than others. And that's what we're saying here", referring to abortion. This sparked an outcry from Senator [[Joel Lourie]], who is Jewish. Lourie said, "We can debate science and medicine and personhood all day long. But when 6 million people, men, women and children, are dragged into gas chambers, I don’t think that's an appropriate comparison."  Fair responded with, "Six million, it shouldn’t have been one, for crying out loud. Six million is incredibly horrible, what they endured. But those 60 million taken out of the womb will never have a chance to be dragged into anything. They’re gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Tim|title=Mention of Holocaust in SC abortion debate sparks anger|url=http://www.thestate.com/2014/05/02/3421686/mention-of-holocaust-in-sc-abortion.html|newspaper=The State|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Borden|first=Jeremy|title=20-week abortion ban moves to S.C.

In 2013, [[Jim Bob Duggar]], former state legislator and star of the reality television series  {{em|[[19 Kids and Counting]]}}, compared abortion to the Holocaust at the [[Values Voters Summit]].  The comparison sparked criticism, to which Duggar responded, "Let me clarify, We have since 1973 had 55 million abortions, so what we have going on is a baby holocaust."  Opposition to this statement prompted a [[MoveOn.org]] petition to cancel Duggar's reality television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Laura|title=’19 Kids And Counting’ Jim Bob Duggar Compares Abortions To Holocaust, Now Show Protested|url=http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/19-kids-and-counting-jim-bob-duggar-compares-abortions-to-holocaust-now-show-protested-45794/|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=The Global Dispatch|date=13 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haley|first=Garrett|title=Abortion Advocates Call for Cancellation of Duggar Family's ’19 Kids and Counting’|url=http://christiannews.net/2013/11/11/abortion-advocates-call-for-cancellation-of-duggar-familys-19-kids-and-counting/|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=Christian News Network|date=11 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dries|first=Kate|title=Jim Bob Duggar Thinks America's in the Midst of 'A Baby Holocaust'|url=http://jezebel.com/jim-bob-duggar-thinks-americas-in-the-midst-of-a-baby-1446645823|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=Jezebel|date=16 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social impact entertainment''' ('''SIE''') is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value.

The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of [[Entertainment-education]] which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/entertainment-education/|title=Entertainment-Education|date=2012-10-24|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "[[Impact producer|Impact Producers]]" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building.

[[Cinema of Change]] reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/the-cinema-of-change-ecosystem/|title=The Cinema of Change EcosystemThe Cinema of Change Ecosystem - Cinema of Change|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable being [[Participant Media]] due to its $100 million+ funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jmkdbrhlfK8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Tech Billionaires: Reshaping Philanthropy in a Quest for a Better World|last=Solomon|first=Lewis D.|date=2011-12-31|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412813747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Norman Lear Center]] and [[UCLA TFT]]'s Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.

A '''stone butch''' is a [[lesbian]] or trans-masculine person who displays female butchness or traditional "[[masculinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Female Masculinity|last = Halberstam|first = Judith|publisher = Duke University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = |chapter = Even Stone Butches Get the Blues}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone butches usually do not like to be sexually touched genitally by their partners; however, they still provide their partners with sexual gratification, and often experience pleasure themselves in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures|last=Zimmerman|first=Bonnie|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=9780815319207|location=|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stone butch woman is also receptive to receiving sexual pleasure from her female partner in different ways as well.

The term was popularized by [[Leslie Feinberg]] in ''[[Stone Butch Blues]]'',  a 1993 novel describing the protagonist's explorations of the lesbian community. A large segment of the novel is devoted to the tribulations of being a stone butch person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27336208|title=Stone butch blues : a novel|last=1949-2014.|first=Feinberg, Leslie,|date=1993|publisher=Firebrand Books|isbn=1555838537|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|oclc=27336208}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the novel the protagonist ultimately settles the battle between her gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual role by claiming the autonomy to identify however she wishes.

'''Target acquisition''' is the detection, identification, and location of a target in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non-lethal means. The term is used for a broad area of applications. 

A "target" here is an entity or object considered for possible engagement or other action (see [[Targeting (warfare)]]). Targets include a wide array of resources that an enemy commander can use to conduct operations including mobile and stationary units, forces, equipment, capabilities, facilities, persons and functions. It may comprise target acquisition,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enlisted.info/field-manuals/fm-6-121-field-artillery-target-acquisition.shtml|Field{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} Manual 6-121&lt;/ref&gt; Joint Targeting&lt;ref name="dtic"&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/doctrine/jwfc/jntfiretar_hdbk.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Information Operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwar.org.uk/iwar/resources/doctrine/fm-3-13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Technically target acquisition may just denote the process of a weapon system to decide which object to lock on to, as opposed to surveillance on one and [[Tracking system|target tracking]]{{dn|date=May 2018}} on the other side; for example in an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft system]].

== History ==
Target acquisition under the doctrines of the [[Cold War]] and post–Cold War were focused on identifying the capabilities, assets and identities of large troop formations, air defense systems, artillery, rockets, missiles and identifying other High Pay-off Targets (HPTs) and [[High-value target|High Value Targets]] (HVTs). HPTs, which if successfully engaged and neutralized, significantly contribute to the success of the "friendly commander's" course of action. HVT is a target that an "enemy commander" requires for completion of a mission. They both seem to accomplish the same, but are different when conducting the targeting analysis process.

Since the [[September 11 attacks]], target acquisition has become a highly technical, robust and complex process because of the priority target types, including the targeting of individuals. Whereas a satellite can locate a missile launcher or a formation of 16 tanks by its shape, heat signature or size, it cannot identify and locate 1 of 7 billion individuals without having a person on the ground to recognize, report and engage that individual. This also requires an enhancement of [[Human intelligence (espionage)|Human Intelligence (HUMINT)]] sources or the enhancement of biometric technology for the purpose of positive identification of individuals in the targeting process.&lt;ref name="dtic" /&gt; The Joint Targeting process is better suited for targeting individuals. The latest U.S. doctrine is the JP 3-60, ''Joint Doctrine for Targeting''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bits.de/NRANEU/others/jp-doctrine/jp3_60(02).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Uru language''', more specifically known as '''Iru-Itu''', and '''Uchumataqu''', is an extinct language formerly spoken by the [[Uru people]]. In 2004, it had 2 remaining native speakers out of an ethnic group of 140 people in the [[La Paz Department, Bolivia]] near [[Lake Titicaca]], the rest having shifted to [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The language is close enough to the [[Chipaya language]] to sometimes be considered a dialect of that language.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Olson (1964) mentions a variety of Uru, [[Uru of Ch'imu]], spoken on the [[Isla del Sol]] in Lake Titicaca. It is not clear if this was a dialect of Iru Itu or a separate Uru language.

==Identifying Uchumataqu==
Due to one of the Uru's name for their language, "Pukina", some linguists have grouped Uru with the [[Arawakan languages|Arawaken languages]] or have accidentally mistaken Uchumataqu with [[Puquina language|Puquina]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danielsen|first=Swintha|year=2010|title=Review of "Uchumataqu: The Lost Language of the Urus of Bolivia. A Description of the Language as Documented between 1894 and 1952. Indigenous Languages of Latin America"|jstor=40929741|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=52|pages=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the personal and posessive pronouns of the older, unrelated Puquina are similar to those of Arawaken languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language of the Andes|last=Adelaar|first=Willem F. H.|publisher=Cambridge Language Surveys|year=2004|isbn= 978-0-511-21050-1 |location=Cambridge, GB|pages=353|quote=|via=Ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uru differs drastically from Arawaken languages in its person-marking system and its morphology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Uchumataqu is known for being related to [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and other Andean languages, with borrowed grammatical and lexical morphemes from a prolonged exposure to Aymara&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a very similar pronoun system to [[Chipaya language|Chipaya]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pena|first=Jaime|year=2009|title=Uchumataqu: The Lost Language of the Urus of Bolivia. A Grammatical Description of the Language as Documented between 1894 and 1952.|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c248ab88-9a37-4cc1-ad23-1988b8c063f6%40sessionmgr4010&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=4111|journal=Studies in Language|volume=33|pages=1012–1018|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Uru has many differentiating features like not being [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and having a five-vowel system (a e i o u) while Aymara which is polysynthetic and has a three-vowel system (a i u)
&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, Uru does not identify gender morphologically as Chipaya does.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Wenlin Software for Learning Chinese''' ({{zh|c=文林|p=[[wikt:wénlín|Wénlín]]|l=Literature forest}}) is a [[software]] [[application software|application]] designed by Tom Bishop, who is also president of the Wenlin Institute. It is based on his experience of the needs of learners of the [[Chinese language]], predominantly [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. It contains a dictionary function, a corpus of Chinese texts, a function for reading and creating Chinese text files, and a [[flashcard]] function. By pointing the cursor at a Chinese character the software looks up an English word, and vice versa, working like a dictionary. The software recognizes files in [[Unicode]], [[GB 2312]], [[Big5]], and [[HZ (character encoding)|HZ]] format.

==Functions==
===Dictionary function===
The dictionary contains an electronic version of the [[ABC Chinese–English Dictionary]] by [[John DeFrancis]] and the [[Shuowen Jiezi]] seal character dictionary. The current version (4.3.2) contains more than 300,000 Chinese-English entries and over 60,000 English-Chinese entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wenlin.com/|title=Wenlin -|website=wenlin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wenlin.com/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Wenlin - Wenlin|website=wenlin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It allows users to search for Chinese characters or words by inputting either Chinese characters or pinyin using a variety of input options, including handwriting recognition. Users can update existing entries add new definitions to the dictionary. The program can also be extended with additional data modules, such as the [[ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese]].

Unlike most electronic Chinese dictionaries, characters in Wenlin are defined in terms of the [[Chinese_character_description_language|Character Description Language]] (CDL), an XML specification for describing complex glyphs in East Asian language, developed by the Wenlin Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.wenlininstitute.org/wenlin4.3/Character_Description_Language|title=Character Description Language - Wenlin Guide|website=guide.wenlininstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the program to define characters and character variants that are not defined in existing character sets such as [[Unicode]]. Version 4.3.2 of Wenlin covers more than 80,000 Chinese characters, including many rare characters.

===List function===
The software allows the user to display lists of Chinese characters ordered by [[pinyin]], stroke count, frequency, components, or Unicode. It also displays lists of words by pinyin, frequency, and serial number. English words can be displayed alphabetically, as well as the [[List of Kangxi radicals|214 radicals]] of the Chinese language.

===Corpus and text function===
The paid version of the software comes with a small corpus of largely Classical Chinese texts. The software also allows users to open text files in a variety of [[Chinese_character_encoding|Chinese character encodings]].

==Development and versioning==
Wenlin Software for Learning Chinese is developed and sold by the Wenlin Institute, a [[Social Purpose Corporation]] for Chinese and English language education, with Tom Bishop as President. The current paid version of the software, called the DELUXE Edition ({{zh|c=文林完整版|p=Wénlín Wánzhěngbǎn}}), is 4.3.2. Wenlin Institute also offers a free 4.2.1 version, called the Free Edition ({{zh|c=文林免費版|p=Wénlín Miǎnfèibǎn}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3250">{{short description|quotation from The Tempest}}
[[File:What is Past is Prologue statue.jpg|thumb|right|"What is past is prologue", inscribed on ''Future'' (1935, Robert Aitken) located on the northeast corner of the [[National Archives Building]] in Washington, DC]]

"'''What's past is prologue'''" is a quotation by [[William Shakespeare]] from his play ''[[The Tempest]]''.  The phrase was originally used in ''The Tempest'', Act 2, Scene I. [[The Tempest#Characters|Antonio]] uses it to suggest that all that has happened before that time, the "past", has led [[The Tempest#Characters|Sebastian]] and himself to this opportunity to do what they are about to do: commit murder, or make another choice.  

In contemporary use, the phrase stands for the idea that history sets the context for the present. The quotation is engraved on the [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, DC]],&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations.  1989. [http://www.bartleby.com/73/1296.html NUMBER:	1296]&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly used by the military when discussing the similarities between war throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;The Past as Prologue? A History of U.S. Counterinsurgency Policy in Colombia, 1958-66 [http://www.stormingmedia.us/22/2280/A228004.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Williamson ''The Past as Prologue: The Importance of History to the Military Profession '' Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (May 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical meaning==
The phrase was originally used in ''The Tempest'', Act 2, Scene I. [[The Tempest#Characters|Antonio]] uses it to suggest that all that has happened before that time, the "past," has led [[The Tempest#Characters|Sebastian]] and himself to this opportunity to do what they are about to do: commit murder. In the context of the preceding and next lines, "(And by that destiny) to perform an act, Whereof what's past is prologue; what to come, In yours and my discharge," Antonio is in essence rationalizing to Sebastian and the audience that he and Sebastian are fated to act by all that has led up to that moment, the past has set the stage for their next act, as a prologue does in a play. It can also be taken to mean that everything up until now has merely set the stage for Antonio and Sebastian to make their own destinies.

==Contemporary use==
* [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] used the quotation in the 2008 [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|vice-presidential debate]] against Sarah Palin when he was accused of focusing too much on the past.&lt;ref&gt;"Replied Biden: "Past is prologue." He went on to defend his emphasis on the Bush policies often supported by McCain." [http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/711987.html 'In debate, both candidates accomplished their primary missions'] Miami Herald 10.03.08&lt;/ref&gt;
* The debut studio album of American ambient music project [[Tycho_(musician)|Tycho]] is called [[Past_Is_Prologue_(album)|Past is Prologue]].
* A 2018 episode of [[Star Trek: Discovery]] is called [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep13|What's Past Is Prologue]].
