The '''A36''' is a [[trunk road]] and [[primary route]] in southwest England that links the port city of [[Southampton]] to the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. At Bath, the A36 connects with the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4 road]] to [[Bristol]], thus providing a road link between the major ports of Southampton and Bristol. Originally, the A36 continued to Avonmouth, but this section was renumbered to the A4. On its way south from Bath the A36 passes a number of towns and a city, including [[Warminster]], [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] and [[Salisbury]] in [[Wiltshire]], and [[Totton]] in [[Hampshire]], on the western outskirts of Southampton, where it joins the [[A35 road|A35]].

==Standard of route==
The majority of the A36 is built to single carriageway standard, but parts of it have been upgraded to [[dual carriageway]]. The A36 is dual carriageway for its &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;1&amp;nbsp;mile&amp;nbsp;(1.6&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; bypass of the village of [[Beckington]], &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;3&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(5&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; north of [[Frome]], and also dualled for approximately &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;1&amp;nbsp;mile&amp;nbsp;(1.6&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; near its [[grade separation|grade separated]] junction with the [[A303 road]], &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;8&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(13&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; north-west of Wilton. The A36 in Salisbury acts as the city's ring road, [[bypass (road)|bypassing]] the city centre to dual carriageway standard. Just south-east of Salisbury the largest dualled section runs for about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;4&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(6&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt;, bypassing the village of [[Alderbury]]. Then, the road is briefly dualled from its [[roundabout]] with the [[A3090 road]] to the [[M27 motorway]] (junction 2) &amp;ndash; this part of the road is erroneously thought by some to have been previously known as the '''A36(M)'''; prior to the opening of the Totton Western Bypass on the other side of the junction, it was named as a spur of the M27, and hence is built to motorway standards. The A36 reverts to single carriageway standard through Totton until it terminates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1315">The '''Actino-&lt;i&gt;ugpB&lt;/i&gt; RNA motif''' is a conserved [[RNA]] structure that was [[Bioinformatics discovery of non-coding RNAs|discovered by bioinformatics]].&lt;ref name="Weinberg2017b"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinberg Z, Lünse CE, Corbino KA, Ames TD, Nelson JW, Roth A, Perkins KR, Sherlock ME, Breaker RR |title=Detection of 224 candidate structured RNAs by comparative analysis of specific subsets of intergenic regions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=45 |issue=18 |pages=10811–10823 |date=October 2017 |pmid=28977401 |pmc=5737381 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkx699 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Actino-&lt;i&gt;ugpB&lt;/i&gt; motifs are found in strains of the species ''[[Gardnerella vaginalis]]'', within the phylum [[Actinobacteria]].

It is ambiguous whether Actino-&lt;i&gt;ugpB&lt;/i&gt; RNAs function as [[cis-regulatory element]]s or whether they operate in ''trans''.  Many of the RNAs are upstream of the gene 'ugpB', which encodes a protein putatively involved in [[sugar]] [[secretion|transport]].  However, several of the RNAs are not located upstream of a protein-coding [[gene]].  Structurally, the motif consists of two hairpins with conserved [[nucleotide]]s located in the stems and outside of the hairpins, but not in their terminal loops.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1064">'''Athermalization''', in [[optics]], is the process of achieving [[optothermal stability]] and ensuring that [[optical properties]] do not change with variations in temperature.&lt;ref name="IgaKokubun2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenichi Iga|author2=Yasuo Kokubun|title=Encyclopedic Handbook of Integrated Optics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUZuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|date=1 November 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-2781-5|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, athermalization can be achieved by making the optics and metering structure out of the same material. This is very difficult in practice, as materials that are ideal for use in optics are often brittle or expensive, and are thus not always ideal for use in a metering structure. For this reason, athermalization is often achieved by using switchbacks or in-depth knowledge of the thermal elastic effects that are present in the particular system.&lt;ref&gt;http://optomechanicalservices.com/Athermalization&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E. D. Babbitt.png|thumb|Edwin Dwight Babbitt an early proponent of Chromotherapy]]
'''Chromotherapy''', sometimes called '''color therapy''', '''colorology''' or '''cromatherapy''', is an [[alternative medicine]] method, which is considered [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromotherapists claim to be able to use [[light]] in the form of [[color]] to balance "energy" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels.

Color therapy is distinct from other types of [[light therapy]], such as [[Neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice treatment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1108807 |pmc=1545706 |year=1975 |author1=Dobbs |first1=R.

J. |doi=10.1136/adc.50.11.833}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blood irradiation therapy]] which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions,&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; and from [[photobiology]], the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms. The potential risk of retinal damage linked to chromotherapy has been discussed by French skeptic and lighting physicist Sébastien Point. Although Point considers that LED lamps at domestic radiance are safe in normal use for the general population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/shouldnt-afraid-leds/|title=Why you shouldn't be afraid of LEDs - European Scientist|author=|date=1 February 2018|website=europeanscientist.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  Some evidence that white LEDs are toxic for Human at domestic radiance?, Radioprotection, september 2017 , https://www.radioprotection.org/articles/radiopro/abs/2017/04/radiopro170025/radiopro170025.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.&lt;ref&gt;S.Point, the danger of chromotherapy, Skeptical Inquirer, Vol.41, N°4, July/August 2017 skepdigest.awardspace.us/The_Danger_of_Chromotherapy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrp.asso.fr/medias/sfrp/documents/Divers/Fiche%20lampes%20%C3%A0%20Led%20SFRP%20-%20Anglais%20_%2006-2018%20(2).pdf S. Point and A. Barlier-Salsi, LED lighting and retinal damage.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[Avicenna]] (980–1037), seeing color as of vital importance both in [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and in [[Therapy|treatment]], discussed chromotherapy in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. He wrote that "color is an observable symptom of disease" and also developed a chart that related color to the [[temperature]] and physical condition of the body. His view was that red moved the blood, blue or white cooled it, and yellow reduced muscular pain and inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ecam/neh137 |pmid=16322805 |pmc=1297510 |year=2005 |author1=Azeemi |first1=S. T. |title=A Critical Analysis of Chromotherapy and Its Scientific Evolution |journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=481–488 |last2=Raza |first2=S. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Civil War General [[Augustus Pleasonton]] (1801–1894) conducted his own experiments and in 1876 published his book ''The Influence Of The Blue Ray Of The Sunlight And Of The Blue Color Of The Sky'' about how the color [[blue]] can improve the growth of crops and livestock and can help heal diseases in humans. This led to modern chromotherapy, influencing scientist Dr. Seth Pancoast (1823–1889) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt (1828–1905) to conduct experiments and to publish, respectively, ''Blue and Red Light; or, Light and Its Rays as Medicine'' (1877) and ''The Principles of Light and Color''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Paul. (2001). ''Banvard's Folly: Tales of Renowned Obscurity, Famous Anonymity, and Rotten Luck''. Picador. p. 229. {{ISBN|0-330-48689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Indian-born American-citizen scientist [[Dinshah P. Ghadiali]] (1873–1966), published ''The Spectro Chromemetry Encyclopaedia'', a work on color therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, Joe. [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/spectro.html "Colorful Nonsense: Dinshah Ghadiali and His Spectro-Chrome Device"]. Quackwatch.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghadiali claimed to have discovered why and how the different colored rays have various therapeutic effects on organisms. He believed that colors represent chemical potencies in higher octaves of vibration, and for each organism and system of the body there is a particular color that stimulates and another that inhibits the work of that organ or system. Ghadiali also thought that by knowing the action of the different colors upon the different organs and systems of the body, one can apply the correct color that will tend to balance the action of any organ or system that has become abnormal in its functioning or condition. Dinshah P. Ghadiali's son Darius Dinshah continues to provide information about color therapy via his Dinshah Health Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing non-pharmaceutical home color therapy, and his book ''Let There Be Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dinshah | first=Darius | title=Let There be Light | isbn=978-0933917309 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5wBLPwAACAAJ | year=2012 | publisher=Dinshah Health Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] had described Ghadiali as "perhaps the greatest quack of them all". In 1925, Ghadiali was accused of rape and arrested in Seattle and sentenced under the [[Mann Act]] for five years at the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]]. According to Gardner, photographs of Ghadiali at work in his laboratory are "indistinguishable from stills of a grade D movie about a mad scientist".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. pp. 211-212. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century "color healers" claimed colored glass filters could treat many diseases including [[constipation]] and [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Gruson | first = L | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/science/color-has-a-powerful-effect-on-behavior-researchers-assert.html?&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Color has a powerful effect on behavior, researchers assert | date = 1982-10-19 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colored chakras==
[[File:Chakra silhouette.png|thumb|100px|A New Age conceptualisation of the chakras of Indian body culture and their positions in the human body]]

Practitioners of [[ayurvedic medicine]] believe the body has seven "[[chakra]]s", which some claim are 'spiritual centers', and which are held to be located along the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. [[New Age]] thought associates each of the chakras with a single color of the visible light spectrum, along with a function and organ or bodily system. According to this view, the chakras can become imbalanced and result in physical diseases, but application of the appropriate color can allegedly correct  such imbalances.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = D | year = 2001 | title = Color Decoder | isbn = 978-0-7641-1887-6 | publisher = Barron's }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purported colors and their associations are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm | title = Color Psychology: How Colors Impact Moods, Feelings, and Behaviors | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[About.com]] | last = van Wagner | first = K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific reception ==

Chromotherapy is regarded by health experts as [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. (1993). ''Mystical Diets: Paranormal, Spiritual, and Occult Nutrition Practices''. Prometheus Books. pp. 256-257. {{ISBN|0-87975-761-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Jonathan. (2003). ''Quack Magic: The Dubious History of Health Fads and Cures''. Ebury Press. p. 216. {{ISBN|978-0091888091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book published by the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific evidence does not support claims that alternative uses of light or color therapy are effective in treating cancer or other illnesses".&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ades | first = Terri | year = 2009 | title = Complete Guide to Complementary &amp; Alternative Cancer Therapies | isbn = 9781604430530 | publisher = American Cancer Society | pages = 210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photobiology]], the term for the scientific study of the effects of light on living tissue, has sometimes been used instead of the term chromotherapy in an effort to distance it from its roots in Victorian [[mysticism]] and to strip it of its associations with symbolism and magic.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt; [[Light therapy]] is a specific treatment approach using high intensity light to treat specific sleep, skin and mood disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2174">{{Other uses|Contextualization (disambiguation){{!}}Contextualization}}
'''Contextualization''' in [[sociolinguistics]] refers to the use of language and [[discourse]] to signal relevant aspects of an interactional or communicative situation. [[Basil Bernstein]] (1990 [1971]) uses (re)contextualization when referring to the reformulation of scientific knowledge in pedagogical contexts, for instance in [[textbooks]]. [[John J. Gumperz|John Gumperz]] (1982a, 1982b) and others in [[interactional sociolinguistics]] study subtle "contextualization cues", for instance [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], that allow language users to infer contextually adequate meanings of discourse (see also Eerdmans, Prevignano &amp; Thibault, 2002).

Gumperz (1982a) suggests that in the following interaction the [[Style (sociolinguistics)|linguistic style]] used by the interviewer signals a context different from that expected by the husband. The interviewer, an African-American graduate student in educational psychology, has been sent to interview a woman at her home in a low-income neighborhood. The interviewer rings the door bell and the woman's husband opens the door.

:Husband: {{Not a typo|So y're gonna check out ma old lady, hah?}}
:Interviewer: Ah, no. I only came to get some information. They called from the office.

The husband addresses the interviewer in an informal style, marking their interaction as friendly. When the interviewer responds in a more formal style, the context becomes more formal. As a result, the interviewer reports that the interview was "stiff" (Gumperz 1982a: 133).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2569">The '''dead mother complex''' is a clinical condition described by [[André Green (psychoanalyst)|Andre Green]] involving an early and destructive identification with the figure of a 'dead' – or rather depressed and emotionally unavailable – mother.

==Complex/syndrome==
Green introduced the concept in an essay written in 1980, published in 1983, and translated into English in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Green, A. 'The dead mother', in ''On Private Madness'', London: Hogarth Press, 1986, pp. 142-173. Translated by Katherine Aubertin from 'La mère morte', ''Narcissisme de vie, narcissisme de mort'', Éditions de Minuit, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the dead mother complex as involving a mother who was initially emotionally engaged with her child, but who then "switched off" from emotional resonance to emotional detachment, perhaps under the influence of loss and mourning in her own family of origin.&lt;ref&gt;P. Mariotti, ''The Maternal Lineage'' (2012) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact on the child, when it finds itself unable to restore a feeling contact, is the internalisation of a hard unresponsive emotional core, which fosters a destructive form of [[narcissism]],&lt;ref&gt;J. White, ''Generation'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to [[attachment disorder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;P. Shaver, ''Attachment in Adulthood'' (2010) p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals itself as a major resistance to progress in the [[transference]].

Later, writers have argued for differentiating a range of responses within the dead mother complex, reserving the name dead mother syndrome for the most acute form.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bennett ed., ''Montreal 2010'' (2012) p. 1633&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
*The dead mother complex has been seen as underlying both [[Gradiva (novel)|Gradiva]] and Freud's own psychology as seen in ''[[Delusion and Dream in Jensen's Gradiva]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill ''Freud and the Passions'' (2010) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sylvia Plath]] in her writing has been linked to the dead mother complex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3721066/Dead_Mother_Effect_on_a_Daughter Dead Mother Effect on a Daughter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10669">'''Double-Blind FROG''' is a method for simultaneously measuring two unknown [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort laser pulses]].  Well established ultrafast measurement techniques like [[Frequency-resolved optical gating|Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG)]] and its simplified version [[GRENOUILLE]] can only measure one unknown ultrashort laser pulse at a time. Another version of FROG, called cross-correlation FROG (XFROG), also measures only one pulse, but it involves two pulses: a known reference pulse and the unknown pulse to be measured.

In modern optics experiments, ultrashort laser pulses have been used in a great variety of engineering application and scientific research, for example, biomedical engineering, material science, nonlinear spectroscopy, ultrafast chemistry, etc. Often, these experiments involve using two potentially different input laser pulses, for example, Raman spectroscopy, two-color pump-probe experiments, and non-degenerate four-wave mixing. In many situations, an output pulse is generated by a nonlinear optical process, such as harmonic generation, continuum generation, or optical parametric oscillation. In all such cases, measuring more than one pulse simultaneously is required to completely characterize the experiment and understand its results in order to eventually understand the underlying science of the process under study. Thus a measurement device capable of measuring two pulses simultaneously is highly desired.

== Blind Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (Blind FROG) and Double Blind FROG==

Early attempts to solve the two-pulse measurement problem were made by Trebino and Kane and co-workers beginning in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLong|first=Kenneth|author2=Rick Trebino |author3=William White |title=Simultaneous recovery of two ultrashort laser pulses from a single spectrogram|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B|year=1995|volume=12|issue=12|pages=2463|url=http://josab.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josab-12-12-2463|doi=10.1364/josab.12.002463|bibcode = 1995JOSAB..12.2463D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kane|first=Daniel|author2=G. Rodriguez |author3=A. J. Taylor |author4=Tracy Sharp Clement |title=Simultaneous measurement of two ultrashort laser pulses from a single spectrogram in a single shot|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B|year=1997|volume=14|issue=4|pages=935|url=http://josab.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josab-14-4-935 |doi=10.1364/josab.14.000935|bibcode = 1997JOSAB..14..935K }}&lt;/ref&gt; They took advantage of the fact that FROG and its variations involved crossing two replicas of the pulse to be measured in a nonlinear-optical medium (where one gated the other in time) and measuring the spectrum of the product of the two pulse electric fields vs. delay.  Thus, instead of using a known reference pulse as the gate, the second unknown pulse was used as the gate. The mathematical form of the measured trace is, &lt;math&gt;I(\omega ,\tau )=|\int e^{ -i\omega t }E_{ 1 }(t)|E_{ 2 }(t-\tau )|^{ 2 }dt|^{ 2 }&lt;/math&gt;. This particular experimental setup has come to be known as Blind FROG due to its mathematical equivalence to [[Blind deconvolution|Blind Deconvolution]].&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, retrieval of two pulses from the Blind FROG trace proved to be ill-posed; many different pulse pairs yield the same measured trace. Without extra information about the pulses, such as the spectra, non-trivial ambiguities are found by the Blind FROG retrieval algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seifert|first=Birger|author2=Heinrich Stolz |author3=Manfred Tasche |title=Nontrivial ambiguities for blind frequency-resolved optical gating and the problem of uniqueness|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B|year=2004|volume=21|issue=5|pages=1089|url=http://josab.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josab-21-5-1089|doi=10.1364/josab.21.001089|bibcode = 2004JOSAB..21.1089S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even with the spectra, algorithm convergence was found to be too slow.
&lt;br /&gt;
The attosecond-laser-pulse community, however, finds the Blind FROG approach useful due to the specific mathematical form used in the retrieval algorithm in this case.  On the other hand, for more common, longer pulses, improvements were required.
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Blind FROG setup.tif|thumb|Schematic for Blind FROG implemented in Polarization-Gate (PG) geometry. If Pulse #2 is equal to Pulse #1, this is the PG FROG beam geometry, and if Pulse #2 is known, this is the PG XFROG beam geometry.]]
In 2002, in his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trebino|first=Rick|title=Frequency-resolved optical gating : the measurement of ultrashort laser pulses|year=2000|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Boston|isbn=1-4020-7066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trebino proposed “Double Blind FROG” (DB FROG) to solve the two-pulse measurement problem. DB FROG is a slightly modified version of Blind FROG in which two FROG traces are measured. This second FROG trace contains the extra information required to retrieve both pulses essentially uniquely (with only trivial ambiguities, such as the zeroth-order phase and the first-order spectral phase, which corresponds to the pulses’ average arrival time).
&lt;br /&gt;
To understand DB FROG, it helps to consider a particular FROG beam geometry.  Here we consider the polarization-gate (PG) geometry.  The modification required to turn a Blind PG FROG into Double Blind PG FROG is the addition of a pair of crossed polarizers and a spectrometer. The main idea behind DB FROG is that, when one pulse gates the other, the other must also gate the one. In Blind FROG (see Blind FROG schematic), the gated pulse 2 is simply dumped after the nonlinear medium.  But in DB PG FROG (see Figure 2), it passes through a crossed polarizer and is spectrally resolved to generate a second FROG trace. In DB PG FROG, trace 1 is proportional to &lt;math&gt;|\int e^{ -i\omega t }E_{ 1 }(t)|E_{ 2 }(t-\tau )|^{ 2 }dt|^{ 2 }&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are the two light pulse electric fields. This expression is identical to that in PG XFROG. Trace 2 is proportional to &lt;math&gt;|\int e^{ -i\omega t }E_{ 2 }(t)|E_{ 1 }(t-\tau )|^{ 2 }dt|^{ 2 }&lt;/math&gt; where the roles of the two pulses are reversed. This term, of course, also has the form of a FROG trace produced by PG XFROG. The DB FROG retrieval algorithm uses information contained in both traces to retrieve both of the unknown pulses.
[[File:Double Blind FROG Schematic.tif|thumb|Schematic for Double Blind Polarization-Gate FROG]]

== Retrieval algorithm ==
A unique DB FROG retrieval algorithm, based on the XFROG algorithm, is used to retrieve the two unknown pulses by making use of the two recorded traces. The retrieval algorithm divides the whole retrieval problem into two XFROG problems. It starts with random initial guesses for both unknown pulses and takes one of the unknown two pulses, say, &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; as the unknown and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt; as the gate. Even though &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not the correct gate pulse to begin with, the algorithm treats it as if it is the correct one. The standard XFROG algorithm along with trace 1 is used to retrieve &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt;. The returned &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is not the correct one, but it is an improved version of it, since trace 1 contains information about &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt;. This improved version of &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is then used in the next step of the retrieval algorithm, which now reverses the roles of &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; as known and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt; as the unknown) and runs trace 2 with standard XFROG algorithm to produce a better version of &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This completes one cycle of the retrieval algorithm and improves both &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The retrieval algorithm then uses the improved results for &lt;math&gt;E_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to perform the next cycle. It continues alternating between traces 1 and 2 until the desired agreement between measured and retrieved traces occurs. It typically takes 3-5 cycles to converge depending on the complexity of the pulse pair. Also, complete convergence on early iterations is not necessary.

== Experimental and numerical results ==
Pulse pairs with Time Bandwidth Products (TBP) ranging from 1 to 6 and also different wavelengths have been measured and retrieved experimentally using DB PG FROG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Tsz Chun|author2=Justin Ratner |author3=Vikrant Chauhan |author4=Jacob Cohen |author5=Peter M. Vaughan |author6=Lina Xu |author7=Antonio Consoli |author8=Rick Trebino |title=Simultaneously measuring two ultrashort laser pulses on a single-shot using double-blind frequency-resolved optical gating|journal=J. Opt. Soc. Am. B|year=2012|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1237|url=http://josab.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josab-29-6-1237 |doi=10.1364/josab.29.001237|bibcode = 2012JOSAB..29.1237W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Tsz Chun|author2=Justin Ratner |author3=Rick Trebino |title=Simultaneous measurement of two different-color ultrashort pulses on a single shot|journal=J. Opt. Soc. Am. B|year=2012|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1889|url=http://josab.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josab-29-8-1889|doi=10.1364/josab.29.001889|bibcode = 2012JOSAB..29.1889W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements demonstrated that the DB FROG retrieval algorithm is capable of ignoring experimental noise and various inevitable non-physical details in the recorded traces and that it returns the correct retrieved pulse.
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to experimental work, numerical simulations have also shown that the DB FROG retrieval algorithm is extremely robust and reliable.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Depending on the gating geometry of the experimental setup, DB FROG inherits both advantages and disadvantages from the particular geometry. In the case of Polarization-Gate geometry, the advantage is the infinite phase-matching bandwidth which makes the system alignment insensitive. On the other hand, a disadvantage of PG geometry is the requirement of high-quality polarizers (calcite polarizers work fine) which could be expensive and introduce non-negligible distortion into the pulse. This distortion could be removed by numerically back propagating the pulse through the polarizer.  DB FROG is promising and, although not in widespread use, it is a subject of active current research.

In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''f-ratio''' is the fraction of total [[primary production]] fuelled by [[nitrate]] (as opposed to that fuelled by other [[nitrogen]] [[chemical compound|compounds]] such as [[ammonium]]). The ratio was originally defined by Richard Eppley and Bruce Peterson in one of the first [[Academic publishing#Academic paper|papers]] estimating global oceanic production.&lt;ref name=eppley&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/282677a0 | last1=Eppley | first1=R.W. |last2=Peterson |first2=B.J. | year=1979 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v282/n5740/abs/282677a0.html | title=Particulate organic matter flux and planktonic new production in the deep ocean | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=282 | pages=677–680 | issue=5740|bibcode = 1979Natur.282..677E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fraction was originally believed significant because it appeared to directly relate to the [[export production|sinking (export) flux]] of [[organic compound|organic]] [[marine snow]] from the [[photic zone|surface ocean]] by the [[biological pump]]. However, this interpretation relied on the assumption of a strong depth-partitioning of a parallel process, [[nitrification]], that more recent measurements has questioned.&lt;ref name="dore96"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.4319/lo.1996.41.8.1619 | last1=Dore |first1=J.E. | last2=Karl | first2=D.M. | year=1996 | title=Nitrification in the euphotic zone as a source for nitrite, nitrate, and nitrous oxide at Station ALOHA | journal=Limnol.

==Overview==
[[Gravity|Gravitational]] sinking of [[organism]]s (or the remains of organisms) transfers [[carbon]] from the surface waters of the ocean to its [[aphotic zone|deep interior]].  This process is known as the biological pump, and quantifying it is of interest to scientists because it is an important aspect of the [[Earth]]'s [[carbon cycle]].  Essentially, this is because carbon transported to the deep ocean is isolated from the atmosphere, allowing the ocean to act as a reservoir of carbon.  This biological mechanism is accompanied by a physico-chemical mechanism known as the [[solubility pump]] which also acts to transfer carbon to the ocean's deep interior.

Measuring the flux of sinking material (so-called marine snow) is usually done by deploying [[sediment trap]]s which intercept and store material as it sinks down the [[water column]].  However, this is a relatively difficult process, since traps can be awkward to deploy or recover, and they must be left ''in situ'' over a long period to integrate the sinking flux.  Furthermore, they are known to experience biases and to integrate horizontal as well as vertical fluxes because of water currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thomas | first1=S. | last2=Ridd | first2=P.V. | year=2004 | title=Review of methods to measure short time scale sediment accumulation | journal=Marine Geology | volume=207 | pages=95–114 | doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2004.03.011 | bibcode=2004MGeol.207...95T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Buesseler | first1=K.O. | author-link1=Ken Buesseler | year=2007 | title=An assessment of the use of sediment traps for estimating upper ocean particle fluxes | journal=J.

The f-ratio is one such proxy.

=="New" and "regenerated" production==
[[Image:F ratio diagram.gif|thumb|256px|right|Diagram of '''new''' and '''regenerated''' production]]

Bio-available nitrogen occurs in the ocean in several forms, including simple ionic forms such as nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitrite]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and more complex organic forms such as [[urea]] ((NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).  These forms are used by [[autotroph]]ic [[phytoplankton]] to synthesise organic molecules such as [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s).  [[Grazing]] of phytoplankton by [[plankton|zooplankton]] and larger organisms transfers this organic nitrogen up the [[food chain]] and throughout the marine [[food-web]].

When nitrogenous organic molecules are ultimately [[metabolism|metabolised]] by organisms, they are returned to the water column as ammonium (or more complex molecules that are then metabolised to ammonium).  This is known as ''regeneration'', since the ammonium can be used by phytoplankton, and again enter the food-web.  Primary production fuelled by ammonium in this way is thus referred to as '''regenerated production'''.&lt;ref name=dugdale&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.4319/lo.1967.12.2.0196 | last1=Dugdale | first1=R.C. | last2=Goering | first2=J.J. | year=1967 | url=http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_12/issue_2/0196.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720112630/http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_12/issue_2/0196.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2011-07-20 | title=Uptake of new and regenerated forms of nitrogen in primary productivity | journal=Limnol. Oceanogr. | volume=12 | pages=196–206 | issue=2 | bibcode=1967LimOc..12..196D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ammonium can also be [[oxidation|oxidised]] to nitrate (via nitrite), by the process of nitrification.  This is performed by different [[bacteria]] in two stages :

:::'''NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + 3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;
:::NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → '''NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;''' + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;

Crucially, this process is believed to only occur in the absence of [[light]] (or as some other [[function (mathematics)|function]] of depth).  In the ocean, this leads to a vertical separation of nitrification from [[primary production]], and confines it to the [[aphotic zone]].  This leads to the situation whereby any nitrate in the water column must be from the aphotic zone, and must have originated from organic material transported there by sinking.  Primary production fuelled by nitrate is, therefore, making use of a "fresh" nutrient source rather than a regenerated one.  Production by nitrate is thus referred to as '''new production'''.&lt;ref name=dugdale/&gt;

The figure at the head of this section illustrates this.  Nitrate and ammonium are taken up by primary producers, processed through the food-web, and then regenerated as ammonium.  Some of this return flux is released into the surface ocean (where it is available again for uptake), while some is returned at depth.  The ammonium returned at depth is nitrified to nitrate, and ultimately [[turbulence|mixed]] or [[upwelling|upwelled]] into the surface ocean to repeat the cycle.

Consequently, the significance of new production lies in its connection to sinking material.  At [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], the export flux of organic material sinking into the aphotic zone is balanced by the upward flux of nitrate.  By measuring how much nitrate is consumed by primary production, relative to that of regenerated ammonium, one should be able to estimate the export flux indirectly.

As an aside, the f-ratio can also reveal important aspects of local ecosystem function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Allen | first=A.E. |author2=Howard-Jones, M.H. |author3=Booth, M.G. |author4=Frischer, M.E. |author5=Verity, P.G. |author6=Bronk, D.A. |author7=Sanderson, M.P. | year=2002 | doi=10.1016/s0924-7963(02)00171-9 | title=Importance of heterotrophic bacterial assimilation of ammonium and nitrate in the Barents Sea during summer | journal=Journal of Marine Systems | volume=38 | pages=93–108 |bibcode = 2002JMS....38...93A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High f-ratio values are typically associated with productive ecosystems dominated by large, [[eukaryotic]] phytoplankton (such as [[diatom]]s) that are grazed by large zooplankton (and, in turn, by larger organisms such as fish).  By contrast, low f-ratio values are generally associated with low biomass, [[oligotroph]]ic food webs consisting of small, [[prokaryotic]] phytoplankton (such as ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'') which are kept in check by microzooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1029/1999GB001229 | last=Laws | first=E.A. |author2=Falkowski, P.G. |author3=Smith, W.O. |author4=Ducklow, H. |author5=McCarthy, J.J. | year=2000 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2000/1999GB001229.shtml | title=Temperature effects on export production in the open ocean | journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume=14 | pages=1231–1246 | bibcode=2000GBioC..14.1231L | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dunne&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dunne | first=J.P. |author2=Armstrong, R.A. |author3=Gnanadesikan, A. |author4=Sarmiento, J.L.  | year=2005 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2004GB002390.shtml | title=Empirical and mechanistic models for the particle export ratio | journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume=19 | pages=GB4026 | doi=10.1029/2005GB002390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
[[Image:F ratio diagram 2.gif|thumb|256px|right|Is nitrification really confined to the aphotic zone?]]

A fundamental assumption in this interpretation of the f-ratio is the spatial separation of primary production and nitrification.  Indeed, in their original paper, Eppley &amp; Peterson noted that: "To relate new production to export requires that nitrification in the euphotic zone be negligible".&lt;ref name=eppley/&gt;  However, subsequent observational work on the distribution of nitrification has found that nitrification can occur at shallower depths, and even within the photic zone.&lt;ref name="dore96" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1029/1998JC900004 | last=Raimbault | first=P. |author2=Slawyk, G. |author3=Boudjellal, B. |author4=Coatanoan, C. |author5=Conan, P. |author6=Coste, B. |author7=Garcia, N. |author8=Moutin, T. |author9=Pujo-Pay, M. | year=1999 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1999/1998JC900004.shtml | title=Carbon and nitrogen uptake and export in the equatorial Pacific at 150°W: Evidence of an efficient regenerated production cycle | journal=J.

Res. | volume=104 | pages=3341–3356 | bibcode=1999JGR...104.3341R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3354/meps197051 | last1=Diaz | first1=F. | last2=Raimbault | first2=P. | year=2000 | url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v197/p51-65/ | title=Nitrogen regeneration and dissolved organic nitrogen release during spring in a NW Mediterranean coastal zone (Gulf of Lions): implications for the estimation of new production | journal=Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. | volume=197 | pages=51–65 | bibcode=2000MEPS..197...51D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the adjacent diagram shows, if ammonium is indeed nitrified to nitrate in the ocean's surface waters it essentially "[[short circuit]]s" the deep pathway of nitrate.  In practice, this would lead to an overestimation of new production and a higher f-ratio, since some of the ostensibly new production would actually be fuelled by recently nitrified nitrate that had never left the surface ocean.  After including nitrification measurements in its parameterisation, an [[ecosystem model]] of the [[oligotroph]]ic [[subtropical gyre]] region (specifically the [[Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study|BATS]] site) found that, on an annual basis, around 40% of surface nitrate was recently nitrified (rising to almost 90% during summer).&lt;ref name=martin06&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Martin | first1=A.P. | last2=Pondaven | first2=P. | year=2006 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005GB002608.shtml | title=New primary production and nitrification in the western subtropical North Atlantic: a modelling study | journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume=20 | doi=10.1029/2005GB002608 | bibcode=2006GBioC..20.4014M | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study synthesising geographically diverse nitrification measurements found high variability but no relationship with depth, and applied this in a global-scale model to estimate that up to a half of surface nitrate is supplied by surface nitrification rather than upwelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yool | first1=A. | last2=Martin | first2=A.P. | last3=Fernández | first3=C. | last4=Clark | first4=D.R. | year=2007 | title=The significance of nitrification for oceanic new production | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=447 | pages=999–1002 | doi=10.1038/nature05885 | issue=7147|bibcode = 2007Natur.447..999Y | pmid=17581584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although measurements of the rate of nitrification are still relatively rare, they do suggest that the f-ratio is not as straightforward a proxy for the biological pump as was once thought.  For this reason, some workers have proposed distinguishing between the f-ratio and the ratio of particulate export to primary production, which they term the '''pe-ratio'''.&lt;ref name=dunne/&gt;  While quantitatively different than the f-ratio, the pe-ratio shows similar qualitative variation between high productivity/high biomass/high export regimes and low productivity/low biomass/low export regimes.

In addition, a further process that potentially complicates the use of the f-ratio to estimate "new" and "regenerated" production is [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium]] (DNRA). In low oxygen environments, such as [[oxygen minimum zone]]s and seafloor sediments, [[Chemoorganoheterotrophy|chemoorganoheterotrophic]] microbes use nitrate as an [[electron acceptor]] for [[cellular respiration|respiration]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft, B. Strous, M. and Tegetmeyer, H. E.|first=|year=2011|title=Microbial nitrate respiration – Genes, enzymes and environmental distribution|url=|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|volume=155|pages=104–117|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.12.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing it to nitrite, then to ammonium. Since, like nitrification, DNRA alters the balance in the availability of nitrate and ammonium, it has the potential to introduce inaccuracy to the calculated f-ratio. However, as DNRA's occurrence is limited to anaerobic situations,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam, Phyllis and Kuypers, Marcel M.

In mathematics a '''Fermat number''', named after [[Pierre de Fermat]] who first studied them, is a [[natural number|positive integer]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;F_{n} = 2^{2^n} + 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is a [[nonnegative]] integer. The first few Fermat numbers are:
: [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[17 (number)|17]], [[257 (number)|257]], [[65537 (number)|65537]], 4294967297, 18446744073709551617, … {{OEIS|id=A000215}}.

If 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is [[prime number|prime]], and ''k'' &gt; 0, it can be shown that ''k'' must be a power of two. (If ''k'' = ''ab'' where 1 ≤ ''a'', ''b'' ≤ ''k'' and ''b'' is odd, then 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = (2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 ≡ (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0 ('''mod''' 2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1). See [[#Other theorems about Fermat numbers|below]] for a complete proof.) In other words, every prime of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 (other than 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 1) is a Fermat number, and such primes are called '''Fermat primes'''. As of 2018, the only known Fermat primes are ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{OEIS|id=A019434}}.

==Basic properties==
The Fermat numbers satisfy the following [[recurrence relation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{n} = (F_{n-1}-1)^{2}+1&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' ≥ 1,

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{n} = F_{n-1} + 2^{2^{n-1}}F_{0} \cdots F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{n} = F_{n-1}^2 - 2(F_{n-2}-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{n} = F_{0} \cdots F_{n-1} + 2&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' ≥ 2. Each of these relations can be proved by [[mathematical induction]]. From the last equation, we can deduce '''Goldbach's theorem''' (named after [[Christian Goldbach]]): no two Fermat numbers [[coprime|share a common integer factor greater than 1]]. To see this, suppose that 0 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; have a common factor ''a'' &gt; 1. Then ''a'' divides both

:&lt;math&gt;F_{0} \cdots F_{j-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;; hence ''a'' divides their difference, 2. Since ''a'' &gt; 1, this forces ''a'' = 2. This is a [[contradiction]], because each Fermat number is clearly odd. As a [[corollary]], we obtain another proof of the [[infinity|infinitude]] of the prime numbers: for each ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, choose a prime factor ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; then the sequence {''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is an infinite sequence of distinct primes.

Further properties:

*No Fermat prime can be expressed as the difference of two ''p''th powers, where ''p'' is an odd prime.
*With the exception of F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the last digit of a Fermat number is 7.
* The [[sums of reciprocals|sum of the reciprocals]] of all the Fermat numbers {{OEIS|id=A051158}} is [[irrational number|irrational]]. ([[Solomon W. Golomb]], 1963)

==Primality of Fermat numbers==
Fermat numbers and Fermat primes were first studied by Pierre de Fermat, who [[conjecture]]d (but admitted he could not prove) that all Fermat numbers are prime. Indeed, the first five Fermat numbers ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are easily shown to be prime. However, the conjecture was refuted by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1732 when he showed that

:&lt;math&gt; F_{5} = 2^{2^5} + 1 = 2^{32} + 1 = 4294967297 = 641 \times 6700417. &lt;/math&gt;

Euler proved that every factor of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; must have the form ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 (later improved to ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 by [[Édouard Lucas|Lucas]]).

The fact that 641 is a factor of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can be easily deduced from the equalities 641&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;×5+1 and 641&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. It follows from the first equality that 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;×5&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;−1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;641) and therefore (raising to the fourth power) that 2&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;×5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;641). On the other hand, the second equality implies that 5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;−2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;641). These [[Modular arithmetic|congruences]] imply that −2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;641).

Fermat was probably aware of the form of the factors later proved by Euler, so it seems curious why he failed to follow through on the straightforward calculation to find the factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Křížek|Luca|Somer|2001|p=38, Remark 4.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common explanation is that Fermat made a computational mistake.

There are no other known Fermat primes ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''n'' &gt; 4. However, little is known about Fermat numbers with large ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/links/theory/special_forms/ "Prime Links++: special forms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224224552/http://primes.utm.edu/links/theory/special_forms/ |date=2013-12-24 }} at The [[Prime Pages]].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, each of the following is an open problem:
*Is ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[composite number|composite]] [[for all]] ''n'' &gt; 4?
*Are there infinitely many Fermat primes? ([[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] 1844)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ribenboim|1996|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Are there infinitely many composite Fermat numbers?
*Does a Fermat number exist that is not [[square-free number|square-free]]?

{{As of|2014}}, it is known that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is composite for {{nowrap|5 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 32}}, although amongst these, complete factorizations of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are known only for {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 11}}, and there are no known prime factors for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 20}} and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 24}}.&lt;ref name="Keller"/&gt; The largest Fermat number known to be composite is ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3329780&lt;/sub&gt;, and its prime factor {{nowrap|193 × 2&lt;sup&gt;3329782&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}, a [[megaprime]], was discovered by the [[PrimeGrid]] collaboration in July 2014.&lt;ref name="Keller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrimeGrid’s Mega Prime Search - 193*2^3329782+1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PrimeGrid’s Mega Prime Search – 193*2^3329782+1 (official announcement)|url=http://www.primegrid.com/download/mega-3329782.pdf|publisher=PrimeGrid|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heuristic arguments for density===

There are several probabilistic arguments for estimating the number of Fermat primes. However these arguments give quite different estimates, depending on how much information about Fermat numbers one uses, and some predict no further Fermat primes while others predict infinitely many Fermat primes.

The following [[heuristic argument]] suggests there are only finitely many Fermat primes: according to the [[prime number theorem]], the "[[probability]]" that a number ''n'' is prime is about 1/ln(''n''). Therefore, the total [[expected value|expected number]] of Fermat primes is at most

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln F_{n}} &amp;= \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)}\\ 
&amp;&lt; \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n} \\ 
&amp;= \frac{2}{\ln 2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This argument is not a rigorous [[mathematical proof|proof]]. For one thing, the argument assumes that Fermat numbers behave "[[randomness|randomly]]", yet we have already seen that the factors of Fermat numbers have special properties.

If (more sophisticatedly) we regard the ''conditional'' probability that ''n'' is prime, given that we know all its prime factors exceed ''B'', as at most ''A'' ln(''B'') / ln(''n''), then using Euler's theorem that the least prime factor of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, we would find instead

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\ln 2^{n+1}}{\ln F_{n}} &amp;= A \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\log_2 2^{n+1}}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)} \\ 
&amp;&lt; A \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+1) 2^{-n} \\ 
&amp;= 4A.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Although such arguments engender the belief that there are only finitely many Fermat primes, one can also produce arguments for the opposite conclusion. Suppose we regard the conditional probability that ''n'' is prime, given that we know all its prime factors are 1 modulo ''M'', as at least ''CM''/ln(''n''). Then using Euler's result that ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; we would find that the expected total number of Fermat primes was at least

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{2^{n+1}}{\ln F_{n}} &amp;= \frac{C}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{2^{n+1}}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)} \\ 
&amp;&gt; \frac{C}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 1 \\ 
&amp;= \infty,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and indeed this argument predicts that an asymptotically ''constant fraction'' of Fermat numbers are prime.

===Equivalent conditions of primality===
{{main article|Pépin's test}}

Let &lt;math&gt;F_n=2^{2^n}+1&lt;/math&gt; be the ''n''th Fermat number. Pépin's test states that for ''n'' &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is prime if and only if &lt;math&gt;3^{(F_n-1)/2}\equiv-1\pmod{F_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;3^{(F_n-1)/2}&lt;/math&gt; can be evaluated modulo &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; by [[exponentiation by squaring|repeated squaring]]. This makes the test a fast [[polynomial-time]] algorithm. However, Fermat numbers grow so rapidly that only a handful of Fermat numbers can be tested in a reasonable amount of time and space.

There are some tests that can be used to test numbers of the form ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, such as factors of Fermat numbers, for primality.

:'''[[Proth's theorem]]''' (1878). Let ''N'' = ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 with odd ''k'' &lt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. If there is an integer ''a'' such that
:: &lt;math&gt;a^{(N-1)/2} \equiv -1\pmod{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:then ''N'' is prime. Conversely, if the above congruence does not hold, and in addition
:: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{N}\right)=-1&lt;/math&gt; (See [[Jacobi symbol]])
:then ''N'' is composite. 

If ''N'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 3, then the above Jacobi symbol is always equal to −1 for ''a'' = 3, and this special case of Proth's theorem is known as [[Pépin's test]]. Although Pépin's test and Proth's theorem have been implemented on computers to prove the compositeness of some Fermat numbers, neither test gives a specific nontrivial factor. In fact, no specific prime factors are known for ''n'' = 20 and 24.

==Factorization of Fermat numbers==
Because of the size of Fermat numbers, it is difficult to factorize or even to check primality. [[Pépin's test]] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for primality of Fermat numbers, and can be implemented by modern computers. The [[elliptic curve method]] is a fast method for finding small prime divisors of numbers. Distributed computing project ''Fermatsearch'' has successfully found some factors of Fermat numbers. Yves Gallot's proth.exe has been used to find factors of large Fermat numbers. [[Édouard Lucas]], improving the above-mentioned result by Euler, proved in 1878 that every factor of Fermat number &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt;, with ''n'' at least 2, is of the form &lt;math&gt;k\times2^{n+2}+1&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Proth number]]), where ''k'' is a positive integer. By itself, this makes it easy to prove the primality of the known Fermat primes.

Factorizations of the first twelve Fermat numbers are:

==Pseudoprimes and Fermat numbers==
Like [[composite number]]s of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1, every composite Fermat number is a [[strong pseudoprime]] to base 2. This is because all strong pseudoprimes to base 2 are also [[Fermat pseudoprime]]s - i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;2^{F_n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{F_n}&lt;/math&gt;

for all Fermat numbers.

In 1904, Cipolla showed that the product of at least two distinct prime or composite Fermat numbers &lt;math&gt;F_{a}F_{b}\dots F_{s}, a&gt;b&gt;\dots&gt;s&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; will be a Fermat pseudoprime to base 2 if and only if &lt;math&gt;2^s &gt; a &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgfSBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;ots=On_KUoiNZp&amp;dq=cipolla+fermat+1904&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=17 Lectures on Fermat Numbers: From Number Theory to Geometry|first1=Michal|last1=Krizek|first2=Florian|last2=Luca|first3=Lawrence|last3=Somer|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{math proof|If &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer but not a power of 2, it must have an odd prime factor &lt;math&gt;s &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt;, and we may write &lt;math&gt;k= rs&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1 \le r &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;.

By the preceding lemma, for positive integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(a-b) \mid (a^m-b^m)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mid &lt;/math&gt; means "evenly divides". Substituting &lt;math&gt;a = 2^r, b = -1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;m = s&lt;/math&gt; and using that &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is odd,

:&lt;math&gt; (2^r+1) \mid (2^{rs}+1), &lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt; (2^r+1) \mid (2^k+1). &lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; 2^r+1 &lt; 2^k+1&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;2^k+1&lt;/math&gt; is not prime. Therefore, by contraposition &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must be a power of 2.

{{math theorem| A Fermat prime cannot be a [[Wieferich prime]].
{{math proof| We show if &lt;math&gt;p=2^m+1&lt;/math&gt; is a Fermat prime (and hence by the above, ''m'' is a power of 2), then the congruence &lt;math&gt;2^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod {p^2}&lt;/math&gt; does not hold.

Since &lt;math&gt;2m |p-1&lt;/math&gt; we may write &lt;math&gt;p-1=2m\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. If the given congruence holds, then &lt;math&gt;p^2|2^{2m\lambda}-1&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;0 \equiv \frac{2^{2m\lambda}-1}{2^m+1}=(2^m-1)\left(1+2^{2m}+2^{4m}+\cdots +2^{2(\lambda-1)m} \right) \equiv -2\lambda \pmod {2^m+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;2^m+1|2\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;2\lambda \geq 2^m+1&lt;/math&gt;. This leads to &lt;math&gt;p-1 \geq m(2^m+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is impossible since &lt;math&gt;m \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;.

{{math theorem|note=[[Édouard Lucas]]| Any prime divisor ''p'' of &lt;math&gt;F_n = 2^{2^n}+1&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;k2^{n+2}+1&lt;/math&gt; whenever ''n'' &gt; 1.
{{math proof|title=''Sketch of proof''|Let ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the group of non-zero elements of the integers modulo ''p'' under multiplication, which has order ''p-1''. Notice that 2 (strictly speaking, its image modulo ''p'') has multiplicative order dividing &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (since &lt;math&gt; 2^{2^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the square of &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; which is −1 modulo ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), so that, by [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], ''p'' − 1 is divisible by &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1} &lt;/math&gt; and ''p'' has the form &lt;math&gt;k2^{n+1}+1&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''k'', as [[Euler]] knew. Édouard Lucas went further. Since ''n'' &gt; 1, the prime ''p'' above is congruent to 1 modulo 8. Hence (as was known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]), 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] modulo ''p'', that is, there is integer ''a'' such that &lt;math&gt;p|a^2-2.&lt;/math&gt; Then the image of ''a'' has order &lt;math&gt;2^{n+2}&lt;/math&gt; in the group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and (using Lagrange's theorem again), ''p'' − 1 is divisible by &lt;math&gt;2^{n+2}&lt;/math&gt; and ''p'' has the form &lt;math&gt;s2^{n+2}+1&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''s''.

In fact, it can be seen directly that 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ''p'', since

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1 +2^{2^{n-1}} \right)^{2} \equiv  2^{1+2^{n-1}} \pmod p.&lt;/math&gt; 

Since an odd power of 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ''p'', so is 2 itself.

==Relationship to constructible polygons==
[[File:constructible_polygoon_set.svg|thumb|300px|Number of sides of known constructible polygons having up to 1000 sides (bold) or odd side count (red)]]
{{main article|Constructible polygon}}
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] developed the theory of [[Gaussian period]]s in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' and formulated a [[sufficient condition]] for the constructibility of regular polygons. Gauss stated without proof that this condition was also [[necessary condition|necessary]], but never published his proof.  A full proof of necessity was given by [[Pierre Wantzel]] in 1837. The result is known as the '''Gauss–Wantzel theorem''':

: An ''n''-sided regular polygon can be constructed with [[compass and straightedge]] if and only if ''n'' is the product of a power of 2 and distinct Fermat primes: in other words, if and only if ''n'' is of the form ''n'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;…''p''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''k'' is a nonnegative integer and the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct Fermat primes.

A positive integer ''n'' is of the above form if and only if its [[Euler's totient function|totient]] φ(''n'') is a power of 2.

==Applications of Fermat numbers==
===Pseudorandom Number Generation===
Fermat primes are particularly useful in generating pseudo-random sequences of numbers in the range 1 … ''N'', where ''N'' is a power of 2. The most common method used is to take any seed value between 1 and ''P''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, where ''P'' is a Fermat prime. Now multiply this by a number ''A'', which is greater than the square root of ''P'' and is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] modulo ''P'' (i.e., it is not a [[quadratic residue]]). Then take the result modulo ''P''. The result is the new value for the RNG.
: &lt;math&gt;V_{j+1} = \left( A \times V_j \right) \bmod P&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Linear congruential generator]], [[RANDU]])
This is useful in computer science since most data structures have members with 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; possible values. For example, a byte has 256 (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) possible values (0–255). Therefore, to fill a byte or bytes with random values a random number generator which produces values 1–256 can be used, the byte taking the output value −&amp;nbsp;1. Very large Fermat primes are of particular interest in data encryption for this reason. This method produces only [[pseudorandom]] values as, after ''P''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 repetitions, the sequence repeats. A poorly chosen multiplier can result in the sequence repeating sooner than ''P''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

==Other interesting facts==
A Fermat number cannot be a perfect number or part of a pair of [[amicable numbers]]. {{harv|Luca|2000}}

The series of reciprocals of all prime divisors of Fermat numbers is [[Convergent series|convergent]]. {{harv|Křížek|Luca|Somer|2002}}

If ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is prime, there exists an integer ''m'' such that ''n'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The equation
''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;(2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;+''m'')&lt;/sub&gt;
holds in that case.&lt;ref&gt;Jeppe Stig Nielsen, [http://jeppesn.dk/nton.html "S(n) = n^n + 1"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=SierpinskiNumberoftheFirstKind|title=Sierpiński Number of the First Kind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let the largest prime factor of Fermat number ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be ''P''(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Then,
:&lt;math&gt;P(F_n)\ge 2^{n+2}(4n+9)+1.&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Grytczuk|Luca|Wójtowicz|2001}}

==Generalized Fermat numbers==
Numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;a^{2^{ \overset{n} {}}} + b^{2^{ \overset{n} {}}}&lt;/math&gt; with ''a'', ''b'' any [[coprime]] integers, ''a'' &gt; ''b'' &gt; 0, are called '''generalized Fermat numbers'''. An odd prime ''p'' is a generalized Fermat number if and only if ''p'' is congruent to [[Pythagorean prime|1 (mod 4)]]. (Here we consider only the case ''n'' &gt; 0, so 3 = &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{0}}+1&lt;/math&gt; is not a counterexample.)

An example of a [[probable prime]] of this form is 124&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt; + 57&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt; (found by Serge Batalov).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=x%5E65536%2By%5E65536&amp;action=Search PRP Top Records, search for x^65536+y^65536], by  Henri &amp;amp; Renaud Lifchitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

By analogy with the ordinary Fermat numbers, it is common to write generalized Fermat numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;a^{2^{ \overset{n} {}}} + 1&lt;/math&gt; as ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''a''). In this notation, for instance, the number 100,000,001 would be written as ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(10). In the following we shall restrict ourselves to primes of this form, &lt;math&gt;a^{2^{ \overset{n} {}}} + 1&lt;/math&gt;, such primes are called "Fermat primes base ''a''". Of course, these primes exist only if ''a'' is even.

If we require ''n'' &gt; 0, then [[Landau's problems|Landau's fourth problem]] asks if there are infinitely many generalized Fermat primes ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''a'').

===Generalized Fermat primes===
Because of the ease of proving their primality, generalized Fermat primes have become in recent years a topic for research within the field of number theory. Many of the largest known primes today are generalized Fermat primes.

Generalized Fermat numbers can be prime only for [[Even and odd numbers|even]] {{mvar|a}}, because if {{mvar|a}} is odd then every generalized Fermat number will be divisible by 2.  The smallest prime number &lt;math&gt;F_n(a)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;F_5(30)&lt;/math&gt;, or 30&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;+1. Besides, we can define "half generalized Fermat numbers" for an odd base, a half generalized Fermat number to base ''a'' (for odd ''a'') is &lt;math&gt;\frac{a^{2^n}+1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and it is also to be expected that there will be only finitely many half generalized Fermat primes for each odd base.

(In the list, the generalized Fermat numbers (&lt;math&gt;F_n(a)&lt;/math&gt;) to an even {{mvar|a}} are &lt;math&gt;a^{2^n}+1&lt;/math&gt;, for odd {{mvar|a}}, they are &lt;math&gt;\frac{a^{2^n}+1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. If {{mvar|a}} is a perfect power with an odd exponent {{OEIS|id=A070265}}, then all generalized Fermat number can be algebraic factored, so they cannot be prime)

(For the smallest number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F_n(a)&lt;/math&gt; is prime, see {{oeis|id=A253242}})

'''Focused ion beam''', also known as '''FIB''', is a technique used particularly in the [[semiconductor]] industry, [[materials science]] and increasingly in the biological field for site-specific analysis, deposition, and [[ablation|ablation of materials]]. A FIB setup is a scientific instrument that resembles a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM). However, while the SEM uses a focused [[Electron beam|beam of electrons]] to image the sample in the chamber, a FIB setup uses a focused beam of [[ion]]s instead. FIB can also be incorporated in a system with both electron and ion beam columns, allowing the same feature to be investigated using either of the beams. FIB should not be confused with using a beam of [[Ion beam|focused ions]] for direct write [[lithography]] (such as in [[proton beam writing]]). These are generally quite different systems where the material is modified by other mechanisms.

==Ion beam source==
Most widespread instruments are using [[liquid metal ion source]]s (LMIS), especially [[gallium]] ion sources. Ion sources based on elemental gold and iridium are also available. In a gallium LMIS, gallium metal is placed in contact with a [[tungsten]] needle, and heated gallium [[wetting|wets]] the tungsten and flows to the tip of the needle, where the opposing forces of surface tension and electric field form the gallium into a cusp shaped tip called a [[Taylor cone]]. The tip radius of this cone is extremely small (~2&amp;nbsp;nm). The huge [[electric field]] at this small tip (greater than 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; volts per centimeter) causes ionization and [[Field electron emission|field emission]] of the gallium atoms.

Source ions are then generally accelerated to an energy of 1–50 keV ([[electronvolt|kiloelectronvolts]]), and focused onto the sample by [[electrostatic lens]]es. LMIS produce high current density ion beams with very small energy spread. A modern FIB can deliver tens of nanoamperes of current to a sample, or can image the sample with a spot size on the order of a few nanometers.

More recently, instruments using plasma beams of noble gas ions, such as Xenon, have become available more widely. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-01|title=Large volume serial section tomography by Xe Plasma FIB dual beam microscopy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399115300644|journal=Ultramicroscopy|language=en|volume=161|pages=119–129|doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.11.001|issn=0304-3991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
[[File:Principe FIB.jpg|thumb|alt=block diagram|right|upright=1.65|The principle of FIB]] Focused ion beam (FIB) systems have been produced commercially for approximately twenty years, primarily for large semiconductor manufacturers. FIB systems operate in a similar fashion to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) except, rather than a beam of electrons and as the name implies, FIB systems use a finely focused beam of ions (usually gallium) that can be operated at low beam currents for imaging or at high beam currents for site specific [[sputtering]] or milling.

As the diagram on the right shows, the gallium (Ga+) primary ion beam hits the sample surface and sputters a small amount of material, which leaves the surface as either secondary ions (i+ or i-) or neutral atoms (n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;). The primary beam also produces secondary electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). As the primary beam rasters on the sample surface, the signal from the sputtered ions or secondary electrons is collected to form an image.

At low primary beam currents, very little material is sputtered and modern FIB systems can easily achieve 5&amp;nbsp;nm imaging resolution (imaging resolution with Ga ions is limited to ~5&amp;nbsp;nm by sputtering &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.588663|title=Fundamental limits to imaging resolution for focused ion beams|year=1996|last1=Orloff|first1=Jon|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=14|issue=6|pages=3759|bibcode = 1996JVSTB..14.3759O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.3013306|title=Sputtering limits versus signal-to-noise limits in the observation of Sn balls in a Ga[sup +] microscope|year=2008|last1=Castaldo|first1=V.|last2=Hagen|first2=C.

At higher primary currents, a great deal of material can be removed by sputtering, allowing precision milling of the specimen down to a sub micrometer or even a nano scale.

If the sample is non-conductive, a low energy electron flood gun can be used to provide charge neutralization. In this manner, by imaging with positive secondary ions using the positive primary ion beam, even highly insulating samples may be imaged and milled without a conducting surface coating, as would be required in an SEM.

Until recently, the overwhelming usage of FIB has been in the semiconductor industry. Such applications as defect analysis, circuit modification, [[photomask]] repair and transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample preparation of site specific locations on integrated circuits have become commonplace procedures. The latest FIB systems have high resolution imaging capability; this capability coupled with in situ sectioning has eliminated the need, in many cases, to examine FIB sectioned specimens in a separate SEM instrument.&lt;ref name=Fibics&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fibics.com/fib/tutorials/introduction-focused-ion-beam-systems/4/|title = Introduction : Focused Ion Beam Systems|accessdate = 2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEM imaging is still required for the highest resolution imaging and to prevent damage to sensitive samples. However, the combination of SEM and FIB columns onto the same chamber enables the benefits of both to be utilized.

==Usage==
Unlike an electron microscope, FIB is inherently destructive to the specimen. When the high-energy gallium ions strike the sample, they will [[sputter]] atoms from the surface. Gallium atoms will also be [[Ion implantation|implanted]] into the top few nanometers of the surface, and the surface will be made [[amorphous]].

Because of the sputtering capability, the FIB is used as a micro- and nano-machining tool, to modify or machine materials at the micro- and nanoscale. FIB micro machining has become a broad field of its own, but nano machining with FIB is a field that is still developing. Commonly the smallest beam size for imaging is 2.5–6&amp;nbsp;nm. The smallest milled features are somewhat larger (10–15&amp;nbsp;nm) as this is dependent on the total beam size and interactions with the sample being milled.

FIB tools are designed to etch or machine surfaces, an ideal FIB might machine away one atom layer without any disruption of the atoms in the next layer, or any residual disruptions above the surface. Yet currently because of the sputter the machining typically roughens surfaces at the sub-micrometer length scales.&lt;ref name=fib&gt;{{cite book| title = High Resolution Focused Ion Beams: FIB and Its Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGlJG-lcBLsC&amp;printsec=frontcover|author1=J.

A FIB can also be used to deposit material via [[ion beam induced deposition]]. FIB-assisted [[chemical vapor deposition]] occurs when a gas, such as [[tungsten hexacarbonyl]] (W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is introduced to the vacuum chamber and allowed to [[Chemisorption|chemisorb]] onto the sample. By scanning an area with the beam, the precursor gas will be decomposed into volatile and non-volatile components; the non-volatile component, such as tungsten, remains on the surface as a deposition. This is useful, as the deposited metal can be used as a sacrificial layer, to protect the underlying sample from the destructive sputtering of the beam. From nanometers to hundred of micrometers in length, tungsten metal deposition allows metal lines to be put right where needed. Other materials such as [[platinum]], cobalt, carbon, gold, etc., can also be locally deposited.&lt;ref name=fib/&gt;&lt;ref name=fib2/&gt; Gas assisted deposition and FIB etching process are shown below.&lt;ref name="ion beam implantation"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Creation of nanoelectronic devices by focused ion beam implantation |author1=Koch, J. |author2=Grun, K. |author3=Ruff, M. |author4=Wernhardt, R. |author5=Wieck, A.D. |year=1999 |doi=10.1109/IECON.1999.822165 |book-title=IECON '99 Proceedings.

FIB is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to patch or modify an existing [[semiconductor device]]. For example, in an [[integrated circuit]], the gallium beam could be used to cut unwanted electrical connections, and/or to deposit conductive material in order to make a connection. The high level of surface interaction is exploited in patterned doping of semiconductors. FIB is also used for maskless implantation.

The FIB is also commonly used to prepare samples for the [[transmission electron microscope]]. The TEM requires very thin samples, typically ~100 nanometers or less. Other techniques, such as [[ion mill]]ing or [[electropolishing]] can be used to prepare such thin samples. However, the nanometer-scale resolution of the FIB allows the exact region of interest to be chosen, such as perhaps a grain boundary or defect in a material. This is vital, for example, in integrated circuit failure analysis. If a particular transistor out of several million on a chip is bad, the only tool capable of preparing an electron microscope sample of that single transistor is the FIB.&lt;ref name=fib/&gt;&lt;ref name=fib2/&gt; 
The same protocol used for preparing samples to transmission electron microscopy can also be used to select a micro area of a sample, extract it and prepare it for analysis using a [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertazzo|first1=Sergio|last2=Maidment|first2=Susannah C. R.|last3=Kallepitis|first3=Charalambos|last4=Fearn|first4=Sarah|last5=Stevens|first5=Molly M.|last6=Xie|first6=Hai-nan|title=Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million–year-old dinosaur specimens|journal=Nature Communications|date=9 June 2015|volume=6|pages=7352|doi=10.1038/ncomms8352|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E7352B|pmid=26056764|pmc=4468865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawbacks to FIB sample preparation are the above-mentioned surface damage and implantation, which produce noticeable effects when using techniques such as high-resolution "lattice imaging" TEM or electron energy loss spectroscopy. This damaged layer can be minimized by FIB milling with lower beam voltages, or by further milling with a low-voltage argon ion beam after completion of the FIB process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1017/S1431927605502460|title = A Three Beam Approach to TEM Preparation Using In-situ Low Voltage Argon Ion Final Milling in a FIB-SEM Instrument|year=2005|author=Principe, E L|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis| volume=11| last2=Gnauck| first2=P| last3=Hoffrogge| first3=P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIB preparation can be used with cryogenically frozen samples in a suitably equipped instrument, allowing cross sectional analysis of samples containing liquids or fats, such as biological samples, pharmaceuticals, foams, inks, and food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fei.com/uploadedFiles/Documents/Content/2006_06_CryoSDB_SoftImaging_AppNote_mb.pdf|title = Unique Imaging of Soft Materials Using Cryo-SDB| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIB is also used for [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS). The ejected secondary ions are collected and analyzed after the surface of the specimen has been sputtered with a primary focused ion beam.

==FIB imaging==
At lower beam currents, FIB imaging resolution begins to rival the more familiar scanning electron microscope (SEM) in terms of imaging topography, however the FIB's two imaging modes, using '''secondary electrons''' and '''secondary ions''', both produced by the primary ion beam, offer many advantages over SEM. [[File:Sergio Bertazzo - CLIM.jpg|thumbnail|Correlative Light-Ion Microscopy of cells on glass.

FIB secondary electron images show intense grain orientation contrast. As a result, grain morphology can be readily imaged without resorting to chemical etching. Grain boundary contrast can also be enhanced through careful selection of imaging parameters. FIB secondary ion images also reveal chemical differences, and are especially useful in corrosion studies, as secondary ion yields of metals can increase by three orders of magnitude in the presence of oxygen, clearly revealing the presence of corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fibics.com/MS_FIBApp_SII_SteelCorrosion.html|title = FIB: Chemical Contrast|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of FIB secondary electron imaging is the fact that the ion beam does not alter the signal from fluorescent probes used in the labelling of proteins, thus creating the opportunity to correlate FIB secondary electron images with images obtained by fluorescence microscopes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Helium ion microscope (HeIM)==
Another ion source seen in commercially available instruments is a [[helium]] ion source, which is inherently less damaging to the sample than Ga ions although it will still sputter small amounts of material especially at high magnifications and long scan times. As helium ions can be focused into a small probe size and provide a much smaller sample interaction than high energy (&gt;1 kV) electrons in the SEM, the He ion microscope can generate equal or higher resolution images with good material contrast and a higher depth of focus. Commercial instruments are capable of sub 1&amp;nbsp;nm resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.smt.zeiss.com/C1256A770030BCE0/WebViewAllE/F4BF4E46C9379912C1257508002B9F7C| title = Carl Zeiss press release| date = 2008-11-21| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.smt.zeiss.com/C1256E4600307C70/EmbedTitelIntern/ORIONEssentialSpecificationPDF/$File/oriondata.pdf|title = Zeiss Orion Helium Ion Microscope Technical Data| accessdate = 2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wien filter in focused ion beam setup==

Imaging and milling with Ga ions always result in Ga incorporation near the sample surface. As the sample surface is sputtered away at a rate proportional to the sputtering yield and the ion flux (ions per area per time), the Ga is implanted further into the sample, and a steady-state profile of Ga is reached. This implantation is often a problem in the range of the semiconductor where silicon can be amorphised by the gallium. In order to get an alternative solution to Ga LMI sources, mass-filtered columns have been developed, based on a Wien filter technology. Such sources include Au-Si, Au-Ge and Au-Si-Ge sources providing Si, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Ge, In, Sn, Au, Pb and other elements.

[[File:Wien filter.jpg|thumb|alt=diagram showing the way the masses are selected|left|upright=1.1|Mass selection in the FIB column]] 
The principle of a Wien filter is based on the equilibrium of the opposite forces induced by perpendicular electrostatic and a magnetic fields acting on accelerated particles. The proper mass trajectory remains straight and passes through the mass selection aperture while the other masses are stopped.&lt;ref name=ExB&gt;{{citation| title = Orsay physics work on ExB mass filter Column |year =1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides allowing the use of sources others than gallium, these columns can switch from different species simply by adjusting the properties of the Wien filter. Larger ions can be used to make rapid milling before refining the contours with smaller ones. Users also benefits from the possibility to dope their samples with elements of suitable alloy sources.

The latter property has found great interests in the investigation of magnetic materials and devices. Khizroev and Litvinov have shown, with the help of [[Magnetic force microscope|magnetic force microscopy]] (MFM), that there is a critical dose of ions that a magnetic material can be exposed to without experiencing a change in the magnetic properties. Exploiting FIB from such an unconventional perspective is especially favourable today when the future of so many novel technologies depends on the ability to rapidly fabricate prototype nanoscale magnetic devices.&lt;ref name=magnetic&gt;{{cite journal|title = Focused-ion-beam-based rapid prototyping of nanoscale magnetic devices|author1=Khizroev S. |author2=Litvinov D. |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/3/R01|year = 2004|journal = Nanotechnology|volume = 15|pages = R7|issue = 3|bibcode = 2004Nanot..15R...7K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Full-sky Astrometric Mapping Explorer''' (or '''FAME''') was a proposed [[astrometry|astrometric]] [[satellite]] designed to determine with unprecedented accuracy the positions, distances, and motions of 40 million [[star]]s within our [[galactic neighborhood]] (distances by [[stellar parallax]] possible). This database was to allow astronomers to accurately determine the distance to all of the stars on this side of the Milky Way galaxy,  detect large planets and planetary systems around stars within 1,000 light years of the Sun, and measure the amount of dark matter in the galaxy from its influence on stellar motions. It was to be a collaborative effort between the [[United States Naval Observatory]] (USNO) and several other institutions. FAME would have measured stellar positions to less than 50 [[microarcseconds]]. The [[NASA]] MIDEX mission was scheduled for launch in 2004.  In January 2002, however, NASA abruptly cancelled this mission, mainly due to concerns about its price tag which grew from $160 million to $220 million. 

This would have been an improvement over the [[High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite]] (Hipparcos) which operated 1989-1993 and produced various [[star catalogs]]. Astrometric parallax measurements form part of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], and can also be measured by other [[Space telescopes]] such as [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] (HST) or ground-based telescopes to varying degrees of precision.

Compared to the FAME accuracy of 50 microarcseconds, the [[Gaia mission]] is planning 10 micro[[arcsecond]]s accuracy, for mapping [[stellar parallax]] up to a distance of tens of thousands of light-years from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Henney | first = Paul J. | title = ESA's Gaia Mission to study stars | publisher = Astronomy Today | date =  | url = http://www.astronomytoday.com/exploration/gaia.html | accessdate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold E. Puthoff''' (born  June 20, 1936) is an American [[engineer]] and [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]].&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/harold-e-puthoff Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology: Harold E. Puthoff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1967, Puthoff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack David, Michael Park. (1978). ''Playback: Canadian Selections''. McClelland and Stewart. p. 68. "Hal Puthoff, has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University. He worked for the Naval Security Group in Washington and then for the National Security Agency."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;Hugh Urban. (2013). ''The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion''. Princeton University Press. p. 113. "A physicist with a PhD from Stanford University, Harold Puthoff joined Scientology in the late 1960s and quickly advanced to the OT VII level by 1971."&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked with, and invented, tunable lasers and electron beam devices, concerning which he holds patents, and he is co-author (with R. Pantell) of ''Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics'' (Wiley, 1969), published in English, French, Russian and Chinese. Puthoff published papers on [[polarizable vacuum]] (PV) and [[stochastic electrodynamics]] topics, which are examples of alternative approaches to general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Puthoff took an interest in the [[Church of Scientology]] in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top [[Operating Thetan|OT VII]] level by 1971.&lt;ref name="Urban"/&gt; Puthoff wrote up his "wins" for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved "[[remote viewing]]" abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Puthoff, Hal, ''Success Story'', Scientology Advanced Org Los Angeles (AOLA) special publication, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology's ''Celebrity'' magazine, stating that Scientology had given him "a feeling of absolute fearlessness".&lt;ref&gt;''Celebrity'' magazine, Minor Issue 9, February 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Puthoff severed all connection with Scientology in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Puthoff, "Harold Puthoff Responds on Zero-Point Energy," ''Skeptical Inquirer'', September/October1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and '80s Puthoff directed a [[CIA]]/[[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]-funded program at [[SRI International]] to investigate [[paranormal]] abilities, collaborating with [[Russell Targ]] in a study of the purported [[psychic abilities]] of [[Uri Geller]], [[Ingo Swann]], [[Pat Price (remote viewer)|Pat Price]], [[Joseph McMoneagle]] and others, as part of the [[Stargate Project]]. Both Puthoff and Targ became convinced Geller and Swann had genuine psychic powers.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Targ, Harold Puthoff. (2005). ''Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities''. Hampton Roads Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Geller employed [[sleight of hand]] tricks.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Harris. (1985). ''Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect''. Calgary: Micky Hades International.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Puthoff founded a for-profit company, EarthTech International in Austin, TX. At about the same time, he founded an academically-oriented scientific research organization, Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (IASA), also in Austin, TX, where he is Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archived.parapsych.org/members/h_puthoff.html Harold Puthoff at the Parapsychological Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Independent of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, NJ, IASA pursues more focused research on topics specifically related to energy generation and space propulsion, with funding from anonymous donors.

Puthoff and EarthTech were granted a US Patent 5,845,220&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent US5,845,220|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=5845220A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19981201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP|website=European Patent Office|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 after five years delay. The claims were disputed that information could be transmitted through a distance using a modulated potential with no electric or magnetic field components. The case is used for educational purposes in patent law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DANIEL C. |first1=RISLOVE |title=(Page 1304) A CASE STUDY OF INOPERABLE INVENTIONS: WHY IS |url=http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/lawreview/issues/2006-4/rislove.pdf |website=University of Wisconsin Law School |publisher=University of Wisconsin Law School |accessdate=25 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925131935/http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/lawreview/issues/2006-4/rislove.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of a ''valid'' patent where "The lesson of the Puthoff patent is that in a world where both types of patents are more and more common, even a competent examiner may fail to distinguish innovation from pseudoscience."

==Assessment of scholarship==
[[Uri Geller]] was studied by [[Russell Targ]] and Puthoff at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI). Targ and Puthoff declared to have demonstrated that Geller had genuine psychic powers, though it was reported that there were flaws with the controls in the experiments and Geller was caught using [[sleight of hand]] on many other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (1982). ''The Truth about Uri Geller''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 163. "In reality, however, Geller, an experienced magician and showman, simply bends the objects when no one is watching. But, you may argue, millions of people were watching him on TV! Geller is a master at an essential tool of the magician: misdirection or distracting peoples' attention. He is quite good at projecting an air of innocence that belies his actions. That he can fool so many people is a tribute to slight-of-hand (sic) artistry, not psychic power."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Terence Hines]]:

{{quote|Geller turned out to be nothing more than a magician using sleight of hand and considerable personal charm to fool his admirers. The tests at SRI turned out to have been run under conditions that can best be described as chaotic. Few limits were placed on Geller’s behavior, and he was more or less in control of the procedures used to test him. Further, the results of the tests were incorrectly reported in Targ and Puthoff’s Nature paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The psychologists [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff’s [[remote viewing]] experiments. In a series of thirty-five studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]], Richard Kammann. (1978). ''Information transmission in remote viewing experiments''. Nature 274: 680–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. (1981). ''Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments''. Nature 292: 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Terence Hines has written:

{{quote|Examination of the few actual transcripts published by Targ and Puthoff show that just such clues were present. To find out if the unpublished transcripts contained cues, Marks and Kammann wrote to Targ and Puthoff requesting copies. It is almost unheard of for a scientist to refuse to provide his data for independent examination when asked, but Targ and Puthoff consistently refused to allow Marks and Kammann to see copies of the transcripts. Marks and Kammann were, however, able to obtain copies of the transcripts from the judge who used them. The transcripts were found to contain a wealth of cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Marks, when the cues were eliminated the results fell to a chance level.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]], Richard Kammann. (1980). ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1573927987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]] noted that controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (1997). "[http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/remote%20viewing.html Remote viewing]" in [[An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural]]. St. Martin's Griffin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks and Kamman concluded: "Until remote viewing can be confirmed in conditions which prevent sensory cueing the conclusions of Targ and Puthoff remain an unsubstantiated hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Reevaluation''. Prometheus Books. p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massimo Pigliucci]] has written Puthoff's research into zero-point energy is considered to be a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]]. (2010). ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk''. University of Chicago Press. p. 90. "Harold Puthoff is the director of Austin's Institute for Advanced Studies, but is also a well-known parapsychologist and conducts research on so-called zero point energy, the idea that one can extract energy from empty space—a proposition, I should add, that violates basic principles of thermodynamics and that is considered pseudoscience by credentialed physicists."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Martin Gardner]], Puthoff (and Targ) "imagined they could do research in parapsychology but instead dealt with 'psychics' who were cleverer than they were".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Ray |title=The Martin Gardner Correspondence with Marcello Truzzi |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=57–59 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history and philosophy of science''' ('''HPS''') is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that encompasses the [[philosophy of science]] and the [[History of science and technology|history of science]]. Although many scholars in the field are trained primarily as either historians or as philosophers, there are degree-granting departments of HPS at several prominent universities (see below).

==A unified discipline==
The organization [http://integratedhps.org/en/ &amp;HPS] (Integrated History and Philosophy of Science) has set forth a program for a unified discipline: "Good history and philosophy of science is not just history of science into which some philosophy of science may enter, or philosophy of science into which some history of science may enter. It is work that is both historical and philosophical at the same time. The founding insight of the modern discipline of HPS is that history and philosophy have a special affinity and one can effectively advance both simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;"About &amp;HPS," http://www3.nd.edu/~andhps/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One origin of the unified discipline is the historical approach to the discipline of the philosophy of science. This hybrid approach is reflected in the career of [[Thomas Kuhn]]. His first permanent appointment, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Discussion with Thomas S. Kuhn" in ''The Road Since Structure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; was to a position advertised by the philosophy department, but he also taught courses from the history department. When he was promoted to full professor in the history department only, Kuhn was offended at the philosophers' rejection because "I sure as hell wanted to be there, and it was my philosophy students who were working with me, not on philosophy but on history, were nevertheless my more important students".&lt;ref&gt;"A Discussion with Thomas S. Kuhn," p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is also reflected in his historicist approach, as outlined in Kuhn's seminal [[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962, 2nd ed. 1970), wherein philosophical questions about scientific theories and, especially, theory change are understood in historical terms, employing concepts such as [[paradigm shift]].

However, Kuhn was also critical of attempts fully to unify the ''methods'' of history and philosophy of science: "Subversion is not, I think, too strong a term for the likely result of an attempt to make the two fields into one. They differ in a number of their central constitutive characteristics, of which the most general and apparent is their goals. The final product of most historical research is a narrative, a story, about particulars of the past. [...] The philosopher, on the other hand, aims principally at explicit generalizations and at those with universal scope. He is no teller of stories, true or false. His goal is to discover and state what is true at all times and places rather than to impart understanding of what occurred at a particular time and place."&lt;ref&gt;"The Relations Between the History and the Philosophy of Science," pp. 3–20 in ''The Essential Tension'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent work questions whether these methodological and conceptual divisions are in fact barriers to a unified discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Patton, ''Philosophy, Science, and History'', pp. 27–33, New York: Routledge 2014, http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415898317/.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9644">'''Item tree analysis''' ('''ITA''') is a [[Data analysis|data analytical]] method which allows constructing a
hierarchical structure on the items of a [[questionnaire]] or [[Concept inventory|test]] from observed response
patterns. &lt;br /&gt;Assume that we have a questionnaire with ''m'' items and that subjects can
answer positive (1) or negative (0) to each of these items, i.e. the items are
[[Dichotomy|dichotomous]]. If ''n'' subjects answer the items this results in a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] data [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''D''
with ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows.
Typical examples of this data format are test items which can be solved (1) or failed
(0) by subjects. Other typical examples are questionnaires where the items are
statements to which subjects can agree (1) or disagree (0).&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the content of the items it is possible that the response of a subject to an
item ''j'' determines her or his responses to other items. It is, for example, possible that
each subject who agrees to item ''j'' will also agree to item ''i''. In this case we say that
item ''j'' [[Logical implication|implies]] item ''i'' (short &lt;math&gt;i \rightarrow j&lt;/math&gt;). The goal of an ITA is to uncover such
[[Determinism#Mathematical models|deterministic]] implications from the [[data set]] ''D''.

== Algorithms for ITA ==
ITA was originally developed by Van Leeuwe in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Van Leeuwe (1974)''&lt;/ref&gt; The result of his [[algorithm]],
which we refer in the following as ''Classical ITA'', is a [[logically consistent]] set of
implications &lt;math&gt;i \rightarrow j&lt;/math&gt;. Logically consistent means that if ''i'' implies ''j'' and ''j'' implies ''k'' then ''i'' implies ''k'' for each triple ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' of items. Thus the outcome of an ITA is a [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]] relation on the item set, i.e. a [[quasi-order]] on the items.&lt;br /&gt;
A different algorithm to perform an ITA was suggested in ''Schrepp (1999)''. This algorithm is called ''Inductive ITA''. &lt;br /&gt;
Classical ITA and inductive ITA both construct a quasi-order on the item set by [[Exploratory data analysis|explorative data analysis]]. But both methods use a different algorithm to construct this quasi-order. For a given data set the resulting quasi-orders from classical and inductive ITA will usually differ.&lt;br /&gt;
A detailed description of the algorithms used in classical and inductive ITA can be found in ''Schrepp (2003)'' or ''Schrepp (2006)''[http://www.jstatsoft.org/v16/i10/paper]. In a recent paper (Sargin &amp; Ünlü, 2009) some modifications to the algorithm of inductive ITA are proposed, which improve the ability of this method to detect the correct implications from data (especially in the case of higher random response error rates).

== Relation to other methods ==
ITA belongs to a group of data analysis methods called ''Boolean analysis of questionnaires''.
[[Boolean analysis]] was introduced by Flament in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Flament (1976)''&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a Boolean analysis is to
detect deterministic dependencies (formulas from [[Boolean logic]] connecting the items, like for example &lt;math&gt;i \rightarrow j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i \wedge j \rightarrow k&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i \vee j \rightarrow k&lt;/math&gt;) between the items of a questionnaire or test.
Since the basic work of ''Flament (1976)'' a number of different methods for boolean analysis
have been developed. See, for example, ''Van Buggenhaut and Degreef (1987)'', ''Duquenne (1987)'' or ''Theuns (1994)''.
These methods share the goal to [[Mathematical proof|derive]] deterministic dependencies between the items of a
questionnaire from data, but differ in the algorithms to reach this goal. A comparison of ITA
to other methods of boolean data analysis can be found in ''Schrepp (2003)''.

== Applications ==
There are several research papers available, which describe concrete applications of item tree analysis. 
''Held and Korossy (1998)'' analyzes implications on a set of [[algebra]] problems with classical ITA. Item tree analysis is also used in a number of [[Social studies|social science studies]] to get [[insight]] into the structure of dichotomous data. In ''Bart and Krus (1973)'', for example, a predecessor of ITA is used to establish a hierarchical order on items that describe socially unaccepted behavior. In ''Janssens (1999)'' a method of Boolean analysis is used to investigate the
integration process of [[Minority group|minorities]] into the [[value system]] of the dominant culture. Schrepp&lt;ref&gt;See ''Schrepp (2002)'' and  ''Schrepp(2003)''&lt;/ref&gt; describes several applications of inductive ITA in the analysis of dependencies between items of social science questionnaires.

== Example of an application ==
To show the possibilities of an analysis of a data set by ITA we analyse the statements of question 4 of the International Social Science Survey Programme (ISSSP) for the year 1995 by inductive and classical ITA.
The ISSSP is a continuing annual program of cross-national collaboration on surveys covering important topics for social science research. The program conducts each year one survey with comparable questions in each of the participating nations. The theme of the 1995 survey was [[national identity]]. We analyze the results for question 4 for the data set of [[Western Germany]].
The statement for question 4 was:

''Some people say the following things are important for being truly German. Others say they are not important. How important do you think each of the following is'':&lt;br /&gt;
''1. to have been born in Germany''&lt;br /&gt;
''2. to have German citizenship''&lt;br /&gt;
''3. to have lived in Germany for most of one’s life''&lt;br /&gt;
''4. to be able to speak German''&lt;br /&gt;
''5. to be a Christian''&lt;br /&gt;
''6. to respect Germany’s political institutions''&lt;br /&gt;
''7. to feel German''

The subjects had the response possibilities ''Very important'', ''Important'', ''Not very important'', ''Not important at all'', and ''Can’t choose'' to answer the statements. 
To apply ITA to this data set we changed the answer categories.&lt;br /&gt; ''Very important'' and ''Important'' are coded as 1. ''Not very important'' and ''Not important at all'' are coded as 0. ''Can’t choose'' was handled as missing data.&lt;br /&gt; 
The following figure shows the resulting quasi-orders &lt;math&gt;\leq_{IITA}&lt;/math&gt; from inductive ITA and &lt;math&gt;\leq_{CITA}&lt;/math&gt; from classical ITA.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Results of ITA for ISSP 1995 question 4.jpg|600px]]

== Available software ==
The program ITA 2.0 implements both classical and inductive ITA. The program is available on [http://www.jstatsoft.org/v16/i10]. A short documentation of the program is available in [http://www.jstatsoft.org/v16/i10/paper].

'''Jiāo Bǐngzhēn''' ({{zh|t=焦秉貞|s=焦秉贞|p=Jiāo Bǐngzhēn|w='''Chiao Ping-chen'''}}), 1689–1726) was a native of [[Jining, Shandong|Jining]], [[Shandong]] who became a noted painter and astronomer. In painting he is noteworthy as one of the first [[Qing dynasty]] painters to be influenced by the West. He is also among the more significant portrait and miniature painters in the early Qing. He was skilled in painting people, landscapes, and buildings.&lt;ref name="CiHai"&gt;Cihai: Page 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western influence in his art came from his exposure to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at the Directorate of Astronomy. Their influence also exposed him to new ideas on astronomy and religion. At some point Jiao became a [[Roman Catholic]] and played a role on the Jesuit side of the [[Chinese Rites controversy]].

'''Lewis H. Ryder''' is a British [[theoretical physicist]].

==Biography==

Ryder earned a master's degree in physics from [[Oxford University]], a [[PhD]] in Mathematical Physics from [[Edinburgh University]] under supervision of [[Peter Higgs]], and later an [[SERC fellowship]].

In 1967 he went to the [[University of Kent]] where he is still a senior lecturer.

His research interests are in geometrical aspects of [[particle physics]] and its parallels with [[general relativity]], and the possible existence and detection of [[torsion tensor|torsion]] and [[curvature]] in [[spacetime]]. He also does research on the [[geometric phase]] and in [[condensed matter physics]].

Intersex people have many different [[sex assignment]]s and [[gender identity|gender identities]],&lt;ref name="ohchr" /&gt; and so there is no presumption that people on this list have any particular sex assigned at birth, nor any particular gender identity.

This list consists of well-known intersex people. The individual listings note the subject's main occupation or source of notability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4205">'''MERODE'''&lt;ref&gt;Snoeck, M. (2014). Enterprise Information Systems Engineering: The MERODE approach: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Object-oriented modeling|Object Oriented]] [[Enterprise modelling|Enterprise Modeling]] method developed at [[KU Leuven]] (Belgium). Its name is the abbreviation of '''M'''odel driven, '''E'''xistence dependency '''R'''elation, '''O'''bject oriented '''DE'''velopment. MERODE is a method for creating [[domain model]]s (also called conceptual models) as basis for building information systems making use of two prominent [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagramming techniques - [[class diagram]] and [[state diagram]]s. Starting from a high-level [[Platform-independent model|PIM]] (close to a Computational Independent Model ([[Computational Independent Model|CIM]])) allows removing or hiding details irrelevant for a [[conceptual model]]ling view which makes the approach easier to understand. 
The method is grounded in process algebra, which enables mathematical reasoning on models. Thanks to this, models can be checked for internal consistency and mutual completeness, i.e. inter/intra model consistency and syntactical quality. The automated reasoning ("consistency by construction") &lt;ref&gt;Snoeck, M., Michiels, C., &amp; Dedene, G. (2003). Consistency by construction: The case of MERODE. In M. A. Jeusfeld, Pastor, Oscar (Ed.), Conceptual modeling for novel application domains, LNCS (Vol. 2814, pp. 105-117).&lt;/ref&gt; also caters for autocomplete functionality, which allows creating correct models faster.

A typical MERODE analysis or conceptualisation consists of three views or diagrams: a so-called existence dependency graph (EDG) similar to a [[UML class metamodel|UML class diagram]], a proprietary concept namely an object event table (OET) and a group of [[finite-state machine|finite state machine]]s.

MERODE fosters a [[model-driven engineering]] approach to software development. It targets platform independent domain models that are sufficiently complete for execution, i.e. transformation to platform-specific models and to code. In order to achieve automated transformation of models, MERODE limits the use of UML to a number of well-defined constructs with clear semantics and complements this with the notion of "existence dependency" &lt;ref&gt;Snoeck M, Dedene G (1998) Existence Dependency: the key to semantic integrity between structural and behavioral aspects of object types. IEEE Trans Softw Eng 24(24):233–251&lt;/ref&gt; and a proprietary approach to object interaction modelling.

MERODE-models can be created with the opensource case tool JMermaid.&lt;ref&gt;http://merode.econ.kuleuven.ac.be/mermaid.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The tool also allows checking the models for consistency and readiness for transformation.

'''Maker education''' (a term coined by [[Dale Dougherty]] in 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators|last=Dougherty|first=Dale|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-0415539203|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] learning, is an approach to [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and [[project-based learning]] that relies upon hands-on, often collaborative, learning experiences as a method for solving authentic problems. People who participate in making often call themselves "makers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifehacker.com/im-dale-dougherty-founder-of-make-magazine-and-this-i-1742793651|title=I'm Dale Dougherty, Founder of Make: Magazine, and This Is How I Work|last=Orin|first=Andy|newspaper=Lifehacker|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[maker movement]] and develop their projects in [[makerspace]]s, or development studios which emphasize prototyping and the repurposing of found objects in service of creating new inventions or innovations. Culturally, makerspaces, both inside and outside of schools, are associated with collaboration and the free flow of ideas. In schools, maker education stresses the importance of learner-driven experience, interdisciplinary learning, peer-to-peer teaching, iteration, and the notion of "failing forward", or the idea that mistake-based learning is crucial to the [[Learning|learning process]] and eventual success of a project.

== Influences ==
Maker education is an offshoot of the [[maker movement]], which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described as "the umbrella term for independent innovators, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]'', as well as hands-on [[Maker Faire]]s that are catnip for [[:Category:Do it yourself|DIYers]] who used to toil in solitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/104210/maker-faire-maker-movement/|title=Why the Maker Movement Is Important to America's Future|last=Bajarin|first=Tim|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale Dougherty, founder of the Maker Faire and ''Make'' magazine, stated in his 2011 TED Talk that "We are all makers. We are born makers. We don't just live, but we make." In the same TED Talk, Dougherty also called for making to be embraced in education, as students are the new generation of makers. Another central contributor to the maker movement, [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], who was once the editor-in-chief of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] and is now the CEO of [[3D Robotics]], wrote a manifesto of the maker movement in 2012, called "Makers". His third book, ''[[Makers: The New Industrial Revolution]]'' (2012), emphasizes the role that making has to play in the renaissance of American manufacturing. Mark Hatch, who is now the CEO of [[TechShop]], also published "The Maker Movement Manifesto". In addition to these contributions, seminal texts include, ''Invent To Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom'' by [[Sylvia Libow Martinez]], and ''The Art of Tinkering,'' by Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich, founders of The Tinkering Studio at the [[Exploratorium]].

In the United States, hands-on learning through making has roots in the nineteenth century, as a result of the influence of educators such as [[Calvin M. Woodward]], who established the Manual Training School of Washington University on June 6, 1879. Unlike later [[Vocational education in the United States|vocational education]] that would take hold in 1917 through the Smith-Hughes Act that had the aim of reducing the United States reliance on foreign trade, the impetus for the Manual Training School was to provide students with training in making and craftsmanship that had "no immediate vocational goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Transformation of the School: Progressivism in American Education, 1876–1957]]|last=Cremin|first=Lawrence|publisher=Vintage|year=1961|isbn=978-0394705194|location=New York|pages=26|quote="no immediate vocational goal."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's maker education highlights students' potential to "change the world"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makered.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=About Maker Ed|website=makered.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "let their imaginations run wild"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while also emphasizing building students' entrepreneurship skills and ability to earn money by selling their inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Make:|title=Why Education Needs the Maker Movement - Betty Ray|date=2015-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twcuJG733y4|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of the late nineteenth century is sometimes also referenced in relationship with the maker movement. The Arts and Crafts movement, which originated in Britain before taking hold in Europe and North America, was anti-industrial, critical of machinery and factory production, advocating instead for a return to traditional craftsmanship.

== Development and expansion ==
Since 2005, maker education has gained momentum in schools across the United States and around the world. Proponents of the [[maker movement]] cite the potential for making to bring more women to [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields and close the [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gap]]. Other potential benefits and goals for making include creating greater [[educational equity]] among students in public schools, and the possibility for making to be a driver in educational and societal change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fablearn.stanford.edu/fellows/blog/steam-de-trojan-horse-making-%E2%80%9Dinclusivity%E2%80%9D|title=STEAM, de Trojan Horse for Making "Inclusivity" {{!}} FabLearn Fellows|website=fablearn.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other educators and innovators have developed offshoot curriculum and technologies related to the intersection of [[critical thinking]] and [[making]], called [[critical making]].

In school models, such as the Lighthouse Community Charter, a charter school in Oakland, California, Aaron Van der Woorf, the robotics teacher leads the students in Maker Ed. At the [[The Park School|Park School]], in collaboration with Harvard's Project Zero, students hold a mini maker faire in school that also acts as a fundraiser for the school. Some districts have also adopted maker education district-wide, such as the district of [[Elizabeth Forward School District|Elizabeth Forward]], just south of Pittsburgh, which partnered with [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] to provide professional development for teachers through working with students on Maker Ed. Principals in Albemarle County schools cite Superintendent Pam Moran as instrumental in bringing maker education to their school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-02-albemarle-county-schools-journey-from-a-makerspace-to-a-maker-district|title=Albemarle County Schools' Journey From a Makerspace to a Maker District (EdSurge News)|newspaper=EdSurge|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to bringing maker education to schools, scholars like Paulo Blikstein of Stanford University and Dennis Krannich of the University Bremen, in Germany, state that, "Digital fabrication and 'making,' and the positive social movement around them, could be an unprecedented opportunity for educators to advance a progressive educational agenda in which project-based, interest-driven, student-centered learning are at the center stage of students' educational experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blikstein|first=Paulo|last2=Krannich|first2=Dennis|year=2013|title=The makers' movement and FabLabs in education: experiences, technologies, and research|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 12th international conference on interaction design and children|volume=|pages=613–616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penketh High School Became the first school in the United Kingdom to embedded maker education into the UK education system in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/16038242.Penketh_High_becomes_first_state_school_in_the_country_to_build_dedicated__makerspace_/|title=Penketh High becomes first state school in the country to build dedicated 'makerspace'|website=Warrington Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration has also strongly supported the growing maker movement as an integral part of STEM education, which it hopes will increase American students ability to compete globally in the areas of science, engineering, and math. At the White House, President Obama hosted the first ever White House Maker Faire in June, 2014, adopting the idea that Americans are a "Nation of Makers". On the Nation of Makers webpage, Americans are encouraged to join the movement, asserting that "empowering students and adults to create, innovate, tinker, and make their ideas and solutions into reality is at the heart of the Maker Movement". Since the first-ever White House Maker Faire, the Obama Administration has "continued to support opportunities for students to learn about STEM through making, expand the resources available for maker entrepreneurs, and foster the development of advanced manufacturing in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/nation-of-makers|title=The First White House Maker Faire|website=The White House|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2015, the President announced the National Week of Making, June 17–23, to support the Nation of Makers. In 2016, President Obama renewed his commitment to maker education by continuing the National Week of Making. The National Maker Faire will include participation from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Navy (Navy), the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At the time of this announcement, the President also detailed the progress that had been made on the Nation of Makers. He announced, 
* Eight Federal agencies are announcing new grants, education initiatives, training, knowledge networks, and other supports to help create more makers and assist more entrepreneurs to take prototypes to scale with new ventures.
* More than 1,400 K–12 schools, representing almost 1 million students from all 50 states, are committing to dedicating a space for making, designating a champion for making, and having a public showcase of student projects.
* More than 100 additional commitments including the distribution of 1 million foldable microscopes to children around the world by Foldscope Instruments; the investment in 100 new makerspaces by Google as part of the Making Spaces program; and new steps to support making at 77 universities and colleges through Make Schools Alliance.
In addition to these developments, on June 17, 2016, the White House issued a press release, detailing the next steps the United States government will take to support the development and expansion of maker education.

== Critique ==
{{See also|Critical theory of maker education}}
Though maker education has been embraced by thousands of schools and school districts across the United States and abroad, there has also emerged criticism of the movement.

Among the critics is [[Evgeny Morozov]], a Belarusian writer and researcher, whose work focuses on the impact, both social and political, of technology. In his article published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', entitled, "Making It: Pick up a spot welder and join the revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/making-it-2|title=Making It|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morozov criticizes [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] for "confusing the history of the Web with the history of capitalism and ends by speculating about the future of the maker movement, which, on closer examination, is actually speculation on the future of capitalism". He also criticizes companies and organizations that were once committed to open source software for becoming acquired by for-profit companies and embroiled in copyright and trademark lawsuits. Morozov also criticizes the maker movement's major contributors financial relationship with [[DARPA]], which made a $10 million grant to support maker education for high school students, and $3.5 million to [[TechShop]] to establish new [[makerspaces]].

While Morozov is one of the more vocal critics of maker education, he is not the only one. Debbie Chachra, associate professor at Olin College of Engineering, in her article in January 23, 2015 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled, "Why I Am Not a Maker",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/|title=Why I Am Not a Maker|last=Chachra|first=Debbie|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; centers her criticism on "the social history of who makes things—and who doesn't". Chachra describes the history of the "makers" of products as men, rather than those who cared for "hearth and home", that is, historically, women. She calls for recognition of "the work of the educators, those that analyze and characterize and critique, everyone who fixes things, all the other people who do valuable work with and for others—above all, the caregivers—whose work isn't about something you can put in a box and sell". In "A more lovingly made world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=2013|title=A More Lovingly Made World|url=|journal=Cultural Studies Review|volume=19|pages=296–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[McKenzie Wark]] of [[The New School]], Wark writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don't actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn't teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] and Mark Hatch evoke Marx in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer.

Finally, Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of [[Northwestern University]], and Meg Escude of [[Exploratorium]], offer an in-depth look at the ways in which maker education reinforces [[educational inequality]]. They begin by offering Haitian writer, [[Edwidge Danticat]]'s commentary on making: "If you can't afford clothes, but you can make them--make them. You have to work with what you have, especially if you don't 'have a lot of money. You use creativity, and you use imagination." Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude make the case that true making is often born from difficult environmental circumstances, and that what local communities once did as part of their daily lives (offering an exchange of skills and knowledge, for example, to help others in need in the community) is now being offered to low-income neighborhoods as an intervention program, promising greater educational equality. They argue that the "American Maker" highlighted by [[Dale Dougherty]] in his 2011 Ted Talk, is symptomatic of the problems associated with [[American exceptionalism]], in that it is "grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices". Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for "equity-oriented design" of maker experiences which include, "critical analyses or educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8438">The '''Maxwell–Bloch equations''', also called the '''optical Bloch equations''', were first derived by Tito Arecchi and Rodolfo Bonifacio of Milan, Italy.&lt;ref name="Arecchi-Bonifacio"&gt;F. T. Arecchi and R. Bonifacio, 'Theory of Optical Maser Amplifiers', IEEE J. Quantum Electron. 1, pp169-178 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the dynamics of a [[two-state quantum system]] interacting with the electromagnetic mode of an optical resonator. They are analogous to (but not at all equivalent to) the [[Bloch equation]]s which describe the motion of the nuclear magnetic moment in an electromagnetic field. The equations can be derived either semiclassically or with the field fully quantized when certain approximations are made.

==Semi-classical formulation==
The derivation of the semi-classical optical Bloch equations is nearly identical to solving the [[two-state quantum system]] (see the discussion there). However, usually one casts these equations into a density matrix form. The system we are dealing with can be described by the wave function: 
:&lt;math&gt; \psi = c_g\psi_g + c_e\psi_e &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left|c_g\right|^2 + \left|c_e\right|^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[density matrix]] is 
:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \begin{bmatrix}\rho_{ee} &amp; \rho_{eg} \\ \rho_{ge} &amp; \rho_{gg}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}c_e c_{e}^* &amp; c_e c_{g}^* \\ c_g c_{e}^* &amp; c_g c_{g}^* \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

(other conventions are possible; this follows the derivation in Metcalf (1999)).&lt;ref name="metcalf"&gt;Metcalf, Harold. ''Laser Cooling and Trapping'' Springer 1999 pg. 24-&lt;/ref&gt; One can now solve the Heisenberg equation of motion, or translate the results from solving the Schrödinger equation into density matrix form. One arrives at the following equations, including spontaneous emission: 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \rho_{gg}}{dt} = \gamma \rho_{ee} + \frac{i}{2}(\Omega^* \bar \rho_{eg} - \Omega\bar \rho_{ge})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \rho_{ee}}{dt} = -\gamma \rho_{ee} + \frac{i}{2}(\Omega \bar \rho_{ge} - \Omega^*\bar \rho_{eg})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d \bar \rho_{ge}}{dt} = -\left( \frac{\gamma}{2} + i\delta \right) \bar \rho_{ge} + \frac{i}{2}\Omega^*(\rho_{ee} - \rho_{gg})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \bar \rho_{eg}}{dt} = - \left( \frac{\gamma}{2} - i\delta \right) \bar \rho_{eg} + \frac{i}{2}\Omega(\rho_{gg} - \rho_{ee})&lt;/math&gt;

In the derivation of these formulae, we define &lt;math&gt;\bar \rho_{ge} \equiv \rho_{ge}e^{i\delta t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar \rho_{eg} \equiv \rho_{eg}e^{-i\delta t}&lt;/math&gt;. It was also explicitly assumed that spontaneous emission is described by an exponential decay of the coefficient &lt;math&gt;\rho_{eg}(t)&lt;/math&gt; with decay constant &lt;math&gt;\frac{\gamma}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the (generalized) [[Rabi frequency]], which is 
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \sqrt{|\chi_{g,e}|^2 + \delta^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta = \omega - \omega_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the detuning and measures how far the light frequency, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, is from the transition, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \chi_{g,e} = {\vec{d}_{g,e}\cdot\vec{E}_0 \over \hbar}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\vec{d}_{g,e}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transition dipole moment]] for the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{g \rightarrow e}&lt;/math&gt; transition and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\vec{E}_0 = \hat{\epsilon}E_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] [[electric field]] amplitude including the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]].

==Derivation from Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Beginning with the [[Jaynes-Cummings model|Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian]] under [[coherent state|coherent drive]]

:&lt;math&gt;H=\omega_c a^\dagger a + \omega_a \sigma^\dagger\sigma+ig(a^\dagger\sigma-a\sigma^\dagger)+iJ(a^\dagger e^{-i\omega_l t}-a e^{i\omega_l t})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[lowering operator]] for the cavity field, and &lt;math&gt; \sigma=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_x - i\sigma_y\right) &lt;/math&gt; is the atomic lowering operator written as a combination of [[Pauli matrices]]. The time dependence can be removed by transforming the wavefunction according to &lt;math&gt; |\psi\rangle\rightarrow \operatorname{e}^{-i\omega_l t\left(a^\dagger a + \sigma^\dagger\sigma\right)}|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a transformed Hamiltonian

:&lt;math&gt;H=\Delta_c a^\dagger a + \Delta_a \sigma^\dagger\sigma+ig(a^\dagger\sigma-a\sigma^\dagger)+iJ( a^\dagger-a)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta_i = \omega_i - \omega_l &lt;/math&gt;. As it stands now, the Hamiltonian has four terms. The first two are the self energy of the atom (or other two level system) and field. The third term is an energy conserving interaction term allowing the cavity and atom to exchange population and coherence. These three terms alone give rise to the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of dressed states, and the associated anharmonicity in the energy spectrum. The last term models coupling between the cavity mode and a classical field, i.e. a laser. The drive strength &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; is given in terms of the power transmitted through the empty two-sided cavity as &lt;math&gt; J=\sqrt{2P(\Delta_c^2 + \kappa^2)/(\omega_c \kappa)} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;2\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the cavity linewidth. This brings to light a crucial point concerning the role of dissipation in the operation of a laser or other [[Cavity quantum electrodynamics|CQED]] device; dissipation is the means by which the system (coupled atom/cavity) interacts with its environment. To this end, dissipation is included by framing the problem in terms of the master equation, where the last two terms are in the [[Lindblad superoperator|Lindblad form]]

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho}=-i[H,\rho] + 2\kappa\left(a\rho a^\dagger -\frac{1}{2}\left(a^\dagger a \rho + \rho a^\dagger a\right)\right) + 2\gamma\left(\sigma\rho 
\sigma^\dagger -\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma^\dagger \sigma\rho + \rho \sigma^\dagger \sigma\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The equations of motion for the expectation values of the operators can be derived from the master equation by the formulas  &lt;math&gt; \langle O \rangle = \operatorname{tr}\left(O\rho\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \langle\dot{O}\rangle = \operatorname{tr}\left(O\dot{\rho}\right) &lt;/math&gt;. The equations of motion for &lt;math&gt; \langle a\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \langle\sigma\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \langle\sigma_z\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, the cavity field, atomic coherence, and atomic inversion respectively, are

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle a \rangle = i\left(-\Delta_c \langle a \rangle - ig\langle \sigma\rangle - iJ\right) -\kappa \langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle \sigma \rangle = i\left(-\Delta_a \langle \sigma \rangle - ig\langle a \sigma_z \rangle\right) -\gamma \langle \sigma \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle \sigma_z \rangle = -2g\left(\langle a^\dagger \sigma \rangle+\langle a \sigma^\dagger \rangle\right) -2\gamma \langle \sigma_z\rangle-2\gamma  &lt;/math&gt;

At this point, we have produced three of an infinite ladder of coupled equations. As can be seen from the third equation, higher order correlations are necessary. The differential equation for the time evolution of &lt;math&gt;\langle a^\dagger \sigma \rangle &lt;/math&gt; will contain expectation values of higher order products of operators, thus leading to an infinite set of coupled equations. We heuristically make the approximation that the expectation value of a product of operators is equal to the product of expectation values of the individual operators. This is akin to assuming that the operators are uncorrelated, and is a good approximation in the classical limit. It turns out that the resulting equations give the correct qualitative behavior even in the single excitation regime. Additionally, to simplify the equations we make the following replacements

:&lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle = (\gamma/\sqrt{2} g)x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma \rangle = -p/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma_z\rangle = -D  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta = \Delta_c/\kappa &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C = g^2/2\kappa\gamma &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \sqrt{2} g J/\kappa\gamma  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta=\Delta_a/\gamma  &lt;/math&gt;

And the Maxwell–Bloch equations can be written in their final form

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=\kappa\left(-2Cp+y-(i\Theta+1)x\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{p} = \gamma\left( -(1+i\Delta)p + xD\right)   &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{D}=\gamma\left(2(1-D)-(x^*p+xp^*)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1379">The '''Medawar Zone''' is the area of [[problem]]s which are most likely to produce fruitful results.  Problems that are too simple are unlikely to produce novel or significant results.  Problems that are too ambitious may not succeed at all or may be rejected by the research community at large.  This is illustrated in the figure:

[[Image:MedawarZone.gif]]

In an article on creativity in research, [[Craig Loehle]] named this zone after Sir [[Peter Medawar]], a [[Nobel prize]]-winning medical researcher who was active from the 1940s to the 1960s. In  ''The Art of the Soluble'', Medawar suggested that there seems to be a certain time when scientific questions seem especially ripe for answering, whereas other questions remain elusive and out-of-reach from investigation.

'''NuSTAR''' ('''Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array''') is a space-based [[X-ray]] telescope that uses a [[Conical intersection|conical approximation]] to a [[Wolter telescope]] to focus high energy X-rays from [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] sources, especially for [[nuclear spectroscopy]], and operates in the range of 3 to 79 [[keV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/page/about |title=About |series=NuSTAR |publisher=Caltech |accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NuSTAR is the eleventh mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Small Explorer]] satellite program ('''SMEX-11''') and the first space-based direct-imaging [[X-ray telescope]] at energies beyond those of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[XMM-Newton]]. It was successfully launched on 13 June 2012, having previously been delayed from 21 March due to software issues with the launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/nustar20120316.html |title=Launch of NASA's NuSTAR Mission Postponed |publisher=NASA |first1=Whitney |last1=Clavin |first2=Trent J. |last2=Perrotto |first3=George |last3=Diller |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nustar-launch"&gt;{{cite press release |title=NASA Selects Explorer Mission Proposals for Feasibility Studies (03-353) |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/nustar20120316.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission's primary scientific goals are to conduct a deep survey for [[black hole]]s a billion times more massive than the Sun, to investigate how particles are accelerated to very high energy in [[active galaxy|active galaxies]], and to understand how the elements are created in the explosions of massive stars by imaging the remains, which are called [[supernova remnant]]s.

After a primary mission lasting two years (to 2014) it is now in its fifth year in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/news/nustar170613 |title=NuSTAR's First Five Years in Space |publisher=Caltech |first=Whitney |last=Clavin |date=13 June 2017 |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NuSTAR's predecessor, the High Energy Focusing Telescope (HEFT), was a balloon-borne version that carried telescopes and detectors constructed using similar technologies. In February 2003, NASA issued an Explorer Program Announcement of Opportunity. In response, NuSTAR was submitted to NASA in May, as one of 36 mission proposals vying to be the tenth and eleventh Small Explorer missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NASA Selects Explorer Mission Proposals for Feasibility Studies (03-353) |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/nov/HQ_03353_feasibility_studies.html |publisher=Dwayne Brown, NASA |date=4 November 2003 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November, NASA selected NuSTAR and four other proposals for a five-month implementation feasibility study.

In January 2005, NASA selected NuSTAR for flight pending a one-year feasibility study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NASA Selects Small Explorer Mission (05-026) |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jan/HQ_05026_exp_mission.html |publisher=Dolores Beasley/Gretchen Cook-Anderson, NASA |date=26 January 2005 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was cancelled in February 2006 as a result of cuts to science in NASA's 2007 budget. On 21 September 2007 it was announced that the program had been restarted, with an expected launch in August 2011, though this was later delayed to June 2012.&lt;ref name="nustar-launch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NASA Restarts Telescope Mission to Detect Black Holes (07-198) |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/sep/HQ_07198_NuSTAR.html |publisher=Grey Hautaluoma, NASA |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Restarts Telescope Mission to Detect Black Holes |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/jpl/news/nustar-20070921_prt.htm |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writers |title=NASA Plans Black Hole Finder |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070921_nustar_restart.html |work=SPACE.com |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal investigator is [[Fiona A. Harrison]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). Other major partners include the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU), [[Columbia University]], [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz]],  [[Sonoma State University]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], and the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI). NuSTAR's major industrial partners include [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] and [[Alliant Techsystems|ATK Space Components]].

==Launch==
NASA contracted with [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] to launch NuSTAR (mass {{convert|772|lbs|kg}})&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/main/index.html |title=NuSTAR |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket for 21 March 2012.&lt;ref name="nustar-launch"/&gt; It had earlier been planned for 15 August 2011, 3 February 2012, 16 March 2012, and 14 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Nelson |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=2306 |title=NASA Approves X-ray Space Mission |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a launch meeting on 15 March 2012, the launch was pushed further back to allow time to review flight software used by the launch vehicle's flight computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/nustar20120316.html |title=Launch of NASA's NuSTAR Mission Postponed |work=NASA.gov |first1=Whitney |last1=Clavin |first2=Trent J |last2=Perrotto |first3=George |last3=Diller |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was conducted successfully at 16:00:37 UTC on 13 June 2012&lt;ref name="SFN"/&gt; about 117 nautical miles south of [[Kwajalein Atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orbital.com/NewsInfo/release.asp?prid=685 |title=NASA Selects Orbital's Pegasus Rocket to Launch NuSTAR Space Science Satellite |publisher=Orbital |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pegasus rocket was dropped from the [[Stargazer (aircraft)|L-1011 'Stargazer' aircraft]].&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47798276/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/nasa-blasts-nustar-telescope-orbit-hunt-black-holes#.T9tuHVJy9RU |first=Clara |last=Moskowitz |title=NASA blasts NuSTAR telescope into orbit to hunt black holes |work=MSNBC |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2012 it was confirmed that the 10 m mast was fully deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/95927/nustar-successfully-deploys-huge-mast/ |title=NuSTAR Successfully Deploys Huge Mast |date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optics==
[[File:NuSTAR's Russian Doll-like Mirrors (PIA15631).jpg|thumb|left|NuSTAR's nested X-ray mirrors]]
Unlike visible light telescopes&amp;nbsp;– which employ mirrors or lenses working with normal incidence&amp;nbsp;– NuSTAR has to employ grazing incidence optics to be able to focus X-rays. For this two conical approximation [[Wolter telescope]] design optics with {{convert|10.15|m}} focal length are held at the end of a long [[Deployable structure|deployable]] mast. A laser [[metrology]] system is used to determine the exact relative positions of the optics and the focal plane at all times, so that each detected photon can be mapped back to the correct point on the sky even if the optics and the focal plane move relative to one another during an exposure.

Each focusing optic consists of 133 concentric shells. One particular innovation enabling NuSTAR is that these shells are coated with [[depth-graded multilayer coating|depth-graded multilayers]] (alternating atomically thin layers of a high-density and low-density material); with NuSTAR's choice of Pt/SiC and W/Si multilayers, this enables reflectivity up to 79&amp;nbsp;keV (the platinum [[K-edge]] energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/about-nustar/instrumentation/optics |title=NuSTAR optics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68o5LUMAG?url=http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/about-nustar/instrumentation/optics |archivedate=30 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=optics-overview&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/uploads/files/hailey_spie2010_7732_28.pdf |title=The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR): optics overview and current status |journal=Proceedings of the SPIE |volume=7732 |first1=Charles J. |last1=Hailey |first2=HongJun |last2=An |first3=Kenneth L. |last3=Blaedel |first4=Nicolai F. |last4=Brejnholt |first5=Finn E. |last5=Christensen |first6=William W. |last6=Craig |first7=Todd A. |last7=Decker |first8=Melanie |last8=Doll |first9=Jeff |last9=Gum |first10=Jason E. |last10=Koglin |first11=Carsten P. |last11=Jensen |first12=Layton |last12=Hale |first13=Kaya |last13=Mori |first14=Michael J. |last14=Pivovaroff |first15=Marton |last15=Sharpe |first16=Marcela |last16=Stern |first17=Gordon |last17=Tajiri |first18=William W. |last18=Zhang |display-authors=5 |date=29 July 2010 |doi=10.1117/12.857654 |bibcode=2010SPIE.7732E..0TH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719160220/http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/uploads/files/hailey_spie2010_7732_28.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optics were produced, at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], by heating thin (210&amp;nbsp;µm) sheets of flexible glass in an oven so that they slump over precision-polished cylindrical quartz [[mandrel]]s of the appropriate radius.  The [[coating]]s were applied by a group at the [[Danish Technical University]].

The shells were then assembled, at the [[Nevis Laboratories]] of Columbia University, using graphite spacers machined to constrain the glass to the conical shape, and held together by epoxy. There are 4680 mirror segments in total (the 65 inner shells each comprise six segments and the 65 outer shells twelve; there are upper and lower segments to each shell, and there are two telescopes); there are five spacers per segment. Since the epoxy takes 24 hours to cure, one shell is assembled per day&amp;nbsp;– it took four months to build up one optic.

The expected point spread function for the flight mirrors is 43 arc-seconds, giving a spot size of about two millimeters at the focal plane; this is unprecedentedly good resolution for focusing hard X-ray optics, though it is about one hundred times worse than the best resolution achieved at longer wavelengths by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]].

==Detectors==
[[File:NuSTAR detector.JPG|thumb|left|One of NuSTAR's two detectors]]
[[File:Nustar mast deployed.jpg|thumb|NuSTAR's mast deployed on Earth; the inset is looking down the structure]]
Each focusing optic has its own focal plane module, consisting of a solid state [[cadmium zinc telluride]] (CdZnTe) pixel detector &lt;ref name=Harrison2010&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Fiona |title=Semiconductor radiation detection systems |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=9781439803851}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by a CsI [[Electronic anticoincidence|anti-coincidence shield]]. One detector unit&amp;nbsp;— or focal plane&amp;nbsp;— comprises four (two-by-two) detectors, manufactured by [http://www.evproducts.com eV Products]. Each detector is a rectangular crystal of dimension 20mm x 20mm and thickness ~2mm that have been gridded into 32 × 32, 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm pixels (each pixel subtending 12.3 arc seconds) and provides a total of 12 arc minute field of view for each focal plane module.

CZT detectors are state-of-the-art room temperature [[semiconductor]]s that are very efficient at turning high energy photons into electrons. The electrons are digitally recorded using custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designed by the NuSTAR [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] Focal Plane Team. Each pixel has an independent discriminator and individual X-ray interactions trigger the readout process. On-board processors, one for each telescope, identify the row and column with the largest pulse height and read out pulse height information from this pixel as well as its eight neighbors. The event time is recorded to an accuracy of 2 μs relative to the on-board clock. The event location, energy, and depth of interaction in the detector are computed from the nine-pixel signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rana |first1=Vikram |title=Development of focal plane detectors for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission |journal=Proc. SPIE |date=2009 |volume=7435 |doi=10.1117/12.825418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kitaguchi2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kitaguchi |first1=Takao |title=Spectral calibration and modeling of the NuSTAR CdZnTe pixel detectors |journal=Proc. SPIE |date=2011 |volume=8145 |doi=10.1117/12.896972|arxiv = 1109.0378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focal planes are shielded by [[cesium iodide]] (CsI) crystals that surround the detector housings. The crystal shields, grown by [[Saint-Gobain]], register high energy photons and cosmic rays which cross the focal plane from directions other than the along the NuSTAR optical axis. Such events are the primary background for NuSTAR and must be properly identified and subtracted in order to identify high energy photons from cosmic sources. The NuSTAR active shielding ensures that any CZT detector event coincident with an active shield event is ignored.

==Major scientific results==
[[File:Pointing X-ray Eyes at our Resident Supermassive Black Hole.jpg|thumb|NuSTAR has captured these first, focused views of the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in high-energy X-ray light.]]
NuSTAR has proven itself to be a versatile instrument and has opened up new discoveries in wide and varied areas of astrophysical research since it launch.

===Spin measurement of a supermassive black hole===
In February 2013, NASA revealed that NuSTAR, along with the [[XMM-Newton]] space observatory, has measured the spin rate of the [[supermassive black hole]] at the centre of the galaxy [[NGC 1365]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/nustar20130227.html |title=NASA's NuSTAR Helps Solve Riddle of Black Hole Spin |publisher=NASA |date=27 February 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracing radioactivity in a supernova remnant===
One of NuSTAR's main goals is to characterize stars' explosions by mapping the radioactive material in a [[supernova remnant]]. The NuSTAR map of [[Cassiopeia A]] shows the titanium-44 isotope concentrated in clumps at the remnant's center and points to a possible solution to the mystery of how the star exploded. When researchers simulate supernova blasts with computers, as a massive star dies and collapses, the main shock wave often stalls and the star fails to shatter. The latest findings strongly suggest the exploding star literally sloshed around, re-energizing the stalled shock wave and allowing the star to finally blast off its outer layers.&lt;ref name=CasANews&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA's NuSTAR Untangles Mystery of How Stars Explode |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-054 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |publisher=JPL |date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nearby supermassive black holes===
In January 2017, researchers from [[Durham University]] and the [[University of Southampton]], leading a coalition of agencies using NuSTAR data, announced the discovery of supermassive black holes at the center of nearby galaxies [[NGC 1448]] and [[IC 3639]].&lt;ref name="nasa20170107"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/black-holes-hide-in-our-cosmic-backyard |title=Black Holes Hide in Our Cosmic Backyard |publisher=NASA |first=Elizabeth |last=Landau |date=7 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annuar2017"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A New Compton-thick AGN in our Cosmic Backyard: Unveiling the Buried Nucleus in NGC 1448 with NuSTAR |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |first1=A. |last1=Annuar |first2=D.

'''Observado.org''' is a non-profit [[website]] which collects sightings in nature. Users can submit sightings regarding any area of fauna and flora, whereby administrators scrutinize these sightings. A forum is present where questions by observers can be posed and commented on by any user.

Observado.org was founded in 2005 as a sister site of Waarneming.nl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waarneming.nl&lt;/ref&gt; The founder was Stichting Natuurinformatie&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natuurinfo.nl/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; (Foundation nature data) Since its start over 8 million nature sightings have been collected featuring almost 300.000 pictures by alsmost 3.000 users and this number grows exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observado.org/statistiek.php statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of observado.org is to make available sightings of observers all around the world and help with knowledge on biodiversity. Not only citizen scientist, but also professional researchers share their data on this website. The website also exchanges data with international researchers. For example, sightings have been used by researchers of amongst others the Dutch Butterfly Association ([[Vlinderstichting]]) for surveys on dragonflies and butterflies for Europe and the mediterranean. Observers, e.g. birders, collect their own sightings and pictures made during field trips and holidays. Meanwhile, they feed the data that enable them to share their sightings, pictures with other users and ngo's. It is possible to submit sightings from just about any bird, mammal, insect or plant. The sightings and statistics are freely accessible for all users of the website. In order to avoid poaching some sightings have been made invisible for other users.

Observado.org provides an overview of all the biodiversity in the world. Screens like these will provide an insight into this diverse world of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;http://observado.org/soortgroep/all&lt;/ref&gt;

Observado.org is available in many languages among which English, German, Danish, Swedish, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Tsjech, Polish, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Thai and West-Frisian. For each country or continent a separate site has been made on which sightings, pictures and statistics.

Observado.org is maintained by volunteers. They add new functions and species and above all enforce quality control with respect to sightings. Missing species or bugs can be reported on the forum.&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.waarneming.nl/smf/index.php/board,108.0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observado.org on mobile devices==
Observado.org has got special software modules for mobile devices: [[WnPda]], [[WnSmart]] (both for Windows Mobile), [[ObsMapp]] (Android) and  [[iObs]] (iOS). These programs enable submitting sighting in the field on a [[PDA]]. Sightings can be submitted on-line directly or at the end of a trip to Observado.org. When submitting GPS position and time are registered as well the name of the species, the number and all sorts of features of the sighting.  For a correct time the timezone of the device should be correctly filled in.

For smartphones the website WebObs is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.webobs.org&lt;/ref&gt; Webobs also enables submitting sightings in the field. WebObs requires one of the following systems:
*BlackBerry 6+;
*Android 2+ (e.g. HTC, Samsung devices and tablets);
*IOS (Apple)|IOS (iPhone en iPad).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10430">The '''Olduvai theory''' states that [[industrial civilization]] (as defined by ''per capita'' [[energy]] production) will have a lifetime of less than or equal to 100 years (1930–2030).  The theory provides a quantitative basis of the transient-pulse-theory of modern civilization.  The name is a reference to the [[Olduvai Gorge]] in Tanzania.

== History ==
The Olduvai theory was introduced in 1989 by power system engineer [[Richard C. Duncan]] as the "transient-pulse theory of industrial civilization"&lt;ref name="transientpulse"&gt;[http://public.me.com/duncanrichardc OT_1989.pdf] - Duncan, R. C. (1989). Evolution, technology, and the natural environment: A [[unified theory]] of [[History of the world|human history]]. Proceedings of the Annual Meeting, American Society of Engineering Educators: Science, Technology, &amp; Society, 14B1-11 to 14B1-20. &lt;/ref&gt; with further details in the 1993 paper "The life-expectancy of industrial civilization: The decline to global equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, R. C. (1993). The life-expectancy of industrial civilization: The decline to global equilibrium. Population and Environment, 14(4), 325-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 1996, Duncan introduced a paper titled "The Olduvai Theory: Sliding Towards a Post-Industrial Stone Age" where the term "Olduvai Theory" replaced "transient-pulse theory" used in previous papers.&lt;ref name="dieoff125"&gt;[http://www.dieoff.org/page125.htm "The Olduvai Theory:Sliding Towards a Post-Industrial Stone Age] - Richard C. Duncan (1996), www.dieoff.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Duncan further updated his theory in "The Peak of World Oil Production and the Road to the Olduvai Gorge", at the Summit 2000 Pardee Keynote Symposium of the [[Geological Society of America]], on November 13, 2000.&lt;ref name="dieoff224"&gt;[http://dieoff.org/page224.htm "The Peak Of World Oil Production And The Road To The Olduvai Gorge"] - Richard C. Duncan (2000), www.dieoff.org&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Duncan extended his [[data set]] to include up to 2003 in "The Olduvai Theory Energy, Population, and Industrial Civilization".&lt;ref name="SocialContract"&gt;"[http://www.thesocialcontract.com/pdf/sixteen-two/xvi-2-93.pdf The Olduvai Theory Energy, Population, and Industrial Civilization]" - Richard C. Duncan (2005/2006), www.TheSocialContract.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details of theory ==
Industrial civilization is defined in Duncan's paper as the time between [[Energy development|energy production]] ''[[per capita]]'' rising above 37% of its eventual peak value, and it falling back below 37% of the peak value later. In 1996, he estimated this period to be from 1930 until approximately 2025, with the ''per capita'' peak having occurred in 1977.&lt;ref name="dieoff125"/&gt; In 2009, he considered separately the peaks of [[standard of living]] in [[OECD]] countries, non-OECD countries (specifically China, India and Brazil), and the USA. He found that the standard of living in the US peaked in 1973, that of OECD countries in 2005, while that of the non-OECD countries was still rising in 2007. He predicted a global peak in standard of living in 2010, followed by a decline to the 1930 level by 2030.&lt;ref name="SocialContract"/&gt;

The Olduvai theory claims that [[exponential growth]] of energy production ended in 1979, that [[Energy|energy use]] ''per capita'' will show no growth through 2008, and that after 2008 energy growth will become sharply negative, culminating, after a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], in a [[world population]] of 2 billion circa 2050. &lt;ref name="SocialContract"/&gt;

The Olduvai theory divides human history into three phases. The first "[[pre-industrial]]" phase stretches over most of human history when simple tools and weak machines limited [[economic growth]]. The second "industrial" phase encompasses modern industrial civilization where machines temporarily lift all [[Limits to Growth|limits to growth]]. The final "[[Deindustrialization|de-industrial]]" phase follows where industrial economies decline to a period of equilibrium with [[renewable resource]]s and the natural environment.&lt;ref name="dieoff224"/&gt;

The decline of the industrial phase is broken into three sections:
* The Olduvai slope (1979&amp;ndash;1999)—energy ''per capita'' 'declined at 0.33%/year'
* The Olduvai slide (2000&amp;ndash;2011)—'begins … with the escalating warfare in the Middle East… marks the all-time [[peak oil|peak of world oil production]]'.
* The Olduvai cliff (2012&amp;ndash;2030)—'begins … in 2012 when an epidemic of permanent blackouts spreads worldwide, i.e. first there are waves of brownouts and temporary blackouts, then finally the [[electric power]] networks themselves expire'. This is partly connected to fossil fuel production, as coal and natural gas are significant fuel sources in electricity generation, but it is unclear how nuclear power generation fails, if at all.

==Criticism==
===Data===
At the time of Duncan's paper, the peak in ''per capita'' energy consumption was 11.15 boe/c/yr ([[barrels of oil equivalent]] ''per capita'' per year) and occurred in 1979; however, since then energy use ''per capita'' has increased beyond that level, with 2006 providing a peak value of 12.12 boe/c/yr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1c.xls World Per Capita Total Primary Energy Consumption, 1980-2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013182222/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1c.xls |date=2006-10-13 }} - [[Energy Information Administration]], 2006 (Excel Sheet)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.uci.edu/~silverma/units.html Energy Units and Conversions] - Dennis Silverman, UC Irvine&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase directly contradicts Postulate 2 of the most recent version of the theory, namely that "''[average ''per capita'' energy] will show no growth from 1979 to circa 2008''".&lt;ref name="SocialContract"/&gt;  Duncan has responded to this criticism in a 2009 essay entitled The Olduvai Theory - Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living.&lt;ref name="SocialContract2009"&gt;[http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_19_4/tsc_19_4_duncan.shtml "The Olduvai Theory - Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living"] - Duncan, R. C. (2009), www.TheSocialContract.com&lt;/ref&gt; The response is that certain non-OPEC countries such as China and India have increased their ''per capita'' energy usage whilst efficiency improvements within the USA &amp; OPEC have reduced their requirements for energy without impacting the quality of life. The theory is then re-assessed from the standpoint OPEC, non-OPEC and USA energy consumption. 

Proponents note that the current trend of increasing ''per capita'' energy consumption may be difficult to sustain in the face of limits on [[fossil fuel]] resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoildrum.com/story/2006/3/6/135437/7111 Revisiting the Olduvai Theory] - The Oil Drum, March 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, advances in [[renewable energy]] have reduced dependence on fossil fuels. For example, in 2015 [[Sweden]] produced approximately 8,153 kWh of electricity per capita per year (5.01 boe/c/yr) from renewable resources, with the exclusion of hydropower; Sweden's theoretical maximum electric generation capacity from renewable resources, including hydropower, is estimated to be 24,472 kWh per capita per year (15.03 boe/c/yr) at the current population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Quote==
In justification of his reference to Olduvai Gorge, Duncan writes:&lt;ref&gt; Richard C. Duncan, ''World Energy Production, Population Growth, And the Road to the Olduvai Gorge,'' Institute on Energy and Man, As published in Population and Environment, May-June 2001, v. 22, n. 5.

&lt;blockquote&gt;…(1) it is famous for the myriad hominid fossils and stone tools discovered there, (2) I've been there, (3) its long hollow sound is eerie and ominous, and (4) it is a good metaphor for the 'Stone Age way of life'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much like [[disease]]s of humans and other animals, [[plant pathology|plant diseases]] occur due to pathogens such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[plant virus|viruses]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[oomycetes]], [[nematode]]s, [[phytoplasmas]], [[protozoa]], and [[parasitic plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Agrios"&gt;{{cite book| last =Agrios | first =George | authorlink = | title =Plant Pathology | publisher =Academic Press | year =2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-12-044565-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant disease epidemiologists strive for an understanding of the cause and effects of disease and develop strategies to intervene in situations where crop losses may occur.  Typically successful intervention will lead to a low enough level of disease to be acceptable, depending upon the value of the crop.

Plant disease epidemiology is often looked at from a multi-disciplinary approach, requiring [[biology|biological]], [[statistics|statistical]], [[agronomy|agronomic]] and [[ecology|ecological]] perspectives. Biology is necessary for understanding the pathogen and its life cycle.  It is also necessary for understanding the physiology of the crop and how the pathogen is adversely affecting it. Agronomic practices often influence disease incidence for better or for worse.  Ecological influences are numerous.  Native species of plants may serve as reservoirs for pathogens that cause disease in crops. [[Statistical model]]s are often applied in order to summarize and describe the complexity of plant disease epidemiology, so that disease processes can be more readily understood.&lt;ref name="Arneson"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Arneson | first =PA | authorlink = | title =Plant disease epidemiology: temporal aspects | journal =Plant Health Instructor | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher =American Phytopathological Society | location = | year =2001 | url =http://www.apsnet.org/education/AdvancedPlantPath/Topics/Epidemiology/Epidemiology.htm | doi =10.1094/PHI-A-2001-0524-01 | id = | accessdate = | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080223091912/http://www.apsnet.org/education/AdvancedPlantPath/Topics/Epidemiology/Epidemiology.htm | archivedate =2008-02-23 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madden"&gt;{{cite book| last =Madden | first =Laurence | authorlink = |author2=Gareth Hughes |author3=Frank Van Den Bosch  | title =Study of Plant Disease Epidemics | publisher =American Phytopathological Society | year =2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-89054-354-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, comparisons between patterns of disease progress for different diseases, cultivars, management strategies, or environmental settings can help in determining how plant diseases may best be managed.  [[Policy]] can be influential in the occurrence of diseases, through actions such as restrictions on imports from sources where a disease occurs.

In 1963 J. E. van der Plank published "Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control", a seminal work that created a theoretical framework for the study of the epidemiology of plant diseases.&lt;ref name="Drenth"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Drenth | first =A | authorlink = | title =Fungal epidemics&amp;nbsp;– does spatial structure matter?  | journal =New Phytologist | volume =163 | issue = 1| pages = 4–7| publisher =Blackwells | location = | year =2004 | url =http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01116.x| doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01116.x| id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book provides a theoretical framework based on experiments in many different host pathogen systems and moved the study of plant disease epidemiology forward rapidly, especially for fungal foliar pathogens.  Using this framework we can now model and determine thresholds for epidemics that take place in a homogeneous environment such as a mono-cultural crop field.&lt;ref name="Drenth" /&gt;

== Elements of an epidemic ==

Disease epidemics in plants can cause huge losses in yield of crops as well threatening to wipe out an entire [[species]] such as was the case with [[Dutch Elm Disease]] and could occur with [[Sudden Oak Death]]. An epidemic of potato late blight, caused by ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'', led to the [[The Great Hunger|Great Irish Famine]] and the loss of many lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine, University College Dublin, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-9045-5858-3}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly the elements of an epidemic are referred to as the “disease triangle”: a susceptible host, pathogen, and conducive environment.&lt;ref name="Agrios" /&gt;  For a disease to occur all three of these must be present.  Below is an illustration of this point.  Where all three items meet, there is a disease.  The fourth element missing from this illustration for an epidemic to occur is time.  As long as all three of these elements are present disease can initiate, an epidemic will only ensue if all three continue to be present.  Anyone of the three might be removed from the equation though.  The host might out-grow susceptibility as with high-temperature adult-plant resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Shultz | first =T.R | authorlink = | author2 =Line, R.F | title =High-Temperature, Adult-Plant Resistance to Wheat Stripe Rust and Effects on Yield Components | journal =Agronomy Journal | volume =84 | issue =2 | pages =170–175 | publisher =American Society of Agronomy | location = | year =1992 | url =http://agron.scijournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/2/170 | doi =10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400020009x | id = | accessdate = }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the environment changes and is not conducive for the pathogen to cause disease, or the pathogen is controlled through a fungicide application for instance.

Sometimes a fourth factor of [[time]] is added as the time at which a particular infection occurs, and the length of time conditions remain viable for that infection, can also play an important role in epidemics.&lt;ref name="Agrios" /&gt;   The age of the plant species can also play a role, as certain species change in their levels of disease resistance as they mature; in a process known as ontogenic resistance.&lt;ref name="Agrios" /&gt;

If all of the criteria are not met, such as a susceptible host and pathogen are present, but the environment is not conducive to the pathogen infecting and causing disease, a disease cannot occur.  For example, corn is planted into a field with corn residue that has the fungus ''Cercospora zea-maydis'', the causal agent of [[Grey leaf spot]] of corn, but if the weather is too dry, and there is no leaf wetness the [[spore]]s of the fungus in the residue cannot germinate and initiate infection.

Likewise, it stands to reason if the host is susceptible and the environment favours the development of disease but the pathogen is not present there is no disease.  Taking the example above, the corn is planted into a ploughed field where there is no corn residue with the fungus ''Cercospora zea-maydis'', the causal agent of [[Grey leaf spot]] of corn, present but the weather means extended periods of leaf wetness, there is no infection initiated.

When a pathogen requires a vector to be spread then for an epidemic to occur the vector must be plentiful and active.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Types of epidemics ===

Pathogens cause monocyclic epidemics with a low [[birth rate]] and [[death rate]], meaning they only have one infection cycle per season. They are typical of soil-borne diseases such as [[Fusarium wilt]] of [[flax]]. Polycyclic epidemics are caused by pathogens capable of several infection cycles a season. They are most often caused by airborne diseases such as [[powdery mildew]]. [[Bimodal]] polycyclic epidemics can also occur. For example, in [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]] of [[stone fruit]]s the [[blossom]]s and the [[fruit]]s are infected at different times.

For some diseases it is important to consider the disease occurrence over several growing seasons, especially if growing the crops in [[monoculture]] year after year or growing [[perennial plant]]s. Such conditions can mean that the [[wikt:inoculum|inoculum]] produced in one season can be carried over to the next leading to a build of inoculum over the years. In the [[tropics]] there are no clear-cut breaks between growing seasons as there are in [[temperate]] regions and this can lead to accumulation of inoculum.

Epidemics that occur under these conditions are referred to as ''polyetic'' epidemics and can be caused by both monocyclic and polycyclic pathogens. Apple powdery mildew is an example of a polyetic epidemic caused by a polycyclic pathogen and Dutch Elm disease a polyetic epidemic caused by a monocyclic pathogen.

== Employment ==

Plant disease epidemiologists are typically employed as researchers by universities, or governmental institutions such as the [[USDA]].  However, private companies in agricultural fields also employ epidemiologists.

{{for|the Philip K. Dick story|Project Plowshare}}
The '''Plowshares Project''' is a [[Peace Studies]] collaborative between [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]], [[Earlham College]] and [[Goshen College]] in [[Indiana]].

==History==
The Plowshares Project was formed in 2002, and is funded by a four-year grant from [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. The project defines its mission and goals by the religious ethos of the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Society of Friends]], and [[Mennonite Church USA]].

==Purpose==
Plowshares was initiated to enrich the Peace Studies programs at Manchester, Earlham, and Goshen colleges. The program facilitates channels of discussion, and seeks to uphold the peacemaking traditions of the colleges' [[peace churches|founding churches]].

==Declared goals==
With the Lilly grant, the Plowshares Program intends to:
*''Further Expand Peace Studies Programs''—by creating an international resource for peace studies education, strengthening educators, and offering grants for student research.
*''Unification of Peace Studies Courses''—through discussion and program development by founding schools.
*''Increase Awareness of Peace Studies and Related Issues''—by creating a community presence to inform respective communities and nation of happenings and to distinguish Indiana as a strong base for peace studies.

==Peace House==
The Peace House is the main outlet for community involvement for the Plowshares Project. Located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the house serves as a hub for undergraduate students from any US college or university, and in any major, to become directly involved in the fields of peace and justice. 

The Peace House provides semester-long residence for students pursuing internships with Indianapolis companies and organizations who are involved or concerned with peace and justice issues. There is also a nine-week summer intensive available for students. 

===Fall and spring semesters===
During the regular semester, students at the Peace House take two Peace Studies courses taught by adjunct faculty. From the Plowshares website:
*''Introduction to Urban Peace and Justice Issues''— combined with an introduction to the city of Indianapolis
*''Peacemaking in Practice''—focusing on "self-reflection, strategic planning and practical skills for non-violent social change&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;"

====Internship====
The internship session mediated by Peace House allows for '''up to''' 20 hours of work per week under the supervision of the Peace House director; the work grants up to six credit hours. 

===Summer session===
The nine-week summer session operates without the class work, but still facilitates a full-time internship. The student may work up to 40 hours per week with a selected organization, and may still earn up to six credit hours. During the summer, students may also reside at the Peace House without earning college credit.

[[File:Taurus-littrow-valley.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Labeled aerial photo of the Taurus–Littrow valley (north is at the bottom).]]

'''Taurus–Littrow''' is a [[Moon|lunar]] [[valley]] located on the [[Near side of the Moon|near side]] at the coordinates {{Lunar coords and quad cat|20.0|N|31.0|E|globe:Moon}}. It served as the landing site for the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo 17]] mission in December 1972, the last manned mission to the Moon to date.&lt;ref name=alsj&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.site.html|work= Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal |title=The Valley of Taurus-Littrow |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=7 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/5881?__fsk=-350546068 |work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature            |title= Taurus-Littrow Valley |publisher=International Astronomical Union |accessdate=7 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The valley is located on the southeastern edge of [[Mare Serenitatis]] along a ring of [[mountains]] formed between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago when a large object impacted the Moon, forming the Serenitatis basin and pushing rock outward and upward. Taurus–Littrow is located in the [[Montes Taurus|Taurus mountain range]] and south of [[Littrow (crater)|Littrow crater]], features after which the valley received its name. The valley's name, coined by the Apollo 17 crew, was eventually approved by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=alsj/&gt;

Data collected on Apollo 17 show that the valley is composed primarily of [[feldspar]]-rich [[breccia]] in the large [[massif]]s surrounding the valley and [[basalt]] underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of [[regolith]], or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolfe |last2=Lucchitta |last3=Reed |last4=Ulrich |last5=Sanchez |title=Geology of the Taurus-Littrow valley floor|journal=Lunar Science Conference, 6th|year=1975|volume=3|pages=2463–2482|bibcode=1975LPSC....6.2463W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taurus–Littrow was selected as the Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling [[Lunar highlands|highland]] material and young [[Volcano|volcanic]] material in the same location.&lt;ref name=lpi&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/landing_site/ |title=Apollo 17 Landing Site Overview |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |accessdate=7 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==

===Formation and geography===

Several million years after the formation of the Serenitatis basin, [[lava]]s began to upwell from the Moon's interior, filling the basin and forming what is now known as Mare Serenitatis. As a result of these lavas, rock and soil samples from the area that were collected by Apollo 17 astronauts [[Eugene Cernan]] and [[Harrison Schmitt]] gave insight to the natural history and [[Lunar geologic timescale|geologic timeline of the Moon]].&lt;ref name=alsj/&gt;
[[File:AS17-140-21493+AS17-140-21497.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] is seen next to a large [[Tracy's Rock|boulder]] in the Taurus–Littrow valley on the [[Apollo 17]] mission in 1972. The South massif is visible to the right.]]

Somewhere between 100 and 200 million years after the Serenitatis basin and Taurus–Littrow formed, the lavas that began to seep through the lunar [[Crust (geology)|crust]] began to flood the low-lying areas.&lt;ref name=alsj /&gt; These lava flows were often accompanied by fire fountains that blanketed the surrounding area with tiny glass beads. These beads were sometimes colored orange, explaining the orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts at [[Shorty (crater)|Shorty crater]]. Most of these beads, however, were darkly colored, resulting in the dark appearance of Mare Serenitatis from Earth.&lt;ref name=alsj/&gt;

[[File:Apollo 17 orange soil.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of the orange soil discovered on Apollo 17, the result of volcanic glass beads.]]

The valley itself is elongated along an axis that points toward the center of Mare Serenitatis.&lt;ref name=alsj /&gt; Large massifs are located on either side of the valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other.&lt;ref name=alsj /&gt; The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the [[Grand Canyon]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.landing.html |title=Landing at Taurus-Littrow |work= Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=7 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]], [[New Mexico]]. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a [[Fault scarp|scarp]] cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.&lt;ref name=alsj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Head|first=James|title=Morphology and structure of the taurus-littrow highlands (Apollo 17): evidence for their origin and evolution|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|volume=9|issue=3-4|pages=355–395|year=1974|doi=10.1007/BF00562579|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t5p8k7628qj46xp6/|accessdate=30 August 2010|bibcode=1974Moon....9..355H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Apollo 17 observations, the valley floor is generally a gently rolling plane. Boulders of various sizes and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley. At the [[ALSEP]] lunar experiment deployment area, located west of the immediate landing site, the boulders average about four meters in size and are higher in concentration than in other areas of the valley.&lt;ref name="profpaper"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bailey |last2=Lucchitta |last3=Muehlberger |last4=Scott |last5=Sutton |last6=Wilshire |title=The Geologic Investigation of the Taurus-Littrow Valley: Apollo 17 Landing Site  |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17profpaper.htm|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]] impact, which occurred between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed [[secondary crater]] clusters in various locations of the Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed as a result of said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange [[ejecta blanket]], or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed as a result of an avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

===Composition===
Evidence from the Apollo 17 mission shows that the massifs surrounding the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, a result of the lava flows during the valley's history. [[Seismic]] studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2&amp;nbsp;feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low [[albedo]], or reflectivity, is a direct result of the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of [[plagioclase]], but also contain amounts of [[clinopyroxene]] and other [[minerals]].&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

The unconsolidated regolith layer on the valley floor has a thickness of about {{convert|14|m|ft}} and contains ejecta from many impacts, most notably Tycho. This enabled samples to be retrieved from this impact without having to visit the crater itself. The possibility that some craters in the valley could be secondary impacts of Tycho created further opportunities for sampling ejecta from that impact.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

There are several geologic deposits on the valley floor originating from several different events in the geologic timeline of the Moon. One of these formations, the light mantle, is a deposit of lightly colored material in a series of projections extending about six&amp;nbsp;kilometres (3.7&amp;nbsp;mi) from the south massif across the floor. Pre-mission analyses suggested that this deposit might be the result of an avalanche originating from the northern slope of the south massif. Post-mission analysis of samples of the material show that it is primarily composed of fine-grained material and scattered rock fragments that were presumably spread across the valley floor from the south massif at some point. Evidence from samples and visual observations taken during Apollo 17 show that the light mantle varies in thickness throughout the valley. Craters located farther away from the south massif penetrate through the light mantle to darker underlying material. Meanwhile, craters close to the south massif as wide as {{convert|75|m|ft}} do not appear to penetrate to darker material at all. The age of this formation is estimated to be about the same as the central crater cluster, or about 70–95 million years old.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

[[Troctolite 76535]], a [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] [[troctolite]] composed primarily of [[olivine]] and [[plagioclase]] was recovered in the valley as part of a rake sample. The sample has been called the most interesting to be returned from the Moon.&lt;ref name="t76535"&gt;{{cite web|title=76535 Trocolite|url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/76535.pdf|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sample has been the subject of [[Thermochronology|thermochronological]] calculations in order to determine whether the Moon ever generated a [[Dynamo theory|core dynamo]] or formed a metallic [[Planetary core|core]].&lt;ref name="lunarmagnetism"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garrick-Bethell|first=Ian |last2=Weiss |last3=Shuster |last4=Buz |title=Early Lunar Magnetism|journal=Science|date=January 2009|volume=323|issue=5912|pages=356–359|doi=10.1126/science.1166804|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5912/356|accessdate=25 November 2010|pmid=19150839|bibcode = 2009Sci...323..356G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocks sampled in the immediate vicinity of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] are mostly [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]] coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well.

==Landing site selection==
As Apollo 17 was the final lunar mission of the [[Apollo program]], several different scientific objectives were identified in order to maximize the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] crater, [[Tsiolkovskiy (crater)|Tsiolkovskiy]] crater on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]], among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

Taurus–Littrow was eventually selected with the objectives of sampling ancient highland material and young volcanic material in the same landing site. The Taurus–Littrow site offered both of these in the form of highland material in the Tycho ejecta sampled and the prospect that some of the craters in the area could be volcanic vents.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

{{about||biological taxonomy|Taxonomy (biology)|other uses|Taxonomy (disambiguation)}}

'''Taxonomy''' is the practice and science of classification. The word is also used as a [[count noun]]: '''a taxonomy''', or '''taxonomic scheme''', is a particular [[categorization|classification]]. The word finds its roots in the [[Greek language]] {{Lang|grc|τάξις}}, ''taxis'' (meaning 'order', 'arrangement') and {{Lang|grc|νόμος}}, ''nomos'' ('law' or 'science'). Originally, ''taxonomy'' referred only to the classification of organisms or a particular classification of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification. Taxonomy is different from [[meronomy]] which is dealing with the classification of parts of a whole.

Many taxonomies have a [[hierarchical]] structure, but this is not a requirement. Taxonomy uses taxonomic units, known as '''taxa''' (singular [[taxon]]).

==Applications==
Wikipedia categories illustrate a taxonomy&lt;ref&gt;Zirn, Cäcilia, Vivi Nastase and Michael Strube. 2008. [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140111074556/http://www.h%2Dits.org/english/research/nlp/papers/zirn08.pdf "Distinguishing Between Instances and Classes in the Wikipedia Taxonomy"] [http://videolectures.net/eswc08_zirn_dbi/ (video lecture).] 5th Annual [[European Semantic Web Conference]] (ESWC 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and a full taxonomy of Wikipedia categories can be extracted by automatic means.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ponzetto and M. Strube. 2007. [https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-228.pdf "Deriving a large scale taxonomy from Wikipedia"]. Proc. of the 22nd Conference on the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, pp. 1440-1445.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, it has been shown that a manually-constructed taxonomy, such as that of computational lexicons like [[WordNet]], can be used to improve and restructure the Wikipedia category taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ponzetto, R. Navigli. 2009. [http://ijcai.org/papers09/Papers/IJCAI09-343.pdf "Large-Scale Taxonomy Mapping for Restructuring and Integrating Wikipedia"]. Proc. of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2009), Pasadena, California, pp. 2083-2088.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense, taxonomy also applies to relationship schemes other than parent-child hierarchies, such as [[Network (mathematics)|network structure]]s. Taxonomies may then include single children with multi-parents, for example, "Car" might appear with both parents "Vehicle" and "Steel Mechanisms"; to some however, this merely means that 'car' is a part of several different taxonomies.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Joab. [http://gcn.com/Articles/2004/02/03/Taxonomys-not-just-design-its-an-art.aspx?Page=1&amp;p=1 "Taxonomy's not just design, it's an art,"] ''Government Computer News'' (Washington, D.C.). September 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A taxonomy might also simply be organization of kinds of things into groups, or an alphabetical list; here, however, the term vocabulary is more appropriate. In current usage within [[knowledge management]], taxonomies are considered narrower than [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]] since ontologies apply a larger variety of relation types.&lt;ref&gt;Suryanto, Hendra and Paul Compton. [http://ol2000.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/final/HSuryanto_5.pdf "Learning classification taxonomies from a classification knowledge based system."] [[University of Karlsruhe]]; [http://www.greenchameleon.com/gc/blog_detail/defining_taxonomy/ "Defining 'Taxonomy',"] Straights Knowledge website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, a hierarchical taxonomy is a [[tree structure]] of classifications for a given set of objects. It is also named [[containment hierarchy]]. At the top of this structure is a single classification, the root node, that applies to all objects. Nodes below this root are more specific classifications that apply to subsets of the total set of classified objects. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the general to the more specific.

By contrast, in the context of legal terminology, an open-ended contextual taxonomy is employed—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context. In scenarios taken from the legal domain, a formal account of the open-texture of legal terms is modeled, which suggests varying notions of the "core" and "penumbra" of the meanings of a concept. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the specific to the more general.&lt;ref&gt;Grossi, Davide, [[Frank Dignum]] and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9yj2lfa5cy67c78m/fulltext.pdf?page=1 "Contextual Taxonomies" in ''Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems,'' pp. 33-51].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[cultural anthropology|Anthropologists]] have observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. Perhaps the most well-known and influential study of [[folk taxonomy|folk taxonomies]] is [[Émile Durkheim]]'s ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life''. A more recent treatment of folk taxonomies (including the results of several decades of empirical research) and the discussion of their relation to the scientific taxonomy can be found in [[Scott Atran]]'s ''Cognitive Foundations of Natural History.'' Folk taxonomies of organisms have been found in large part to agree with scientific classification, at least for the larger and more obvious species, which means that it is not the case that folk taxonomies are based purely on utilitarian characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution, Order and Complexity|author1=Kenneth Boulding |author2=Elias Khalil |publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=9780203013151|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N-OUCDi8SS8C&amp;dq=Durkheim+folk+taxonomy}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century the German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]], following the work of the thirteenth-century Majorcan philosopher [[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ramon Llull]] on his ''Ars generalis ultima'', a system for procedurally generating concepts by combining a fixed set of ideas, sought to develop an [[alphabet of human thought]]. Leibniz intended his ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' to be an "algebra" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. The concept of creating such a "[[universal language]]" was frequently examined in the 17th century, also notably by the English philosopher [[John Wilkins]] in his work ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668), from which the classification scheme in [[Peter Mark Roget|Roget]]'s [[Thesaurus]] ultimately derives.

==Use of taxonomies in various disciplines==
=== Taxonomies in software engineering ===
Vegas et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vegas|first1=S.|title=Maturing software engineering knowledge through classifications: A case study on unit testing techniques.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|date=2009|volume=35|issue=4|pages=551–565|doi=10.1109/TSE.2009.13|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4775907/}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a compelling case to advance the knowledge in the field of software engineering through the use of taxonomies. Similarly, Ore et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ore|first1=S.|title=Critical success factors taxonomy for software process deployment|journal=Software quality journal|date=2014|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21-48|doi=10.1007/s11219-012-9190-y|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11219-012-9190-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a systematic methodology to approach taxonomy building in software engineering related topics.

==== Software testing taxonomies ====
Several taxonomies have been proposed in software testing research to classify techniques, tools, concepts and artifacts. The following are some example taxonomies: 
# A taxonomy of model-based testing techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Utting|first1=Mark|title=A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches|journal=Software Testing, Verification &amp; Reliability|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=297-312|doi=10.1002/stvr.456|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2344870}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A taxonomy of static-code analysis tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=Jernej|title=Taxonomy of static code analysis tools|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd international convention MIPRO|pages=418-422|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/5512516/5533310/05533417.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engström et al.&lt;ref name="EngstromPAB16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engström|first1=Emelie|title=SERP-test: a taxonomy for supporting industry–academia communication|journal=Software Quality Journal|date=2016|pages=1-37|doi=10.1007/s11219-016-9322-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-016-9322-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest and evaluate the use of a taxonomy to bridge the communication between researchers and practitioners engaged in the area of software testing. They have also developed a web-based tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://serpconnect.cs.lth.se/|title=SERP-connect}}&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate and encourage the use the taxonomy. The tool and its source code are available for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engstrom|first1=Emelie|url=https://github.com/emenlu/connect|title=SERP-connect backend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomies in research publishing ===
Citing inadequacies with current practices in listing authors of papers in medical research journals, Drummond Rennie and co-authors called in a 1997 article in ''JAMA'', the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' for 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''a radical conceptual and systematic change, to reﬂect the realities of multiple authorship and to buttress accountability. We propose dropping the outmoded notion of author in favor of the more useful and realistic one of contributor.''&lt;ref name="CRediT"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brand |first1=Amy |last2=Allen |first2=Liz |last3=Altman |first3=Micah |last4=Hlava |first4=Marjorie |last5=Scott |first5=Jo |title=Beyond authorship: attribution, contribution, collaboration, and credit |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1087/20150211 |website=Wiley Online Library |publisher=Learned Publishing 28 (2) |accessdate=13 June 2018 |ref=CRediT |format=online |doi=10.1087/20150211|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}}  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since 2012, several major academic and scientific publishing bodies have mounted ''Project CRediT'' to develop a [[controlled vocabulary]] of contributor roles.&lt;ref name="CASRAI_CRediT"&gt;{{cite web |title=CRediT |url=http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT |website=CASRAI |publisher=[[CASRAI]] |accessdate=13 June 2018 |ref=CASRAI_CRediT |format=online |date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as ''[[CRediT]] (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)'', this is an example of a flat, non-hierarchical taxonomy; however, it does include an optional, broad classification of the degree of contribution: ''lead'', ''equal'' or ''supporting''.  [[Amy Brand]] and co-authors summarise their intended outcome as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Identifying specific contributions to published research will lead to appropriate credit, fewer author disputes, and fewer disincentives to collaboration and the sharing of data and code. &lt;ref name="CRediT"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As of mid-2018, this taxonomy apparently restricts its scope to ''research outputs'', specifically journal articles; however, it does rather unusually "hope to … support identification of peer reviewers".&lt;ref name="CASRAI_CRediT" /&gt;  (As such, it has not yet defined terms for such roles as editor or author of a chapter in a ''book'' of research results.)  Version 1, established by the first Working Group in the (northern) autumn of 2014, identifies 14 specific contributor roles using the following defined terms:
*Conceptualization 
*Methodology 
*Software 
*Validation 
*Formal Analysis 
*Investigation
*Resources 
*Data curation 
*Writing – Original Draft 
*Writing – Review &amp; Editing 
*Visualization 
*Supervision 
*Project Administration 
*Funding acquisition 

Reception has been mixed, with several major publishers and journals planning to have implemented CRediT by the end of 2018, whilst almost as many aren't persuaded of the need or value of using it.  For example,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] has created a ''TACS (Transparency in Author Contributions in Science)'' webpage to list the journals that commit to setting authorship standards, defining responsibilities for corresponding authors, requiring ORCID iDs, and adopting the CRediT taxonomy.&lt;ref name="NAS_TACS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Transparency in Author Contributions in Science (TACS) |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/Transparency_Author_Contributions.html |website=National Academy of Sciences |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=13 June 2018 |ref=NAS_TACS |format=online |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same webpage has a table listing 21 journals (or families of journals), of which:
* 5 have, or by end 2018 will have, implemented CRediT,
* 6 require an author contribution statement and suggest using CRediT,
* 8 don't use CRediT, of which 3 give reasons for not doing so, and
* 2 are uninformative.

The taxonomy is an open standard conforming to the [[OpenStand]] principles&lt;ref name="OpenStand"&gt;{{cite web |title=OpenStand |url=https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/ |website=OpenStand |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is published under a [[Creative Commons]] licence.&lt;ref name="CASRAI_CRediT" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

=== '''Taxonomy for the web''' ===
Websites with a good designed taxonomy or hierarchy is easily understood by users, due to their possibility to develop a mental model of the site structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/86110226|title=Information architecture for the World Wide Web|last=Peter.|first=Morville,|date=2007|publisher=O'Reilly|others=Rosenfeld, Louis., Rosenfeld, Louis.|isbn=9780596527341|edition=3rd ed|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=86110226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== '''Guidelines for writing taxonomy for the web:''' ====

* Mutually exclusive categories can be beneficial. If categories appear several places, it’s called cross-listing or polyhierarchical. The hierarchy will lose its value if cross-listing appears too often. Cross-listing often appears when working with ambiguous categories that fits more than one place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Having a balance between breadth and depth in the taxonomy is beneficial. Too many options (breadth), will overload the users by giving them too many choices. At the same time having a too narrow structure, with more than two or three levels to click-through, will make users frustrated and might give up.  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==Is-a and has-a relationships==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
Two of the predominant types of relationships in [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge-representation]] systems are [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]] and the universally quantified [[Indicative conditional|conditional]]. Predication relationships express the notion that an individual entity is an example of a certain type (for example, ''John is a bachelor''), while universally quantified conditionals express the notion that a type is a subtype of another type (for example, ''A dog is a mammal'', which means the same as ''All dogs are mammals'').&lt;ref name=Brachman&gt;[[Ronald J. Brachman]]; [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/journals/computer/Brachman83 What IS-A is and isn't. An Analysis of Taxonomic Links in Semantic Networks].

'''''The Voyage of the Mimi''''' is a thirteen-episode American educational [[television program]] depicting the crew of the ship ''Mimi'' exploring the ocean and taking a census of [[humpback whale]]s.&lt;ref name="olds_pg55"&gt;{{citation |url=//books.google.com/books?id=GJi2VJZ5tU4C&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=%22voyage%20of%20the%20mimi%22&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=%22voyage%20of%20the%20mimi%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-86656-559-2 |title=The Computer as an Educational Tool |year=1986 |author=Olds, Henry F. |publisher=Psychology Press (retrieved via Google Books) |accessdate=2010-11-07 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS (Public Broadcasting Service)]] and was created by the [[Bank Street College of Education]] in 1984&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt; to teach middle-schoolers about [[science]] and [[mathematics]] in an interesting and interactive way, where every lesson related to real world applications. 

The series was also released on [[VHS]] and as a [[LaserDisc]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goenc.com/records/record_generator.asp?encnum=001072 |title=goENC.com : Record for ENC#001072 (Explore and discover) |date=2005-07-27 |publisher=ENC Learning Inc. |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the series was released in digital form via [[iTunes U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/BankStreetLib/status/499625030196944896 |title=From the Archives to your screen-you can stream/download The Voyage of the Mimi (+other goodies) on our iTunesU page &lt;nowiki&gt;https://t.co/YlXK8lerLT&lt;/nowiki&gt; |publisher=[[Twitter]] |author=Bank Street Library |date=2014-08-13 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
After a segment of a fictional adventure in the first part of each episode, a corresponding "expedition documentary" taught viewers something scientific relating to plot events in the previous episode of the show.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="olds_pg56"&gt;{{citation |url=//books.google.com/books?id=GJi2VJZ5tU4C&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=%22voyage%20of%20the%20mimi%22&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=%22voyage%20of%20the%20mimi%22&amp;f=false |title=The Computer as an Educational Tool |year=1986 |author=Olds, Henry F. |publisher=Psychology Press (retrieved via Google Books) |isbn=978-0-86656-559-2 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is an episode where the plot is about obtaining drinkable water,&lt;ref name="WPTV_p2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvpt4learning.org/itv/PDF/voyage.pdf |year=1984 |publisher=[[WVPT]] |accessdate=2011-01-17 |title=THE VOYAGE OF THE MIMI |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the course of the episode, the viewer is also given lessons about [[condensation]], [[heat]], and the three [[states of matter]]. Each lesson has accompanying student and teacher handouts or worksheets.&lt;ref name="olds_pg55"/&gt; Four software modules are available that covered topics and skills in navigation and map reading, computer literacy and programming, the elements of ecosystems, and the natural environment of whales.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_1984-08-07"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fiske |first=Edward |date=1984-08-07 |title=EDUCATION; COMBINING TV, BOOKS, COMPUTERS |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2014-09-17 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/07/science/education-combining-tv-books-computers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Means |first1=Barbara |last2=Olson |first2=Kerry |date=1997-01-01 |title=Technology and Education Reform: Studies of Education Reform |publisher=Diane Publishing Co.

''The Voyage of the Mimi'' was shot in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]] with some scenes being shot on Dyer Island, Maine. It marked [[Ben Affleck]]'s television debut role.&lt;ref name="mental_floss_facts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt;

A second series was produced in 1988, ''[[The Second Voyage of the Mimi]]'', in which the two Granvilles, along with other archaeologists, searched for a lost [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] city and uncovered a conspiracy along the way. Both series emphasized equal opportunity in math and science with a diverse cast (including race, gender, and disability status)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bold Ventures: Volume 2 Case Studies of U.S. Innovations in Science Education |last1=Raizen |first1=Senta |last2=Britton |first2=Edward |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |year=1997 |pages=412–413 |url=//books.google.com/books?id=AfKlClYU91oC&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA412#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated an instructional strategy wherein the fictionalized adventure would catch the interest of students for the initial part of the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bold Ventures: Volume 2 Case Studies of U.S. Innovations in Science Education |last1=Raizen |first1=Senta |last2=Britton |first2=Edward |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |year=1997 |page=414 |url=//books.google.com/books?id=AfKlClYU91oC&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA412#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third series, which would have been about the [[Mississippi River]], including the river's biology and history, was planned but was not made due to an inability to obtain funding.&lt;ref name="mental_floss_facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=30 Fun Facts About 'The Voyage of the Mimi' |publisher=[[Mental Floss]] |author=McCarthy, Erin |accessdate=2014-11-26 |date=2014-09-29 |archivedate=2014-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013100040/http://mentalfloss.com/article/59121/30-fun-facts-about-voyage-mimi |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/59121/30-fun-facts-about-voyage-mimi |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
Ben Affleck played C.T. Granville and [[Peter G. Marston]] played his grandfather Captain Granville.

Cast Listing:
*[[Ben Affleck]] as Clement Tyler (C.T.) Granville
*[[Peter G. Marston]] as Captain Clement Tyler Granville
*Edwin De Asis as Ramon Rojas
*Victoria Gadsden as Anne Abrams
*Mark Graham as Arthur Spencer
*Judy Pratt as Sally Ruth Cochran
*Mary Tanner as Rachel Fairbanks

Film Crew Listing:
*Barbara Hanania, Assistant Cinematographer

*Eric Taylor, Sound

==Episodes==
Each episode consists of two fifteen-minute segments: the fictional story, then an expedition that reveals the fact behind the fiction.

The first segment of each episode follows a serialized tale of scientists taking a census of humpback whales off the coast of Massachusetts. Captain Clement Tyler Granville, the owner of the sailboat Mimi is hired by scientist Anne Abrams and her colleague Ramon Rojas to make the census. Anne's Graduate Research Assistant is Sally Ruth Cochran. In addition, the two scientists each invite a high school student (Arthur Spencer and Rachel Fairbanks) to take part in the study. Finally, Captain Granville's identically-named grandson comes visiting for the summer in order to give his mother a break during her pregnancy.

Each second segment is a standalone exploration of one of the scientific principles touched on in the serialized tale.&lt;ref name="olds_pg56"/&gt; In these segments, an actor (Ben Affleck, Mark Graham, or Mary Tanner) portraying a young person comes out of character and interviews a real, in many cases well-known, scientist about his or her work. These scientists include oceanographer [[Sylvia Earle]], geologist Kim Kastens, zoologist [[Katharine Payne]], Greg Watson of the [[New Alchemy Institute]], and physicist [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes_1984-08-07" /&gt;

In addition, Judy Pratt, a deaf student at [[Gallaudet University]], and Peter Marston, a scientist at [[M.I.T.]], come out of character in interviews with Mary Tanner and Ben Affleck at their respective workplaces.

==The real ''Mimi''==

===Beginnings===
The Mimi is a French-built sailboat that is 72 feet (21 meters) in length,&lt;ref name="WPTV_p1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvpt4learning.org/itv/PDF/voyage.pdf |year=1984 |publisher=[[WVPT]] |accessdate=2011-01-17 |title=THE VOYAGE OF THE MIMI |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally built in 1934 to function as a deep-hulled cargo barge.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt; She was built in northwest France in the region of [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], on the coast of the [[Mer d'Iroise]] (the Iroise Sea). Mimi is a type of vessel known as a "[[Gabare d'Iroise]]," where "[[Gabare]]" translates as "cargo barge" and "[[Iroise]]" refers to the region in which she was constructed.

Mimi was initially used as a cargo ship in the rough waters of the [[North Sea]], and was thus built to withstand serious maritime conditions. Because Mimi was a "gabare," she was also built with a shallow draft. This combination of strength and ability to operate in shallow waters allowed Mimi to be used both in the open sea and the extensive canal system in Europe at that time.

After serving many years in the Northern part of France, Mimi was sold to an owner in the Southern part of France where she was converted to a [[fishing trawler]] for [[tunafish]].&lt;ref name="WPTV_p1"/&gt;

===Nazi commandeer, sinking and salvage===
&lt;!-- According to owners George and Alan Story, during the [[Nazi]] occupation of France during the Second World War, Mimi was commandeered by Nazi forces and used as a shallow-water supply ship in Western France.--&gt;The Mimi was used by German soldiers during the Second World War to transport munitions.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt; In 1942, the Germans seized the Mimi for the purpose of transporting supplies to military outposts in the region of the Brittany coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Nashua Telegraph]] |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NTGB&amp;p_theme=ntgb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no&amp;p_text_search-0=voyage%20of%20the%20mimi%20nazi&amp;s_dispstring=All |author=Fischel, Josh |date=2009-07-05 |title=Educational Voyage 'The Voyage of the Mimi' released 25 years ago |page=D10 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Allied Forces pushed the retreating Axis forces back eastward through France in August 1944, Nazi protocol was to destroy any military property that might possibly be used against them by the invading forces (i.e. fortresses, ammunition, vehicles, etc.) For reasons unknown, Mimi was not destroyed by retreating Nazi forces, but rather left tied to a tree on a mudflat. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After the war the Mimi was sunk, and remained so until the 1960s when a Frenchman and his family bought it and converted it from a trawler to a sailboat.&lt;ref name="mental_floss_facts"/&gt;

===Television career===
By 1984, the Mimi had a new owner, Peter Marston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//news.google.com/newspapers?id=GOwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hHQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2338%2C237558 |title=The MIMI docks at Captain's Cove in October |author=Carroll, Susan |date=1988-09-01 |publisher=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]] (retrieved via Google News archives) |accessdate=2012-09-02 |page=8A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was kept moored in Gloucester, Massachusetts, throughout the filming of the series and thereafter. In addition to its role in "The Voyage of the Mimi," which began in 1984, the boat was used from the late 1980s through the 1990s to teach schoolchildren using the ''Mimi'' curriculum.&lt;ref name="stellwagen_soundings" /&gt; Each school year, the Mimi sailed from New England to the Gulf of Mexico and back, stopping at pre-arranged ports of call to meet with students in grades 4 through 7, and their teachers. At each port, "Mimifests" were held, which included various activities and presentations about marine life, seamanship, and navigation.&lt;ref name="stellwagen_soundings" /&gt; These events were attended by approximately 30,000 students each year.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1988, Peter Marston and other freelance musicians produced a cassette, ''Sea Songs from the Mimi Crew'', of old-time sea songs self-published under the name "The Barn School" based in Gloucester, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.worldcat.org/title/sea-songs-from-the-mimi-crew/oclc/23209361 |title=Sea songs from the Mimi crew (Musical cassette, 1988) [WorldCat.org] |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Marston retained ownership of the vessel until 1999, when the boat was sold to new owners Captain George G. Story of Gloucester, Massachusetts, his brother Captain Alan M. Story of Deltona, Florida, and Spiro "Steve" Cocotas, also from Gloucester. They operated the vessel as Three Mates Inc. for several years, bringing the boat to as many as 28 cities along the east coast.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Beginning of the end===
After three years of ownership under Three Mates Inc., Mimi was repossessed for financial reasons and sold at public auction in Massachusetts. Michael Spurgeon developed a plan to resurrect the Mimi, and the vessel was subsequently purchased with venture capital provided by Spurgeon's employer, Capt. Greg Muzzy, a Boston-area [[entrepreneur]] who owns and operates the "Liberty Fleet of Tall Ships,".  Mimi was sailed from Gloucester to the [[Mystic River]] in Boston, where she was kept docked at various marinas in East Boston and Chelsea.

Spurgeon's intention was to rehabilitate the ship and possibly court a Discovery Channel special about Mimi's story. After spending approximately $100,000 on infrastructural investments on the ship, including a complete rebuild of the stern and diesel engine, the ship became too costly to continue work on.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2008, it was discovered that a homeless man had been living aboard the ship while docked at the marina, and he was promptly kicked out. In an act of revenge, the man returned and removed one of several plugs in the belly of the ship, allowing her to rapidly fill with water. Mimi sank while at port, effectively ruining all electronics aboard the ship as well as seriously damaging the recently rebuilt engine. A significant amount of damage occurred above the keel of the ship due to freshwater clams colonizing the wood while she was underwater, rendering restoration nearly impossible.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/east_boston/2011/08/in_east_boston_the_last_voyage.html|title=In East Boston, the last voyage of the Mimi |author=McGonegal, Joe|publisher=[[Boston.com]] |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was floated back to the surface by a recovery team two weeks later, and sat disused after that.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Attempted revival and final disposal===
In the summer of 2010, two recent college graduates of the [[University of Vermont]] who had been fans of ''The Voyage of the Mimi'' stumbled upon the Mimi at port and mounted an effort to save the ship, which had fallen into a state of disrepair.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt;  Their efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful, given among other factors the high cost that would be required to save the ship and the Mimi's limited historical value, so the Mimi was scrapped in July 2011.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

The College of Behavioral and Social Sciences began as "The School of Liberal Arts" in 1919, and was headquartered in [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]]; Frederic E. Lee served as the school's first dean. In the 1920s, it became "The College of Arts and Sciences," with five separate divisions. In 1936, the college moved into the newly completed College of Arts and Sciences Building, which was renamed Francis Scott Key Hall in 1955. In the 1940s, the departments of Economics, Geography and Government &amp; Politics moved into The College of Business and Public Administration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/about-us/history.aspx |title=College of Behavioral and Social Sciences - History |publisher=Bsos.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business and Public Administration combined to become the new "Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences", one of five divisions in the university. In 1986, the five divisions split into fourteen colleges, and The College of Behavioral and Social Sciences was formed. The college has been headquartered in Millard E. Tydings Hall since 1993.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Undergraduate opportunities==

===CIVICUS===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2013}}CIVICUS is a two-year living and learning undergraduate program in the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, which links academic coursework together with participation in internships and community service to provide an experience of civil service engagement for participants (known as CIVICUS Associates). CIVICUS Associates live together in Somerset Hall (located in the North Hill Community), which was renovated in 1999 for the CIVICUS Living and Learning Program. Somerset Hall also houses the program's offices and hosts CIVICUS classes. The hall is designed with several study and social lounges to enhance students' living and learning experience. Somerset is located centrally on campus making the walk to classes, the dining hall, McKeldin Library, and the Stamp Student Union quick and convenient. All the rooms in Somerset are air conditioned and each student has his/her own internet, phone, and cable jack. Most of the rooms are doubles with a few triples and quads scattered throughout the building. There are also some singles. In addition, there is a computer lab and laundry facility located on the ground floor. Each floor also has one or two small kitchenettes with a microwave and a sink.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civicus.umd.edu/somerset.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For students entering CIVICUS in the fall of their freshman year, the CIVICUS classes students are required to take in their first semester consist of a 1-credit class called CIVICUS Student and the University (BSCV181) and a 3-credit class called Introduction to CIVICUS (BSCV191). In their second semester, students take a 1-credit class called CIVICUS and Service Learning (BSCV182) and a 3 credit class called Introduction to Contemporary Social Problems (SOCY105). In their third semester in the CIVICUS program, students take a 3-credit class called Leadership in a Multicultural Society. In the last semester in the program students take the CIVICUS Capstone 3 credit class (BSCV302) that gives them academic credit for their CIVICUS Internship. A student can take a 1 credit class instead if the student is getting academic credit from another academic program.  The creator and current director of the program is Dr. Sue Briggs, who teaches the majority of the required courses, as well as provides assistance and information regarding all aspects of the program.

In addition to the in-class requirements, CIVICUS associates are responsible for completing four service projects per semester, a long term service project, and an internship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicus.umd.edu/somerset.htm CIVIUS Website, Somerset Hall] Retrieved 2010-7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Associates also participate in an additional two community days of service, once per semester. Students are able to participate in wide variety of service activities, ranging from those on campus, to those in the surrounding counties and Washington, D.C. The program is based on the five principles of civil society: citizenship, leadership, community building in a diverse society, scholarship, and community service-learning. CIVICUS is a program for enthusiastic, motivated, and dedicated students who want to get involved with the campus and local community to make a positive difference. CIVICUS comprises a diverse group of student leaders whose distinct personalities, perspectives, and backgrounds enrich class discussions, service projects, and the conversations throughout the halls of Somerset. This camaraderie continues even after CIVICUS students have completed their citation, as many CIVICUS juniors and seniors return regularly to Somerset and remain involved with the program. In addition to being involved with the CIVICUS community, many of the students are actively involved in the university and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civicus.umd.edu/associates.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Maryland freshmen applicants whose application materials suggest they possess significant levels of leadership, involvement, and motivation are invited to join the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicus.umd.edu/faq.htm#1 CIVICUS Website, FAQ] Retrieved 2010-7-8&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 130 associates are in the program at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
