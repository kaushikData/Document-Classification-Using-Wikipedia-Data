Significant reforms of the [[Russian Armed Forces]] were announced in October 2008 under Defence Minister [[Anatoliy Serdyukov]], and major structural reorganisation began in 2009. The stated aims of the reform are to reorganize the structure and the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in the Russian army, and to reduce it in size.&lt;ref name="Military reform to change army structure"&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081017/117787642.html Military reform to change army structure. What about its substance?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key elements of the reforms announced in October 2008 included:
* reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million by 2012;
* reducing the number of officers;
* centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres;
* creating a professional [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] corps;
* reducing the size of the central command;
* introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff;
* elimination of cadre-strength formations;
* reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system;
* reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.

There had previously been several reform attempts such as the [[Russian Ground Forces#Reforms under Sergeyev|1997 plan]] under defence minister [[Igor Sergeyev]] and the [[Russian Ground Forces#Reforms under Putin|2003 programme]] of [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin]] (‘Urgent Tasks for the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’), the latter of which was very similar to the 2008 programme, as it emphasized already the need for reductions in personnel strength, a gradual decrease in the use of conscripts in favour of professional soldiers, the creation of a professional NCO corps and drastic changes to officer training and education. The 2003 program however moved at a very slow pace, mainly due to the unwillingness of the military to reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rieas.gr/research-areas/global-issues/russian-studies/104.html Reforming The Russian Military: Problems And Prospects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel strength==
An essential part of the military reform is its down-sizing. By the beginning of the reform, there were about 1.13 million active personnel in the Russian Armed Forces. The planned reduction to 1 million servicemen will be advanced from 2016 to 2022.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Moscow Defense Brief #4, 2008 p. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Largely, the reductions falls within the officers. They used to account for about one third of the total strength of the Armed Forces: this will be reduced to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;Moscow Defense Brief #2, 2009 p. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The enlisted men are to be reduced according to the table:&lt;ref name="Reform of the Russian Armed Forces"&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/infographics/20091204/157098191.html Reform of the Russian Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2011 General-Colonel Vasily Smirnov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, said that the reformed forces would consist of 220,000 officers, 425,000 contract servicemen and 300,000 conscript soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asian-defence.blogspot.com/2011/04/russia-to-continue-military.html Russia To Continue Military Conscription For Next 10-15 Years | ASIAN DEFENCE NEWS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCO Corps==
An important element of the reforms is the creation of a professional [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] corps. Such a corps would serve as the basis for soldier training and military discipline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The NCO corps will consist of specialists with almost 3 years (2 years and 10 months) of training. The first new NCO Training Center was established in December 2009 at the [[Ryazan]] Institute for Airborne Troops. The future NCOs will occupy the posts of commanders and deputy commanders of motor rifle, reconnaissance, airborne, and motor transport platoons, as well as company and battery first sergeants. It is planned to have 2,000 candidates annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=35456&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=485&amp;no_cache=1 Russian Military Plans New NCO Training Center | The Jamestown Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the introduction of sergeants into the system will take not 3–4 years as envisaged, but at least 10–15. This delay could undermine reform by creating problems with management and the manning of those combat arms where a relatively high percentage of officers are involved in the direct operation of military equipment, such as the submarine fleet, air-defense forces, etc.

==Military districts==
From 1992 to 2010, the [[Russian Ground Forces]] were divided into six [[military district]]s:
* [[Leningrad Military District]];
* [[Moscow Military District]];
* [[Volga-Urals Military District]];
* [[North Caucasus Military District]];
* [[Siberian Military District]];
* [[Far East Military District]].

In mid 2010, a reorganisation was announced which would consolidate military districts and the navy's fleets into four Joint Strategic Commands (OSK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20100714/159810197.html Russia sets up four strategic commands | Defense | RIA Novosti&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically divided, the four commands will be:

* Joint Strategic Command West – [[Western Military District]] (HQ in [[Saint Petersburg]]), includes the [[Northern Fleet|Northern]] and [[Baltic Fleet]]s;
* Joint Strategic Command South – [[Southern Military District]] (HQ in [[Rostov-on-Don]]) includes the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and [[Caspian Flotilla]];
* Joint Strategic Command Center – [[Central Military District]] (HQ in [[Yekaterinburg]]);
* Joint Strategic Command East – [[Eastern Military District]] (HQ in [[Khabarovsk]]), includes the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]].

"Serdyukov's Defense Ministry will also be putting some soon-to-be-vacant [[real estate]] up for sale, e.g., Moscow MD headquarters (Polina Osipenko Street, Moscow), Far East MD headquarters (Seryshev Street, Khabarovsk).&lt;ref&gt;Russian Defence Policy blog, [http://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/winners-and-losers-in-organizing-new-mds-and-armies/ Winners and Losers in Organizing New MDs and Armies], 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The initial asking prices for these buildings and land will be several billion U.S. dollars. As long planned, proceeds from these sales, along with the sale of the Navy Main Staff, military educational institutions, and other military establishments in Moscow, are supposed to fund construction of housing for servicemen as well as military garrison infrastructure in new army deployment locations."

==Ground Forces==
Before the 2008 reform, the [[Russian Ground Forces]] (SV) had 24 [[Division (military)|divisions]], namely 3 tank divisions, 16 motorized rifle divisions and 5 machine gun artillery divisions, as well as two division-strength [[List of Russian military bases abroad|military bases]] in [[102nd Military Base|Armenia]] and Tajikistan, and 12 independent brigades. Out of those 24 divisions, only 5 motorised rifle-divisions were at full strength in 2008. Only about 13% of the army units could be deemed permanently combat-ready.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Moscow Defense Brief #2, 2010 p. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that every tank or motorized-rifle division will be split, as a rule, into two brigades. This process began in October 2008 with the splitting of the [[2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division]] near Moscow. By the end of 2009, 23 of the 24 divisions had been disbanded and their elements were used to create 4 tank brigades, 35 motorized rifle brigades (10 of which were pre-existing) and one "fortifications" brigade. All the brigades are permanent-readiness forces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Almost all brigades are now designated ''otdelnaya'' (separate), with several units retaining the "Guards" honorific. The only remaining division is the [[18th Machine Gun Artillery Division]] on the [[Kuril Islands]].

The number of military units and formations in the Ground Forces will be reduced from 1,890 to 172 within three years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The original four-link command and control system (military district – army – division – regiment) has been replaced by a three-link system (military district – operational command – brigade).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Air Forces==
The number of units in the [[Russian Air Force]] (VVS) will be reduced from 340 to 180, the number of air bases from 245 to 52. It was announced that the Air Force plans to eliminate the reduced, two-squadron [[Russian Aviation Regiment|aviation regiments]] (those with 24 combat aircraft per regiment). The new organization of the VVS establishes the Air Base as the basic structural element. Each air base will include an HQ, 1–7 air squadrons (or aviation groups), an airfield service battalion and communication units.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; The [[Belarusian Air Force]] currently uses the same structure. All [[Aviation Division]] HQs have been disbanded and the Air Bases receive their orders from the seven new Aviation Commands:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
* [[Operative-Strategic Aerospace Defence Command]] (former [[Special Purpose Command]] and [[16th Air Army]])
* [[37th Air Army|Long Range Aviation Command]] (former [[37th Air Army]])
* [[Military Transport Aviation]] Command (former 61st Air Army)
* [[1st Air and Air Defence Forces Command]] of the Joint Strategic Command West (former [[6th Air Army]])
* [[2nd Air and Air Defence Forces Command]] of the Joint Strategic Command East (former [[11th Air Army]])
* [[3rd Air and Air Defence Forces Command]] of the Joint Strategic Command Center (former [[14th Air Army]])
* [[4th Air and Air Defence Forces Command]] of the Joint Strategic Command South (former [[4th Air Army|4th]] and [[5th Air Army|5th Air Armies]])

All the air defence divisions and corps of the Air Defence Forces (PVO), which are part of the Air Force since 1998, have been disbanded and replaced by 13 aerospace defence brigades. These new brigades have been distributed among the seven commands, and consist of fighter aviation air bases, SAM regiments and radar regiments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

The [[Gagarin Air Force Academy|Gagarin]] and Zhukovskiy air force academies have been merged into the new Zhukovskiy-Gagarin Air Force Academy in Monino.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gagarin Air Force Academy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy==
The [[Russian Navy]] (VMF) will be cut almost by half, from 240 to 123 units. On the other hand, its fighting capability will be bolstered by bringing various units to 100% of their full wartime strength. Other planned changes are the offloading of non-military assets such as housing, the outsourcing of some jobs to civilian contractors and a reduction of the number of non-combat officers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Moscow Defense Brief #2, 2011 p. 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fleets have been subordinated to the new Operational Strategic Commands: the [[Northern Fleet|Northern]] and [[Baltic Fleet]]s are part of the Western Military District, the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and [[Caspian Flotilla]] are part of the Southern Military District, and the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]] is part of the Eastern Military District.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Under the State Armament Program, 100 warships will be procured by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=11583 Russian Navy to procure 100 ships by 2020&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase of 20 submarines, 35 corvettes and 15 frigates is planned&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; for example 6-8 [[List of ships of the Russian Navy|Project 885 SSNs]] and 6 [[List of ships of the Russian Navy|Project 636]].

The Navy's schools and research institutes have been merged into a territorially distributed Naval Academy Research and Training Center which consists of the [[N.G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy|Naval Academy]], the Higher Special Officer Courses, five naval research institutes, three MOD research institutes, the [[Nakhimov Naval School]] in St. Petersburg and the Naval Cadet Corps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The [[Russian Naval Aviation|Naval Aviation]] and the support units were reorganized into 13 air bases which were in a second stage merged into territorially integrated structures. As is the case for the reformed Air Force, each new air base consists of an HQ, support units and one or more aviation groups (the former air bases).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Several units of the [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Naval Infantry]] have changed their status. The 61st Separate Naval Infantry Brigade of the Northern Fleet has become a regiment, the 810th Regiment of the Black Sea Fleet has become a brigade, the 55th Division of the Pacific Fleet has been disbanded and replaced by the 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade, and the 77th Brigade of the Caspian Flotilla was disbanded too.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Airborne Troops==
Initially it was planned to transform the four existing divisions of the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] (VDV) into 7 to 8 air-assault brigades, among a number of other cuts and changes which drew of lot of protest of reserve and active airborne troopers who fear a loss of status.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/shurygin-on-the-vdvs-discontent/ Shurygin on the VDV’s Discontent | Russian Defense Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However general [[Vladimir Shamanov|Shamanov]], who was appointed as new CinC of the VDV in May 2009 and who generally supports the reform programme, cancelled all cuts and changes in the VDV and announced that the airborne troops would be reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;Åslund A., Guriev S. and Kuchins A. (2010) ''Russia after the global economic crisis'' The Russia Balance Sheet Project. {{ISBN|978-0-88132-497-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOD Serdyukov announced that he does not see the need to create independent rapid-reaction forces. "The Armed Forces already have such units in the VDV. They will be strengthened, and each military district will have an Airborne brigade to carry out urgent missions and operations under unpredictable circumstances."

The divisions have been beefed up and there are now four independent airborne/air-assault brigades.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Strategic Missile Troops==
The [[Strategic Missile Troops]] (RVSN) will retain 8 in place of twelve missile divisions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Space Troops==
The number of units/formations of the [[Russian Space Forces]] (KV) will be reduced from 7 to 6.

==Reform of military education==
The centralization and downsizing of the military education system is closely related to planned reductions to the officer corps. The Russian military education system had been based upon the previous set of [[Soviet military academies]]. Serdyukov announced that the 65 [[Military academy|military institutions of higher learning]] (15 academies, four universities, 46 colleges – including [[Suvorov Military School|Suvorov]] and [[Nakhimov Naval School|Nakhimov]] schools – and institutes) will be reduced by 2012 to just ten "systemic institutions": three research and teaching centers, six academies and one university. The new institutions will not only serve to train officers, but also to conduct research. They will be established according to territory, not combat arm. For now, all existing facilities will become affiliates of these ten centers; decisions regarding potential closures will be taken later. Serdyukov affirmed that the entire faculty of existing military institutes will be preserved and absorbed into the new system, and that only the managerial layer will be reduced. He also said that many formerly military specializations, such as lawyers, will now be educated at civilian facilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21444">'''Czech political crisis in 2018''' started when ''[[Seznam News]]'' published an interview with son of Czech Prime Minister [[Andrej Babiš]], [[Andrej Babiš jr.|Andrej Babiš Jr.]] Babiš Jr. stated that his father's people kidnapped him in [[Crimea]] and kept him there.&lt;ref name="V Česku začíná politická krize.

==History==
Journalists of ''Seznam News'', [[Sabina Slonková]] and [[Jiří Kubík]], found Andrej Babiš Jr. in [[Switzerland]], where he lives with his mother. They interviewed him.&lt;ref name="Kvůli Čapímu hnízdu mě drželi na Krymu, řekl Babišův syn"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kvůli Čapímu hnízdu mě drželi na Krymu, řekl Babišův syn |url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/488956-kvuli-capimu-hnizdu-me-drzeli-na-krymu-rekl-babisuv-syn.html |website=Novinky.cz |accessdate=13 November 2018 |language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš Jr. participated in his father's business involving farm Stork's Nest. He states that he was kidnapped by his father's people in 2016 when Stork's Nest was investigated by [[European Anti-Fraud Office]] and then kept in Crimea. He stated that his father's employees threatened him. He noted that he was sent to National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;ref name="Andrej Babiš mladší tvrdí, že ho kvůli kauze Čapí hnízdo drželi na Krymu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrej Babiš mladší tvrdí, že ho kvůli kauze Čapí hnízdo drželi na Krymu |url=https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-mladsi-protopopov-capi-hnizdo-krym_1811122301_miz |website=iROZHLAS |accessdate=13 November 2018 |language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babišův syn pilotoval boeing.

She resigned her mandate, when the interview was published.&lt;ref name="Autorka lékařské zprávy na Babiše ml.

Opposition parties expressed shock with reports that [[Andrej Babiš]] had his son get kidnapped. Leader of the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] [[Petr Fiala]] organised meeting with leaders of other opposition parties namely [[Czech Pirate Party]], [[Freedom and Direct Democracy]], [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party]], [[TOP 09]] and [[Mayors and Independents]] to talk their approach. Opposition then called for Babiš' resignation and decided to cause motion of no confidence. Opposition has 92 MPs of 200.

[[Andrej Babiš]], who was at the time in [[Palermo]], stated that his son is mentally ill and called the interview a "disgusting attack" on his family. He stated that he considers it a campaign against his persona. He refused the statement that his son was kidnapped.&lt;ref name="Babiš: Jde o odporný útok na moje děti.

On November 13, ODS, Pirates, KDU-CŠL, TOP 09, and STAN have agreed that they will vote in favor of the no-confidence vote (totaling 70 votes), while ANO will vote against it (78 votes). ČSSD, a junior coalition partner of the ANO-led government, [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|KSČM]], a party that provides support for the government, and SPD, an opposition party, who was in favor of the idea of a no-confidence vote, have taken an undecided approach (52 votes). On November 15, Babis and ANO had negotiations with the SPD, KSČM, and the ČSSD. SPD leader, [[Tomio Okamura]], said that he and his party will vote against the no-confidence vote, if the ČSSD leaves the coalition. Okamura has said that his party can’t join the coalition due to the unresolved case about the kidnapping of his son, but he said he would consider the confidence and supply arrangement with KSČM. Okamura also stated the desire of two concessions, which are the implementation of an SPD-program in the government and the change of certain policies, implemented by the ANO-ČSSD government. Negotiations, will continue before the no confidence vote with [[Tomio Okamura|Okamura]], [[Vojtěch Filip|Filip]], and [[Jan Hamacek|Hamacek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacSwan |first=Angus |date=13 November 2018 |title=Czech opposition pushes for no-confidence vote over PM's investigation|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/czech-opposition-pushes-for-no-confidence-vote-over-pm-s-investigation-10927422|language=English |work=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=bne |first=IntelliNews |date=15 November 2018 |title=Czech PM facing pressure to step down over son's kidnap claim|url=http://www.intellinews.com/czech-pm-facing-pressure-to-step-down-over-son-s-kidnap-claim-151989/?source=czech-republic|language=English |work=bne IntelliNews |access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, President Miloš Zeman annouced that Babiš will stay in the position of PM no matter the result of the no confidence vote, as he would simply appoint him again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eurozpravy.cz/domaci/politika/240468-kdyby-vlada-padla-zeman-opet-jmenuje-premierem-babise/|title=Kdyby vláda padla, Zeman opět jmenuje premiérem Babiše {{!}} EuroZprávy.cz|last=EuroZprávy.cz|access-date=2018-11-16|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again with intent of letting him govern without confidence, as he would have let his first cabinet rule indefinitely in case of no coalition with ČSSD. And also called the interview a "disgusting hyenism", citing his personal resentment against Slonková.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.expres.cz/milos-zeman-sabina-slonkova-kauza-babis-andrej-babis-mladsi-pot-/zpravy.aspx?c=A181116_114007_dx-zpravy_lare|title=Kauzy Slonkové se dotkly i mě, říká Zeman a označil reportáž za hyenismus|date=2018-11-16|website=Expres.cz|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, Andrej Babiš travelled to Switzerland, to talk to his son and ex-wife. Police and state attorneys "were not afraid" that he might attempt to influence them (it is a crime to influence witnesses in Czech Republic) and did not even propose any countermeasures (such as prohibition to meet them).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/andrej-babis-syn-cesta-do-svycarska_1811181625_jak|title=Žalobci se neobávají, že Babiš jel do Švýcarska svého syna ovlivňovat|work=iROZHLAS|access-date=2018-11-18|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police instead focused on a case of flowers put by Babiš as a tribute to Velvet revolution being thrown into a trash bin by a protester, which also attracted considerable attention of Babiš's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/demonstrace-17-listopadu-protest-sametova-revoluce-andrej-babis-tomio-okamura-1hf-/domaci.aspx?c=A181117_085852_domaci_linv|title=Květiny od Babiše a Okamury vyhodili kvůli demokracii.

On November 18, Beata Babišová, mother of Babiš jr. and Ex-wife of Babiš sr. posted a video online, where she asked journalists to "leave her family alone" and also called her son insane. Earlier, Babiš junior claimed that his mother tries to silence him and that his father forces her to do so. But later stopped communicating entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/babis-ml-oznamil-ze-chce-vypovidat-ale-matka-na-nej-tlaci-den-po-navsteve-otce-matka-v-tv-premierovi-pomohla-60743|title=Babiš ml. oznámil, že chce vypovídat, ale matka na něj tlačí.

On November 19, there was a fire in Czech National institute of mental health, where Dita Protopopová worked and where Babiš jr. was originally declared insane, promting many to theorize whether the fire was set on purpose to destroy evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://praha.idnes.cz/pozar-klecany-hasici-narodni-ustav-dusevniho-zdravi-pcd-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A181119_183235_praha-zpravy_mpl|title=V Národním ústavu duševního zdraví hořelo, nikdo nebyl zraněn|date=2018-11-19|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, PM Babiš met with the leadership of [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]], who provide his government with confidence. After the event, Babiš left without talking to present journalists and KSČM announced that they will vote against the motion of no confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2657399-zive-vedeni-kscm-jedna-o-postoji-k-hlasovani-o-neduvere-kabinetu-babis-se-novinarum|title=Komunisté vládu při hlasování o nedůvěře podrží, oznámil Filip.

On November 21, leadership of ČSSD announced that their deputies will leave the chamber for the vote and not take part in it (this counts as voting no, as motion of no confidence requires majority of all deputies to pass). But also announced that they would support a potential self dissolution of Chamber of deputies and therefore, snap elections. This would take 120 out of 200 deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2658023-podrzet-nebo-shodit-vedeni-cssd-jedna-o-postoji-k-vlade-zeman-prijme-sefa-kscm|title=ČSSD se nezúčastní hlasování o nedůvěře, je ale ochotná podpořit rozpuštění sněmovny|last=televize|first=Česká|work=ČT24 - Nejdůvěryhodnější zpravodajský web v ČR - Česká televize|access-date=2018-11-21|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''26 Baku Commissars''' were [[Bolshevik]] and [[Left SR|Left Socialist Revolutionary (SR)]] members of the Baku [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] Commune. The commune was established in the city of [[Baku]], which was then the capital of the briefly independent [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and is now the capital of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]. The commune, led by [[Stepan Shahumyan]], existed until 26 July 1918 when the Bolsheviks were forced out of power by a coalition of [[Dashnaks]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Right SRs]], and [[Mensheviks]]. 

After their overthrow, the Baku [[commissar]]s attempted to leave Baku but were captured by the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and imprisoned. On 14 September 1918, during the [[Battle of Baku|fall of Baku]] to Ottoman forces, [[Red Army]] soldiers broke into their prison and freed the commissars; they then boarded a ship to [[Krasnovodsk]], where they were promptly arrested by local authorities and, on the night of 20 September 1918, executed by a firing squad between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma on the [[Transcaspian Railway]].

== Baku Commune ==
The Baku Commune, a short-lived political entity, lasted from 13 April to 25 July 1918. It came to power after the bloody confrontation with the Muslim population, known as the [[March Days]] in Baku. During its brief existence the Commune had to face several problems: from the shortage of food and supplies to the threat of a strong [[Ottoman Empire]] Army which wanted to attack Baku. Despite the difficult conditions, the Commune carried out several social reforms, such as the [[nationalization]] of the oil industry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This is how the writer [[Victor Serge]] described the situation in May, June and July and the state of the small Red Army of Baku:&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;
[http://www.marxists.org/archive/serge/1930/year-one/ch06.htm Year One of the Russian Revolution | Chpt. 6&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''In May, June and July the inhabitants could be given only minute rations of nuts and sunflower seed; the small quantities of corn that the Soviet managed to bring in by sea were reserved for the troops. Attempts at requisitioning were made by the small Red Army of Baku, a poorly disciplined, poorly managed body composed largely of Armenians who were alien to the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. These drank in excess and plundered the Moslem peasants, causing disaffection among them.}}

On 5 June 1918 the Baku Red Army repulsed an assault by overwhelming Ottoman troops, but later it launched an unsuccessful assault on [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], the headquarters of the Ottoman [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]], and was obliged to retreat to Baku.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/az-baku.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
At this point, [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashanaks]], Right SRs and Mensheviks started to negotiate with General [[Lionel Dunsterville|Dunsterville]], the commander of the British troops in Persia, inviting his troops to Baku in order to defend the city from an imminent Ottoman attack. The Bolsheviks and their leftist allies opposed this scheme, but on 25 July the majority of the Soviet voted to call in the British, and the Bolsheviks resigned.
The Baku Commune was imprisoned for participation in unlawful military formations and militarized robbery, particularly for the [[March Days]] atrocities and was replaced by the Central-Caspian Dictatorship.

In contrast to what happened in many parts of Russia, where the Bolsheviks earned a reputation for ruthlessness executing those who did not support them, the Bolsheviks of Baku were not so strict. The [[Cheka]] in Baku executed only two persons, both members of the Soviet caught in embezzling public funds: the Commissar for Finance, Aleksandr Kireev, and the commissar of the steamship ''Meve'', Sergei Pokrovskii.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== The executions ==
[[File:Stepan Shaumyan.jpg|thumb|Stepan Shahumyan, the leader of the 26 commissars]]
After the [[fall of the Baku Soviet]] in July 1918, the Bolshevik leaders and some loyal troops tried to reach [[Astrakhan]], the only [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] port still in Bolshevik hands. However, their ship was intercepted by the military vessels of the [[Caspian fleet]] and after undergoing an hour's bombardment in mid-sea they surrendered and returned to Baku. Most of the Bolshevik militants were arrested and remained in prison until, after the fall of Baku to the Turks, a commando unit led by [[Anastas Mikoyan]] freed them from their prison.

Shahumyan, Dzhaparidze, Azizbekov, and their comrades, along with Mikoyan, then boarded the ship ''Turkmen'', intending to reach Astrakhan by sea. According to recent historians, the sailors chose instead to sail to [[Krasnovodsk]] for fear of being arrested in Astrakhan. At Krasnovodsk the commissars were arrested by the town's commandant who requested further orders from the "[[Ashkhabad Committee]]", led by the Socialist Revolutionary [[Fyodor Funtikov]], about what should be done with them. Three days later, British Major-General [[Wilfrid Malleson]], on hearing of their arrest, contacted Britain's liaison-officer in Ashkhabad, Captain [[Reginald Teague-Jones]], to suggest that the commissars be handed over to British forces to be used as hostages in exchange for British citizens held by the Soviets. That same day, Teague-Jones attended the Committee's meeting in Ashkabad which had the task of deciding the fate of the Commissars. For some reason Teague-Jones did not communicate Malleson's request to the Committee, and claimed he left before a decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;C. Dobson &amp; J. Miller ''The Day We Almost Bombed Moscow'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1986. p94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; He further claimed that next day he discovered the committee had eventually decided to issue orders that the commissars should be executed. According to historian Richard H. Ullman, Teague-Jones could have stopped the executions if he wanted since the Ashkabad Committee was dependent on British support and could not refuse a request from its powerful ally, but he decided not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Ullman ''Anglo-Soviet Relations 1917-21. Vol. I. Intervention and the War'' Princeton, N.J., 1961 p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 20 September, three days after being arrested, twenty-six of the commissars were executed by a firing squad between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma on the [[Trans-Caspian railway]]. How Anastas Mikoyan, who was part of the group, managed to survive is still uncertain, as is the reason why his life was spared. In 1922, V. Chaikin, a Socialist Revolutionary journalist, published a description of the moments before the execution.&lt;ref&gt;''On the History of the Russian Revolution (K Istorii Rossi skoi Revoliutsii)'' (Moscow, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''At around 6 A.M. [relates a witness], the twenty-six commissars were told of the fate awaiting them while they were in the train. They were taken out in groups of eight or nine men. They were obviously shocked, and kept a tense silence. One sailor shouted: `I'm not afraid, I'm dying for liberty.' One of the executioners replied that `We too will die for liberty sooner or later, but we mean it in a different way from you.' The first group of commissars, led from the train in the semi-darkness, was dispatched with a single salvo. The second batch tried to run away but was mown down after several volleys. The third resigned itself to its fate ...}}

Soviet officials later blamed the executions on British agents acting in the Baku area at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Teague-Jones]], ''The Spy Who Disappeared: Diary of a Secret Mission to Russian and Central Asia in 1918'' Gollancz, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1919/04/23.htm|title=The Shooting of the Twenty-Six Baku Comrades|author=J.V.

Funtikov put all blame for the executions onto Britain, and in particular Teague-Jones who, he claimed, had ordered him to have the commissars shot. Funtikov was tried and shot in Baku in 1926. Britain denied involvement in the incident, saying it was done by local officials without any knowledge of the British.

This accusation caused a further souring of relations between Britain and the fledgling Soviet government and helped lead to the confrontational attitude of both sides in the coming years.

According to [[Soviet historiography]] two British officers on board the commissars' ship ordered it to sail to Krasnovodsk instead of Astrakhan, where they found a government led by SRs and British officers who immediately ordered the arrest of the commissars. The Soviets would later immortalize the death of the 26 commissars through, among other things, movies,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0023971|Dvadtsat shest komissarov (1933)&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; artwork,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armymuseum.ru/art/art8_r.html|title=armymuseum.ru|work=armymuseum.ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816051811/http://www.armymuseum.ru/art/art8_r.html|archivedate=16 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; stamps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.nestor.minsk.by/fsunews/ussr/1968/su3535.html &lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at home.nestor.minsk.by&lt;/ref&gt; and public works including the [[26 Commissars Memorial]] in Baku.

==Soviet investigations==
Boris Vladimirovich Sennikov published a book in 2004 about his findings on the [[Tambov Rebellion]] where he mentioned several facts about the event.&lt;ref&gt;Sennikov, B. '''Tambov rebellion of 1918-1921 and de-peasant-ation of Russia 1929-1933''' (Tambovskoe vosstanie 1918-1921 gg. i raskrest'janivanie Rossii 1929-1933 gg.). "Posev". Moskva, 2004. (Library of Russian Studies. #9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sennikov claims that the famous Brodsky's painting is an invention of the Soviet historiography. The truth was established by the special commission of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK) that arrived from Moscow. The commission was headed by [[Vadim Chaikin]] ([[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|PSR]]). The commission also consisted of a big group of a high-ranking Moscow's [[Cheka]] officers headed by [[Yakov Peters]], an international criminal associated with the [[Siege of Sidney Street]]. Sennikov also brings up a quote of Chaikin in the article of [[Suren Gazaryan]] "That should not be repeated" in the Leningrad magazine "[[Zvezda (magazine)|Zvezda]]": "The painting of Brodsky ''Execution of the 26 Baku Commissars'' is historically false. They were not shot, but rather [[decapitation|decapitated]]. And the executioner of the penalty was a single man - a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], a gigantic strength [[bogatyr]]. That Turkmen by himself with his own hands using [[shashka]] beheaded all of them."&lt;ref&gt;Gazaryan, S. ''That should not be repeated''. [http://zvezdaspb.ru/index.php?page=2&amp;razd=biblio/1989.htm "Zvezda". Leningrad, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; The pit with remains of the commissars and their heads was uncovered under the surveillance of the VTsIK special commission and representatives of [[Cheka]]. The report on the death of Baku commissars was sent by the commission to VTsIK, [[Sovnarkom]], and the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|RKP(b)]].

In 1922 Vadim Chaikin published his book ''To the history of the Russian Revolution'' through the Grazhbin Publishing ([[Moscow]]) commemorating the first part "Execution of 26 Baku Commissars" to the event. After serving time in the [[Oryol Prison]] Chaikin on 11 September 1941 he was [[Execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] along with 156 other Oryol prison inmates during the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]].

==Demolition of the 26 Commissars Memorial and reburial==
[[Image:26 Baku Commissars Memorial, 1987.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[26 Commissars Memorial]] was a symbol of [[Azerbaijan SSR]].]]In January 2009, the [[Baku]] authorities began the demolition of the city's [[26 Commissars Memorial]].&lt;ref name="KU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/148040|format=|script-title=ru:В Азербайджане против демонтажа мемориала 26 Бакинских комиссаров протестуют только левые|publisher = kavkaz-uzel.ru|author= Фаик Меджид|accessdate=17 January 2009|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the latest monument of several that had been built to commemorate the Commissars erected in that park during the Soviet period. This last monument itself had been fenced-off since July 2008.&lt;ref name="KU"/&gt; The remains of the commissars were reburied at [[Hövsan|Hovsan]] Cemetery on 26 January 2009, with participation of Muslim, Jewish and Christian clergy, who conducted religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1news.az/society/20090114012021504.html |script-title=ru:Продолжается демонтаж мемориала 26 Бакинских комиссаров в Баку |publisher=1news.az |author=Мурсал Алиев |accessdate=17 January 2009 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130734/http://1news.az/society/20090114012021504.html |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dismantling was opposed by some local [[Left-wing politics|left-wingers]] and by the [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Azerbaijan Communist Party]] in particular.&lt;ref name="KU"/&gt; It also upset Armenia as the Armenian public believed that the demolition and reburial was motivated by the reluctance of the Azerbaijanis, after the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|Nagorno-Karabakh War]] to have ethnic Armenians buried in the center of their capital.&lt;ref name="iwpr.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=349861&amp;apc_state=henh|title=Azerbaijan: Outcry at Commissars' Reburial |first=Magerram |last=Zeinalov |first2=Gegham |last2=Vardanian |date=2009 |work=Institute for War and Peace Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another scandal happened when Azerbaijani press reports claimed that during the exhumation only 21 bodies were discovered and that "Shahumyan and four other Armenian commissars managed to escape their murderers".&lt;ref name="iwpr.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.az/eng/news_27_01_2009_31645.html |title=Remains of Baku commissars uncovered in centre of Azerbaijani capital re-buried |work=ABC.AZ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003220600/http://abc.az/eng/news_27_01_2009_31645.html |archivedate=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.day.az/news/society/145138.html|title=Во время раскопок могилы 26 бакинских комиссаров в Баку не были обнаружены останки трех человек - ОБНОВЛЕНО|date=26 January 2009|work=Day.Az}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-y.aspx?DocsID=1108761|title=Ъ-Газета - Бакинцы недосчитались комиссаров|work=kommersant.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was questioned by Shahumyan’s granddaughter Tatyana, now living in [[Moscow]], who told the [[Russia]]n daily [[Kommersant]] that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is impossible to believe that they weren’t all buried. There is a film in the archives of 26 bodies being buried. Apart from this, my grandmother was present at the reburial."&lt;ref name="iwpr.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Almost all monuments in Azerbaijan dedicated to the commissars including Shahumyan, Azizbekov, Dzhaparidze and Fioletov, have been demolished. Most streets named after the commissars have been renamed.

'''Acción Gallega''' ('''AG''', ''Galician Action'' in English language) was one of the most important [[Agrarianism|agrarianist]], [[Turno|antiturnista]] and anti-[[client politics]] ([[Cacique#Caciquismo|anticaciquismo]]) political movements in [[Galiza|Galicia]] in the 20th century. With a decidedly antiforal&lt;ref&gt;The ''Foros'' were abusive contracts between the peasants and the landowners in [[Galiza|Galicia]] until their total abolition in 1926. Foros were long-term or often perpetual, so that a person or institution ceded the use or/and benefit of a thing (almost always a land), in exchange for the fulfillment of various conditions previously laid down. This conditions were normally a part of the agrarian production or a part of the monetarian of the production. Sometimes the peasants had to pay up to the 50% of its production. It was a mode of semifeudal exploitation of the land, with the owners usually being fidalgos (low nobility), priests or rich peasants.&lt;/ref&gt; and redemptionist&lt;ref&gt;Redención meant the total abolition of the foros and the delivery of the land ownership to the peasants.&lt;/ref&gt; character, in its first formulation, constituted the radical sector of the [[Galician people|Galician]] [[Agrarianism|agrarianist]] in the 1910s.

==History==

===Origins===
The origins of AG lie in the agitated year of 1909. In that year, a group of [[Galician people|Galician]] politicians, intellectuals and journalists living in [[Madrid]] met day after day. They were: [[Basilio Álvarez]], [[Alfredo Vicenti]], [[Manuel Portela Valladares]], Enrique Peinador, [[Luís Antón del Olmet]], Prudencio Canitrot, Alfonso Alcalá Martín, Ricardo Vilariño, Rafael Carvajal, Cánovas Cervantes, Eloy Páramo, etc. The topic of their discussions was the constant [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] and antiforal struggles in [[Galiza|Galicia]]; namely the liberation of the [[Galician people|Galician]] peasants and, more generally, of [[Galiza|Galicia]] in general. Acción Gallega was conceived as a movement in that tumultuous context. In January 15, 1910, the movement gave the first public sign of life, with the appearance of ''Acción Gallega'', the official magazine of the movement, subtitled ''Biweekly Magazine and defender of regional interests''. [[Basilio Álvarez]] was the main promoter of the magazine and of the movement. A part of this journalistic campaign, AG also initiated a series of meetings and actions of different nature. [[Agrarianism|Agrarianist]] associations of [[Ribadeo]], [[Riotorto]], [[Fonsagrada]], [[Becerreá]] and other [[Municipalities of Spain#Galicia|municipalities]] joined AG.

===Elections and the united agrarian party===
The rallies and meetings of Acción Gallega began in the [[Meira (comarca)|Terras de Meira]] with [[Basilio Álvarez]], Prudencio Canitrot, Cánovas Cervantes and Rafael Carvajal as the main speakers. The [[Spanish general election, 1910|elections to the Spanish Cortes of 1910]] allowed them to participate actively in the campaign, presenting three candidates: Rafael Carvajal, in the district of [[Mondoñedo]]; [[Alfredo Vicenti]], by [[Becerreá]], and [[Manuel Portela Valladares]] in [[Fonsagrada]]. The success was total in [[Fonsagrada]], being [[Manuel Portela Valladares]] elected deputy, and an [[electoral fraud]] of the [[Client politics|caciques]] prevented the triumph of [[Alfredo Vicenti]] in [[Becerreá]]. Acción Gallega gained a deputy in the [[Congreso de los Diputados]].

At this early stage what AG wanted was to give a sense of unity to the [[Galician people|Galician]] [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] movement, split into different fronts ([[Galician Solidarity]], antiforistas, [[Unión Campesina]], etc.). This led to the attempt of creating in 1910, an unified [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[political party]] in [[Galiza|Galicia]], the [[Liga Agrario-Redencionista]] (LAR), which was a total failure. After the failure of the LAR, the magazine ''Acción Gallega'' disappeared.

===Radicalization===
In 1911 a series of events radicalized the movement, along with their leader, [[Basilio Álvarez]], which was increasingly interested in [[christian socialism]]. In August 1912 the "Manifesto de [[Ourense]]" appears, where Acción Gallega undertook a campaign of rallies, with an [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] and [[cooperatives|cooperativist]] character, to collect the aspirations of the peasantry and send them to the [[Spanish Government]]. The rallies, that had a verbal radicalism unprecedented in [[Galiza|Galicia]],&lt;ref&gt;Basilio Álvarez even said that "Dynamite sometimes smells better than incense."&lt;/ref&gt; began in [[O Carballiño]], and continued in [[Ribadavia]], [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]], [[Ourense]], [[Bande]], [[A Estrada]], etc. The tone of the speakers was radical, rebel and even openly revolutionary, especially the tone of Basilio Álvarez, which said that [[Madrid]] feared the possibility of a [[revolution]] in [[Galiza|Galicia]]. The tone of the speakers was also increasingly [[Galicianism (Galicia)|regionalist]] and [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]]. Famous poets like [[Ramón Cabanillas]] and [[Antonio Noriega Varela]] made popular poems (all in [[Galician language]]) dedicated to the imminent [[revolution]] of the peasants. The official magazine, ''Acción Gallega'', was printed again in 1912.

This radicalization made Acción Gallega lost some moderate supporters and gained more radical others, like the [[anarchism|anarchists]]. Most of the press also began attacking the movement, which until then had defended.

===End===
Since 1912 the movement focused on fighting [[Cacique#Caciquismo|caciques]], with a clear ideology inspired by the [[regenerationism]] and redemptionist antiforismo, again based in the oratorial skills of [[Basilio Alvarez]] and his group of unconditional friends.

The decomposition of AG was the result of the persecutions the movement suffered in its late years. Since 1913, the constitutional guarantees didn't apply to Acción Gallega, which was de facto banned. In 1914 the movement was involved in cases of [[unrest]] and [[terrorism]]. Due to his confrontation with the authorities and the bishop of [[Ourense]] [[Basilio Álvarez]] was forbidden to exercise the priesthood and, finally, his character of priest was withdrawn by the bishop [[Eustaquio Ilundáin y Esteban]]. Due to this [[Manuel Portela Valladares]] and [[Alfredo Vicenti]] abandoned Acción Gallega. This, and the split of the [[Ourense]] section of AG marked the end of the organization, in late 1914.

Despite the dissolution of Acción Gallega the [[Galician people|Galician]] [[agrarianism|agrarian]] movement continued to be very influenced by its ideas and radicalism.

==Anthem==
Acción Gallega used a poem of [[Ramón Cabanillas]], written in 1910, as its official anthem.

'''Americans for Prosperity''' ('''AFP'''), founded in 2004, is a libertarian/[[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political [[advocacy group]] in the [[United States]] funded by [[David H. Koch]] and [[Charles Koch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group|title=How the Koch brothers built the most powerful rightwing group you've never heard of|date=2018-09-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Koch brothers' primary political advocacy group, it is one of the most influential American conservative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans for Prosperity|publisher=FactCheck.org|date=2014-06-16|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2014/02/americans-for-prosperity-3/|accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian20090918&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/18/republicans-internet-barack-obama |title=Republicans steal Barack Obama's internet campaigning tricks |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=politico20140509 /&gt;

After the 2009 inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]], AFP helped transform the [[Tea Party movement]] into a political force. It organized significant opposition to Obama administration initiatives such as [[global warming]] regulation, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the expansion of [[Medicaid]] and economic stimulus. It helped turn back [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], the major environmental proposal of Obama's first term. AFP advocated for limits on the [[collective bargaining]] rights of [[Public-sector trade unions in the United States|public-sector trade unions]] and for [[right-to-work law]]s, and it opposed raising the federal [[minimum wage]]. AFP played an active role in the achievement of the Republican majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2010 and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 2014.

In the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 mid-term election]] cycle, AFP led all groups, other than [[political action committees]] (PACs), in spending on political television advertising. AFP's scope of operations has drawn comparisons to [[political party|political parties]]. AFP, an [[501(c) organization#501(c)(4)|educational social welfare organization]], and the associated '''Americans for Prosperity Foundation''', a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|public charity]], are [[tax exemption|tax-exempt]] [[nonprofit organization|nonprofits]]. As a tax-exempt nonprofit, AFP is not legally required to disclose its donors to the general public.&lt;ref name=factcheck/&gt; The extent of AFP's political activities while operating as a tax-exempt entity has raised concerns among some [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance]] watchdogs regarding the [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] of its funding.

Now, they're calling in their chips. At the National Press Club yesterday, AFP president Tim Phillips and several officers with the group laid out their agenda. The group is calling for legalizing crude oil exports, a repeal of the estate tax, approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, blocking any hike in the gas tax, a tax holiday on corporate profits earned overseas, blocking the EPA's new rules on carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants, and a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, along with a specific focus on the medical device tax. The announcement was touted by NPR as a "conservative agenda for Congress." But it's also a near mirror image of Koch Industries' lobbying agenda. Koch Industries – the petrochemical, manufacturing and commodity speculating conglomerate owned by David and Charles – is not only a financier of political campaigns, but leads one of the most active lobbying teams in Washington, a big part of why the company has been such a financial success.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David S. |last1=Meyer |first2=Amanda |last2=Pullum |chapter=The Tea Party and the Dilemmas of Conservative Populism |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tPVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=David+S.+Meyer+and+Amanda+Pullum,+%E2%80%9CThe+Tea+Party+and+the+Dilemmas+of+Conservative+Populism.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JvRomAs7IJ&amp;sig=UASAqTZGqQa6n-qikGLXsk687Ns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMIn9iW-5vCxwIVkyqICh1VYAHJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Understanding the Tea Party Movement |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |year=2014}} in Nella Van Dyke and David S Meyer, eds., * Describes AFP as one of several groups "established before Obama's election and funded by very wealthy sponsors who sought both to promote an ideological vision and to protect a financial interest.

===Health care and 2014 midterm===

AFP has described itself as the nation's largest grassroots champion for health care freedom.&lt;ref name=factcheck/&gt; In August 2009, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine identified health care reform as one of the key domestic policy goals of the Obama administration, and identified AFP as one of the most prominent groups in opposition.&lt;ref name=motherjones20090819/&gt; AFP sponsored two other groups advocating against the Obama administration's proposed [[health care reform]], Patients United Now and Patients First.&lt;ref name=motherjones20090819/&gt;

In May 2009, AFP launched Patients United Now, which opposed a [[single-payer health care system]] and a government-funded [[health insurance]] option. It purchased television advertisements warning of "government-controlled health care" or a "Washington takeover" of health care.&lt;ref name=Missoulian/&gt; In one Patients United Now television advertisement, a Canadian woman, [[Shona Holmes health care incident|Shona Holmes]], said she could not get timely treatment in Canada and ultimately was treated in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Lazarus"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/09/business/fi-lazarus9 |title=Healthcare debate framed by fear-mongering ads|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2010-10-21|first=David|last=Lazarus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients United Now staged more than three hundred rallies to oppose the Obama administration's proposed [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA).&lt;ref name=Mayer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The billionaire brothers bankrolling the get-Obama-out campaign |first=Lara |last=Marlowe |date=November 12, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |location=[[Dublin, Ireland]] |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/the-billionaire-brothers-bankrolling-the-get-obama-out-campaign-1.10983 |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, AFP mailed voters in at least eight West Virginia counties material that may have led them to believe they were ineligible to vote in an upcoming primary election. The mailings, received just before the deadline to update voter registration, included registration cards and prepaid return envelopes addressed to county clerks, with a message cautioning voters that if they did not update their voter registration, they might lose their right to vote in the upcoming primary election. AFP's West Virginia director said the mailings were a non-partisan, [[get out the vote]] effort targeting unregistered voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wvgazette.com/article/20140422/GZ01/140429746 |date=April 22, 2014 |title=Voters getting misleading info from group, Tennant says |first=Paul J. |last=Nyden |accessdate=March 23, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Charleston Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the New Hampshire attorney general’s office began investigating the nonprofit status of AFP after a group of Republican representatives accused the conservative activist group of improperly wading into state elections. The investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/New-Hampshire-Attorney-General-to-investigate-Americans-for-Prosperity-s-non-profit-status-during-campaign-season-18455776|title=NH Attorney General to Investigate AFP’s Non-Profit Status|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''April 6 Youth Movement Democratic Front''' ({{lang-ar|حركة شباب 6 أبريل الجبهة الديمقراطية}}) is an Egyptian activist group established in spring 2011 after the differences in the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], led by [[Ahmed Maher (youth leader)|Ahmed Maher]]. Differences in the Movement started to appear in April when leaders of the movement announced they would transform it into a NGO or foundation on its anniversary. TV host and founder, Abd Alrahman Ezz, of 6 April "Democratic Front", told Ahram Online that the decision was taken without consultation. "It was taken with no respect for democracy, for the majority," Ezz says. The lack of internal democracy is the main reason why some left the mainstream movement, led by Ahmed Maher, forming the Democratic Front, Ezz says most of the old members joined the Democratic Front. On August 5th, a group of 6 April Youth Movement members in Alexandria announced that they had joined the Democratic Front, leaving the Ahmed Maher front due to what they considered discrimination in decision making processes.

The split is not limited to Cairo and Alexandria but also seems to have been reproduced itself across the country. On August 6th, a group of April 6 Movement members in Kafr El-Sheikh governor announced that they joined the Democratic Front, leaving the Ahmed Maher Front. The same happened in Behaira and Port Said.

The April 6 Movement Democratic Front is using the same [[raised fist]] symbol as the [[Otpor!]] movement from [[Serbia]], that helped bring down the regime of [[Slobodan Milošević]], and whose nonviolent tactics were later used in [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia,]]  an organization founded by former Otpor! members.

==Anti-Protest law campaign==

The April 6 Movement, Ahmer Maher and the Democratic Front held a press conference on Monday in the Sheikh Zayed city desert to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the movement.Page text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/april-6-movement-celebrates-7th-anniversary-despite-ban egyptindependent]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sherif al-Rouby, spokesperson for the Democratic Front, told Al-Masry Al-Youm that the two fronts had to hold the press conference in the desert after security services canceled reservations made at a hall to hold the event.
 
Rouby added that they invited a limited number of journalists, fearing security interference, and that the two fronts agreed on uniting the political events they hold without being united themselves.
 
During the conference, the movement declared a new strategy to deal with the government.
 
Last month, a court upheld a previous verdict banning the April 6 group which used to be the main opponent against the rule of toppled President Hosni Mubarak.
 
The movement was formed upon calls for a general strike on April 6, 2008 in solidarity with protests from spinning and weaving workers in Mahalla city against price hikes and low wages.
 
The Egyptian interim president Adly Mansour, and regardless of the widespread critics,[34] approved a new law restricting protests on 24 November 2013.[35][36]

The law was nationally and internationally heavily criticized with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urging the Egyptian government to amend it or repeal it.[37] UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon added his voice to those criticizing the law for leaving the door open to a very restrictive and repressive interpretation and urged the Egyptian authorities to consider amendments to the law "to make sure that any laws passed are in full conformity with international human rights standards".[38] Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (ALDE), the third largest group in the European Parliament, criticized the new law&lt;blockquote&gt;This anti-protest law is against everything the revolution was about. The Egyptian government should withdraw it.[39]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 26 November, the No Military Trials for Civilians campaign organised a protest at the Shura Council in defiance of the protest law. The protest was violently dispersed by the police, and dozens of well-known activists were arrested.[40] The female activists were beaten and released on a desert road in the middle of the night,[41] while the 24 male detainees remained in custody; most of whom were released on bail a week later.[42]

===Petition to repeal the protest law===
The April 6 movement democratic front and maher front launched a campaign to annul the [[Egyptian protest law]] by a circulating a petition which citizens may sign to indicate approval for law's abolition or redrafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6 April call for redrafting of Protest Law|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/23/6-april-call-redrafting-protest-law/|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=[[Daily News Egypt]]|date=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=April 6 launches campaign to repeal protest law|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/103278/news/april-6-launches-campaign-to-repeal-protest-law|newspaper=Cairo Post|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading functionaries from various political factions who have signed the petition include the president of the [[Constitution Party (Egypt)|Constitution Party]], [[Hala Shukrallah]], and Mohamed Ghonim, a key member of the [[Egyptian Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hala Shukrallah signs April 6 petition against protest law|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/97517/Egypt/Politics-/Hala-Shukrallah-signs-April--petition-against-prot.aspx|newspaper=Ahram Online|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=April 6 petition against protest law draws prominent signatories|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/103681/news/april-6-petition-against-protest-law-draws-prominent-signatories|newspaper=Cairo Post|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bar Kokhba revolt''' ({{lang-he-n|מרד בר כוכבא|links=no}}; ''Mered Bar Kokhba'') was a rebellion of the Jews of the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]], led by [[Simon bar Kokhba]], against the [[Roman Empire]]. Fought circa 132–136 CE,&lt;ref&gt;for the year 136, see: W. Eck, ''The Bar Kokhba Revolt: The Roman Point of View'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; it was the last of three major [[Jewish–Roman wars]], so it is also known as '''The Third Jewish–Roman War''' or '''The Third Jewish Revolt'''. Some historians also refer to it as the '''Second Revolt&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004314634_001]&lt;/ref&gt; of Judea''', not counting the [[Kitos War]] (115–117 CE), which had only marginally been fought in Judea.

The revolt erupted as a result of ongoing religious and political tensions in Judea following on the failure of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|First Revolt]] in 66−73 CE. These tensions were related to the establishment of a large Roman presence in Judea, changes in administrative life and the economy, together with the outbreak and suppression of Jewish revolts from Mesopotamia to Libya and Cyrenaica.&lt;ref&gt;William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein,[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA106 ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period,''] Cambridge University Press, 1984 pp.106.&lt;/ref&gt; The proximate reasons seem to centre around  the construction of a new city, [[Aelia Capitolina]], over the ruins of Jerusalem and the erection of a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] on the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref name="Eshel" /&gt; The [[Church Fathers]] and rabbinic literature emphasize the role of [[Quintus Tineius Rufus (consul 127)|Rufus]], [[Roman governor|governor]] of Judea in provoking the revolt.&lt;ref name="William David Davies p. 35"&gt;William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein: The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period, p. 35., Cambridge University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|9780521772488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 132, the revolt led by Bar Kokhba quickly spread from central Judea across the country, cutting off the Roman garrison in Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem).&lt;ref name="Axelrod 2009 29"&gt;{{cite book |last=Axelrod |first=Alan |title=Little-Known Wars of Great and Lasting Impact |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x322-89x3MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=In+132,+a+revolt+led+by+Bar+Kokhba+quickly+spread+from+Modi%27in&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pNKWU-WFBPSssASm2YDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20132%2C%20a%20revolt%20led%20by%20Bar%20Kokhba%20quickly%20spread%20from%20Modi'in&amp;f=false |publisher=Fair Winds Press |year=2009 |page=29 |isbn=9781592333752}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quintus Tineius Rufus was the provincial governor at the time of the erupting uprising, attributed with the failure to subdue its early phase. Rufus is last recorded in 132, the first year of the rebellion; whether he died or was replaced is uncertain. Despite arrival of significant Roman reinforcements from [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Roman Arabia|Arabia]], initial rebel victories over the Romans established an independent state over most parts of Judea Province for over two years, as Bar Kokhba took the title of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] ("prince"). Simon bar Kokhba, the commander of the revolt, was regarded by many Jews as the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]], who would restore their national independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John S.

The Roman army was made of six full [[Roman legion|legions]] with [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] and elements from up to six additional legions, which finally managed to crush the revolt.&lt;ref name="Israel-Tour-Day"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616233531/http://www.rsy-netzer.org.uk/newsletters/mailing-view/65.html|archivedate=16 June 2011|title=Israel Tour Daily Newsletter|url=http://www.rsy-netzer.org.uk/newsletters/mailing-view/65.html|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bar Kokhba revolt resulted in the extensive depopulation of Judean communities, more so than during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] of 70 CE.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = J. E. |publisher = Oxford University Press |quote= Up until this date the Bar Kokhba documents indicate that towns, villages and ports where Jews lived were busy with industry and activity. Afterwards there is an eerie silence, and the archaeological record testifies to little Jewish presence until the Byzantine era, in En Gedi. This picture coheres with what we have already determined in Part I of this study, that the crucial date for what can only be described as genocide, and the devastation of Jews and Judaism within central Judea, was 135 CE and not, as usually assumed, 70 CE, despite the siege of Jerusalem and the Temple's destruction | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XWIMFY4VnI4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=bar+kokhba%22+genocide%22&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=koFNUrWtHoeD4ASHqYDYDQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=bar%20kokhba%22%20genocide%22&amp;f=false | title = The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cassius Dio]], 580,000 Jews perished in the war and many more died of hunger and disease.

''The archaeology of Ancient Judea and Palestine''. Getty Publications, 2005 p. 33. "It seems clear that by choosing a seemingly neutral name - one juxtaposing that of a neighboring province with the revived name of an ancient geographical entity (Palestine), already known from the writings of Herodotus - Hadrian was intending to suppress any connection between the Jewish people and that land." {{ISBN|0-89236-800-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1TA-Fg4wBnUC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=intentionally+suppressed+jewish+national+Aelia+Capitolina+Palaestina&amp;sig=xxUlDy9oYikzsdYmFHP0E-lDFE8 ''The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered''] by Peter Schäfer, {{ISBN|3-16-148076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is only [[circumstantial evidence]] linking [[Hadrian]] with the name change and the precise date is not certain.&lt;ref name=F90&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|1990|p=19}}: "While it is true that there is no evidence as to precisely who changed the name of Judaea to Palestine and precisely when this was done, circumstantial evidence would seem to point to Hadrian himself, since he is, it would seem, responsible for a number of decrees that sought to crush the national and religious spirit of thejews, whether these decrees were responsible for the uprising or were the result of it. In the first place, he refounded Jerusalem as a Graeco-Roman city under the name of Aelia Capitolina. He also erected on the site of the Temple another temple to Zeus."&lt;/ref&gt; The common view that the name change was intended to "sever the connection of the Jews to their historical homeland" is disputed.{{sfn|Jacobson|2001|p=44-45|ps=: "Hadrian officially renamed Judea Syria Palaestina after his Roman armies suppressed the Bar-Kokhba Revolt (the Second Jewish Revolt) in 135 C.E.; this is commonly viewed as a move intended to sever the connection of the Jews to their historical homeland. However, that Jewish writers such as Philo, in particular, and Josephus, who flourished while Judea was still formally in existence, used the name Palestine for the Land of Israel in their Greek works, suggests that this interpretation of history is mistaken. Hadrian’s choice of Syria Palaestina may be more correctly seen as a rationalization of the name of the new province, in accordance with its area being far larger than geographical Judea. Indeed, Syria Palaestina had an ancient pedigree that was intimately linked with the area of greater Israel."}}

The Bar Kokhba revolt greatly influenced the course of Jewish history and the philosophy of the Jewish religion. Despite easing the persecution of Jews following Hadrian's death in 138 CE, the Romans barred Jews from [[Jerusalem]], except for attendance in [[Tisha B'Av]]. [[Jewish messianism]] was abstracted and spiritualized, and rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative. The [[Talmud]], for instance, refers to Bar Kokhba as "Ben-Kusiba," a derogatory term used to indicate that he was a [[List of Jewish messiah claimants|false Messiah]]. It was also among the key events to [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|differentiate]] Christianity as a religion distinct from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Avi-Yonah, ''The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule'', Jerusalem 1984 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Jewish Christian]]s regarded Jesus as the Messiah and did not support Bar Kokhba,&lt;ref&gt;Justin, "Apologia", ii.71, compare "Dial." cx; Eusebius "Hist.

==Background==
{{Main|Jewish–Roman wars}}

After the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66-73 CE), the Roman authorities took measures to suppress the rebellious province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea]]. Instead of a [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]], they installed a [[praetor]] as a [[Roman governor|governor]] and stationed an entire [[Roman legion|legion]], the [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']], in the area. Tensions continued to build up in the wake of the [[Kitos War]], the second large-scale Jewish insurrection in the Eastern Mediterranean during 115-117, the final stages of which saw fighting in Judea. Mismanagement of the province during the early 2nd century might well have led to the proximate causes of the revolt, largely bringing governors with clear anti-Jewish sentiments to run the province.

Historians have suggested multiple reasons for the sparking of the Bar Kokhba revolt, long-term and proximate. Several elements are believed to have contributed to the rebellion; changes in administrative law, the diffuse presence of Romans, alterations in agricultural practice with a shift from landowning to sharecropping, the impact of a possible period of economic decline, and an upsurge of nationalism, the latter influenced by similar revolts among the Jewish communities in Egypt, Cyrenaica and Mesopotamia during the reign of Trajan in the [[Kitos War]].&lt;ref name="Eshel" /&gt; The proximate reasons seem to centre around the construction of a new city, [[Aelia Capitolina]], over the ruins of Jerusalem and the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the Temple mount.&lt;ref name="Eshel" /&gt; One interpretation involves the visit in 130 CE of [[Hadrian]] to the ruins of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. At first sympathetic towards the Jews, Hadrian promised to rebuild the Temple, but the Jews felt betrayed when they found out that he intended to build a temple dedicated to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] upon the ruins of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name=Dio /&gt; A rabbinic version of this story claims that Hadrian planned on rebuilding the Temple, but that a malevolent [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] convinced him not to. The reference to a malevolent Samaritan is, however, a familiar device of Jewish literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World: The Jews of Palestine from Alexander the Great to the Arab Conquest | first = Peter | last = Schäfer | authorlink = Peter Schäfer | publisher = Routledge | date = 2003 | page = 146 | others = Translated by David Chowcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional legion, the [[Legio VI Ferrata|VI ''Ferrata'']], arrived in the province to maintain order. Works on Aelia Capitolina, as Jerusalem was to be called, commenced in 131 CE.

==Timeline of events==
===First phase===
====Eruption of the revolt====
Jewish leaders carefully planned the second revolt to avoid the numerous mistakes that had plagued the first [[Great Jewish Revolt]] sixty years earlier.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 132, the revolt, led by [[Simon bar Kokhba]] and [[Eleazar of Modi'im|Elasar]], quickly spread from [[Modi'in]] across the country, cutting off the Roman garrison in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Axelrod 2009 29"/&gt; Although Rufus was in charge during the early phase of the uprising, he disappears from the record after 132 for unknown reasons. Shortly after the eruption of the revolt, Bar Kokhba's rebels inflicted heavy casualties to [[Legio X Fretensis]], based in Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem). At that point, [[Legio VI Ferrata]] was sent to reinforce the Roman position from [[Lajjun|Legio base]] in Yizrael Valley, fielding altogether some 20,000 Roman troops, but was unable to subdue the rebels, who nearly conquered Jerusalem.

====Stalemate and reinforcements====
Given the continuing inability of Legio X and Legio VI to subdue the rebels, additional reinforcements were dispatched from neighbouring provinces. [[Gaius Publicus Marcellus]], the Legate of Roman Syria, arrived commanding [[Legio III Gallica]], while [[Titus Haterius Nepos]], the governor of [[Roman Arabia]], brought [[Legio III Cyrenaica]]. Later on it is assumed that [[Legio XXII Deiotariana]] was sent from [[Arabia Petraea]], but was ambushed and massacred on its way to Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem), possibly disbanding as a result. [[Legio II Traiana Fortis]], previously stationed in Egypt, may have also arrived in Judea in this stage. By that time the number of Roman troops stood at nearly 80,000 in the area, a number still inferior to rebel forces, who were also better familiar with the terrain and occupied strong fortifications.

Many Jews from the diaspora made their way to Judea to join Bar Kokhba's forces from the beginning of the rebellion, with the traditional assumption being that hard tests were imposed on recruits due to the inflated number of volunteers. From some documents evidence was also found for non-Jews enlisting in Bar Kokhba's forces, though it is not conclusive. According to Jewish sources some 400,000 men were at the disposal of Bar Kokhba at the peak of the rebellion, though historians tend to more conservative numbers of 200,000.

===Second phase===
====From guerilla warfare to open engagement====
The outbreak and initial success of the rebellion took the Romans by surprise. The rebels incorporated combined tactics to fight the Roman Army. According to some historians, Bar Kokhba's army mostly practiced guerrilla warfare, inflicting heavy casualties. This view is largely supported by Cassius Dio, who wrote that the revolt began with covert attacks in line with preparation of hideout systems, though after taking over the fortresses Bar Kokhba turned to direct engagement due to his superiority in numbers. Only after several painful defeats in the field did the Romans decide to avoid open conflict and instead methodically besiege individual Judean cities.

====Rebel statehood====

Simon Bar Kokhba took the title ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi Israel]]'' and ruled over an entity that was virtually independent for two and a half years. The Jewish sage [[Rabbi Akiva]] identified Simon Bar Kosiba as the [[Jewish messiah]], and gave him the surname "Bar Kokhba" meaning "Son of a Star" in the [[Aramaic language]], from the [[Star Prophecy]] verse from [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb|Numbers|24:17}}: "There shall come a star out of [[Jacob]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Numbers|24:17}}: There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of [[Moab]], and destroy all the children of [[Sheth]].&lt;/ref&gt; The name [[Bar Kokhba (disambiguation)|Bar Kokhba]] does not appear in the Talmud but in ecclesiastical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |chapter = BAR KOKBA AND BAR KOKBA WAR | chapterurl = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2464-bar-cochba-bar-cochbah | encyclopedia = [[The Jewish Encyclopedia]] | date = 1906 | editor-last = Singer | editor-first = Isidore | first=S. |last=Krauss |volume=2 |pages = 506–507 | quote = Bar Kokba, the hero of the third war against Rome, appears under this name only among ecclesiastical writers: heathen authors do not mention him; and Jewish sources call him Ben (or Bar) Koziba or Kozba...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era of the [[Salvation#Judaism|redemption of Israel]] was announced, contracts were signed and a large quantity of [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage|Bar Kokhba Revolt coinage]] was struck over foreign coins.

====From open warfare to rebel defensive tactics====
With the slowly advancing Roman army cutting supply lines, the rebels engaged in long-term defense. The defense system of Judean towns and villages was based mainly on [[hideout caves]], which were created in large numbers in almost every population center. Many houses utilized underground hideouts, where Judean rebels hoped to withstand Roman superiority by the narrowness of the passages and even ambushes from underground. The cave systems were often interconnected and used not only as hideouts for the rebels but also for storage and refuge for their families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1TA-Fg4wBnUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=bar+kokhba+hideout+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GlaA7CVIKX&amp;sig=R13hJeDivoHpHlk1b-reENSmo4o&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D8hfVIPzIMPgavnigqAP&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bar%20kokhba%20hideout%20systems&amp;f=false Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. p184]&lt;/ref&gt; Hideout systems were employed in the Judean hills, the Judean desert, northern Negev, and to some degree also in Galilee, Samaria and Jordan Valley. As of July 2015 some 350 hideout systems have been mapped within the ruins of 140 Jewish villages.&lt;ref name=nrg/&gt;

===Third phase===
====Julius Severus' campaign====
[[File:Bar Kokhba's papyrus.png|thumb|200px|left|A cluster of [[papyrus]] containing Bar Kokhba's orders during the last year of the revolt, found at the [[Cave of Letters]] in the Judean desert by Israeli archaeologist [[Yigael Yadin]].]]
Following a series of setbacks, Hadrian called his general [[Sextus Julius Severus]] from [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and troops were brought from as far as the [[Danube]]. In 133/4, Severus landed in Judea with a massive army, bringing 3 Legions from Europe (including [[Legio X Gemina]] and possibly also [[Legio IX Hispana]]), cohorts of additional legions and between 30 and 50 auxiliary units. He took the title of provincial governor and initiated a massive campaign to systematically subdue Judean rebel forces. Severus' arrival almost doubled the number of Roman troops facing the rebels.

The size of the Roman army amassed against the rebels was much larger than that commanded by [[Titus]] sixty years earlier - nearly one third of the Roman army took part in the campaign against Bar Kokhba. It is estimated that forces from at least 10 Legions participated in Severus' campaign in Judea, including [[Legio X Fretensis]], [[Legio VI Ferrata]], [[Legio III Gallica]], [[Legio III Cyrenaica]], [[Legio II Traiana Fortis]], [[Legio X Gemina]], cohorts of [[Legio V Macedonica]], cohorts of [[Legio XI Claudia]], cohorts of [[Legio XII Fulminata]] and cohorts of [[Legio IV Flavia Felix]], along with 30-50 auxiliary units, for a total force of 60,000–120,000 Roman soldiers facing Bar Kokhba's rebels. As noted above, it is plausible that [[Legio IX Hispana]] was among the legions Severus brought with him, and that its demise occurred during Severus' campaign, as its disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.&lt;ref name="livius.org"/&gt;

====Battle of Tel Shalem====
According to some views, one of the crucial battles of the war took place near Tel Shalem in the [[Beit She'an]] valley, near what is now identified as the legionary camp of Legio VI Ferrata. Next to the camp, archaeologists have unearthed the remnants of a triumphal arch, which featured a dedication to Emperor Hadrian, which most likely refers to the defeat of Bar Kokhba's army.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. P172.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional finds at Tel Shalem, including a bust of Emperor Hadrian, specifically link the site to the period. The theory for a major battle in Tel Shalem implies a significant extension of the area of the rebellion - while some historians confine the conflict to Judea proper, the location of Tel Shalem suggests that the war encompassed the northern Jordan Valley as well, some 50&amp;nbsp;km north of the war's minimal boundaries.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Judean highlands and desert====
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20047 Archeological sites of Israel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Remains of [[Hurvat Itri]], destroyed during the Bar Kokhba revolt]]
{{main|Herodium}}
[[Simon bar Kokhba]] declared Herodium as his secondary headquarters. Archaeological evidence for the revolt was found all over the site, from the outside buildings to the water system under the mountain. Inside the water system, supporting walls built by the rebels were discovered, and another system of caves was found. Inside one of the caves, burned wood was found which was dated to the time of the revolt. The fortress was besieged by the Romans in late 134 and was taken by the end of the year or early in 135. Its commander was [[Yeshua ben Galgula]], likely Bar Kokhba's second in command.

===Fourth phase===
{{see|Cave of Horror|Cave of Letters}}
The last phase of the revolt is characterized by Bar Kokhba's loss of territorial control, with the exception of the surroundings of the Betar fortress, where he made his last stand against the Romans. The Roman Army had meanwhile turned to eradicate smaller fortresses and hideout systems of captured villages, turning the conquest into a campaign of annihilation.

====Siege of Betar====
[[File:Beitar-169.jpg|thumb|200px|Ruined walls of the Beitar fortress, the last stand of Bar Kokhba]]
{{main|Betar (fortress)}}
After losing many of their strongholds, Bar Kokhba and the remnants of his army withdrew to the fortress of [[Betar (fortress)|Betar]], which subsequently came under siege in the summer of 135. [[Legio V Macedonica]] and [[Legio XI Claudia]] are said to have taken part in the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the Years 1873-1874'', London 1899, pp. 463-470&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jewish tradition, the fortress was breached and destroyed on the fast of [[Tisha B'av]], the ninth day of the lunar month Av, a day of mourning for the destruction of the First and the Second Jewish Temple. Rabbinical literature ascribes the defeat to Bar Kokhba killing his maternal uncle, Rabbi [[Eleazar of Modi'im|Elazar Hamudaʻi]], after suspecting him of collaborating with the enemy, thereby forfeiting Divine protection.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] iv. 68d; [[Lamentations Rabbah]] ii. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The horrendous scene after the city's capture could be best described as a massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud, ''Taanit'' 4:5 (24a); Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:5).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jerusalem Talmud relates that the number of dead in Betar was enormous, that the Romans "went on killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] 4:5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roman Inscription found near Bettir in 19th century.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Inscription found near Battir mentioning the 5th and 11th Roman Legions]]

====Final accords====
According to a Rabbinic [[midrash]], the Romans executed eight leading members of the [[Sanhedrin]] (The list of [[Ten Martyrs]] include two earlier Rabbis): [[Rabbi Akiva|R. Akiva]]; R. [[Hanania ben Teradion]]; the interpreter of the Sanhedrin, R. Huspith; R. [[Eliezer ben Shamua]]; R. [[Hanina ben Hakinai]]; R. [[Jeshbab the Scribe]]; R. Yehuda ben Dama; and R. [[Yehuda ben Baba]]. The Rabbinic account describes agonizing tortures: R. Akiva was flayed with iron combs, R. Ishmael had the skin of his head pulled off slowly, and R. Hanania was burned at a stake, with wet wool held by a Torah scroll wrapped around his body to prolong his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=228&amp;letter=M Martyrs, The Ten] ''Jewish Encyclopedia'': "The fourth martyr was Hananiah ben Teradion, who was wrapped in a scroll of the Law and placed on a pyre of green brushwood; to prolong his agony, wet wool was placed on his chest."&lt;/ref&gt; Bar Kokhba's fate is not certain, with two alternative traditions in the Babylonian Talmud ascribing the death of Bar Kokhba either to a snake bite or other natural causes during the Roman siege or possibly killed on the orders of the Sanhedrin, as a [[List of Jewish messiah claimants|false Messiah]]. According to [[Lamentations Rabbah]], the head of Bar Kokhba was presented to Emperor Hadrian after the Siege of Betar.

Following the Fall of Betar, the Roman forces went on a rampage of systematic killing, eliminating all remaining Jewish villages in the region and seeking out the refugees. [[Legio III Cyrenaica]] was the main force to execute this last phase of the campaign. Historians disagree on the duration of the Roman campaign following the fall of Betar. While some claim further resistance was broken quickly, others argue that pockets of Jewish rebels continued to hide with their families into the winter months of late 135 and possibly even spring 136. By early 136 however, it is clear that the revolt was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. P160. "Thus it is very likely that the revolt ended only in early 136."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews were killed in the overall operations, and 50 fortified towns and 985 villages were razed to the ground,&lt;ref name=Dio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/mosaic.html "Mosaic or mosaic?—The Genesis of the Israeli Language"] by Zuckermann, Gilad&lt;/ref&gt; with many more Jews dying of famine and disease. The Jewish communities of Judea were devastated to an extent which some scholars describe as a [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.co.il"/&gt; Schäfer suggests that Dio exaggerated his numbers.&lt;ref name="schafer-1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schäfer|first1=P.|title=Der Bar Kochba-Aufstand|date=1981|location=Tübingen|pages=131ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Cotton considered Dio's figures highly plausible, in light of accurate Roman census declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Schäfer. ''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. P142-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Judean war captives were sold into slavery.&lt;ref name="Mor, M. 2016. P471"/&gt;

The revolt was led by the Judean [[Pharisees]], with other Jewish and non-Jewish factions also playing a role. Jewish communities of Galilee who sent militants to the revolt in Judea were largely spared total destruction, though they did suffer persecutions and massive executions. Samaria partially supported the revolt, with evidence accumulating that notable numbers of Samaritan youths participated in Bar Kokhba's campaigns; though Roman wrath was directed at Samaritans, their cities were also largely spared from the total destruction unleashed on Judea. [[Eusebius]] of Caesarea wrote that [[Jewish Christians]] were killed and suffered "all kinds of persecutions" at the hands of rebel Jews when they refused to help Bar Kokhba against the Roman troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ja-jn/jewish_wars/bk03.html#Justin.|title=Texts on Bar Kochba: Eusebius|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourgel, Jonathan, ″The Jewish-Christians in the storm of the Bar Kokhba Revolt″, in: ''From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome (66-135/6 EC)''. Paris: Éditions du Cerf, collection Judaïsme ancien et Christianisme primitive, (French), pp. 127-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Roman population of the region also suffered severely during the early stage of the revolt, persecuted by Bar Kokhba's forces.

Cassius Dio also wrote: "Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore, Hadrian, in writing to the Senate, did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors: 'If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the army are in health.'"&lt;ref name=Cassius&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History''&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the exceptional number of preserved Roman veteran diplomas from the late 150s and 160 CE indicate an unprecedented conscription across the Roman Empire to replenish heavy losses within military legions and auxilary units between 133 to 135, corresponding to the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;E. Werner. ''The bar Kokhba Revolt: The Roman Point of View. The Journal of Roman Studies Vol. 89 (1999), pp. 76-89. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/300735]&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, [[Legio XXII Deiotariana|XXII ''Deiotariana'']] was disbanded after serious losses.&lt;ref name="F. Keppie 2000 pp 228-229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="livius.org account"/&gt; In addition, as also noted above, some historians argue that [[Legio IX Hispana]]'s disbandment in the mid-2nd century could have been a result of this war.&lt;ref name="livius.org"/&gt; Previously it had generally been accepted that the Ninth disappeared around 108 CE, possibly suffering its demise in Britain, according to Mommsen; but archaeological findings in 2015 from Nijmegen, dated to 121 CE, contained the known inscriptions of two senior officers who were deputy commanders of the Ninth in 120 CE, and lived on for several decades to lead distinguished public careers. It was concluded that the Legion was disbanded between 120 and 197 CE - either as a result of fighting the Bar Kokhba revolt, or in Cappadocia (161), or at the Danube (162).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/legion/legio-viiii-hispana/|title=Legio VIIII Hispana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legio X Fretensis]] sustained heavy casualties during the revolt.&lt;ref name=mor334/&gt;

After the suppression of the revolt, Hadrian's proclamations sought to root out Jewish nationalism in Judea,&lt;ref name="Eshel"/&gt; which he saw as the cause of the repeated rebellions. He prohibited [[Torah]] law and the [[Hebrew calendar]], and executed Judaic scholars. The sacred scrolls of Judaism were ceremonially burned on the [[Temple Mount]]. At the former Temple sanctuary, he installed two statues, one of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], another of himself. In an attempt to erase any memory of Judea or [[Ancient Israel]], he wiped the name off the map and replaced it with [[Syria Palaestina]].&lt;ref name="H.H. Ben-Sasson, 1976, page 334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ariel Lewin p. 33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered"/&gt; By destroying the association of Jews with Judea and forbidding the practice of the Jewish faith, Hadrian aimed to root out a nation that had inflicted heavy casualties on the Roman Empire. Similarly, he re-established Jerusalem as the Roman pagan [[polis]] of Aelia Capitolina, with Jews forbidden to enter, except on the day of [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', page 334: "Jews were forbidden to live in the city and were allowed to visit it only once a year, on the Ninth of Ab, to mourn on the ruins of their holy Temple."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians view the Bar Kokhba Revolt as having decisive historic importance.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; They note that, unlike the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] chronicled by [[Josephus]], the Jewish population of Judea was devastated after the Bar Kokhba Revolt,&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; being killed, exiled, or sold into slavery, and Jewish religious and political authority was suppressed far more brutally than before. The Jews suffered a serious blow in Jerusalem and its environs in Judea, but the Jewish communities thrived in the remaining regions of Palestine—e.g., [[Galilee]], [[Bet Shean]], [[Caesarea]], [[Golan]] and along the edges of Judea&lt;ref name=CambridgeJudaism/&gt; The massive destruction and death in the course of the revolt has led scholars such as [[Bernard Lewis]] to date the beginning of the [[Jewish diaspora]] from this date. Hadrian's death in 138 CE marked a significant relief to the surviving Jewish communities. Some of the Judean survivors resettled in Galilee, with some rabbinical families gathering in [[Sepphoris]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1984, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KcsUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA132 132]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbinic Judaism]] had already become a portable religion, centered around [[synagogue]]s.

[[Image:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Galilee]] in [[late antiquity]]]]
Judea would not be a center of Jewish religious, cultural, or political life again until the modern era, although Jews continued to sporadically populate it and important religious developments still took place there. [[Galilee]] became an important center of Rabbinic Judaism, where the Jerusalem Talmud was compiled in the 4th-5th centuries CE. In the aftermath of the defeat, the maintenance of Jewish settlement in Palestine became a major concern of the rabbinate.&lt;ref name=smelik/&gt; The Sages endeavoured to halt Jewish [[Jewish diaspora|dispersal]], and even banned emigration from Palestine, branding those who settled outside its borders as idolaters.&lt;ref name=smelik&gt;Willem F. Smelik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tju-IreyEDMC&amp;pg=PA434 ''The Targum of Judges,''] BRILL 1995 p.434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later relations between the Jews and the Roman Empire===
{{Main|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
Relations between the Jews in the region and the Roman Empire continued to be complicated. [[Constantine the Great and Judaism|Constantine I]] allowed Jews to mourn their defeat and humiliation once a year on [[Tisha B'Av]] at the [[Western Wall]]. In 351–352 CE, the Jews of Galilee launched [[Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus|yet another revolt]], provoking heavy retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lazare and Robert Wistrich, Antisemitism: Its History and Causes, University of Nebraska Press, 1995, I, pp.46-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallus revolt came during the rising influence of early Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire, under the [[Constantinian dynasty]]. In 355, however, the relations with the Roman rulers improved, upon the rise of Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the last of the Constantinian dynasty, who, unlike his predecessors, defied Christianity. In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Sassanian Persia, he ordered the Jewish Temple rebuilt in his effort to foster religions other than Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to rebuild the Temple has mostly been ascribed to the dramatic [[Galilee earthquake of 363]], and traditionally also to the Jews' ambivalence about the [[Third Temple|project]]. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire, though Christian historians of the time ascribed it to divine intervention.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html "Julian and the Jews 361–363 CE"] (Fordham University, The Jesuit University of New York) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20051020130904/http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html "Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple"].&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's support of [[Judaism]] caused Jews to call him "Julian the [[Hellenes (religion)|Hellene]]".&lt;ref&gt;A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews, [[Avner Falk]]&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's fatal wound in the Persian campaign put an end to Jewish aspirations, and Julian's successors embraced Christianity through the entirety of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]] of Jerusalem, preventing any Jewish claims.

In 438 CE, when the Empress [[Licinia Eudoxia|Eudocia]] removed the ban on Jews' praying at the [[Temple Mount|Temple site]], the heads of the Community in Galilee issued a call "to the great and mighty people of the Jews" which began: "Know that the end of the exile of our people has come!" However the Christian population of the city saw this as a threat to their primacy, and a riot erupted which chased Jews from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Avraham Yaari, ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' (Tel Aviv, 1943), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com?id=8O95ErDSZQgC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=eudocia+jews+temple+mount&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HcA_VaDeN4iWuASh_YDYAw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eudocia%20jews%20temple%20mount&amp;f=false|title=Remains of the Jews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 5th and the 6th centuries, a series of [[Samaritan revolts]] broke out across the [[Palaestina Prima]] province. Especially violent were the third and the fourth revolts, which resulted in near annihilation of the Samaritan community.&lt;ref&gt;Shalev-Hurvitz, V. Oxford University Press 2015. p235&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the [[Samaritan revolts#556 Samaritan revolt|Samaritan revolt of 556]] was joined by the Jewish community, which had also suffered brutal suppression of their religion under Emperor Justianian.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, C. 2005. p.127 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41443760?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J.A.S. 2005. "Jews and Samaritans". [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=xDNv6qZ_I-IC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;lpg=PR30&amp;dq=oppression+jews+justinian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kcmnRxrTgl&amp;sig=I14_xIbyfpcqesRcCBRe7xjPkXw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMkpvkhb_dAhUOCuwKHWtOBF04ChDoATACegQIAxAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the belief of restoration to come, in the early 7th century the Jews made an [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|alliance]] with the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]], joining the Persian invasion of Palaestina Prima in 614 to overwhelm the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] garrison, and gaining autonomous rule over Jerusalem.&lt;ref name = "Phoenicia"&gt;{{cite book |title= Itineraria Phoenicia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA542&amp;dq=Opusculum+de+Persica+captivitate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IzofU5aPGIfiqAGVoIHwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Opusculum%20de%20Persica%20captivitate&amp;f=false| author = Edward Lipiński |publisher = Peeters Publishers |pages = 542–543 |year = 2004 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their autonomy was brief: the [[Nehemiah ben Hushiel|Jewish leader]] was shortly assassinated during a Christian revolt and, though Jerusalem was reconquered by Persians and Jews within 3 weeks, it fell into anarchy. With the subsequent withdrawal of Persian forces, Jews surrendered to the Byzantines in 625 CE or 628 CE, but were massacred by Christian radicals in 629 CE, with the survivors fleeing to Egypt. Byzantine control of the region was finally lost to Muslim Arab armies in 637 CE, when [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] completed the conquest of Akko.

===Legacy===
In the post-rabbinical era, the Bar Kokhba Revolt became a symbol of valiant national resistance. The [[Zionist youth movement]] [[Betar]] took its name from Bar Kokhba's traditional last stronghold, and [[David Ben-Gurion]], Israel's first prime minister, took his Hebrew last name from one of Bar Kokhba's generals.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.knesset.gov.il/vip/BenGurion/eng/BenGurion_Bio_eng.html]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The disastrous end of the revolt also occasioned major changes in Jewish religious thought. [[Jewish messianism]] was abstracted and spiritualized, and rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative. The Talmud, for instance, refers to Bar Kokhba as "Ben-Kusiba," a derogatory term used to indicate that he was a false Messiah. The deeply ambivalent rabbinical position regarding Messianism, as expressed most famously in [[Maimonides]] "Epistle to Yemen," would seem to have its origins in the attempt to deal with the trauma of a failed Messianic uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource: "[[s:Epistle to Yemen|Epistle to Yemen]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular children's song, included in the curriculum of Israeli kindergartens, has the refrain "Bar Kokhba was a Hero/He fought for Liberty," and its words describe Bar Kokhba as being captured and thrown into a lion's den, but managing to escape riding on the lion's back.&lt;ref name="The-military-and-militarism-in-Israeli-society"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tRwTElL0pKcC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22Bar+Kokhba+was+a+Hero%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h6CwBDnkC4&amp;sig=wqE7xGkFXX6niO4HZ6DlAqa0tgw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RWOBTJm9J4WglAeS_sGUDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bar%20Kokhba%20was%20a%20Hero%22&amp;f=false The military and militarism in Israeli society]'' by Edna Lomsky-Feder, Eyal Ben-Ari]." Retrieved on September 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic extent of the revolt==
It is generally accepted that the Bar Kokhba revolt encompassed all of Judea, namely the villages of the [[Judean hills]], the Judean desert, and northern parts of the [[Negev]] desert. The minimalistic approach limits the borders of the war to these areas, but there are also significant findings which may support a wider view of the extent of the revolt. Among those findings are the rebel hideout systems in the Galilee, which greatly resemble the Bar Kokhba hideouts in Judea, and though are less numerous, are nevertheless important. Several historians theorize that the Tel Shalem arch depicted a major battle between Roman armies and Bar Kokhba's rebels in Bet Shean valley, thus extending the battle areas some 50&amp;nbsp;km northwards from Judea. The 2013 discovery of the military camp of [[Legio VI Ferrata]] near [[Tel Megiddo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/197910#.VdAs6vmqqko|title=Roman Legion Camp Unearthed in Megiddo - Inside Israel - News  - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing excavations there may shed light to extension of the rebellion to the northern valleys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} A 2015 archaeological survey in Samaria identified some 40 hideout cave systems from the period, some containing Bar Kokhba's minted coins, suggesting that the war raged in Samaria at high intensity.&lt;ref name=nrg&gt;{{lang-he|התגלית שהוכיחה: מרד בר כוכבא חל גם בשומרון}} [http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/709/420.html] NRG. 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence to support war operations on the coastal plain and as far as Transjordan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The fact that Galilee retained its Jewish character after the end of the revolt has been taken as an indication by some that either the revolt was never joined by Galilee or that the rebellion was crushed relatively early there compared to Judea.&lt;ref name="Harkabi1983"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb00WGipKCIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA37|title=The Bar Kokhba Syndrome: Risk and Realism in International Politics|author=Yehoshafat Harkabi|publisher=SP Books|year=1983|isbn=978-0-940646-01-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1951, [[Bar Kokhba Revolt coinage]] was the sole archaeological evidence for dating the revolt.&lt;ref name=Eshel/&gt; These coins include references to "Year One of the redemption of Israel", "Year Two of the freedom of Israel", and "For the freedom of Jerusalem". Despite the reference to Jerusalem, recent archaeological finds, and the lack of revolt coinage found in Jerusalem, supports the view that the revolt did not capture Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Eshel-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Eshel|2003|pp=95–96}}: "Returning to the Bar Kokhba revolt, we should note that up until the discovery of the first Bar Kokhba documents in Wadi Murabba'at in 1951, Bar Kokhba coins were the sole archaeological evidence available for dating the revolt. Based on coins overstock by the Bar Kokhba administration, scholars dated the beginning of the Bar Kokhba regime to the conquest of Jerusalem by the rebels. The coins in question bear the following inscriptions: "Year One of the redemption of Israel", "Year Two of the freedom of Israel", and "For the freedom of Jerusalem". Up until 1948 some scholars argued that the "Freedom of Jerusalem" coins predated the others, based upon their assumption that the dating of the Bar Kokhba regime began with the rebel capture Jerusalem." L. Mildenberg's study of the dies of the Bar Kokhba definitely established that the "Freedom of Jerusalem" coins were struck later than the ones inscribed "Year Two of the freedom of Israel". He dated them to the third year of the revolt.' Thus, the view that the dating of the Bar Kokhba regime began with the conquest of Jerusalem is untenable. lndeed, archeological finds from the past quarter-century, and the absence of Bar Kokhba coins in Jerusalem in particular, support the view that the rebels failed to take Jerusalem at all."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The revolt is mostly still shrouded in mystery, and only one brief historical account of the rebellion survives.&lt;ref name="Eshel" &gt;Hanan Eshel,[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjtWLZhhMoYC&amp;pg=PA105 'The Bar Kochba revolt, 132-135,'] in William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein, Steven T. Katz (eds.) ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period,'' pp.105-127, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; The best recognized source for the revolt is [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' (book 69),&lt;ref name=Dio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai, Gihon.

The Jerusalem Talmud contains descriptions of the results of the rebellion, including the Roman executions of Judean leaders.

''The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered''. 2003. p184.&lt;/ref&gt; which contained letters actually written by Bar Kokhba and his followers, has added much new primary source data, indicating among other things that there was a pronounced foreign contingent among Bar Kokhba's forces, accounted for by the fact that his military correspondence was, in part, conducted in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Gichon, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454444  'New Insight into the Bar Kokhba War and a Reappraisal of Dio Cassius 69.12-13,'] [[The Jewish Quarterly Review]], Vol. 77, No. 1 (Jul., 1986), pp. 15-43, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Several more brief sources have been uncovered in the area over the past century, including references to the revolt from Nabatea and Roman Syria. Roman inscriptions in [[Tel Shalem]], Betar fortress, Jerusalem and other locations also contribute to the current historical understanding of the Bar Kokhba War.

==Archaeology==
===Cave of Letters===
{{main|Cave of Letters}}
[[File:BabathaScroll.jpg|thumb|A scroll found in the cave, part of the [[Babatha]] archive]]
The [[Cave of Letters]] was surveyed in explorations conducted in 1960-61, when letters and fragments of papyri were found dating back to the period of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Some of these were personal letters between [[Bar Kokhba]] and his subordinates, and one notable bundle of papyri, known as the Babata or [[Babatha]] cache, revealed the life and trials of a woman, Babata, who lived during this period.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Roman Imperial inscription in Jerusalem===
In 2014, one half of a Latin inscription was discovered in Jerusalem during excavations near the Damascus Gate.&lt;ref name=i24news&gt;Jerusalem Post. 21 October 2014 [https://www.jpost.com/Not-Just-News/WATCH-2000-year-old-commemorative-inscription-dedicated-to-Roman-emperor-Hadrian-unveiled-379384 WATCH: 2,000-YEAR-OLD INSCRIPTION DEDICATED TO ROMAN EMPEROR UNVEILED IN JERUSALEM]&lt;/ref&gt; It was identified as the right half of a complete inscription, the other part of which was discovered nearby in the late 19th century and is currently on display in the courtyard of Jerusalem's Studium Biblicum Franciscanum Museum. The complete inscription was translated as follows:
:: To the Imperator Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus, son of the deified Traianus Parthicus, grandson of the deified Nerva, high priest, invested with tribunician power for the 14th time, consul for the third time, father of the country (dedicated by) the 10th legion Fretensis Antoniniana.
The inscription was dedicated by Legio X Fretensis to the emperor Hadrian in the year 129/130 CE. The inscription is considered to greatly strengthen the claim that indeed the Emperor visited Jerusalem that year, supporting the traditional claim that Hadrian's visit was among the main causes of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, and not the other way around.&lt;ref name=i24news/&gt;

===Betar fortress===
The ruins of Betar, the last fortress of Bar Kokhba, destroyed by Hadrian's legions in 135 CE, is located in the vicinity of the towns of [[Battir]] and [[Beitar Illit]]. A stone inscription bearing Latin characters and discovered near Betar shows that the [[Legio V Macedonica|Fifth Macedonian Legion]] and the [[Legio XI Claudia|Eleventh Claudian Legion]] took part in the siege.&lt;ref name="C. Clermont-Ganneau, 1899, pp. 263-270"&gt;C. Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the Years 1873-74'', London 1899, pp. 263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chan Kin-man''' ({{zh|陳健民}}, born 1959&lt;ref&gt;[https://webb-site.com/dbpub/bornyear.asp?byear=1959 People born in 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]) is an associate professor of Sociology the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/soc/staff_003.html CHAN Kin-man 陳健民] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123309/http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/soc/staff_003.html |date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the founders of [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace]]  Campaign that strives for [[Universal suffrage in Hong Kong|universal suffrage]] for [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|Hong Kong Chief Executive Election in 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1594585/occupy-centrals-dr-chan-kin-man-looks-era-disobedience Occupy Central's Dr Chan Kin-man looks to 'era of disobedience']&lt;/ref&gt;

In his undergraduate days, Chan was an avid reader and a passionate student activist. In 1983, he graduated from the Department of Sociology of CUHK, and began participating in community work for several years. By walking with the marginal communities, Chan experienced the multitude of social problems, and vowed to push for reforms on the consciousness and institutional levels.

Since 1993, he has been teaching at the [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/soc/ Department of Sociology at CUHK], and will be retiring in 2019. Chan enjoys teaching, and has been honoured as the best lecturer by university and student organizations on multiple occasions&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chankinman.wordpress.com/about_me/|title=個人簡介|date=2008-10-12|work=陳健民網站|access-date=2018-11-28|language=zh-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, his research interests and social participation concern the development of civil societies and democracy in Chinese communities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Over the years in Mainland China and Hong Kong, he has served various positions in the public services, and set up a number of non-governmental organizations. He is currently the director of the Hong Kong Civil Education Foundation and member of the executive committee of the Hong Kong Democratic Development Network. In March, 2013, Chan, together with Benny Tai and Chu Yiu-ming, initiated the nonviolent civil disobedience campaign “[[Occupy Central with Love and Peace]]”, to call for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, which sowed the seeds for the now globally-known [[Umbrella Movement]] in 2014.

== Life and Career ==
Chan graduated from Concordia Lutheran Middle School in 1979, and earned a degree of [[Bachelor of Social Science]] in [[Sociology]] of the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1983, and [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Philosophy]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Sociology of [[Yale University]] in 1990, 1991 and 1995 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chankinman.wordpress.com/about_me/ About me - Chan Kin-man]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early life ====
Chan was a member of [[Chung Chi College]] of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He was actively involved in student movements, and served in the [http://exco.cusu.hk/ Student Union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong] as the external secretary, alongside notable alumni Andy Ho On-tat and Ricky Wong Wai-kay. After graduating from university in 1983, Chan committed to community work to promote the rights of the marginalized.

In 1988, Chan received a scholarship to attend [[Yale University]]. He studied political Sociology and China studies under the supervision of political scientist [[Juan José Linz|Juan J. Linz]] and sociologist [https://sociology.yale.edu/people/deborah-davis Deborah Davis]. He completed his [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Philosophy]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Sociology at Yale in 1990, 1991 and 1995 respectively.[[Chan Kin-man#cite%20note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==== Teaching career ====
In 1993, Chan began teaching at the Sociology Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He is now an associate professor of Sociology and lecturer in Liberal Studies at [[Shaw College (Hong Kong)|Shaw College]]. He was formerly the director of [http://www.hkiaps.cuhk.edu.hk/eng/default.asp Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies] and the director of the Centre for Civil Society Studies. Beyond CUHK, Chan had been a visiting professor, PhD supervisor and chair of the Institute for Civil Society at the [[Sun Yat-sen University]] in China, also a researcher at the [[National Chengchi University]] in Taiwan.

Chan has received multiple teaching awards from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, including the 1999-2000 Exemplary Teaching Award, 1997-1998 Most Popular Lecturer (Sociology Department), and 1995-1996 Best Lecturer (General Education and Elective Courses)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Media ====

Chan writes about Hong Kong’s democracy issues in Hong Kong newspaper ''[[Ming Pao]]'', and ''[https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%B0%91%E9%97%B4 Civil Society]'', a magazine of the [[Sun Yat-sen University]] that concerns China’s NGO environment. He used to be a guest host of the [[RTHK]] current affairs program. Chan was an independent non-executive directors of the [[HKTV|Hong Kong Television Network Limited]] until July 2013.

== Participation in Public Affairs ==
During his early career, Chan focused on corruption issues in China. In recent years, his research focus has shifted to the development of Chinese civil society. He believes that improvements in China’s governance can only take place if there is a balanced development of the government, economy and civil society.

He once made a statement in 2014: “While it is important to supervise and reform the systems of the chief executive and the legislature, yet more has to be done if we want to establish a real democratic system. A healthy democracy requires support from a strong civil society.”

==== Public participation ====
Chan has served as a member on the Community Research Sub-committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, and the Committee on Promoting Acceptance of People Living with HIV/AIDS of the Hong Kong Advisory Council on AIDS.

In 2002, he co-founded civil society group Hong Kong Democratic Development Network with the Reverend Chu Yiu-ming and others. He is the convener of the scholar committee of the Network.

==== Occupy Central with Love and Peace ====
On March 27, 2013, Chan, HKU law professor Benny Tai and the Reverend Chu Yiu-ming issued a public statement on “Occupy Central with Love and Peace,” announcing the start of the nonviolent campaign for universal suffrage rights in Hong Kong.

After the end of the Umbrella Movement, in February 2015, Chan said in an interview: “The younger generation understands the difference between genuine and fake universal suffrage, and the moral power of nonviolence, at the same time, their life energy evolved, and seek for more aggressive resistance. Not all of them agree with the principle of ‘love and peace’, when faced with the choice between civil disobedience and war games. They want radical structural changes, and not just a lesson on civic education. They want equality, mutual respect, being heard, dialogue, democracy, freedom and autonomy. They despise hegemony, corporate greed, bureaucracy, kitsch and selfishness. They believe that they will lose everything, if they make any sort of compromise. 

A poll by the Chinese University of Hong Kong noted 80 percent of the young respondents want to see the implementation of universal suffrage as soon as possible, and as many as 62 percent of those aged between 15 and 24, supported the Umbrella Movement. The pro-government camp will not get what they want, and the real loser will be the government, because no one can destroy an entire generation.

The '''Comilla Model''' was a rural development programme launched in 1959&lt;ref&gt;"Allama Mashriqi and Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan: Two Legends of Pakistan", by Nasim Yousaf, {{ISBN|1-4010-9097-4}} (2003)http://www.nasimyousaf.info&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Pakistan]] Academy for Rural Development (renamed in 1971 the [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]]).  The Academy, which is located on the outskirts of [[Comilla District|Comilla]] town, was founded by [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], the [[cooperative]] pioneer who was responsible for developing and launching the programme.&lt;ref&gt;Akhter Hameed Khan, Director's Speech in First Annual Report, Comilla, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the results of the Model ultimately frustrated Khan's ambitions, it has important implications for [[rural community development]], particularly [[cooperative]] [[microfinance]] and microcredit&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F Raper, Rural Development in Action: The Comprehensive Experiment at Comilla, East Pakistan, Cornell University Press: Ithaca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2007, Nasim Yousaf,"Dr. Akhter Hameed Khan – The Pioneer of Microcredit"http://www.akhtar-hameed-khan.8m.com/drkhan-microcredit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and purpose ==

The Comilla Model was Khan's reply to the failure of ''Village Agricultural and Industrial Development'' (V-AID) programme, launched in 1953 in [[East Pakistan|East]] and [[West Pakistan]] with technical assistance from the US government. The V-AID was a governmental level attempt to promote citizens participation in the sphere of rural development.&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan. Volume I-III. ''Compiled by the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development, Kothbari, Comilla''. (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan argued that for Comilla to develop rapidly, the [[farmers]] in its [[villages]] must be able to rapidly expand their production and sales. The main constraint they faced was inadequate local infrastructure, especially roads, drains, [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]] and [[irrigation]]. However, even if the government had the resources to build this infrastructure, Khan argued, the problem would not be solved. Once constructed, infrastructure must be regularly maintained. The benefits of it must be managed effectively based on rules that users could accept and predict. Khan thought that view it was essential to develop 'vigorous local institutions' capable of performing this type of local maintenance and management.&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan. Volume II. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

For that reason, the Comilla Model piloted a methodology for stimulating agricultural and rural development, based on the principle of grassroots cooperative participation by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F Raper, ''Rural Development in Action: The Comprehensive Experiment at Comilla, East Pakistan'', Cornell University Press: Ithaca (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Khan found inspiration for the cooperative development aspect of his model from German cooperative pioneer [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]], whose rural credit unions had been an early example of institution-building in predominantly [[orality|non-literate communities]].

== Implementation ==

To simultaneously address problems caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and local institutions, the Model integrated four distinct components in every ''thana'' (sub-district) where it was implemented:

# establishment of a training and development centre,
# a road-drainage embankment works program,
# a decentralised, small scale irrigation program, and
# a two-tiered cooperative system, with primary cooperatives operating in the villages, and federations operating at ''thana'' level.&lt;ref&gt;Akhter Hameed Khan, Works of Akhter Hameed Khan, Vol. II, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable emphasis was placed on distribution of agricultural inputs and extension services, for example by helping farmers to grow potatoes in the sandy Comilla soil, and using cold storage technology.&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhury, Aditee Nag, Let Grassroots Speak:  People’s Participation Self-Help Groups and NGO’s in Bangladesh, University Press Ltd., Dhaka, 1989, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key implementation challenge, Dr. Khan wrote, was to ensure that the four programs grew stronger at the same time in a mutually supporting way.  In particular,

{{quote|
The relation between the Rural Works and Irrigation Programmes and the cooperatives is very close and vital.  The first two develop the productive capacity of the land and increase the farmer's income.  The cooperatives safeguard the farmers from money lenders and enable them to modernize their farming methods.  The cooperatives promote the accumulation of self-owned capital through thrift and they promote managerial and technical skill through training.  Their ultimate aim is self-financing and self-management.&lt;ref&gt;Akhter Hameed Khan, Works of Akhter Hameed Khan, Vol. II, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the villages, the Academy introduced a number of pilot projects beginning in 1959. These pilot projects were guided by two goals: first, to provide a real-life learning situation for its trainees; and second, to devise pilot programmes and institutions which could serve as models capable of replication.&lt;ref&gt;Akhter Hameed Khan, Works of Akhter Hameed Khan, Vol. III.&lt;/ref&gt; In guiding and operating the projects, a set of principles and strategies were formulated as the bases for developing the pilot projects, resulting in a unique rural development approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Comilla_Model Comilla Model] at Banglapedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

The main features of the Comilla Model were:

* The promotion of development and of refining of various institutions, both public and private, and establishing a system of interrelationships between them;
* Involvement of both [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s in the process of rural development;
* Development of leadership in every village, including managers, model farmers, women [[Community organizer|organiser]]s, [[Youth work|youth leaders]], and village [[accountants]], to manage and sustain the development efforts;
* Development of three basic infrastructures (administrative, physical and organisational);
* Priority on [[decentralised]] and coordinated rural administration in co-ordination with officials of various government departments and the representatives of public organisations.
* Integration and co-ordination of the various developing services, institutions and projects;
* Education, organisation and discipline;
* Economic planning and technology;
* Development of a stable and progressive agriculture to improve the conditions of the farmers, and provide employment to rural labour force.&lt;ref&gt;MA Quddus (ed.) Rural Development in Bangladesh, Comilla, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difficulties ==

For various reasons the ''Comilla Model'' was unable to achieve its goal.  It had particular troubles with government relations and efforts to build strong cooperative institutions. According to Dr Khan:

{{quote|
… in actual practice, the four programs suffered from distortion, mismanagement, corruption and subversion.  After Independence of Bangladesh, while the First Five Year Plan gave general endorsement, both theoretical criticisms and practical difficulties became more severe."&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan. Volume II, pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Escalating loan defaults became a particularly important concern, undermining the hope that the cooperatives would become self-reliant and develop into strong institutions.  Dr. Khan reported that influential local people had secured management positions in the cooperatives.  "They are powerful and well informed. They know that the old sanctions (certificates, notices, pressure by officers) are now dead, and they can repudiate their obligations with impunity."&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan. Volume II, pp. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the new government annulled loans issued by its pre-independence predecessor.

Chowdhury reports that by 1979 only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were still functioning.  He attributes this result to four factors:  fraud/lack of internal controls, stagnation, diversion of funds, and ineffective external supervision.  The central problem of fraud and weak controls "was possible not only because of individual dishonesty, but because the people were not made aware of their rights, and were not in a position to voice their rights ..."&lt;ref&gt;Aditee Nag Chowdhury, Let Grassroots Speak, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, there were difficulties with government relations made more difficult by the departure of Khan for Pakistan.
{{quote|
The officers and change agents were not ready to plan with the local people and to report to them directly….  The dynamic personality of Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan helped to mobilize and harmonize diverse groups to work towards a common goal for rural development.  Afterwards, the contradictions within the Comilla approach manifested themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Aditee Nag Chowdhury, Let Grassroots Speak, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Lessons from the Comilla experience ==

Comilla Model provided an experience to be profited by later practitioners. In the early years of [[BRAC (NGO)]] and [[Grameen Bank]] in the 1970s, both Dr. [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Fazle Hasan Abed]] tested cooperative approaches to delivering credit to poor people.  They concluded that the cooperative strategy could not work in rural Bangladesh. Instead, both directly targeted the poorest people, while attempting to keep out those who were not poor.

Dowla &amp; Barua recently summarised the thinking at Grameen Bank:
{{quote|
A major reason for the prior failure of credit cooperatives in Bangladesh was that the groups were too big and consisted of people with varied economic backgrounds.  These large groups did not work because the more affluent members captured the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Asif Dowla &amp; Dipal Barua.  ''The Poor Always Pay Back:  The Grameen II Story'' Kumarian Press Inc., Bloomfield, Connecticut, 2006, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Later cooperative development initiatives in Bangladesh, like RD-12 and the Swanirvar (‘self-reliance’) Movement also adopted a targeting strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Khandker, Shahidur R., Fighting Poverty with Microcredit:  Experience in Bangladesh, Bangladesh Edition, The University Press Ltd., Dhaka, 1999, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Yunus and Abed also attempted to catalyse collective enterprises that were locally owned and controlled. However, problems with internal control and elite manipulation continued, and by the 1990s Grameen and BRAC, along with all the main microfinance NGOs in Bangladesh, had abandoned cooperative approaches and developed highly centralised control and service delivery structures.

== Continuing debates ==

The merits of poverty-targeting continue to stimulate debate in microfinance. While many [[microcredit]] institutions have adopted poverty-targeting, most cooperatives reject it.  The 1st principle in the [[Statement on the Co-operative Identity]] affirms that cooperatives are open to all persons in a community.  Poverty-targeting is seen as 'reverse discrimination' on the basis of social or economic status.

In this view, the main problem with the Comilla Model was that it neglected the 4th cooperative principle:  [[Autonomy and independence (cooperatives)|independence]] from government.  This neglect is clearly visible in the Khan's initial design of the Model, since the cooperatives were conceived of as an instrument for maintaining public infrastructure, and were dependent on the delivery of government extension services and credit for their success.  Cooperatives however, have fallen prey to [[elite capture]] in many [[orality|oral communities]], and in less densely populated nations than Bangladesh, it still proves challenging to deliver microfinance to them.

The purpose of the fact-finding tour was to survey the colonial situation and establish links with Asian youth movements.&lt;ref name="you"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indo"&gt;McVey, Ruth T. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7EP5Shx2HwC&amp;pg=PA55 The Soviet View of the Indonesian Revolution: A Study in the Russian Attitude Towards Asian Nationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218074420/https://books.google.com/books?id=e7EP5Shx2HwC&amp;pg=PA55 |date=2018-02-18 }}''. Jakarta: Equinox Publishing, 1957. pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; The mission had initially been scheduled for 1946, but delayed due to the conflict in [[Vietnam]] and the refusal of French authorities to issue permits for the delegation to enter Vietnam.&lt;ref name="indo"/&gt;

The delegation arrived in India in February 1947. They made contacts with different delegations that attended the Inter-Asian Relations Conference in [[Delhi]]. In Delhi, they discussed with Indonesian representatives the possibility of holding a pan-Asian youth conference in Indonesia in November 1947. In May, the WFDY team visited Indonesia and met with several high-ranking leaders (such as [[Sukarno]], [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]], etc.). In June 1947 the WFDY executive decided to go ahead with the plans, but limit the scope of the conference to Southeastern Asia. The Indonesians began preparations to host the conference in [[Madiun]]. However, in July 1947 (following the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]]), the WFDY executive decided to move the conference to Calcutta and postpone it to February 1948, as Indonesia was considered unsafe after Dutch attacks. The decision greatly disappointed the prospective Indonesian hosts.&lt;ref name="indo"/&gt;

==Attendance==
The conference was attended by delegations from [[Burma]], [[China]], [[Ceylon]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malayan Union|Malaya]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ols"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ch"/&gt; Indian organizations present included the [[All India Trade Union Congress]], the [[All India Students Federation]], the [[All India Kisan Sabha]], the [[Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)|Socialist Unity Centre of India]], the Andhra Youth Federation and a sector of the All India Students Congress.&lt;ref name="mcvey"&gt;McVey, Ruth Thomas.

A mass rally, with around 30,000 participants, was held in connection with the Conference. In the rally a Chinese delegate carried aloft a blood-stained shirt, from a Chinese communist fighter who had been killed in battle.&lt;ref name="ch"/&gt;

Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of Harvard Univ.

Conference which met in Calcutta in 1948 and was in reality a gathering of international Communist agents. There issued from the meeting a programme for insurrection and civil war which was carried, with dire results, to all the countries of South-East Asia."&lt;ref&gt;Low, Francis. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OsliN9sykagC Struggle for Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709025212/http://books.google.com/books?id=OsliN9sykagC |date=2014-07-09 }}''. Essay index reprint series. Freeport, N.Y.: Books for Libraries Press, 1972. pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote in October 1948 that "[t]he new plan was devised last March. Communist delegates attended a "Southeast Asia Youth Conference" in Calcutta. A planeload of experts from Moscow came to give them their orders.&amp;nbsp;... After Words, Deeds. The plan worked out at Calcutta called for simultaneous revolts in Burma and Malaya. Three months after the outbreak of the Malayan revolt, Indonesia's Communists were to strike. As coordination center for the drive a 26-man Soviet Legation, largest in Southeast Asia, was set up in [[Bangkok]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799242,00.html SOUTHEAST ASIA: The Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201125729/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799242,00.html |date=2011-02-01 }}'', in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 4, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Bertil Lintner]] argues that there is no proof of any direct linkage between the Conference as such and the initiations of armed insurgencies in different Asian countries.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; Ruth McVey states that whilst the Conference was the first public meeting of Southeast Asian communists after the Soviet declaration of the two-camp theory (that the world was divided into two camps, imperialism and socialism, and that confrontation between the two was unevitable), Asian communist were already aware of the new line prior to the Calcutta meeting. The Communist Party of India had adopted the new line of confrontation in December 1947.&lt;ref name="indo"/&gt; Mari Olsen claims that it is unclear if the Calcutta conference would have been used to convey Soviet directives to Asian communists, as there were no senior Soviet representatives present.&lt;ref name="ols"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4775">'''Corporate transparency''' describes the extent to which a corporation's actions are observable by outsiders. This is a consequence of regulation, local norms, and the set of information, privacy, and business policies concerning corporate decision-making and operations openness to employees, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], shareholders and the general public. From the perspective of outsiders, transparency can be defined simply as the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from the corporation.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; 

Recent research suggests there are three primary dimensions of corporate transparency: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;Schnackenberg, A., Tomlinson, E., 2014. Organizational Transparency: A New Perspective on Managing Trust in Organization-Stakeholder Relationships. ''Journal of Management'' DOI: 10.1177/0149206314525202. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206314525202&lt;/ref&gt; To increment transparency, corporations infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with stakeholders. For example, governance decisions to voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists indicate disclosure; decisions to actively limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in the firm's correspondence with suppliers and customers indicate clarity; and decisions to not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in the firm's communications with investors indicate accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the firm's objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; 

[[Standard &amp; Poor's]] has included a definition of corporate transparency in its [http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/ap/page.product/equityresearch_gamma/2,5,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.html GAMMA Methodology] aimed at analysis and assessment of [[corporate governance]].

== Customer support transparency ==
{{Main article|Customer engagement}}

Corporations may be transparent to investors, the public at large, and to customers.

Opening up the customer support channels may mean using a feedback tool which allows users to publicly vote on new developments, having an open [[internet forum]], or actively responding to social media questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/mar/02/customer-service-social-rules|title=The new, social rules of customer service|last=Norris|first=Jon|date=2012-03-02|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Armagh disturbances}}
The '''Defenders''' were a [[Roman Catholic]] agrarian secret society in [[Ireland 1691-1801|18th-century Ireland]], founded in [[County Armagh]].&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; Initially, they were formed as local defensive organisations opposed to the Protestant [[Peep o' Day Boys]]; however, by 1790 had become a secret oath-bound fraternal society made up of lodges.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; By 1796, the Defenders had allied with the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], and participated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; By the 19th century, the organisation had developed into the [[Ribbonmen]].&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;

==Origin and activities==
The Defenders were formed in the mid-1780s by Catholics in response to the failure of the authorities to take action against the Protestant [[Peep o' Day Boys]] who launched nighttime raids on Catholic homes under the pretence of confiscating arms which Catholics were prohibited from possessing under the terms of the [[Penal Laws]].&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt;

Having seen the fighting between the Nappach Fleet, Bunker's Hill Defenders, and the Bawn Fleet, between 1784 and 1785 go largely unpunished, they were encouraged to form their own grouping.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; At Grangemore&lt;!-- recte [[Granemore]]? --&gt;, near [[Ballymacnab]], County Armagh, an area that had previously suffered from a Peep o' Day Boys raid, such a grouping was founded and became known as the Defenders.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Supplied with arms purchased from a Protestant shopkeeper in Armagh, they embarked on night-watches and patrols keeping an eye out for Peep o' Day Boys.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt;

The Defenders started out as independent local groups, defensive in nature, however by 1790 they had merged into a widespread secret oath-bound fraternal organisation consisting of lodges, associated to a head-lodge led by a Grand Master and committee.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; The Defenders were greatly influenced by [[Freemasonry]], and were made up of the lower class of Catholics.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Each member had to swear an oath, which despite the penal laws which they were subject to, included the swearing of obedience to [[Monarchy_of_Ireland|King]] [[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]], his successors, and the government.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; The oath itself was revised several times, but kept its central character whilst focusing more on loyalty and solidarity.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt;

By 1786 the Peep o' Day Boys and Defenders were opposed to each other and involved in confrontations.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt;

==Escalation of conflict==
Conflict between the two groups spread from nighttime to daytime with fights at fairs, markets, and races etc.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Throughout the rest of the 1780s fierce fighting predominated parts of County Armagh.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Magistrate's who were largely anti-Catholic and Protestant juries acquitted Peep o' Day Boys who were brought to trial whilst convicting and punishing Defenders.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; The government eventually sent the military in to try to end the trouble.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Whilst successful in quelling daytime fighting, they failed to have an effect on nighttime disturbances.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; More troops were dispatched into the most troublesome areas.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt;

In 1788, Lord Charlemont's re-organised [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Volunteer]] companies in County Armagh became involved in the conflict as Peep o' Day Boys joined their ranks.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Despite being recreated to impartially end the trouble without the need of government troops, the new Volunteers only made things worse as they engaged in sectarian activities.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; Several clashes occurred between the Defenders and the Peep o' Day Boys at times backed up by the Volunteers.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt; By 1789 the disturbances took on a different character focusing on religion itself, with both sides perpetrating atrocities, trying to outdo the other in their barbarism.&lt;ref name="McEvoy"/&gt;

==Militia Act 1793==
[[Catholic Emancipation]] from 1778 onward had removed some of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|penal restrictions]] imposed upon Catholics, who were now allowed to vote and join [[Grand jury|grand juries]]. However, the declaration of war by [[revolutionary France]] against Great Britain in February 1793 was also followed by the passing of the ''Militia Act'' which was a form of partial conscription. Wealthier Catholics such as the young [[Daniel O'Connell]] joined the Militia as it was proof of their gradual acceptance into the establishment, but it was harder for poorer rural Catholics whose help was needed on a family farm. Although the terms of the Act stipulated that conscripts would serve in Ireland, it was widely believed that men would be sent abroad and the resultant opposition saw thousands taking the Defender oath. Members were usually sworn in catechisms, one such oath went: 

{{Cquote|The French Defenders will uphold the cause. The Irish Defenders will pull down British laws.|20px|20px|}}

The Defenders did not have a centralised leadership but were organised in loosely connected local cells and were limited by their lack of firearms.&lt;ref&gt;p.26, ''A Flame now Quenched: Rebels and Frenchmen in Leitrim 1793–98'', Liam Kelly (Dublin 1998) {{ISBN|1-901866-13-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought to obtain them by launching raids on the big and small houses of the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]]. In January 1793 the 'Annual Register' reported that forty farms had been raided for weapons near [[Dundalk]], [[County Louth]]. However [[County Leitrim]] saw the most Defender activity with raids on [[Carrick-on-Shannon]] and [[Manorhamilton]] before eventual defeat at Drumkeerin in May 1793. Despite the ensuing wave of repression, the Leitrim Defenders again rose in open rebellion in 1795 and hundreds of soldiers had to be poured into the county to defeat them.&lt;ref&gt;p.31-46, ''A Flame now Quenched: Rebels and Frenchmen in Leitrim 1793–98'', Liam Kelly (Dublin 1998) {{ISBN|1-901866-13-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Defenders retained enough strength to rise in support of the French during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], with strong Defender contingents present at the defeats at [[Granard]], Wilson's Hospital and [[Battle of Ballinamuck|Ballinamuck]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Battle of the Diamond==
{{Main|Battle of the Diamond}}
In September 1795 the Peep o' Day Boys, backed up by some Volunteer companies, and Defenders would clash in the short [[Battle of the Diamond]], near [[Loughgall]] in County Armagh.&lt;ref name="Connolly434"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jess"/&gt; The result was around 30 Defenders being killed. The aftermath of the battle saw the Peep o' Day Boys retire to James Sloan's inn in Loughgall, where they would found the [[Orange Order]].&lt;ref name="Connolly434"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardon226"/&gt;

==Society of United Irishmen==
The [[Society of United Irishmen]] had early identified the Defenders as potential allies and leading members such as [[James Hope (Ireland)|James Hope]] had regularly travelled throughout the country organising cells and distributing propaganda such as the ''[[Northern Star (newspaper of the Society of United Irishmen)|Northern Star]]'' newspaper. Defender cells were easily transformed into United Irish cells and those who held dual membership were often referred to as being "up and up". The precise role of the Defenders as an organisation during the rebellion is therefore hard to assess but Colonel Foote, commander of the British force and one of its few survivors of the [[battle of Oulart Hill]] referred to the victorious rebels as "Defenders" as opposed to [[United Irishmen]] in his official account of the defeat.

The Defenders of [[County Down]] withdrew support before the United Irish defeat at the [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] on 12 June 1798, as their leader John Magennis had received good local information on the size and placing of the British forces. Magennis had also suggested a night attack which [[Henry Munro (United Irishman)|Munro]] would not allow.&lt;ref&gt;Proudfoot L. (ed.) ''Down History and Society'' (Dublin 1997) chapter by Nancy Curtin at p.289. {{ISBN|0-906602-80-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Defenders were also absent as a group from the earlier [[Battle of Antrim]].

The Defenders were usually depicted as subject to residual sectarianism, ultra-Catholic, guilty of [[anti-Protestantism]] and having only paid at best lip service to the non-sectarian ideals of the United Irishmen.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} While this was undoubtedly true of a proportion of Defenders, Catholic priests were not immune to their wrath as in [[Athlone]] in 1793 where a priest who preached in favour of the Militia Act was almost hanged to death.&lt;ref&gt;J. Brady: ''Catholics and Catholicism in 18th century Press'', (1965) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortunes of the Defenders were closely tied to the United Irishmen by the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion in 1798]] and they did not survive its failure; however their influence endured in the later formation of similar groups like the [[Ribbonmen]] in the 1830s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''María Josefa Gabriela Cariño de Silang''' (19 March 1731 – 20 September 1763) was a Filipina revolutionary leader best known as the first female leader of a Filipino movement for independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vigan.ph/history/diego-silang-and-maria-josefa-gabriela-silang.html|title=Diego Silang and Maria Josefa Gabriela Silang - Vigan.ph|website=www.vigan.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took over the reins of her husband [[Diego Silang]]'s revolutionary movement after his assassination in 1763, leading the [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] rebel movement for four months before she was captured and executed by the colonial government of the [[Spanish East Indies]].

==Early life==
Gabriela Silang (March 19, 1731 – September 20, 1763), born Maria Josefa Gabriela Cariño, was born in [[Barangay]] Caniogan, [[Santa, Ilocos Sur]] to a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] Ilocano father Anselmo Cariño, a trader who ferried his wares from Vigan to Abra along the [[Abra River]] and a descendant of  Ignacio Cariño, the first [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]]n from Spain to arrive in [[Candon]], Ilocos Sur in late 17th century. Her mother was a [[Tinguian people|Tinguian]] mother who was from a Tinguian [[Barrio]] in [[San Quintin, Abra|San Quintin]] [[Abra (province)|Abra]] (now [[Pidigan, Abra|Pidigan]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Rosarito A. Cariño 7th generation great-grandson and Museum Curator of Gabriela Cariño- Silang Gallery of Fine Arts and Museo Nicolas Cariño&lt;/ref&gt;

She received a Christian upbringing from the town's [[parish priest]], and attained elementary level education at the town’s convent school. After being separated from her parents early in her childhood, she was raised by a priest, who eventually arranged a marriage between her and the wealthy businessman. They married in 1751, and he died three years later.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bonnie G. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Diego Silang===
{{main|Diego Silang}}
[[File:Gabriela Silangcropped.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Gabriela Silang]]
After being widowed by her first husband, Gabriela met insurgent leader Diego Silang and married him in 1757.
In 1762, as part of what would later be known as the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain declared war on Spain, which caused the [[British occupation of the Philippines]]. After [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval forces captured Manila in October 1762, an emboldened Diego sought to initiate an armed struggle to overthrow the [[Spain|Spanish]] functionaries in [[Ilocos region|Ilocos]] and replace them with native-born officials. He collaborated with the British occupiers, who appointed him governor of the Ilocos region on their behalf and promised military reinforcement to help in the fight against the Spanish. This reinforcement was, however, never delivered.
During this revolt, Gabriela became one of Diego's closest advisors and his unofficial [[aide-de-camp]] during skirmishes with Spanish troops. She was also a major figure in her husband's collaboration with the British occupiers.
Spanish authorities retaliated by offering a reward for Diego’s assassination. Consequently, his two former allies Miguel Vicos and Pedro Becbec killed him in [[Vigan City|Vigan]] on May 28, 1763.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Commire, Anne, and Deborah Klezmer. Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Waterford, CT: Yorkin Publications, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary leadership in Abra===
After Diego’s assassination, Gabriela fled to [[Tayum, Abra|Tayum]], [[Abra (province)|Abra]] to seek refuge in the house of her paternal uncle, Nicolas Cariño. There, she appointed her first two generals, Miguel Flores and Tagabuen Infiel.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She later assumed her husband's role as commander of the rebel troops and achieved a "[[priest]]ess" status amongst her community and followers. Her popular image as the [[bolo knife|bolo]]-wielding ''la Generala'' on horseback stems from this period.

===Assault on Vigan and Execution===
On September 10, 1763, Silang tried to besiege Vigan but the Spanish retaliated, forcing her into hiding. She retreated once more to Abra, where the Spanish later captured her. On September 20, 1763, Silang and her troops were executed by hanging in Vigan's central plaza.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''George Edward Creel''' (December 1, 1876 – October 2, 1953) was an [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] and writer, a [[politician]] and government official. He served as the head of the [[United States]] [[Committee on Public Information]], a [[propaganda]] organization created by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] during [[World War I]].

==Early life and education==
Creel was born on December 1, 1876 in [[Lafayette County, Missouri]], to Henry Clay Creel and Virginia Fackler Creel, who had three sons, Wylie, George, and Richard Henry (Hal). His father came to Missouri from [[Parkersburg, Virginia]] and bought land in [[Osage County, Missouri]]; he was college educated, and served in Virginia legislature. A captain of the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he did not succeed in the Missouri post-war economy as a farmer and rancher.  Even though he developed alcohol dependence, his wife did not abandon him until his death in 1906. She provided for her family by keeping a boarding house in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and by sewing and keeping a large garden in [[Odessa, Missouri]]. All her children became productive members of society: Wylie Creel, a  businessman; George, a journalist and writer; and Richard, a doctor, who served as Assistant [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] of the [[United States Public Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Waal, C., and Korner, B. O. [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1fJm5ZGjPIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Henry+Clay+Creel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3jhwG0u7Ai&amp;sig=rfwDZ1dxUOKqUotw16yUBT0c05E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp7piDprzJAhUCNT4KHX17AkYQ6AEIQDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Henry%20Clay%20Creel&amp;f=false Hardship and hope: Missouri women writing about their lives, 1820-1920.] Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1997, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

His alcoholic father did not leave as deep an impression on Creel as did his mother, who inspired his passion for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;Ashley, Perry J. American Newspaper Journalists, 1901-1925. Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research Co, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved frequently around west-central Missouri in Creel's early years, living for a time in [[Wheatland, Missouri|Wheatland]], [[Hickory County, Missouri]] then [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] before finally settling in [[Odessa, Missouri]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=Review&gt;Epperson, Ivan H. Missourians Abroad. No. 3—George Creel. ''The Missouri Historical Review'', vol. 12, No. 2 (January 1918), pp. 100-110.&lt;/ref&gt; He often said that, "I knew my mother had more character, brains, and competence than any man that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;[http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/c/creel/ Historic Missourians: George Creel (1876 - 1953)], ''The State Historical Society of Missouri''.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother also encouraged his love for literature. Although Creel did not receive much formal education, as his mother pulled him out of school system, and was mainly home-schooled, he credited his mother for his fair knowledge of [[history]] and literature including [[classics]], such as the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; In 1891, the then fifteen-year-old Creel ran away from home for a year, supporting himself by working at a succession of county [[fair]]s across Missouri and at odd jobs when available.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; Despite his resistance and rebellion, Creel did manage to receive some formal schooling, while attending [[Central High School (Kansas City, Missouri)|Kansas City Central High School]], Odessa High School, and Odessa College for one year in [[Odessa, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;&lt;!---NOTE: Not the Odessa College located in Texas. Do not link to that Wiki. Thanks.---&gt; He said of himself that "an open mind is not part of my inheritance. I took in prejudices with mother's milk and was weaned on partisanship."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hedges. ''Death of the Liberal Class''. New York: [[Nation Books]], 2010, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1896, he began his first formal job at the ''[[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] World.'' &lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; He was hired for $4 a week, starting as a reporter, but eventually moved up to write feature articles.  He also wrote a [[book review]] column and covered social happenings. He was eventually fired because he felt it was wrong to discuss a wealthy man's daughter eloping with her coachman in the paper and apparently his editors didn't agree.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

After his termination, he was given a free train pass to Chicago by a well-wisher, and then hopped a cattle train to New York earning his fare by tending stock. He found an opportunity to work as a free-lance joke writer for [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s comic supplements.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; As a 1913 ''Collier's'' profile put it, he was "shutting himself in his cheap room in a mechanics' hotel; he ground out jokes by the dozens, by the hundreds, jokes in bales and jokes in bundles."&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; But he didn't sell any his first month and survived by shoveling snow. Soon, he sold four jokes to Hearst's ''Evening Journal'' and became a regular with many periodicals.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

On March 11, 1899, he went back to Kansas City with his friend, Arthur Grissom, a poet, who married into rich Kansas family, to start a newspaper, ''The Independent.'' After only ten months, however, Grissom withdrew from the partnership.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; At age 23, Creel became the sole owner, editor, and publisher of ''The Independent''.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; In the paper he dealt with many social issues including [[women's suffrage]], [[single tax]] system, and public ownership of utilities. He was also a strong supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and aggressively fought the policies and practices of [[Thomas Pendergast]].&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;  Creel was not afraid to put politics or party affiliation aside for the greater public good, however. He backed Democrat [[Joseph W. Folk]] in a successful run for [[List of Governors of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; Then, in 1908, Creel came out in support of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Herbert S. Hadley]] and his gubernatorial campaign. Hadley, an ardent reformer like Folk before him, was the first Republican elected Governor of Missouri in nearly forty years. Said Creel in one of his newspaper editorials regarding party affiliations, "When a man becomes so besotted with partisan prejudice as to exalt party above the interest of the community, state or county, that moment he ceases to be a good citizen."&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

In late 1909, Creel left Kansas City and the ''Independent'' behind for a new political battlefield in [[Colorado]]. Reformer [[John F. Shafroth]], a native of [[Fayette, Missouri]] and an acquaintance of Creel's, had been elected Colorado's governor in 1908. Despite the ''Independent'' being profitable, he chose to give the newspaper away to a pair of young women who aspired to be newspaper publishers.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; Leaving Kansas City with just fifty dollars to his name, Creel soon found employment as an editorial writer for the ''[[Denver Post]]''.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; He gained national publicity by calling for the lynching of 11 senators who opposed the public ownership of Denver's water company.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; He resigned promptly after and had a brief stint working at William Randolph Hearst's ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. He moved on to write editorials for ''The Rocky Mountain News'' (1911-1912) where he was a strong supporter of [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;

In June 1912, Creel was appointed Police Commissioner of Denver by the recently elected reform mayor, [http://margins.fair-use.org/note/Henry_J._Arnold Henry J. Arnold]. Creel immediately used the office to launch several ambitious reform campaigns, such as ordering police officers to give up their clubs and nightsticks,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00E3D81E3AE633A25750C0A9649C946296D6CF Ousts Creel, Reformer; Denver Mayor Removes Police Commissioner, Blanche Bates's Husband], ''The New York Times'', February 3, 1913, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a campaign to destroy the red-light district in downtown Denver,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DE7DE1E39E633A25756C2A9679C946596D6CF George Creel Looms Up: Mayor Mitchel May Appoint Man Who Cleaned Denver,] ''The New York Times,'' January 25, 1914, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; while providing a tax-funded rehabilitation farm for women leaving prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM46FG_Red_Light_District_Denver_CO Lower Downtown Walking Tour: Red Light District, Market Street, Denver, Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt;  His time as police commissioner ended after he began pushing the Mayor Henry Arnold to live up to campaign promises. Although he was dismissed by the mayor for the creation of dissension, he was lauded nationally for his watchdog efforts.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

Then in 1916, he became heavily involved in President Wilson's re-election campaign.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; Working under Bob Wooley, the Publicity Head for the [[Democratic National Committee]], Creel wrote newspaper features and interviewed various people.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; In March 1917, Creel discovered that many of the military leaders wanted strong [[censorship]] of any criticism of the war.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; Creel sent President Wilson a brief in which he argued for "expression, not suppression" of the press.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; Wilson approved Creel's proposal and appointed him as chairman of the [[Committee on Public Information]].&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

===Committee on Public Information===
Seven days after the United States entered [[World War I]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] created the [[Committee on Public Information]], a [[propaganda]] agency acting to release government news, to sustain morale in the US, to administer voluntary press censorship, and to develop propaganda abroad.&lt;ref name="Steven Vaughn"&gt;Steven Vaughn. Holding Fast the Inner Lines. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} George Creel was named the head of the committee, and he created 37 distinct divisions, most notably the Division of Pictorial Publicity, the [[Four Minute Men]] Division, the News Division, and the Censorship Board.&lt;ref name="Steven Vaughn" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

The Division of Pictorial Publicity was staffed by hundreds of the nation's most talented artists, and they created over 1000 designs for paintings, posters, cartoons, and sculptures that instilled patriotism, fear, and interest in the war efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Van Schaack. The Division of Pictorial Publicity in World War I. Design Issues, 22, 1, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Creel himself said that the images were "something that caught even the most indifferent eye."&lt;ref name="Steven Vaughn" /&gt;{{rp|85}} Through the [[Four Minute Men]] division, roughly 75,000 civilian volunteers spoke to 314 million people over the span of 18 months on topics assigned by the CPI, like the [[Conscription|draft]], [[rationing]], [[war bond|bond]] drives, and [[victory garden]]s.&lt;ref name="Lisa Mastrangelo"&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo. World War I, Public Intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent Ideals of Public Speaking and Civic Participation. Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 12, 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|610}} These civilian volunteers spoke at social events in places like movie theaters and fellowship halls for four minutes, which was the time it took to change a movie reel and the time believed to be a human's attention span. The guidelines set forth by Creel directed the volunteers to fill their speeches with facts and appeals to emotions to bolster public support for the war efforts.&lt;ref name="Lisa Mastrangelo" /&gt;{{rp|614}} Between the News Division and Censorship Committee, Creel and the CPI were able to control the flow of official war information. Creel sought to portray facts without bias, though most pieces of news were "colored by [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] assumptions."&lt;ref name="Steven Vaughn" /&gt;{{rp|112}} Creel's committee may have produced biased news, but it was his hope that the US could avoid rigid censorship during the war, as Creel's views on censorship were "expression, not repression."&lt;ref name="Steven Vaughn" /&gt;{{rp|115}} Under Creel's direction, the CPI sought only to repress material that contained "dangerous" or "unfavorable" ideas to avoid demoralizing the population.&lt;ref name="Steven Vaughn" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

All activities of the CPI ceased on November 11, upon the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany]]. The efforts of the CPI were regarded as the greatest [[public relations]] effort in history, up to its time. Such a massive, offensive, and multifaceted campaign had never been undertaken before, and the CPI brought to light the power of mass persuasion and [[social influence]] at a national level – realizations that had a profound effect on the field of public relations.&lt;ref name="Think"&gt;Wilcox, Cameron, and Reber, Shinn. Think: Public Relations. New Jersey: Pearson Education, 2013, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the 20th century's most influential public relations practitioners were trained under Creel on the committee, including [[Edward Bernays]] and [[Carl R. Byoir]].&lt;ref name="Think" /&gt;

===Post-war career===
After his prolific career as the chairman of the CPI, Creel joined ''Collier's'' (1920) as a feature writer.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; Then in 1926, he moved to San Francisco and eventually chaired the Regional Labor Board (1933) for [[California]], [[Utah]], and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;

He was an active member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and ran against the novelist [[Upton Sinclair]] for the post of [[Governor of California]] in the 1934 primary. Creel lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="963">A '''government-backed loan''' is a [[loan]] subsidized by the government, which protects lenders against defaults on payments, thus making it a lot easier for lenders to offer potential borrowers lower interest rates. Its primary aim is to make home ownership affordable to lower income households and [[first-time buyer]]s.

There are numerous types of government-backed loans, which vary dependent on the country and status of the borrower. Arguably, the most widely known type of government-backed loan is the  US [[Federal Housing Administration]] [[FHA loan]], in existence since 1934.

Other types of government-backed loans include the following:
* American Dream Downpayment Initiative - ADDI
* Good Neighbor Next Door
* [[HOPE VI]]
* Teacher Next Door Program
* [[VA loan]]
* [[State of New York Mortgage Agency]] – SONYMA

The name '''[[National Health Service]]''' (NHS) is used to refer to the four public health services of [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], individually or collectively, though only [[National Health Service (England)|England's NHS]] officially has this title. For details of the history of each National Health Service, particularly since 1999, see:

The NHS in Scotland was established as a separate entity with its own legislation, the [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947]], from the foundation of the NHS in 1948. Northern Ireland likewise had its own legislation in 1948.  Wales, however, was managed from England and treated much like an English region for the first 20 years of the NHS. In 1969, responsibility for the [[NHS Wales|NHS in Wales]] was passed to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] from the Secretary of State for Health who was thereafter just responsible for the NHS in England.

== Background ==
{{see also|National Insurance Act 1911}}

Dr [[Benjamin Moore (biochemist)|Benjamin Moore]], a Liverpool physician, in 1910 in ''The Dawn of the Health Age'' was probably the first to use the words 'National Health Service'. He established the State Medical Service Association which held its first meeting in 1912 and continued to exist until it was replaced by the [[Socialist Medical Association]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Socialist Medical Association and the Foundation of the NHS|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/the-sma-and-the-foundation-of-the-national-health-service-dr-leslie-hilliard-1980/|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the National Health Service was created in 1948, patients were generally required to pay for their health care. Free treatment was sometimes available from [[Voluntary Hospitals]]. Some [[local government in England|local authorities]] operated hospitals for local ratepayers (under a system originating with the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]]). The [[London County Council]] (LCC) on 1 April 1930 took over from the abolished [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]] responsibility for 140 hospitals, medical schools and other medical institutions. The [[Local Government Act 1929]] allowed local authorities to run services over and above those authorised by the Poor Law and in effect to provide medical treatment for everyone. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the LCC was running the largest public health service in Britain.&lt;ref name="LCC health service"&gt;W. Eric Jackson, "Achievement: A Short History of the LCC", Longmans, 1965, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr [[A. J. Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive criticism about the severe inadequacies of health care. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;R. Samuel, "North and South," ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems of [[health insurance]] usually consisted of private schemes such as [[Friendly society|Friendly societies]] or [[Welfare societies]]. Under the [[National Insurance Act 1911]], introduced by [[David Lloyd George]], a small amount was deducted from weekly wages, to which were added contributions from the employer and the government. In return for the record of contributions, the workman was entitled to medical care (as well as retirement and unemployment benefits) though not necessarily to the drugs prescribed. To obtain medical care, he registered with a doctor. Each doctor in [[General Practice]] who participated in the scheme thus had a 'panel' of those who have made an insurance under the system, and was paid a capitation grant out of the fund calculated upon the number. Lloyd George's name survives in the "'''Lloyd George envelopes'''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Lloyd_George_Envelope&lt;/ref&gt; in which most primary care records in England are stored, although today most working records in primary care are at least partially computerised. This imperfect scheme only covered workers who paid their [[National Insurance]] Contributions and was known as 'Lloyd George's Ambulance Wagon'.  Most women and children were not covered.

[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|[[Aneurin Bevan]], who built on Sir Henry Willink's vision of a National Health Service with the establishment of the NHS]]
[[Bertrand Dawson]] was commissioned in 1919 by [[Christopher Addison]], the first British [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] to produce a report on "schemes requisite for the systematised provision of such forms of medical and allied services as should, in the opinion of the Council, be available for the inhabitants of a given area". An Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services 1920 (Lord Dawson of Penn)|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/healthcare-generally/history-of-healthcare/interim-report-on-the-future-provision-of-medical-and-allied-services-1920-lord-dawson-of-penn/|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was produced in 1920, though no further report ever appeared. The report laid down plans for a network of Primary and Secondary [[Health Centre]]s, and was very influential in subsequent debates about the [[National Health Service]]. However the fall of the Lloyd George government prevented any implementation of those ideas at that time.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1932 accepted a resolution moved by [[Somerville Hastings]] calling for the establishment of a State Medical Service and in 1934 the Labour Party Conference at Southport unanimously accepted an official document on a National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why a National Health Service? Chapter 2 The Socialist Medical Association|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/the-sma-and-the-foundation-of-the-national-health-service-dr-leslie-hilliard-1980/why-a-national-health-service/why-a-national-health-service-chapter-2-the-socialist-medical-association/|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Second World War]] there was already consensus that health insurance should be extended to the dependants of the wage-earner, and that the voluntary and local authority hospitals should be integrated. A [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) pamphlet, "A General Medical Service for the Nation" was issued along these lines in 1938. However, no action was taken due to the international crisis. During the war, a new centralised state-run [[Emergency Hospital Service]] employed doctors and nurses to care for those injured by enemy action and arrange for their treatment in whichever hospital was available. The existence of the service made voluntary hospitals dependent on the Government and there was a recognition that many would be in financial trouble once peace arrived.&lt;ref name="Pre-war and EMS"&gt;[[Paul Addison]], ''The Road to 1945'', Jonathan Cape, 1975, pp. 178–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to do something to guarantee the voluntary hospitals meant that hospital care drove the impetus for reform. 		

In February 1941 the Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health recorded privately areas of agreement on post-war health policy which included "a complete health service to be available to every member of the community" and on 9 October 1941, the Minister of Health [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]] announced that the Government proposed to ensure that there was a comprehensive hospital service available to everyone in need of it, and that local authorities would be responsible for providing it.&lt;ref name="Ernest Brown speaks"&gt;"Post-War Policy For Hospitals", ''The Times'', 10 October 1941, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Medical Planning Commission set up by the professional bodies went one stage further in May 1942 recommending (in an interim report) a National Health Service with General Practitioners working through health centres and hospitals run by regional administrations.&lt;ref name="Medical Planning Commission"&gt;Paul Addison, ''The Road to 1945'', Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1942 [[Arthur Greenwood]], the Labour Party Deputy Leader and cabinet minister with responsibility for post-war reconstruction, successfully pressed the cabinet to commission a report into social insurance from economist and social reformer [[William Beveridge]],&lt;ref name="Beveridge commissioned"&gt;Paul Addison, "The Road to 1945", Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 167-9.&lt;/ref&gt;, Beveridge attached an assumption to the [[Beveridge Report]] that this same idea would be implemented; his report stressed the importance of it.

Developing the idea into firm policy proved difficult. Although the BMA had been part of the Medical Planning Commission, at their conference in September 1943 the association changed policy to oppose local authority control of hospitals and to favour extension of health insurance instead of GPs working for state health centres. When Conservative MP and Health Minister [[Henry Willink]] prepared a white paper endorsing a National Health Service,&lt;ref&gt;http://navigator.health.org.uk/content/national-health-service-white-paper-was-published-march-1944-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/beveridge-bevan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; it was attacked by [[Brendan Bracken]] and [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and resignations were threatened on both sides. However the Cabinet endorsed the White Paper which was published in 1944.&lt;ref name="1944 white paper"&gt;Paul Addison, ''The Road to 1945'', Jonathan Cape, 1975, pp. 239–42.&lt;/ref&gt; This White Paper includes the founding principles of the NHS: it was to be funded out of general taxation and not through [[national insurance]], and services would be provided by the same doctors and the same hospitals, but:
* Services were provided free at the point of use;
* Services were financed from central taxation;
* Everyone was eligible for care (even people temporarily resident or visiting the country).

Willink then set about trying to assuage the doctors, a job taken over by [[Aneurin Bevan]] in [[Clement Attlee]]'s Labour Party government after the war ended. Bevan decided that the 1944 white paper's proposal for local authority control of voluntary hospitals was not workable, as he felt that local authorities were too small to manage hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1946/apr/30/national-health-service-bill#column_48 Hansard]'', HC 5ser vol 422 cols 48 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; He decided that "the only thing to do was to create an entirely new hospital service, to take over the voluntary hospitals, and to take over the local government hospitals and to organise them as a single hospital service".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1946/apr/30/national-health-service-bill#column_49 Hansard]'', HC 5ser vol 422 cols 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure of the NHS in [[England and Wales]] was established by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] which received Royal Assent on 6 November 1946. The Act implemented a system where each person resident would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice.  Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time. 		

Many doctors were initially opposed to Bevan's plan, primarily on the grounds that it reduced their level of independence. The British Medical Association voted in May 1948 not to join the new service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/a-labour-delivery.html A Labour delivery] www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk. Retrieved 11 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but Bevan worked hard to bring them on board by the time the new arrangements launched on 5 July 1948 knowing that without doctors, there would be no health service. Being a shrewd political operator, Bevan managed to push through the radical health care reform measure by dividing and cajoling the opposition, as well as by offering lucrative payment structures for [[consultant (medicine)|consultants]]. On this subject he stated, "I stuffed their mouths with gold".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Establishment==
In 1979 across the whole UK there were about 2,750 NHS hospitals with about 480,000 beds, accounting for about 70% of total NHS expenditure.  About one-third of beds in England were then provided in new or converted accommodation built since 1948 with a higher proportion in Northern Ireland, but lower in Scotland and Wales.  Beds for mental illness, geriatric patients and mental handicap were much more likely to be in older buildings than acute or maternity services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 10|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0101761503|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-10/|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Development of the Workforce in the NHS ==
The National Health Service was a major employer from its foundation. After [[Nationalization|nationalising]] Britain's voluntary and municipal hospitals, the new NHS took responsibility for 360,000 staff in England and Wales and a further 45,000 in Scotland. These included 9,000 full-time [[Physician|doctors]] (with thousands more [[Consultant (medicine)|consultants]] working in multiple part-time roles), 149,000 [[Nursing|nurses]] and [[Midwife|midwives]] (23,000 of whom were part-time), 128,000 ancillary staff (catering, laundry, cleaning and maintenance), 25,000 administrative and clerical staff, and 19,000 professional and technical staff, of whom the 2,800 [[Physical therapy|physiotherapists]], 1,600 laboratory technicians and 2,000 [[radiographer]]s were the largest groups.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Ministry of Health for the year ending 31st December 1952'' (London: HMSO, 1953), pp. 129-130&lt;/ref&gt; This workforce would continue to grow throughout the 20th and 21st Centuries, overtaking the [[National Coal Board]] to become [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s largest employer in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Ministry of Health for the Year Ended 31st December 1964'' (London: HMSO), pp.124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1970s, the NHS had passed 1,000,000 staff&lt;ref name=":RoyC"&gt;Royal Commission on the National Health Service (London: HMSO, 1979), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 was the world's fifth largest work organisation with 1.7m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/06/23/the-worlds-biggest-employers-infographic/#6446ff4a51d0 | title=The World's Biggest Employers [Infographic] |last=McCarthy |first=Niall |publisher=Open Publishing |date=23 July 2015 |website=forbes.com |access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Workforce ===
The NHS has long had one of Britain's most varied workforces, with employees from a diverse range of backgrounds in terms of [[Social class|class]], occupation, [[gender]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[nationality]]. In the early NHS doctors were overwhelmingly men from [[Middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]] backgrounds, and were often [[Private school|privately educated]]. Nurses in [[Hospital|general hospitals]] were usually women and generally from a mixture of middle and [[working class]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health and Society in 20th Century Wales|last=Pamela Michael and Charles Webster (eds)|first=|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Cardiff|pages=165–182|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men constituted a significant minority of nurses but were largely concentrated in mental hospitals, where their role historically had been more associated with manual labour, particularly the physical control of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Working for Health: The Story of COHSE|last=Carpenter|first=Mick|publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|year=1987|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional organisations like the [[Royal College of Nursing]] tended to promote the idea that nurses were middle-class [[professional]]s, whilst [[trade union]]s encouraged nurses to see themselves as workers.&lt;ref name="Lead"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership and Democracy : The History of the National Union of Public Employees, Volume 2, 1928-1993|author1=Stephen Williams  |author2=R.H. Fryer|publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|year=2011|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like nursing, ancillary tasks were also heavily gendered with [[Hospital porter|portering]] and maintenance largely done by men, and laundry and cleaning largely women.

Increasing demand for health services led to a steady expansion in total staff numbers throughout the second half of the 20th Century and into the 21st century. However, NHS wage rates were usually comparatively low and hours often long and anti-social.&lt;ref name="Lead" /&gt; Consequently, under conditions of [[full employment]] in the 1950s and 1960s the NHS experienced regular recruitment crises in virtually all categories of staff, particularly doctors and nurses in some peripheral provincial areas. One solution adopted by health authorities was to encourage married nurses to return to the workforce part-time. In Britain, historically many nurses expected to leave work after getting married and into the 1960s senior nursing posts were disproportionately likely to held by unmarried women. Nurse training also had a very high drop out rate, in part related to students leaving to get married (in addition to rejection by some of the strict discipline imposed on them).&lt;ref name="Nott"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The NHS in Scotland : The Legacy of the Past and the Prospect of the Future|last=Nottingham (ed.)|first=Chris|publisher=Ashgate|year=2000|isbn=|location=Aldershot|pages=34|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time work brought many of these women back into the workforce and the NHS was a key site in the growth of this kind of work in post-war Britain, employing 65,000 part-time ancillary staff (mostly domestics) and 79,000 part-time nurses and midwives by 1967.&lt;ref name="MoH67"&gt;''Report of the Ministry of Health for the Year Ended December 31st 1967'' (London: HMSO, 1968), pp. 172-178&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this rise in part-time work, hospitals increasingly looked overseas for staff, recruiting particularly heavily in Britain's colonies from the 1950s. By 1955, the [[Ministry of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] had official recruitment campaigns in 16 [[British colonies]] and former colonies. By 1965, there were more than 3,000 [[Jamaica]]n nurses working in British hospitals and in 1977, 12% of student nurses and midwives came from overseas, 66% of them from the [[Caribbean]], with substantial numbers also coming from the [[Philippines]] and [[South Asia]]. Large numbers of ancillary staff also migrated to fill NHS vacancies. Doctors were also recruited from across Britain's colonies and former colonies, particularly from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Doctors born and qualified overseas constituted 31% of all doctors in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/immigration-and-the-national-health-service-putting-history-to-the-forefron|title=Immigration and the National Health Service : Putting History to the Forefront|author1=Stephanie Snow  |author2=Emma Jones|date=8 March 2011|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses and doctors recruited by the NHS were often marginalised in job allocation. Early nurse migrants were often forced to re-validate their qualifications on arrival in Britain and instructed to take the less academic [[State Enrolled Nurse]] (SEN) training, rather than the more prestigious [[State Registered Nurse]] (SRN) qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of the Black Working Class|last=Ramdin|first=Ron|publisher=Gower|year=1987|isbn=|location=London|pages=309–323|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SENs had worse pay and fewer promotion prospects. Similarly, employment discrimination often meant South Asian doctors were forced into less desirable posts in run-down provincial hospitals.

The NHS was also a site of expansion in new categories of scientific and technical workers. In 1967, the service employed 31,000 professional and technical staff connected with diagnosis and treatment, including [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[biochemist]]s, [[dietitian]]s, more than 9000 laboratory technicians, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[physicist]]s, [[physiotherapists]], [[psychologist]]s and [[radiographer]]s.&lt;ref name="MoH67" /&gt; This category of staff had more than doubled in size ten years later, rising to 64,700 people or 6.5% of the total workforce.&lt;ref name=":RoyC" /&gt; Although at the start of the period many of these roles had relatively informal career paths, with individuals sometimes recruited as assistants before training as technicians, from the 1970s onwards it became increasingly common for roles to have more formal training schemes and associated degree courses. Professional associations like the [[College of Occupational Therapists]] and the [[Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine]] became better organised and took a greater role both in regulating their professions and in collective bargaining with the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="Bos"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrial Relations in the NHS : The Search for a System|last=Bosanquet (ed.)|first=Nick|publisher=King Edwards Hospital Fund|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s saw further changes in the NHS' workforce. The [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] encouraged (and eventually forced) health authorities to put most ancillary services out for competitive tender, effectively outsourcing the jobs of those workers. This led to a substantial reduction in numbers, with 1/3 of ancillary posts disappearing between 1980 and 1987.&lt;ref name="Lead" /&gt; Those that remained were largely employed by private agencies and no longer subject to national agreements or trade union collective bargaining. For nurses, the introduction of Project 2000 meant that their profession now centred around [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|degree courses]] run by [[University|universities]] rather than nurse training courses run by [[teaching hospital]]s. This effectively removed student nurses from hospital workforces and helped raise the status of the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Voice for Nursing : A History of the Royal College of Nursing, 1916-1990|author1=Susan McGann |author2=Anne Crowther |author3=Rona Dougall |publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the physical labour done by student nurses was now passed to a new category of health worker, the [[Healthcare Assistant|Health Care Assistant]], a role than mirrors that of "[[auxiliary nurse]]s" in the early NHS. The status of [[General practitioner|General Practitioners]] as outside contractors was largely confirmed by the market-based reforms introduced by the Thatcher, Major and Blair governments.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Politics of the NHS|last=Klein|first=Rudolf|publisher=Radcliffe|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working lives of Hospital Doctors changed from the 1970s onwards, as career paths and work patterns became increasingly formalised. Set rules on hours were introduced in the 1970s and refined in the 1980s and 1990s to dramatically reduce the number of hours junior doctors were expected to contribute.

=== Industrial relations ===

==== 1948-72 ====
Between 1948 and 1972 the NHS largely remained free of [[Strike action|strikes]], but nevertheless did experience some other industrial disputes. The foundation of the service was opposed by many doctors, particularly general practitioners, who feared that a state medical service would reduce their independence. Doctors expressed this opposition through their largest professional organisation, the [[British Medical Association]], which held a number of ballots canvassing its members' (largely negative) opinions on arrangements for the new service. After a threat to boycott the new service, the BMA secured some concessions from [[Aneurin Bevan]], the [[Health minister|Minister of Health]] responsible for implementing the [[National Health Service Act 1946|NHS Act]]. The BMA's intransigence did not stop the new health service coming into being, but did secure the right to be paid on a "[[Capitation fee|capitation]]" basis (per patient) rather than on a set [[salary]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More importantly for doctors the government's concessions established the conventional wisdom in the Ministry of Health that changes to the NHS were impossible without the consent of the medical profession, effectively giving doctors a "medical veto".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Winning consent from physicians remained a problem for Health Ministers, who faced regular complaints, particularly over pay. In 1962 the government gave up control over doctors' pay to the independent [[Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration|Review Body on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration]].

The first dispute involving nurses took place when student nurses opened their first NHS pay packets in July 1948. Despite having received a modest pay rise, an increase in [[National Insurance]] contributions meant their take home pay had gone down. Outraged students at St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow, organised a protest rally and a march, threatening to resign ''en masse'' if their demands for better pay, shorter hours and general improvements in conditions weren't met. The march made headlines but won few concessions from the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="Nott" /&gt; Complaints from student nurses about poor conditions, long hours and low pay were common for much of the post-war period. Up to the 1970s student nurses were responsible for as much as 75% of the physical labour on hospital wards and were often subject to intense disciplinary regimes both on the wards and in their private lives, with many student nurses living in strictly-supervised hospital nurses' accommodation.

The conflicts of 1947-48 were not very representative of the prevailing industrial relations culture in the NHS. Despite recurrent complaints about low pay and long hours, NHS staff were not prone to outbreaks of collective protest in the 1950s and 1960s. With the exception of an [[overtime ban]] and [[work-to-rule]] by administrative staff in 1957, organised by [[National and Local Government Officers' Association|NALGO]], and a [[go-slow]] by laundry workers in [[Carshalton]] in 1950, the NHS had little formal workplace conflict. Groups of miners, printers, dockers and car workers did stage a one-hour strike in [[Solidarity action|solidarity]] with nurses' claims for pay increase in 1962, but the nurses' professional organisation the [[Royal College of Nursing]] repudiated their actions and generally preferred to trade on respectability rather than militancy. At that time the Rcn was reluctant to refer to itself as a trade union and nurses looking for more conventional workplace representation looked to the [[Confederation of Health Service Employees|Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE)]] and the [[National Union of Public Employees|National Union of Public Employees (NUPE)]]. The latter was generally strongest amongst ancillary staff and former amongst psychiatric nurses. Recognising the sensitive nature of hospital work both remained cautious regarding industrial action in the NHS until the 1970s, fearing that advocating action that might affect patients would drive away potential members. A combination of cautious organisations, staff who often saw their work as a vocation, and the domineering influence of doctors over the rest of the workforce, led to an "old colonial" system of industrial relations, structured largely by personal patronage and paternalism.&lt;ref name="Bos" /&gt;

==== 1972-1979 ====
This largely broke down in the 1970s with unions like [[National Union of Public Employees|NUPE]], [[Confederation of Health Service Employees|COHSE]] and [[Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs|ASTMS]] recruiting large numbers of all categories of staff, and professional organisations like the RCN and BMA becoming more aggressive in collective bargaining.&lt;ref name="Bos" /&gt; In December 1972, ancillary staff, the worst paid and most marginalised section of the workforce, organised mass demonstrations across the country with around 150,000 workers and supporters protesting poverty level wages. Action continued in March 1973 with ancillaries organising the NHS' first national strike.&lt;ref name="Lead" /&gt; In the years to come other groups took action over similar issues, with nurses mounting a sustained campaign over pay in 1974 and [[radiographer]]s following suit in 1975 under the slogan "no raise, no rays". Doctors also took strike action in 1975, with [[junior doctor]]s walking out over long hours and inadequate pay for extra time and consultants taking action in defence of their right to place their private patients in NHS beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pickets in White : The Junior Doctors' Dispute of 1975 - A Study of the Medical Profession in Transition|author1=Steve Iliffe  |author2=Harvey Gordon|publisher=MPU Publications|year=1977|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although strikes in the NHS remained rare, changes in everyday industrial relations were more profound. The NHS saw a significant expansion in the number of [[Union representative|workplace representatives]] in this period, sometimes forcing managers to consider the views of sections of the workforce, like the ancillary staff, who they had long ignored. This sometimes caused conflict between different groups. The "pay beds" dispute pitched nurses and ancillaries, who opposed private practice, against consultants, the direct beneficiaries of private practice.&lt;ref name="Lead" /&gt; Other aspects of the upsurge in workplace activism were less controversial and all categories of staff were active in lobbying central government for better funding. The second half of the 1970s also saw a series of campaigns aimed at saving local hospitals, some of which involved "[[work-in]]s" where staff took over hospitals and continued to provide services after health authorities had shut them down. In November 1976, health workers took over [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital|Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Women's Hospital]] saving it from closure. The occupation of [[Hounslow Hospital]] in 1977 was less successful with the local authority forcibly removing the patients after 2 months.&lt;ref name="Lead" /&gt;

By the end of the 1970s, industrial relations in the NHS were widely considered to be in crisis, with poor management and inadequate personnel procedures causing [[wikt:endemic]] conflict in a substantial minority of hospitals.&lt;ref name="Bos" /&gt; The participation of large numbers of health workers in the events of 1978-79 [[Winter of Discontent]] was one reflection of this. [[Ambulance driver]]s and ancillary staff were both involved in strikes over pay in January 1979, reducing 1,100 hospitals to emergency services only and causing widespread disruption to ambulance services.

==== 1980-2010 ====
As in other sectors, industrial relations under the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] continued to be conflictual. Successive [[Health minister|Health Ministers]] looked to hold down pay in the [[public sector]] and to [[Outsourcing|outsource]] ancillary staff where possible. Following the 1983 [[Griffiths Report]], the NHS also tried to import a business model more similar to the [[private sector]] with professional managers taking over cost control, reducing the power of the medical profession. There were disputes over all of these policies. In 1982 there was another conflict over pay restraint involving ancillaries and nurses. Campaigning by [[National Union of Public Employees|NUPE]], [[Confederation of Health Service Employees|COHSE]] and [[Royal College of Nursing|RCN]] won an interim pay rise for nurses who were also granted their own independent pay review body, as the doctors had been 20 years earlier. The status and pay for registered nurses subsequently tended to improve, particularly when nurse education was shifted to university degree courses under Project 2000 in 1986.

Ancillary staff, in contrast, were increasingly marginalised during the 1980s. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Government put pressure on health authorities to [[Outsourcing|outsource]] their catering, cleaning, laundry and maintenance services to private companies. [[Trade union]]s fought these policies, in some cases successfully, but many hospital services finally ended up in private hands, sometimes with companies who refused to recognise trade unions. Outsourcing dissipated some of the influence unions had built up during the 1970s and towards the end of decade increasingly occupied many shop stewards in detailed negotiations over grading and contract details rather than recruitment and organising.&lt;ref name="Lead" /&gt;

Doctors' relationship with the government deteriorated during the 1980s. The advance of [[managerialism]] under Griffiths irritated many doctors, previously accustomed to a dominant role in NHS governance. By 1989 doctors were extremely hostile to government reforms and were active in lobbying against the implementation of the 1989 government white paper, ''Working for Patients'', which introduced an internal market to the NHS.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Their defence of public ownership and opposition to market-based reforms marked a substantial shift from doctors' original opposition to the NHS, reflecting how far doctors' mindsets had changed in relation to state medicine.

Relations between the NHS and the government were generally much improved under the [[Blair ministry|Blair Government]]. Substantial investment in staff and new facilities were appreciated by many nurses and doctors, although there were concerns about the introduction of private sector suppliers, the use of [[Public–private partnership|public-private partnerships]] to fund much investment and the development of an intensive culture of achievement targets. There was also no attempt to reverse the outsourcing of ancillary services, something health service unions linked to recurrent crises over hospital cleanliness.

== Cultural History of the NHS ==

=== Film and Television ===
Film and television have played important roles in forming cultural understandings of the [[National Health Service]]. Hospitals and GP practices, in particular, have been repeatedly dramatised as locations that lend themselves to displaying wider life stories - love, birth, ageing, dying, friendships and feuds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Signs of Life: Cinema and Medicine|last=Harper|first=Graeme and Andrew Moor|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2005|isbn=1904764169|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHS has also been an important topic within public health, often forming a central part in public information films about health and wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Public Information Films ====

From the launch of the [[National Health Service]] in 1948, film was used as an important cultural tool for spreading governmental health messages. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], film grew in popularity as a way for the British government to keep citizens informed, impart advice and help raise morale on the [[Home front|Home Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Food Companions: Cinema and consumption in wartime Britain, 1939-1945|last=Farmer|first=Richard|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780719083136|location=Manchester|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment to producing [[public information film]]s continued after the end of the War in 1945 with the newly formed [[Central Office of Information]] taking responsibility for the production of these films. This ensured that the launch of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] was accompanied by a number of public information films shown nationwide during Spring and Summer 1948. Three main films were produced - ''Charley: You're Very Good Health'' (Halas &amp; Batchelor, 1948),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1945to1951/filmpage_cyvgh.htm|title=Public Information Films {{!}} 1945 to 1951 {{!}} Your Very Good Health|last=Archives|first=The National|website=www.nationalarchives.gov.uk|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Here's Health'' (Douglas Alexander, 1948)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6c2f25d6|title=Here&amp;#039;s Health (1948)|newspaper=BFI|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Doctor's Dilemma'' (Unknown, 1948).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69c5c3f7|title=Doctor&amp;#039;s Dilemma (1948)|newspaper=BFI|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films introduced the NHS in three distinct ways with ''Charley: You're Very Good Health'' focused on explaining how the NHS would work upon its launch in a light-hearted manner with Charley standing in as the 'everyman' within the film's narrative. The film used a series of 'suppose' scenarios to outline how the new NHS system would work in practice in comparison to the pre-NHS health care system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Here's Health'' instead employed the narrative techniques of [[melodrama]] to dramatise one family's response to a household accident and the sudden need for medical attention during the Christmas of 1947. It uses flash-forwards to show how these type of care and the cost of it will be altered by the introduction of the NHS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The third main film used to advertise the launch of the NHS was a much briefer, information short, centred on the use of voice-over and a combination of still and moving images to encourage members of the public to register with an NHS GP before the [[National Health Service Act 1946|National Health Service Act]] came into force on 5 July 1948.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Popular Films and Television ====
Within a few years of the NHS, popular fictional films were beginning to focus on the NHS as a location for dramatic narratives. Films such as ''[[White Corridors]]'' ([[Pat Jackson]], 1951) and ''[[Mandy (1952 film)|Mandy]]'' ([[Alexander Mackendrick|Alexander MacKendrick]],1952), shown within the early years of the NHS, showed day-to-day life in an NHS hospital as well as dealing with specific single-issue topics such as [[Hearing loss|deafness]] within [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945–present)|postwar]] British society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='Mandy (1952): On Voice and Listening in the (Deaf) Maternal Melodrama' in Medicine's Moving Pictures: Medicine, Health, and Bodies in American Film and Television|last=Cartwright|first=Lisa|publisher=University of Rochester Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1580463065|location=Rochester|pages=133–162|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doctor (film series)|Doctor]] series, starring firstly [[Dirk Bogarde]] and later [[Leslie Phillips|Leslie Philips]], took a comedic look at the antics of a young doctor in an NHS hospital and the Carry on ... comedies, [[Carry On Nurse|Carry on Nurse]] ([[Gerald Thomas]],1959), [[Carry On Doctor|Carry on Doctor]] ([[Gerald Thomas]], 1967) and [[Carry On Matron|Carry on Matron]] ([[Gerald Thomas]], 1972) also used comic situations within the NHS hospital to poke fun at both the NHS as an institution and the capers of doctors, nurses and patients alike. From the late 1950s, the NHS also became an important subject within the wider history of British [[soap opera]]s. [[Emergency – Ward 10|Emergency Ward 10]] was first broadcast in 1957 on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] and ran until 1967 and followed the life and loves of the staff and patients of the fictionalised Oxbridge General. ITV later followed this up with [[General Hospital (UK TV series)|General Hospital]] which borrowed much from [[Emergency – Ward 10|Emergency Ward 10]] in terms of its themes and focus. The idea of a medical hospital as a suitable and popular setting for a soap opera continued to take root in the 1980s. [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]], set in an A&amp;E department, was first broadcast in 1986 and has since become the longest running medical drama in the world.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Broadcasting and the NHS in the Thatcherite 1980s: The Challenge to Public Service|last=Holland|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780230282377|location=London|pages=169|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when controversy over the NHS was high on the public agenda, [[Paul Unwin (director)|Paul Unwin]] and [[Jeremy Brock]] began their proposal for [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]] by declaring that ‘In 1948 a dream was born: a National Health Service. In 1985 the dream is in tatters.’&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This politicised agenda remained in evidence during the first three series of the [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]], with the programme showing how those who fictionally worked for the NHS were also dissatisfied with the new direction of the Service.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the 1990s television began more overtly showing medial practitioners who were critical or cynical of the NHS. In particular, [[Cardiac Arrest (TV series)|Cardiac Arrest]] was broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]] utilised this type of cynicism within its narrative plots. Television has also forged a place for the NHS within reality television programming. In particular [[24 Hours in A&amp;E]] and [[One Born Every Minute]] have adopted medical documentary formats to show the inner workings of particular NHS hospital departments. [[Fly on the wall|Fly-on-the-wall]] footage is interweaved with interviews with patients, staff and relatives as they give their perspectives on the medical cases shown in each episode.

=== Comedy ===
Comedy films, books, and cartoons have been produced about the [[National Health Service|NHS]].  These have shaped as well as reflected how people think about this institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peopleshistorynhs.org/encyclopaedia/humour-and-the-nhs-is-laughter-the-best-medicine-or-perhaps-nhs-policy-a-sick-joke/|title='Humour and the NHS: Is 'laughter the best medicine'? Is NHS policy a 'sick joke'?|last=Crane|first=Jenny|date=10 November 2016|website=peopleshistorynhs.org|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cartoons ====
There have been lots of cartoons about the NHS throughout the institution's history.  Even before the NHS was launched, there were cartoons documenting the political debates about its form.  In the 1940s, the [[British Medical Association]] was opposed to the idea of doctors becoming state employees on fixed salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://peopleshistorynhs.org/encyclopaedia/the-british-medical-association/|title=British Medical Association|newspaper=People's History of the NHS|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cartoonists made their opinions about this conflict known.  [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] published a cartoon in the ''Evening Standard'' on 14 December 1944 showing Charles Hill, the BMA Secretary, being examined by a doctor.  The doctor states, 'Don't be alarmed.  Whatever's the trouble, you're not going to die from enlargement of the social conscience.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.cartoons.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=LSE1173&amp;pos=2|title=LSE1173: No Caption|last=Low|first=David|date=14 December 1944|website=British Cartoon Archive|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the NHS was launched, many cartoons showed how people responded to the NHS being free at the point of access.  One cartoon, published in 1951 by [[Antonia Yeoman]], portrayed women in a doctor's waiting room, one of whom stated that she had seen eighteen doctors and seven psychiatrists.  Eventually, she had been diagnosed with a 'deep-seated guilt about getting things free from the National Health Service.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://punch.photoshelter.com/image/I0000hgxNAHl2ASo|title=Punch Cartoons by Anton {{!}} PUNCH Magazine Cartoon Archive|website=punch.photoshelter.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysing cartoons about health featured in [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] magazine from 1948, the historian Bernard Zeitlyn argues that they 'centred on the bonanza of free spectacles, beards and trips abroad' that the NHS would bring.&lt;ref name="Zeitlyn 1972 10–12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeitlyn|first=Bernard|year=1972|title='Jokes and the Doctor-Patient Relationship'|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~wolf2728/jokes.html|journal=History of Medicine|volume=4|pages=10–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cartoonists also portrayed public excitement about the availability of free wigs on the NHS.  In one such example, from January 1949, cartoonist Joseph Lee showed an irate man chasing a child, asking, 'Who's been practising Home Perms on my free National Health Service wig?'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.cartoons.ac.uk/GetMultimedia.ashx?db=Catalog&amp;type=default&amp;fname=JL3982.jpg|title=London Laughs: Free NHS Wig|last=Lee|first=Joseph|date=11 January 1949|website=British Cartoon Archive|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoons were also used to criticise NHS policy.  From 1948, Zeitlyn also found cartoons portraying concern about the 'bureaucratic consequences' of the NHS.&lt;ref name="Zeitlyn 1972 10–12"/&gt; The number of critical cartoons about NHS policy increased from the 1960s, as the NHS faced cuts, and the [[satire]] movement emerged in Britain.  In December 1960, cartoonist [[Victor Weisz]] drew an image for the ''Evening Standard'' showing Minister for Health [[Enoch Powell]] as a surgeon covered in blood, accusing him of making too many cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.cartoons.ac.uk/GetMultimedia.ashx?db=Catalog&amp;type=default&amp;fname=VY1756.jpg|title=National Health Service: Operating Theatre|last=Weisz|first=Victor|date=5 December 1960|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cartoonists suggested that too much was being spent on the NHS.  For example, in the ''Daily Mail'' in 1968, [[John Musgrave-Wood]] drew a man to portray the NHS, who was wearing a dunce's cap and being fed 'Defence Cuts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.cartoons.ac.uk/GetMultimedia.ashx?db=Catalog&amp;type=default&amp;fname=12734.jpg|title=The Hypochondriac|last=Musgrave-Wood|first=John|date=9 January 1968|website=British Cartoon Archive|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cartoons have been very interested in portraying NHS staff, both their lives and industrial conflict.  The cartoonist [[Carl Giles]], who often drew for the ''Daily Express'', was very interested in drawing nurses in particular.  Historian Jack Saunders has argued that Giles' presentation shifted from presenting nurses from 'caring and sexualised' to 'bolshie and assertive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://peopleshistorynhs.org/museumobjects/nurses-christmas-1963/|title=Nurses’ Christmas, 1963|newspaper=People's History of the NHS|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Giles sent a cartoon of nurses stealing peas from patients directly to the East Suffolk Nurses League.  On the cartoon, Giles wrote 'with deepest sympathy', referring to the cutting of food allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://peopleshistorynhs.org/museumobjects/pinching-peas-1969/|title=Pinching Peas, 1969|newspaper=People's History of the NHS|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Everyday humour ====
Patients and staff have made jokes about the NHS to one another, on a daily basis, throughout time.  However, it is very hard to locate and to understand these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://peopleshistorynhs.org/encyclopaedia/humour-and-the-nhs-is-laughter-the-best-medicine-or-perhaps-nhs-policy-a-sick-joke/|title=Humour and the NHS: Is ‘laughter the best medicine’?  Is NHS policy a ‘sick joke’?|newspaper=People's History of the NHS|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes 'everyday' jokes about the NHS are mentioned in passing in newspaper coverage.  For example, one letter published by the ''Daily Mail'' in October 1988 described the experiences of an NHS secretary who 'seethed with anger' when hearing a consultant joke about spending his days on a golf course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|date=4 October 1988|title=A sick way to treat a patient|url=|journal=Daily Mail|volume=|pages=34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The People's History of the NHS project at the [[University of Warwick]] has collected more such memories on its website, and invites contributions for more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peopleshistorynhs.org|title=People's History of the NHS|date=|website=People's History of the NHS|publisher=[[University of Warwick]]|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and clinicians hope that humour and laughter may be able to be used to improve human health.  The term 'gelotology', to denote the study of laughter, was created in 1964 by Edith Trager and W. F. Fry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Barbara|year=2005|title=Laughter: The Best Medicine?|url=https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/7422/laughter.pdf|journal=Oregon Library Association|volume=11|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment from 2011, led by researchers at the University of Oxford, suggested that watching comedy videos may raise people's pain thresholds, when watched in a group.

'''Human rights in [[Cape Verde]]''' are addressed under the national constitution.

The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that in general, the government respected the basic rights of citizens, however there were concerns in certain areas such as prison conditions, legal process and discrimination.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"&gt;, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135943.htm U.S Dept of State Human Rights Report: Cape Verde]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Legislative protection of human rights can be seen as a relatively recent development, with the constitution being officially adopted in 1980. The political system operates under a multi-party parliamentary [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report" /&gt;

==Historical situation==
The following chart shows Cape Verde's ratings since 1975 in the [[Freedom in the World]] reports, published annually by [[Freedom House]]. A rating of 1 is "free"; 7, "not free".&lt;ref name='FH1972'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls | title = Country ratings and status, FIW 1973-2012 | accessdate = 2012-08-22 | author = [[Freedom House]] | date = 2012 | format = XLS}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|a|1}}

:1.{{note|a}}Note that the "Year" signifies the "Year covered". Therefore the information for the year marked 2008 is from the report published in 2009, and so on.
:2.{{note|b}}As of 8 July (Independence Day) in 1975; 1 January thereafter.
:3.{{note|c}}The 1982 report covers the year 1981 and the first half of 1982, and the following 1984 report covers the second half of 1982 and the whole of 1983. In the interest of simplicity, these two aberrant "year and a half" reports have been split into three year-long reports through interpolation.

The '''International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists''' strives to advance [[human rights]] everywhere, including the prevention of [[war crime]]s, the punishment of war criminals, the prohibition of [[weapons of mass destruction]], and international co-operation based on the rule of law and the fair implementation of international covenants and conventions.

The association is especially committed to issues that are on the agenda of the [[Judaism|Jewish people]], and works to combat [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], [[antisemitism]], [[Holocaust denial]] and negation of the State of [[Israel]].

IAJLJ was founded in 1969. Among its founders were Supreme Court Justices [[Haim Cohn]] of [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel]], [[Arthur Goldberg]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[René Cassin]] of [[Court of Cassation (France)|France]]. Membership comprises [[lawyer]]s, [[judge]]s, judicial officers and academic [[jurist]]s in more than 50 countries who are active locally and internationally as the need arises. Membership is open to lawyers and jurists of all creeds who share the organization's aims.

The association has Category II Status as a [[non-governmental organization]] at the [[United Nations]], enabling it to participate in the deliberations of various UN bodies. In this capacity, the representative of the association has been actively involved in the work of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] in [[Geneva]] and of related bodies, and as of 2007 will be engaged with the work of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], which has replaced the Commission on Human Rights.

The association also publishes ''Justice'', which examines a variety of relevant issues and current topics and is mailed to thousands of lawyers and jurists throughout the world.

In 2006, the association held its inaugural Justice Haim H. Cohn Lectureship in [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Israel]]. The lecture, on Human Rights in a Constitutional Framework, was delivered by [[William M. Treanor]], [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the School of Law at New York’s [[Fordham University]].

==Conferences==

The association holds its triennial international congress in [[Jerusalem]], as well as conferences and seminars in many other countries. It holds international conferences in European cities to commemorate Jewish lawyers and jurists who perished in [[the Holocaust]] and to mark their contribution to the legal systems of their countries. Conferences have been held in [[Salonika]] (Thessaloniki), [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], and [[Budapest]] in November 2006.

In January 2000 the association held a conference in [[Strasbourg]] under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]] and with the participation of high-ranking officials of the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. Discussions were held on cooperation between IAJLJ and the Council of Europe on ways to combat racism, anti-Semitism and denial of the Holocaust.

In August 2000 the association convened its first conference in [[North America]]. ''“Pursuing Justice in the Global Village”'' was the theme of this conference, held in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Among the participants were several Canadian judges and federal and provincial government ministers, as well as Judge [[Thomas Buergenthal]] of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]]; [[Jerome Shestack]], former [[United States]] [[Ambassador]] to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and former President of the [[American Bar Association]]; and [[Neal Sher]], Chief of Staff, [[International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims]] and Immediate Past President of the American Section of IAJLJ.

'''''Klein, {{abbr|dba|doing business as}} Sweet Cakes by Melissa, v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries''''' was a legal case against a cake shop in [[Gresham, Oregon]], in the United States.

==Case history==
On January 17, 2013, a woman and her mother were invited to a [[Gresham, Oregon]] bakery called "Sweet Cakes by Melissa" (owned by couple Melissa Elaine Klein and Aaron Wayne Klein) for a scheduled wedding cake tasting appointment. The woman selected the bakery after having been a customer previously. Upon introductions, Aaron Klein asked for the names of the "bride and groom," at which point the customer said there were actually two brides. On hearing this, Klein informed them that the bakery does not make wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of their religious beliefs. When the woman's mother tried to object, Klein responded by quoting [[Leviticus 18:22]], which refers to male homosexual sex as an "abomination."&lt;ref name=FOF&gt;[http://www.oregon.gov/boli/SiteAssets/pages/press/Sweet%20Cakes%20FO.pdf Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries- Findings of Fact]&lt;/ref&gt;

The customer subsequently filed a complaint with Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries, 9 months later, alleging the bakery had discriminated against her and her fiancée because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="oreg_Lesb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian couple refused wedding cake files state discrimination complaint|author=|work=OregonLive.com|date=|accessdate=2018-01-26|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/gresham/index.ssf/2013/08/lesbian_couple_refused_wedding.html|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Klein responded by posting a copy of the complaint's first page on their Facebook page, [[Doxing|which contained the full names and contact information]] of the customer and her fiancée.&lt;ref name=FOF/&gt; When the couple discovered this, they had their lawyer contact Klein, who then removed the posting.

On February 1, 2013, news media became aware of the case despite the couple's efforts to avoid public attention.&lt;ref name=FOF/&gt; A few weeks after, a demonstration occurred outside the bakery criticizing their refusal to make the cake, though it was organized by individuals with no association with the original couple, and the couple did not attend it.&lt;ref name=FOF/&gt; After receiving extensive criticism on Facebook and in the news, the Kleins closed their storefront in September 2013, switching to operating the business from their home.&lt;ref name="wwee_Gres"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gresham Cake Bakery That Refused Service to Gays Has Closed|author=|work=Willamette Week|date=|accessdate=2018-01-26|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-30623-gresham-cake-bakery-that-refused-service-to-gays-has-closed.html|language=|quote=}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.katu.com/news/investigators/Sweet-Cakes-responds-to--222094901.html|title=Sweet Cakes owners respond to firestorm over wedding cake decision|first=Chelsea|last=Kopta|date=September 2, 2013|publisher=[[KATU-TV]]|location=Portland, OR|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219083336/http://www.katu.com/news/investigators/Sweet-Cakes-responds-to--222094901.html|archivedate=December 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo20141007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/01/sweet-cakes-by-melissa-bankrupt-_n_5916226.html|title=Sweet Cakes by Melissa's Owners Say Fine for Rejecting Lesbian Couple Will Leave Them Bankrupt|first=Curtis M.|last=Wong|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=October 1, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, an administrative court made a preliminary decision to fine the business $135,000.&lt;ref name="koin_Erro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge to Sweet Cakes: Pay $135K to lesbian couple|author=DuBois, Steven|work=KOIN|date=April 24, 2015|accessdate=2018-01-26|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325020255/http://www.koin.com/2015/04/24/judge-to-sweet-cakes-pay-135k-to-lesbian-couple/|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kleins in turn opened a [[GoFundMe]] page, "Support Sweet Cakes by Melissa", which raised over $500,000 before it was shut down by GoFundMe, who stated that the campaign was not compatible with their terms of service. Go Fund Me later released a statement saying that the Klein’s would relieve all the donations.&lt;ref name=Beck20150425&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golocalpdx.com/news/support-sweet-cakes-by-melissa-gofundme-page-violates-terms|title='Support Sweet Cakes by Melissa' GoFundMe Page Violates Terms|first=Byron|last=Beck|work=GoLocalPDX|date=April 25, 2015|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, GoFundMe confirmed that the funds raised before the appeal was shut down would still be available for withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Beck20150425/&gt;

The administrative court's decision was confirmed in a final order by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/2/sweet-cakes-melissa-owners-owe-135000-damages-gay-/|title=Sweet Cakes by Melissa Owners Owe $135,000 in Damages for Gay Wedding Refusal|first=Valerie|last=Richardson|work=The Washington Times|date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2015/07/gag_order_or_cease_and_desist.html|title=Gag Order or Cease and Desist?

The cease and desist order has been widely described as a gag order, and has brought national attention to this case on first amendment free speech grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=George|last=Rede|date=July 8, 2015|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2015/07/gag_order_or_cease_and_desist.html|title=Gag order or cease and desist?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2203">The '''Liga Feminista Costarricense''' (Costa Rican Feminist League) was the first feminist organization formed in Costa Rica. In 1923, Mexican feminist [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] who was living in New York and publishing a magazine ''Feminismo Internacional'' (International Feminism) invited women all over the world to create subsidiaries of the [[International League of Iberian and Latin American Women]] on 12 October of that year.&lt;ref name="Solano Arias (2014)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solano Arias|first1=Marta E.|title=A 90 años de la fundación de la Liga Feminista Costarricense: los derechos políticos|journal=Revista Derecho Electoral|date=January–June 2014|issue= 17|pages=357–375|url=http://www.tse.go.cr/revista/art/17/solano_arias.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2015|publisher=Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones República de Costa Rica|location=San José, Costa Rica|language=Spanish|issn=1659-2069}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Ángela Acuña Braun]] called together a group to found the Liga Feminista Costarricense (LFC), first feminist organization in Costa Rica.

{{Liberalism sidebar |Development}}

Individual contributors to [[classical liberalism]] and political [[liberalism]] are associated with philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Liberalism as a specifically named ideology begins in the late 18th century as a movement towards self-government and away from [[aristocracy]]. It included the ideas of self-determination, the primacy of the individual and the nation, as opposed to the state and religion, as being the fundamental units of law, politics and economy.

Since then liberalism has broadened to include a wide range of approaches from [[United States|Americans]] [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[John Rawls]] and [[Francis Fukuyama]] as well as the [[India]]n [[Amartya Sen]] and the [[Peru]]vian [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]]. Some of these people moved away from [[liberalism]], while others espoused other [[ideology|ideologies]] before turning to liberalism. There are many different views of what constitutes liberalism, and some liberals would feel that some of the people on this list were not true liberals. It is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive. Theorists whose ideas were mainly typical for one country should be listed in that country's section of [[liberalism worldwide]]. Generally only ''thinkers'' are listed, politicians are only listed when they, beside their active political work, also made substantial contributions to liberal theory.

==Classical contributors to liberalism==

===Aristotle===
{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|100px|Aristotle]]
'''[[Aristotle]]''' (Athens, 384–322 BC) is revered among political theorists for his seminal work ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. He made invaluable contributions to liberal theory through his observations on different forms of government and the nature of man.

He begins with the idea that the best government provides an active and "[[Eudaimonia|happy]]" life for its people. Aristotle then considers six forms of government: [[Monarchy]], [[Aristocracy]], and [[Polity]] on one side as 'good' forms of government, and [[Tyranny]], [[Oligarchy]], and [[Democracy]] as 'bad' forms. Considering each in turn, Aristotle rejects Monarchy as infantilizing of citizens, Oligarchy as too profit-motivated, Tyranny as against the will of the people, Democracy as serving only to the poor, and Aristocracy (known today as [[Meritocracy]]) as ideal but ultimately impossible. Aristotle finally concludes that a polity—a combination between democracy and oligarchy, where most can vote but must choose among the rich and [[virtuous]] for governors—is the best compromise between [[idealism]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realism]].

In addition, Aristotle was a firm supporter of [[private property]]. He refuted Plato's argument for a [[collectivist]] society in which family and property are held in common: Aristotle makes the argument that when one's own son or land is rightfully one's own, one puts much more effort into cultivating that item, to the ultimate betterment of society. He references [[barbarian]] tribes of his time in which property was held in common, and the laziest of the bunch would always take away large amounts of food grown by the most diligent.

=="Humanism"==

===Niccolò Machiavelli===
[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|upright|Niccolò Machiavelli]]
'''[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]''' (Florence, 1469–1527), best known for his ''Il Principe'' was the founder of realist political philosophy, advocated [[classical republicanism|republican]] government, citizen armies, division of power, protection of personal property, and restraint of government expenditure as being necessary to the liberties of a republic. He wrote extensively on the need for individual initiative—''virtu''—as an essential characteristic of stable government. He argued that liberty was the central good which government should protect, and that "good people" would make good laws, whereas people who had lost their virtue could maintain their liberties only with difficulty. His Discourses on Livy outlined realism as the central idea of political study and favored "Republics" over "Principalities".

Anti-statist liberals consider Machiavelli's distrust as his main message, noting his call for a strong state under a strong leader, who should use any means to establish his position, whereas liberalism is an ideology of individual freedom and voluntary choices.

** ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio]]'', 1512–1517 (Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius)

===Desiderius Erasmus===
[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|upright|Desiderius Erasmus]]
'''[[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]]''' (Netherlands, 1466–1536) was an advocate of [[humanism]], critic of entrenched interests, irrationality and superstition. Erasmusian societies formed across Europe, to some extent in response to the turbulence of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].
In his ''De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio'' (1524), he analyzes the Lutheran exaggeration of the obvious limitations on human freedom.

===Thomas Hobbes===
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Hobbes]]
'''[[Thomas Hobbes]]''' (England, 1588–1679) theorized that government is the result of individual actions and human traits, and that it was motivated primarily by "interest", a term which would become crucial in the development of a liberal theory of government and political economy, since it is the foundation of the idea that individuals can be self-governing and self-regulating. His work ''Leviathan'', did not advocate this viewpoint, but instead that only a strong government could restrain unchecked interest: it did, however, advance a proto-liberal position in arguing for an inalienable "right of nature," the right to defend oneself, even against the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} Though his own ideological position is open to debate, his work influenced Locke, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and many other liberals, leading [[Leo Strauss|Strauss]] to identify Hobbes as the "father of liberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Jaume, "Hobbes and the Philosophical Sources of Liberalism", ''The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes' Leviathan'', 211&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contributing literature:
**''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', 1651 (Theologico-Political Treatise)

===Baruch Spinoza===
'''[[Baruch Spinoza]]''' (Netherlands, 1632–1677) is in his ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' and ''Tractatus Politicus'' a proto-liberal defending the value of [[separation of church and state]] as well as forms of [[democracy]]. In the first mentioned book, Spinoza expresses an early criticism of religious intolerance and a defense of [[secular]] [[government]]. Spinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[Need|necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. So freedom is not the possibility to say "no" to what happens to us but the possibility to say "yes" and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that way.

==From Locke to Mill==

===John Locke===
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|upright|John Locke]]
'''[[John Locke]]'s''' (England, 1632–1704) notion that a "[[government]] with the [[consent of the governed]]" and man's [[natural rights]]—[[life]], [[liberty]], and [[Estate (law)|estate]] ([[property]]) as well on [[Toleration|tolerance]], as laid down in ''A letter concerning toleration'' and ''Two treatises of government''—had an enormous influence on the development of [[liberalism]]. Developed a theory of property resting on the actions of individuals, rather than on descent or nobility.

===Charles de Montesquieu===
[[File:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|thumb|upright|Montesquieu]]
'''[[Montesquieu|Charles de Montesquieu]]''' (France, 1689–1755)

In ''The Spirit of the Laws'', Montesquieu expounded the separation of powers in government and society. In government, Montesquieu encouraged division into the now standard legislative, judicial and executive branches; in society, he perceived a natural organization into king, the people and the aristocracy, with the latter playing a mediating role. "I do not write to censor that which is established in any country whatsoever," Montesquieu disclaimed in the ''Laws''; however, he did pay special attention to what he felt was the positive example of the constitutional system in England, which in spite of its evolution toward a fusion of powers, had moderated the power of the monarch, and divided Parliament along class lines.

Montesquieu's work had a seminal impact on the American and French revolutionaries. Ironically, the least liberal element of his thought—his privileging of the aristocracy—was belied by both revolutions. Montesquieu's system came to fruition in America, a country with no aristocracy; in France, political maneuvering by the aristocracy led to the convocation of the 1789 Estates-General and popular revolt.

===Anders Chydenius===
[[File:Anders Chydenius.jpg|upright|thumb|Anders Chydenius]]
'''[[Anders Chydenius]]''' (Finland (then a part of the Swedish realm), 1729–1803)
His book ''Den Nationale Winsten'' (engl. ''The National Gain'') proposed roughly same the ideas as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''Wealth of Nations'', a decade earlier, including foundations of [[liberalism]] and [[capitalism]] and (roughly) the ''[[invisible hand]]''. He demanded complete economic and individual freedom, including the freedom of religion (although he was a priest), worker's rights to freely move and choose their professions and employers, the freedom of speech and trade and abolitions of all privileges and price and wage controls.

He was also a member of the Swedish four-estates parliament, elected three times as representative of the clergy in the northern and western parts of Finland. In his first parliamentary session, 1765–1766, he was very successful as a member of the subcommittee that wrote Sweden's famous Constitutional Law of the Freedom of Printing, [[Tryckfrihetsförordningen]], of 1766. In this law Chydenius combined freedom of the press, and abolishment of the political [[censorship]], with free access for the citizens to most government documents. Chydenius liberal system, where transparency reinforces press freedom, and the right for everyone to print the public document reinforces transparency, has been a fundamental constitutional principle in Sweden ever since, except for the years of royal autocracy 1772–1809. Chydenius model for press freedom and freedom of information was reestablished and strengthened in the Swedish Constitution 1809. It is now the foundation of the present [[Tryckfrihetsförordningen]] of 1949, which is one of the fundamental laws of Sweden.

In diluted form, and without the strong constitutional protection of the Swedish free press model, the principle of free access to public documents that originated in Chydenius law of 1766, has in recent decades been spread from Sweden to the [[Freedom of information legislation|Freedom of Information Acts]] of many countries. This way, Anders Chydenius, has become one of the older liberal thinkers that has most practical influence on politics and public administration of modern western societies.

An edition of Anders Chydenius Complete Works, in Finnish, Swedish and English, is under preparation by the Chydenius Foundation in Finland.

===Adam Smith===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|upright|thumb|Adam Smith]]
'''[[Adam Smith]]''' (Great Britain, 1723–1790), often considered the founder of modern [[economics]], was a key figure in formulating and advancing economic doctrine of free trade and competition. In his ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. This concept has been quoted out of context by later economists as the [[invisible hand]] of the market.

Smith also advanced property rights and personal [[civil liberties]], including stopping slavery, which today partly form the basic liberal ideology. He was also opposed to stock-holding companies, what today is called a "corporation", because he predicated the self-policing of the free market upon the free association of moral individuals.

'''[[John Stuart Mill]]''' (United Kingdom, 1806–1873) is one of the first champions of modern "liberalism." As such, his work on [[political economy]] and [[logic]] helped lay the foundation for advancements in empirical science and public policy based on verifiable improvements. Strongly influenced by Bentham's [[utilitarianism]], he disagrees with Kant's intuitive notion of right and formulates the "highest normative principle" of morals as:
''Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.''

Some consider Mill as the founder of [[Social liberalism]]. Although Mill was mainly for [[free markets]], he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. Mill was also a champion of women's rights.

He supported a state limited in its duties to the defense of persons and their property. For Spencer, voluntary cooperation was the hallmark of the most vibrant form of society, accommodating the widest diversity of members and the greatest diversity of goals. Spencer's [[evolution]]ary approach has been characterized as an extension of [[Adam Smith]]'s "invisible hand" explanation of economic order; his extensive work on sympathy (in [[psychology]] as well as the foundation of ethics, particularly in ''[[The Data of Ethics]]'') explicitly carried on Smith's approach in ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''.

Şinasi, influenced by Enlightenment thought, saw [[freedom of expression]] as a fundamental right and used journalism in order to engage, communicate with, and educate the public.

'''[[Isaiah Berlin]]''' (Latvia/United Kingdom, 1909–1997) is most famous for his attempt to distinguish 'two conceptions of liberty'. Berlin argued that what he called 'positive' and 'negative' liberty were mutually opposing concepts. Positive conceptions assumed that liberty could only be achieved when collective power (in the form of church or state) acted to 'liberate' mankind from its worst aspects. These, Berlin felt, tended towards totalitarianism. Negative conceptions, by contrast, argued that liberty was achieved when individuals were given maximal freedom from external constraints (so long as these did not impinge on the freedom of others to achieve the same condition). Berlin was also a critic of dogmatic Enlightenment rationalism on the grounds that it was unable to accommodate value pluralism.

===John Rawls===
'''[[John Rawls]]''' (United States, 1921–2002) is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. There is general agreement that the publication of his landmark work, ''A Theory of Justice'', led to a revival in the academic study of political philosophy. The importance of this book in contemporary liberal thought and [[social contract]] theory is perhaps best described by an early libertarian rival and critic, [[Robert Nozick]], who called it a "work in political and moral philosophy that has not seen its equal since the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]], if then.... Political philosophers must now work within Rawls' theory or explain why not." (Nozick, Anarchy, State, and Utopia, p.&amp;nbsp;183) Some of Rawls's contributions include the ideas of [[Justice as Fairness]], the [[original position]], [[reflective equilibrium]], [[overlapping consensus]], [[public reason]], and the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]]. Rawls has the distinction among contemporary political philosophers of being frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and referred to by practicing politicians in the United Kingdom.

===Richard Rorty===
'''[[Richard Rorty]]''' (United States, 1931–2007) was one of the leading contemporary philosophers of liberalism. His fundamental claims, among others, are that liberalism is best defined as the attempt to avoid cruelty to others; that liberals need to accept the historical 'irony' that there is no metaphysical justification for their belief that not being cruel is a virtue; that literature plays a crucial role in developing the empathy necessary to promote solidarity (and therefore lack of cruelty) between humans; and that private philosophising and public political discourse are separate practices and should remain so.

===Amartya Sen===
[[File:Amartya Sen.jpg|thumb|upright|Amartya Sen]]
'''[[Amartya Sen]]''' (India, 1933– ) is an economist whose early work was based on [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s General Possibility Theorem, and on the impossibility of both complete [[pareto optimality]] and solely procedural based rights.

The economist '''[[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]]''' (Peru, 1941– ) is an advocate of transparency and private property rights, arguing that intransparent government leads to property not being given proper title, and therefore being "dead capital" which cannot be used as the basis of credit. Argues that laws which allocate property to those most able to use them for economic growth, so called "squatter's rights", are an important innovation.
* Some literature:

* Some literature:
** ''We, The People''

===Will Kymlicka===
'''[[Will Kymlicka]]''' (Canada, 1962– ) tries in his philosophy to determine if forms of ethnic or minority [[nationalism]] are compatible with liberal-democratic principles of individual freedom, social equality and political democracy. In his book ''Multicultural Citizenship. A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights'' he argues that certain "group-differentiated rights" of minority cultures can be consistent with these liberal-democratic principles.

This article provides a summary of results for the '''[[general election]]s''' to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of '''[[Nova Scotia]]'''{{'}}s [[unicameral]] [[Legislature|legislative body]], the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]]. The number of seats has varied over time, from a low of thirty during the 1930s and early 1940s, to the current high of fifty-two. This article only covers elections since Nova Scotia became part of the newly formed [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867. Prior to that, Nova Scotia was a British colony. The Nova Scotia '''House of Assembly''' [[List of Nova Scotia General Assemblies|dates back to 1758]], and Nova Scotia became the first British colony to be granted [[responsible government]] from London in 1848.

The chart on the upper right provides a graphical summary of the results, with the most recent elections towards the right. It shows how the [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal party]] (red) dominated the province's early political history, winning nineteen of the first twenty-two elections from 1867 to 1953; and that since 1953, the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Conservatives]] (blue) have been the most successful party, winning eleven of the fifteen elections since then. The [[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (orange), after winning [[Leader of the Opposition (Nova Scotia)|Official Opposition status]] in four consecutive elections, finally achieved government for the first time in the [[Nova Scotia general election, 2009|2009 election]].

==Summary of results==
The table below shows the total number of seats won by the major political parties at each election. It also shows the percentage of the vote obtained by the major political parties at each election, if greater than 0.1%. The winning party's totals are shown in bold.

A '''major party''' is a political party that holds substantial influence in a country's politics, standing in contrast to a [[minor party]]. It should not be confused with [[majority party]].

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary:
{{quotation|Major party: a political party having electoral strength sufficient to permit it to win control of a government usually with comparative regularity and when defeated to constitute the principal opposition to the party in power.|Merriam-Webster Dictionary online&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/major+party Merriam-Webster Dictionary online]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Major parties hold a significant percentage of the vote in elections and claim higher membership than minor parties. Typically, major parties have the most donors, best-organized support networks and excellent funding for elections. Their candidates for political positions are closely watched since they have the highest chance of being elected to office because of the high membership, recognition and donations that these parties are able to generate.

Two major parties can lead to a [[two-party system]]. If there is only one major party, then it is a [[dominant-party system]].  In a [[multi-party system]], a major party is one that occasionally controls the presidency or premiership and is the most influential party in a [[coalition government]].

It is still in use today.  Nearby is an example of a religious building called a "meeting house", the Marlboro Meeting House Congregational Church.]]

A '''meeting house''' ('''meetinghouse''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meeting%20house "Meeting house"] in [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''meeting-house'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) is a building where religious and sometimes public meetings take place.

The [[colonial meeting house]] in America was typically the first public building built as new villages sprang up. A meeting-house had a dual purpose as a place of worship and for public discourse, but sometimes only for "...the service of God."&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Kevin M..

Many [[nonconformist]] Christian denominations{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} distinguish between a
* '''Church''', which is a body of people who believe in Christ
* '''Meeting house''' or '''[[chapel]]''', which is a building where the church meets

The nonconformist meeting houses generally do not have steeples, with the term "steeplehouses" being used to describe traditional or establishment religious buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quaker Spirituality: Selected Writings|year=2005|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060578725|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=niEc_APtSKMC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Christian denominations which use the term "meeting house" to refer to the building in which they hold their worship include:
*[[Anabaptist]] congregations
**[[Amish]] congregations
**[[Mennonite]] congregations
*[[Congregationalist polity|Congregational churches]] with their congregation-based system of church governance.  They also use the term "[[mouth-house]]s"  to emphasize their use as a place for discourse and discussion.
*[[Christadelphians]]
*[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]) uses the term "meetinghouse" for the building where congregations meet for [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|weekly worship services]], recreational events, and social gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Hamilton |first= C.

The '''Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature''' ({{lang-no|Det Norske Akademi for Språk og Litteratur}}), commonly known as the '''Norwegian Academy''', is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] learned body on matters pertaining to the modern [[Norwegian language]] in its [[Dano-Norwegian]] variety, now commonly known as [[Riksmål]] and [[Bokmål]]. The academy was established in the Norwegian government's honorary residence [[Grotten]] in 1953 based on the model of the [[Swedish Academy]] and the [[French Academy]], but the idea was originally conceived by [[Bjørn Bjørnson]] in 1913. Its members are elected for life on the basis of scholarly, literary or artistic merits. The academy publishes the main dictionary of Norwegian, ''[[Det Norske Akademis ordbok]]'' ("Dictionary of the Norwegian Academy"), is responsible for regulating the written standard known as [[Riksmål]] ("National Language") and has a literary and cultural purpose. The academy awards the [[Norwegian Academy Prize in memory of Thorleif Dahl]].

==History==

The academy was founded in 1953 by several notable [[Norway|Norwegian]] authors and poets, among them [[Arnulf Øverland]], [[Sigurd Hoel]], [[A. H. Winsnes|A.H. Winsnes]], [[Cora Sandel]] and [[Francis Bull]]. They disagreed with the official [[language policy]] aiming to merge ''[[Bokmål]]'' with ''[[Nynorsk]]'' and protested against what they called state discrimination against the dominant Norwegian written standard ''Riksmål''. This was Norway's ''de facto'' written language, used by most large newspapers and by the majority of the population as a written standard (although not necessarily a spoken one). The Academy was modelled after the [[Swedish Academy]] and the [[Académie française|French Academy]].

In addition to regulating [[Riksmål]], the most conservative and [[Danish language|Danish]]-near form of Norwegian, the academy publishes dictionaries and supports the publishing of literature in Riksmål. To-day, after several reforms worth in the official Bokmål and in the traditional Riksmål, Bokmål in its "moderate" version and modern Riksmål coincide.

The Academy has 50 members (2017), each of whom is a specialist in miscellaneous areas of analysis, investigation and expertise. These include Nordic studies, German, English and French languages and literature, history, philosophy, law, political science, poetry et cetera. The President of the Academy is  [[Nils Heyerdahl]],  former Head of Radio Drama in NRK, and the ''Presidium'' also consists of  Vice President [[Helene Uri]], linguist and author, as well as [[Per Qvale]], translator and author [[Karin Gundersen]], professor of French Literature and  [[Erik Fosnes Hansen]], author.

The Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was represented, along with other non-governmental language organisations, in the [[Norwegian Language Council]], which regulates the official ''Bokmål'' and ''Nynorsk'' languages, since its establishment in 1972 until it was reorganized in 2005.

In 1981, the Academy merged with [[Riksmålsvernet]], founded in 1919.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4838">[[File:Circoscrizioni 2017 - Estero - Suddivisioni.svg|thumb|right|350px|Italian overseas constituencies]]

The [[Italian Parliament]] is one of the few legislatures in the world to reserve seats for those [[expatriates|citizens residing abroad]]. There are twelve such seats in the Chamber of Deputies and six in the Senate of the Republic.

The '''Overseas Constituency''' ('''''Circoscrizione Estero''''', or "''Foreign district''") consists of four electoral zones, each of which elect at least one Deputy and one Senator:

* [[Europe]] (including [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]])
* [[South America]]
* [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]
* [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]] and [[Antarctica]]

The remaining seats are distributed between the same overseas electoral zones in proportion to the number of Italian citizens resident in each.

==History==
[[File:Plico elettorale Italia 2018.jpg|thumb|Electoral package sent to an Italian voter in South America for the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]].]]
Italian citizens living outside of Italy have always had the ''right'' to vote in all referendums and elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate). However, until late 2001, any citizen wishing to vote was required ''physically'' to return to the city or town in Italy where he or she was registered on the [[electoral roll]]. The only exception to this rule was for the Italian elections to the [[European Parliament]], in which voters could cast their ballot at their nearest consulate, but only if they had their residence in one of the other [[European Union|EU]] countries.

Until 2001 the Italian Republic offered citizens living abroad a free return train journey to their home town in Italy in order to vote. However, the only portion of the train journey that was free of charge was ''on Italian soil''. Any costs incurred in getting from their place of residence abroad to the Italian border had to be covered by the citizen wanting to vote. Therefore, a free return train journey was hardly an [[incentive]] for the large Italian communities living as far away as in the [[United States]], [[Argentina]] or [[Australia]]. For this reason very few Italians abroad made use of this right to vote, unless they lived in cities and towns that bordered Italy, such as in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. Various Italian minorities living abroad (notably in the United States) protested frequently at this lack of [[political representation]], especially if they paid taxes on property owned in Italy; some of them also demand that the rights of the Italian citizens living outside of the Italian peninsula (e.g. [[Sardinia]]), such as travel tickets and/or free flights to Italy, be extended to all Italian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freeflightstoitaly.ngo |title=Free Flights to Italy NGO |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous years of petitioning and fierce debate, the Italian government, in late 2001, finally passed a law allowing Italian citizens living abroad to vote in elections in Italy by [[postal ballot]]. Italians wishing to exercise this right must first register their residence abroad with their relevant consulate. The first vote by Italians living abroad by postal ballot was for 2 referendums in 2003 and for both chambers of the Italian parliament in 2006: twelve seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] and six seats in the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate of the Republic]].

In 2016, a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 2016|constitutional referendum]] was held in order to change the [[Constitution of Italy]]. The proposed constitution, put forward by the then [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] [[Matteo Renzi]], would eliminate the seats assigned to the overseas constituencies in the Senate of the Republic. Almost 60% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, which therefore was rejected, and Renzi tendered his resignation. However, Italians living abroad voted the opposite way (with 65% saying 'yes'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/05/italian-referendum-italians-live-abroad-voted-against-home/ |title=Italian referendum: How Italians who live abroad voted against those at home |date=5 December 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2017 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus asking to eliminate their own seats in the Senate.

{{Redirect|Pontifical coronation|the expressed rite of ceremoniously crowning Catholic images by the Pope|Canonical coronation}}
A '''papal coronation''' was the ceremony of the placing of the [[papal tiara]] on a newly elected [[pope]]. The first recorded papal coronation was that of [[Pope Nicholas I|Nicholas I]] in 858.&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Dopierała, ''Księga Papieży'', Poznań 1996, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The last was the 1963 coronation of [[Paul VI]], who soon afterwards abandoned the practice of wearing the tiara. None of his successors have used the tiara, and their [[papal inauguration]] celebrations have included no coronation ceremony.

The papal inauguration celebration, with or without a coronation, has only symbolic significance, as a pope assumes office immediately on giving his consent to a valid election.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the term ''Coronación Pontificia'' (English: "pontifical coronation") is sometimes used for the [[canonical coronation]] of religious images by via a formal expressed decree by a reigning Pope. 

==Ritual==
When a [[Papal conclave|conclave]] elects a new pope, he assumes all of the rights and authority of the papacy immediately upon his acceptance of election; however, popes traditionally numbered their [[regnal year]]s from the date of their coronation.&lt;ref name="conclave"&gt;{{Citation

 | year =1908
 | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia

 | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04192a.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt; If a newly elected pope is not a bishop, he is [[consecration#Consecration of bishops|consecrated]] at once. In accordance with tradition, the right of consecration belongs to the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], in his absence to the Subdean, and in the absence of both of these, to the senior [[Cardinal Bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html ''Universi Dominici gregis'', 90]&lt;/ref&gt; If the new pope is already a bishop, as is normally the case, his election is [[Habemus papam|announced]] immediately to the people gathered in Saint Peter's Square and he gives them his blessing.

The episcopal [[enthronement]] of the pope takes place in his [[cathedral]], the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]. This ceremony was once combined with the coronation. During the [[Avignon papacy]], the pope, being in France, could not be enthroned in his cathedral in Rome. The coronations continued, while enthronements had to await a return to Rome. When [[Gregory XI]] did return to Rome, the [[Lateran Palace]] was badly in need of repair, so the popes made the Vatican their residence and transferred coronations to [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. The Lateran Basilica remains the cathedral of Rome, and the enthronement occurs there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html ''Universi Dominici gregis'', 91]&lt;/ref&gt; During the "[[prisoner in the Vatican]]" period, the enthronement did not take place.

===Coronation Mass===
The coronation took place on the first Sunday or Holy Day following the election. It began with a solemn [[Papal Mass]]. During the chanting of [[Terce]], he sat on a throne and all of the cardinals made what was called their "first [[obeisance]]" to him, approaching one by one and kissing his hand. Then the [[archbishop]]s and [[bishop]]s approached and kissed his feet.

Following this, at least from the beginning of the 16th century, the newly elected pope was carried in state through St. Peter's Basilica on the ''[[sedia gestatoria]]'', under a white canopy, with the papal [[flabella]] (ceremonial fans) to either side. Instead of the papal tiara, he wore a jewelled [[mitre]] (the episcopal ''mitra pretiosa''). Three times, the procession was stopped, and a bundle of [[flax]] lashed to a gilded staff was burnt before the newly elected pontiff, while a [[master of ceremonies]] said: ''Pater Sancte, [[sic transit gloria mundi]]'' (Holy Father, thus passes the glory of the world) as a symbolic reminder to set aside materialism and vanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Once at the [[high altar]], he would begin to celebrate [[Solemn High Mass]] with full [[papal Mass|papal ceremonial]].

After the ''[[Confiteor]]'', the pope was seated on the sedia gestatoria, which was resting on the ground, and the three senior [[cardinal bishop]]s approached him wearing mitres. Each in turn placed his hands above him and said the prayer, ''Super electum Pontificem'' (over the elected pope). First the [[Cardinal Bishop of Albano]] said:&lt;blockquote&gt;God, who are present without distinction whenever the devout mind invokes you, be present, we ask you, we and this your servant, __, who to the summit of the apostolic community has been chosen as the judge of your people, infuse with the highest blessings that he experience your gift who has reached this point.&lt;ref&gt;"''Deus qui adesse non delignaris ubicumque devota mente invocaris, adesto quaesumus invocationibus nostris et huic famulo tuo N. quem ad culmen apostolicum commune iudicium tuae plebis elegit ubertatem supernae benedictionis infunde, ut sentiat se tuo munere ad hunc apicem pervenisse.''" [https://archive.org/stream/coronationrites00wooluoft#page/162/mode/2up ''Coronation Rites'', Reginald Maxwell Woolley, B.D. (Cambridge: at the University Press, 1915), pp. 160-161.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then the [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto]] said:&lt;blockquote&gt;We supplicate you, Almighty God, effect your customary devotion and pour out on this your servant, __, the grace of the Holy Spirit that he who is constituted at the head of our church as the servant of the mystery, you would strengthen with the fullness of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;"''Supplicationibus, omnipotens Deus, effectum consuetae pietatis impende, et gratia Spiritus Sancti hunc famulum tuum N. perfunde; ut qui in capite ecclesiarum nostrae servitutis mysterio constituitur, tuae virtutis soliditate roboretur.''" Ibid., p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally the [[Cardinal Bishop of Ostia]] said:&lt;blockquote&gt;God, who willed your Apostle Peter to hold first place in the inner fellowship of the apostles, that universal Christianity overcome evil, look propitiously we ask on this your servant, __, who from a humble position has suddenly been enthroned with the apostles on this same principal sublimity, that just as he has been raised to this exalted dignity, so may he likewise merit to accumulate virtue; in bearing the burden of the universal church, help him, make him worthy and for thee who are blessed may merits replace vices.&lt;ref&gt;"''Deus qui Apostolum tuum Petrum inter caeteros coapostolos primatum tenere voluisti, eique universae Christianitatis molem superimpostuisti; respice propitius quaesumus hunc famulum tuum N. quem de humili cathedra violenter sublimatum in thronum eiusdem apostolorum principis sublimamus: ut sicut profectibus tantae dignitatis augetur, ita virtutum meritis cumuletur; quatenus ecclesiasticae universitatis onus, te adiuvante, digne ferat, et a te qui es beatitudo tuorum meritam vicem recipiat.''" Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then, the senior [[cardinal deacon]] placed the [[pallium]] on his shoulders saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Accept the pallium, representing the plenitude of the Pontifical office, to the honour of Almighty God, and the most glorious Virgin Mary, his Mother, and the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and the Holy Roman Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gabrielmary.com/Papal%20Coronation.html Papal Coronation]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Accipe pallium, plenitudinem scilicet pontificalis officii, ad honorem omnipotentis Dei et gloriosissimae Virginis eius genitricis et beatorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli et sanctae Romanae ecclesiae.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 11th and 12th centuries, the ''immantatio'', or bestowal of the [[mantum]] (a papal vestment consisting of a very long red [[cope]] fastened with an elaborate [[Cope|morse]]) on the newly elected pope was regarded as especially symbolic of investiture with papal authority, and was conferred with the words: "I invest thee with the Roman papacy, that thou rule over the city and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After the investiture with the pallium, the pope incensed the high altar and then went to the Throne, placed on the choir side, between the Altar of the Confession and the Altar of the Chair, and there, during the singing of the Kyrie, he received again the obeisance of the cardinals, archbishops and bishops. Then the Mass continued.  After the [[Gloria in excelsis]] and the ''Pax vobis'', the pope said the [[Collect]] for the day and then secretly a prayer for himself.&lt;ref&gt;This prayer is from the form for the Consecration of a bishop. Woolley. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; After the pope had returned again to his seat the Papal ''Laudes'' were chanted:

As with all Papal High Masses, the Epistle and the Gospel were read in both Greek&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Epistle and Gospel were traditionally read by a [[subdeacon]] and a [[deacon]] from the Byzantine monastery of [[Grottaferrata]] east of Rome&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin and the pope communicated at his throne.&lt;ref&gt;I.e., the Sacrament was brought to the Pope by the deacon and the subdeacon at his throne and he consumed a portion of the Host and drank from the Chalice by means of a narrow gold or silver-gilt tube called a ''fistula''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coronation ===
[[Image:Coronation-BenedictXVsm.jpg|thumb|Photograph showing the moment of the coronation of [[Pope Benedict XV]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]], 1914&lt;br&gt;''The Humeston New Era'' (Iowa newspaper)]] 
After the Mass, the new pope was crowned with the [[papal tiara]]. This frequently took place on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, overlooking the crowds gathered in [[St. Peter's Square]]. The pope was seated on a [[throne]] with the flabella to either side of him. After the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] recited a few prayers, including the Lord's Prayer and a collect,  the senior [[cardinal deacon]], the [[protodeacon]], removed the pope's mitre and placed the tiara on his head with the words:

''Accipe tiaram tribus coronis ornatam, et scias te esse patrem principum et regum, rectorem orbis in terra vicarium Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, cui est honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum'' (Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns, and know that you are the father of princes and kings, the ruler of the world, the vicar of our Savior Jesus Christ on earth, to whom is honor and glory, world without end).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Henrick+%22receive+the+tiara%22&amp;btnG= Francis Patrick Henrick, ''The Primacy of the Apostolic See Vindicated'' (Baltimore, London and Pittsburgh 1857), p. 252]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Encyclopaedia+Americana+%22accipe+tiaram%22&amp;btnG= ''Encyclopaedia Americana'', article "Tiara"], the words were "''... scias te esse patrem, principem et regem ...'' (know that you are a father, a prince and a king).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his coronation, the pope imparted the solemn [[papal blessing]] ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]''.

===Taking possession of the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome===
[[Image:Benedictxiiiprocession.jpg|thumb|left|Procession for the ''possessio'' of [[Pope Benedict XIII]]]]
The last act of the inauguration of a new pope is still the formal taking possession (''possessio'') of his [[cathedra]] as [[Bishop of Rome]] in the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]. This is the final ceremony mentioned in Pope John Paul II's [[Apostolic Constitution]] on the vacancy of the Apostolic See and the election of the Roman Pontiff.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html Universi Dominici gregis,]'' 92&lt;/ref&gt; The pope is enthroned in the same manner as other bishops. He is solemnly conducted to the episcopal throne, and takes possession by seating himself on it. He receives the kiss of peace and listens to the reading of a passage of Holy Scripture, whereupon he pronounces an address that used to be called the ''sermo inthronisticus''.

In ancient times, the letters that the pope sent to the [[patriarch]]s in token of being in communion with them in the same faith were called ''litterae inthronisticae'' or ''syllabai enthronistikai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Location of the ceremony==
[[Image:Antipope Benedict XIII.jpg|thumb|Consecration of [[Antipope]] [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] at [[Avignon]], September 28, 1394]]
The earliest papal coronations took place in [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|St. John Lateran]], the pope's [[cathedral]]. However, for hundreds of years papal coronations have traditionally taken place in the environs of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], though a number of coronations took place in [[Avignon]], during the [[Avignon papacy]]. Earlier, [[Pope Celestine V]] was twice crowned in [[L'Aquila]].&lt;ref name="oce.catholic.com"/&gt; In 1800 [[Pope Pius VII]] was crowned in the crowded church of the [[Benedictine]] island [[monastery]] of San Giorgio, [[Venice]], after his late predecessor, [[Pope Pius VI]], had been forced into temporary exile during [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s capture of Rome. Since the French seized the tiara along with the previous pope, he was crowned with a [[Papier-mâché Tiara|papier-mâché tiara]], for which the ladies of Venice gave up their jewels.

All coronations after 1800 took place in Rome. [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] was crowned in the [[Sistine Chapel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moajrnl;cc=moajrnl;sid=48d32595ff5c5a25aefaa35705092d3c;q1=Coronation;rgn=full%20text;idno=bac8387.0027.158;view=image;seq=0284 Contemporary description of the coronation of Pope Leo XIII]&lt;/ref&gt; due to fears that anti-clerical mobs, inspired by [[Italian unification]], might attack the Basilica and disrupt the ceremony. [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]] was also crowned in the chapel in 1914. [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] was crowned at the dais in front of the High Altar in St. Peter's Basilica. Popes [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]], [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]], and [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]], all were crowned in public on the balcony of the basilica, facing crowds assembled below in [[St. Peter's Square]]. [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] was crowned in front of St Peter's on a special dais. The entire coronation ceremony had taken place outdoors as St Peter's was filled with special seating for the Vatican Council sessions and so unavailable for the coronation.

Pius XII's 1939 coronation broke new ground by being the first to be filmed and the first coronation to be broadcast live on radio.&lt;ref&gt;John Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII'' (Viking, 1999) pp. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony, which lasted for six hours, was attended by leading dignitaries; these included the heir to the Italian throne, the [[Umberto II of Italy|Prince of Piedmont]], former [[king]]s [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], the [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] (representing King [[George VI|George VI of the United Kingdom]]), and the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]], the last two being in [[White tie|evening dress]] (white tie and tails).

==Paul VI and the coronation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Coronation of Pope Paul VI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pope Paul VI]] receives his crown during Papal Coronation, June 1963. He is the last Pope to be crowned.]] --&gt;
The last pope to be crowned was [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]. Though he decided to cease wearing a papal tiara within weeks of his coronation, and laid his own on the [[altar]] of St. Peter's Basilica in a gesture of humility, his 1975 [[Apostolic Constitution]], ''[[Romano Pontifici Eligendo]]'', still prescribed that "the new [[pontiff]] is to be crowned by the senior [[cardinal deacon]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6ROMPON.HTM Romano Pontifici Eligendo Section 92.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, his successor, [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], opted not to be crowned and to have a less formal "[[Papal Inauguration|solemn Mass to mark the start of his ministry as Supreme Pastor]]" in September 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946069-4,00.html Time Magazine: How Pope John Paul I Won]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/16155 |title=National Catholic Register: 33 Days of the Smiling Pope |access-date=2008-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109130457/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/16155 |archive-date=2009-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Paul II and the coronation==
{{main|Papal inauguration}}

After John Paul I's sudden death following a thirty-three-day [[reign]], the new pope, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], opted to copy his predecessor's ceremony without coronation. In his homily at his inauguration Mass, he said that Paul VI had "left his successors free to decide" whether to wear the papal tiara.&lt;ref&gt;Papal Inauguration Homily of Pope John Paul II, ''L'Osservatore Romano'' [http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=1138 (Text of the Homily)]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on:
{{"|Pope John Paul I, whose memory is so vivid in our hearts, did not wish to have the tiara; nor does his Successor wish it today. This is not the time to return to a ceremony and an object considered, wrongly, to be a symbol of the temporal power of the Popes.}}

John Paul II's 1996 [[Apostolic Constitution]], ''[[Universi Dominici gregis]]'', now in force, does not specify the form that the "solemn ceremony of the inauguration of the pontificate"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html Universi Dominici gregis], 92&lt;/ref&gt; of a new pope should take, whether with or without a coronation.

Existing papal tiaras remain available for any future pope who may choose to use one. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWpO1--eMrYC&amp;pg=PA900&amp;lpg=PA900&amp;dq=tiara+coronation+unlikely&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8R5WGhTZ2R&amp;sig=cohcG7SpJI_Nb8fUl-0UyicLAVU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nU0JS-70FMSG4QbUt_y_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tiara%20coronation%20unlikely&amp;f=false OSV's encyclopedia of Catholic history, ''Tiara'' (p. 900)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism}}
'''Post-capitalism''' includes a number of proposals for a new [[economic system]] to replace [[capitalism]], examine more [[Advanced capitalism|advanced]] forms, or otherwise speculate on the fate of the current form of the social order. According to some [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] and some [[Social evolution|social evolutionary theories]], post-capitalist societies may come about as a result of spontaneous evolution as capitalism becomes obsolete. Others propose models to intentionally replace capitalism. The most notable among them are [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]].

==Transition forces==
In 1993, [[Peter Drucker]] outlined a possible evolution of capitalistic society in his book ''[[Post-Capitalist Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F.|title=Post-Capitalist Society|date=1993|publisher=HarperInformation|isbn=978-0-7506-0921-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750609210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book stated that knowledge, rather than capital, land, or labor, is the new basis of wealth. The classes of a fully post-capitalist society are expected to be divided into knowledge workers or service workers, in contrast to the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] of a capitalist society. In the book, Drucker estimated the transformation to post-capitalism would be completed in 2010–2020.

Drucker also argued for rethinking the concept of intellectual property by creating a universal licensing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Peter|title=Post-Capitalist|url=https://www.wired.com/1993/03/drucker-2/|accessdate=17 March 2016|work=WIRED|date=1 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers would subscribe, for a cost and producers would assume that everything is reproduced and freely distributed through social networks.

In 2015, according to [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] the rise of income inequality, repeating cycles of unemployment and inflation and capitalism’s contributions to global warming had led both economists and philosophers to begin seriously considering post-capitalistic societies. Post-capitalism is expected to arise with further advances in automation and information sharing – both of which cause production costs to approach zero.&lt;ref name=PostCapMason&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Paul|title=PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future|date=2015|publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=9781846147388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological drivers of post-capitalism==
The emergence of post-capitalist dynamics were made possible through three major changes that were brought by the evolution and increasing sophistication of information technology. A first driver is a new dynamic that information technology brought to the workplace. Through increased connectivity the reachability of employees was improved and the lines between working hours and free time became blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N. Korody|title=Architecture after capitalism, in a world without work|url=http://uk.archinect.com/features/article/149935222/architecture-after-capitalism-in-a-world-without-work?ukredirect|accessdate=25 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the technological era led to an abundance of information that is easily retainable for everyone. While some industries only continued to exist due to information scarcity and secrecy, the market became disrupted by the emergence of new competitors that were able to enter the market and benefit from large sources of publicly-available information. A result of this was the increase in acquisition activities since the early 2000s which tried to counter decreasing margins through consolidation and monopoly building. A third dynamic that emerged from new technology was [[crowd-funding]] and [[crowd-sourcing]]. Crowd-funding led to a new option for corporate finance, which was often achieved for socially-accepted innovations. Crowd-sourcing on the other hand challenged the traditional employee-employer relationship under capitalism as people started to voluntarily contribute to product developments with a distinctive skill, such as programming or designing. A major reward for people engaged in crowd-sourcing is not monetary compensation, but the intrinsic reward of having a stake in an active development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=P. Mason|title=Three dynamics leading to post-capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun|accessdate=25 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism==
Socialism often implies public ownership of companies and a planned economy, though it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2017}} whether either are essential features. In his book ''[[PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future]]'', [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] argues that centralized planning, even with the advanced technology of today, is unachievable.&lt;ref name=PostCapMason /&gt; Alternatively, [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]] argue that central planning is key to creating a [[Participatory economics|participatory economy]].

For post-capitalism to come from a socialist standpoint, a political and cultural transformation would need to occur alongside the economic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Unorthodox Marxism: An Essay on Capitalism, Socialism, and Revolution|date=1978|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Socialism Today and Tomorrow|date=1981|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080773}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Marxism and Socialist Theory: Socialism in Theory and Practice|date=1981|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Robin Hahnel]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hahnel|first1=Robin|title=What Is To Be Done?|url=https://zcomm.org/znetarticle/what-is-to-be-done-by-robin-hahnel-1/|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=Our defense strategy—and we will need one—must be centered on organizing for massive resistance and non-compliance since no elite, no matter how well armed, can rule unless we, the people, carry out their orders.}}

Helpful definitions involving socialism:
* [[Socialism]], an economic system based on public or cooperative ownership of the [[means of production]] where production is carried out to directly produce [[use-value]], that includes a moneyless form of accounting such as [[Calculation in kind|physical resource accounting]] or [[Labour voucher|labor-time]] and based on the direct production of utility rather than on the capitalist laws of accumulation and value. Some models of socialism imply [[economic planning]] for the allocation of the factors of production in place of [[capital market]]s, while other models of socialism retain market-based allocation of capital goods. Some Marxists believe socialism would eventually in turn evolve into [[communism]].
* [[Economic planning|Planned socialism]], a type of socialism where some form of economic planning substitutes markets for allocating the [[factors of production]] and for coordinating the economy. There are various types of planning, including [[central planning]] and [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]; [[material balance planning]], input-output planning and computerized planning.
* [[Market socialism]], a type of socialism based on [[Socialization (economics)|socialization]] and public or cooperative ownership of the means of production, but retains monetary calculation and market competition and utilizes markets as the primary way of allocating the factors of production.
* [[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]], a political theory based on the writings of [[Murray Bookchin]]. Bookchin developed Communalism after he broke with anarchism believing it to be individualist and lifestylist. It is based on [[libertarian municipalism]], [[confederalism]] and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

==Participatory economy==
{{main|Participatory economy}}
In his book ''Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy'', [[Robin Hahnel]] describes a post-capitalist economy called the [[Participatory economics|participatory economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hahnel|first1=Robert|title=Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy|date=2012|publisher=AK Press Distribution|isbn=0983059764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ends with the proposal of the [[Green New Deal]], a package of policies that address [[climate change]] and [[Financial crisis|financial crises]].

The participatory economy focuses on the participation of all citizens through the creation of worker councils and consumer councils. Hahnel emphasizes the direct participation of worker and consumers rather than appointing representatives. The councils are concerned with large-scale issues of production and consumption and are broken into various bodies tasked with researching future development projects.

In a participatory economy, economic rewards would be offered according to need, the amount of which would be determined democratically by the workers council. Hahnel also calls for "economic justice" by rewarding people for their effort and diligence rather than accomplishments or prior ownership.  A worker’s effort is to be determined by their co-workers. Consumption rights are then rewarded according to the effort ratings. The worker has the choice to decide what they consume using their consumption rights. Hahnel does not address the idea of money, currency, or how consumption rights would be tracked.

Planning in a participatory economy is done through the councils. The process is horizontal across the committees as opposed to vertical. All council members, the workers and consumers, participate directly in planning unlike in Soviet-type economies and other democratic planning proposals in which planning is done by representatives. Planning is an iterative procedure, always being changed and improved upon, that is accomplished at the level of either work or consumption. All information and proposals are freely available to everyone, those inside and outside of the council, so that the social cost of each proposal can be determined and voted on. Long-term plans such as structuring public transportation, residential zones and recreational areas, are to be proposed by delegates and approved by [[direct democracy]] (i.e. voting by the population).

Hahnel argues that a participatory economy will return empathy to our purchasing choices. Capitalism removes the knowledge of how and by whom a product was made: "When we eat a salad the market systematically deletes information about the migrant workers who picked it".&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Participatory Planning|url=http://www.walkingbutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/participatory-planning-michael-albert-robin-hahnel.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the human element from goods, consumers only consider their own satisfaction and need when consuming products. Introducing worker and consumer councils would reintroduce the knowledge of where, how and by whom products were manufactured. A participatory economy is expected to also introduce more socially oriented goods, such as parks, clean air, and public health care, through the interaction of the two councils.

For those that call the participatory economy [[utopia]]n, Albert and Hahnel counter:&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; {{quote|text=Are we being utopian? It is utopian to expect more from a system than it can possibly deliver. To expect equality and justice—or even rationality—from capitalism is utopian. To expect social solidarity from markets, or self-management from central planning, is equally utopian. To argue that competition can yield empathy or that authoritarianism can promote initiative or that keeping most people from decision making can employ human potential most fully: these are utopian fantasies without question. But to recognize human potentials and to seek to embody their development into a set of economic institutions and then to expect those institutions to encourage desirable outcomes is no more than reasonable theorizing. What is utopian is not planting new seeds but expecting flowers from dying weeds.}}

==Anarchism==

The '''Purge''' in Japan was the prohibition of designated Japanese people from engaging in public service, by order of the General Headquarters of the Allied Forces ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]]) after Japan's defeat in [[World War II]]. It ended upon the end of the occupation of Japan in 1952.

==General descriptions==

Edict No. 109 was issued in the name of the Japanese emperor prohibiting [[POW]]s, cooperators of [[World War II]], those belonging to [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]], [[Taisei Yokusankai]] and Gokokudoshikai from engaging in public service in 1946. In 1947, the range of prohibited positions widened, including private enterprises. More than 20,000 people were purged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetsuo|first1=Hirata|last2=Dower|first2=John W.|title=Japan's Red Purge: Lessons from a Saga of Suppression of Free Speech and Thought|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=July 2007|volume=5|issue=7|page=3|url=http://apjjf.org/-John-W.-Dower/2462/article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A purge qualification committee was established to address objections between March 1947 and March 1948 and restarting in February 1949. The law was abolished by law No.94 in 1952 after the Allied occupation came to an end. In 1948, 148 people including politician Wataru Narahashi and Shigeru Hori were denied their purge and four people including [[Takeru Inukai]] obtained release from the purge.

==Effects of the purge==
Leading political figures world disappeared and the next generation gained power. Especially in education and mass communications, leftists and communist sympathizers gained power, which was against the desire of occupation authorities. Nevertheless, the purge of government officials, including judges and those belonging to [[Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu]], was less strict; the latter went to other posts. Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives were purged, but members of their families ran for election, preserving their seats. The policies of the occupation authorities had changed by the intended February 1 [[General strike]], which did not take place by the order of the GHQ and the 1950 [[Korean War]], and those who were purged changed to leftists under the name of the red purge or [[red scare]].

==End of the purge==
In 1950, individuals began to be released from the purge, including some from the Army and Navy. In May 1951, General [[Matthew Ridgway]] stated that the purge would be generally softened and authority would be transferred to the Japanese government. In 1951, more than 250,000 people were freed. At the end, [[Nobusuke Kishi]] and another 5,500 people remained purged.

'''''R v Malmo-Levine; R v Caine''''' [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, 2003 SCC 74, is a leading constitutional decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The Court rejected a constitutional challenge of the criminalization of [[marijuana]].

==Background==
The decision involves two cases. The first was where [[David Malmo-Levine]], a "marijuana/freedom activist",  ran an organization in East [[Vancouver]] called the "Harm Reduction Club", which attempts to reduce the harm associated with marijuana use by educating users and the public about the drug and provide the drug at cost. In December 1996 the police raided the Harm Reduction Club and seized 316 grams of marijuana charging Malmo-Levine with possession for the purpose of trafficking.

The second case involved the 1993 arrest of Victor Caine for possession of marijuana. Caine was in his van by the ocean when two [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officers approached him. He was stopped and a 0.5 gram were found in his possession.

Both Caine and Malmo-Levine challenged the constitutionality of the criminalization of marijuana under the [[Narcotics Control Act]].

Malmo-Levine's argument focused on whether there should be a requirement of harm for [[criminal law]]. He argued that the constitutional power to enact criminal law under section 91(27) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] is limited to conduct that causes harm. He further argued that the "harm principle" should be a principle of [[fundamental justice]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==Opinion of the Court==
Gonthier and Binnie JJ., writing the majority, rejected all the arguments for the requirements of harm under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and section 7 of the Charter. They held that [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] need not establish harm but only a reasonable apprehension of harm.

Gonthier and Binnie looked towards ''[[R v Hauser]]'', which held that narcotics were a new matter not considered in 1867 and so falls under the [[peace, order and good government]] power. They suggest that this case was likely wrong as narcotics is clearly a matter of criminal law.

The criminal law power, they state, includes the protection of vulnerable groups. Thus the government is able to control activities for the protection of drug users and society.

'''Rada''' is the term for "parliament" or "assembly" or some other "council" in several [[Slavic languages]]. Normally it is translated as "council". Sometimes it corresponds to "[[parliament]]", or in [[Soviet Union]] contexts, to "[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]". It also carries a meaning of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], as in the English word "counsel".

== Etymology ==

[[Old High German]] ''rāt'' (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''[[Linguistic reconstruction|*rēdaz]]'') passed (possibly through [[Polish language|Polish]]) into the [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and  [[Russian language|Russian]] languages.

''Råd'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Rat'' in [[German language|German]], ''raati'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''raad'' in [[Estonian language|Estonia]]/[[Dutch language|Dutch]] mean "council" or "assembly", but also "advice", as it does in [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] (except Russian) and [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]], but not [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]], languages.

In Swedish the verb ''råda'' (to counsel) is based on the substantive ''råd''. This is similar to Danish ''råd'' (noun) and ''råde'' (verb).

==Examples==

'''In [[Belarus]]'''
* [[Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic]], provisional parliament of the [[Belarusian People's Republic|Belarusian Democratic Republic]] (now in exile)
* [[Belarusian Central Rada]], the government of Belarus from 1943–44, which was established by [[Nazi Germany]]

'''In [[Czech Republic]]'''
*[[Czech National Council|Česká národní rada]], parliament of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] (1969&amp;ndash;1990) and the [[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic|Czech Republic]] (1990&amp;ndash;1992)

'''In [[Poland]]'''
*[[Central Welfare Council|Rada Główna Opiekuńcza]] (Central Welfare Council)
*[[Council of National Unity|Rada Jedności Narodowej]] (Council of National Unity)
*[[Monetary Policy Council|Rada Polityki Pieniężnej]] (Monetary Policy Council)
*[[Rada Trzech]] (Council of Three)

'''In [[Slovakia]]'''
* [[Slovak National Council (1848–1849)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1848–1849)
* [[Slovak National Council (1914)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1941)
* [[Slovak National Council (1918)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1918)
* [[Slovak National Council (1920)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1920)
* [[Slovak National Council (1932)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1932)
* [[Slovak National Council (1939–1940)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1939–1940)
* [[Slovak National Council (1943–1960)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1943–1960)
* [[Slovak National Council (1943–1992)|Slovenská národná rada]] (1943–1992)
* [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|Národná rada Slovenskej republiky]], the parliament of the [[Slovak Republic]] (1992&amp;ndash;)

'''In [[Ukraine]]'''
*[[Sich Rada]] (Council of Zaporizhian Sich), [[Cossack Rada]]
*[[Tsentralna Rada]] (Central Council), parliament of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]
*[[Verkhovna Rada]] (Supreme Council), the parliament of Ukraine

Historically, the ''Verkhovna Rada'' was also the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Українська ''Радянська'' Соціалістична Республіка [УРСР], ''Ukrayins'ka ''Radyans'ka'' Sotsialistychna Respublika [URSR]''), which was itself part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Союз ''Радянських'' Соціалістичних Республік, [СРСР]), the word ''rada'' replacing the Russian word ''soviet'' in both cases.  See [[official names of the Soviet Union]].

This article provides a detailed historic account of the '''reception and criticism of security and privacy features''' in the '''[[WhatsApp]]''' messaging service.

==2011==

On May 20, 2011, an unconfirmed security researcher from the Netherlands under the pseudonym "WhatsappHack" published, to the Dutch websites Tweakers.net and GeenStijl, a method by which WhatsApp accounts could be hijacked. The researcher noticed a flaw in the authentication process, which allowed the researcher to hijack an account by trying to login with another phone number and intercepting the verification SMS text message that, under specific conditions, remained in the outbox of the Symbian phone after the WhatsApp client would attempt to send it to itself. On Android, the verification message could be obtained through reading the "radio" with a tool named "logcat". The researcher would then copy and send the intercepted verification message to the real number of the phone, using an SMS gateway to spoof the "sender" phone number to the number the researcher tried to maliciously login with. This method worked, and WhatsApp issued a patch within one day after publication of the articles, to both the Android and Symbian clients. WhatsApp did have a security mechanism, by design, which would disable the account on the phone of the original owner of the phone number, when they had a WhatsApp account.&lt;ref name ="Whatsapp-authentication-issue-news-item"&gt;{{cite web | last = de Vries | first = Wilbert | title = Fout in verificatiecheck Whatsapp maakt meelezen berichten mogelijk | language = Dutch | publisher = Tweakers | url = https://tweakers.net/nieuws/74576/fout-in-verificatiecheck-whatsapp-maakt-meelezen-berichten-mogelijk.html | date = May 21, 2011 | accessdate = August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Whatsapp-authentication-issue-news-item2"&gt;{{cite web | author = Mutsaerts | title = WhatsApp. Nu NOG lekker! | language = Dutch | publisher = Geenstijl | url = http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2011/05/whatsapp_nu_nog_lekker.html | date = May 20, 2011 | accessdate = August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Whatsapp-authentication-issue-news-item3"&gt;{{cite news | last = McCarty | first = Brad | title = Signup goof leaves WhatsApp users open to account hijacking | url = https://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/05/23/signup-goof-leaves-whatsapp-users-open-to-account-hijacking/ | work = The Next Web | date = May 23, 2011 | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, another security hole was reported which left communication through WhatsApp susceptible to [[packet analyzer|packet analysis]].

In May 2012 security researchers noticed that new updates of WhatsApp no longer sent messages as plaintext,&lt;ref name = "MiEquipoEstaLoco"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = IT Pro | work = Mi equipo está loco | place = [[Spain|ES]] | url = http://blogs.itpro.es/miequipoestaloco/whatsapp-ya-cifra-los-mensajes/ | language = Spanish| title = Whatsapp ya cifra los mensajes |trans-title=What’s app already encrypts messages | date = May 11, 2012 | accessdate = May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davidbb"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/davidbb/status/199861196365639680 | title = Twitter | type = status | first = David | last = BB | date = May 8, 2012 | accessdate = May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sp0rkbomb"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/sp0rkbomb/status/200579125818298370 | title = Twitter | author = Sp0rk bomb | date = May 10, 2012 | accessdate = May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the cryptographic method implemented was subsequently described as "broken".&lt;ref name="blogentry"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = File perms | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108072201/http://fileperms.org/whatsapp-is-broken-really-broken.html | archive-date=January 8, 2015 | url = http://fileperms.org/whatsapp-is-broken-really-broken/ | dead-url = yes | title = WhatsApp is broken, really broken | date = September 12, 2012 | accessdate = July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= djwm |title= Sniffer tool displays other people's WhatsApp messages |url= http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Sniffer-tool-displays-other-people-s-WhatsApp-messages-1574382.html | publisher = [[Heinz Heise]] | work = H | edition = online |date = May 13, 2012 |accessdate= January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 the WhatsApp support staff said that messages were encrypted in the "latest version" of the WhatsApp software for iOS and Android (but not BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and Symbian), without specifying the cryptographic method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | type = FAQ | title = Are my messages secure?| url = https://whatsapp.zendesk.com/entries/21864047-are-my-messages-secure | publisher = [[Zendesk.com|Zendesk]] | work = WhatsApp | date = August 15, 2012 | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2012, an unknown hacker published a website that made it possible to change the status of an arbitrary WhatsApp user, as long as the phone number was known. To make it work, it only required a restart of the app. According to the hacker, it was only one of many security problems in WhatsApp. On January 9, WhatsApp reported that it had resolved the problem, although the only measure actually taken was to block the website's IP address. As a reaction, a Windows tool was made available for download providing the same functionality. This problem has since been resolved in the form of an IP address check on currently logged-in sessions.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web | last = Schellevis | first = Joost | title = WhatsApp status van anderen is nog steeds te wĳzigen | language = Dutch | publisher = Tweakers | url = http://tweakers.net/nieuws/79321/whatsapp-status-van-anderen-is-nog-steeds-te-wijzigen.html | date = January 12, 2012 | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whatsappstatus&gt;{{cite web | author = rvdm | title = How What’s app net works | url = http://www.wiretrip.org/2012/01/12/how-whatsappstatus-net-works/ | date = January 12, 2012 | publisher = Wire trip | accessdate = April 7, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105132110/http://www.wiretrip.org/2012/01/12/how-whatsappstatus-net-works/ | archivedate = November 5, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013–2015==

On March 31, 2013 the Saudi Arabian [[Communications and Information Technology Commission]] (CITC) issued a statement regarding possible measures against WhatsApp, among other applications, unless the service providers took serious steps to comply with monitoring and privacy regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20130401159359 | title = CITC warns Skype, Viber, WhatsApp | date = March 31, 2013 | work = Saudi Gazette | location = Jeddah}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|7|reason=that was 2013; what is status now, in 2016?}}

In February 2014, the public authority for [[information privacy|data privacy]] of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] advised against using WhatsApp, as the service lacked privacy protection such as end-to-end client side encryption technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/presse/20140220-whatsapp-facebook.htm ULD empfiehlt nach dem WhatsApp-Facebook-Deal: „Wechseln“] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; WhatsApp started implementing end-to-end encryption in late 2014 and finished in April 2016.&lt;ref name="Metz-2016-04-05"/&gt;

A major privacy and security problem has been the subject of a joint Canadian-Dutch government investigation. The primary concern was that WhatsApp required users to upload their mobile phone's entire address book to WhatsApp servers so that WhatsApp could discover who, among the users' contacts, was available via WhatsApp. While this was a fast and convenient way to quickly find and connect the user with contacts who were also using WhatsApp, it meant that their address book was then mirrored on the WhatsApp servers, including contact information for contacts who were not using WhatsApp. This information, which consisted solely of phone numbers without any additional information such as the name of the contact, was stored in [[Cryptographic hash function|hashed]], though not [[Salt (cryptography)|salted]], form.&lt;ref name = "Sophos_2013-01-29"&gt;{{cite news | last = Wisniewski | first = Chester | title = WhatsApp's privacy investigated by joint Canadian-Dutch probe | url = http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/29/whatsapps-privacy-investigated-by-joint-canadian-dutch-probe/ | work = Naked security | publisher = [[Sophos]] | date = January 29, 2013 | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "priv.gc.ca_2013-01-15"&gt;{{cite web | title = Investigation into the personal information handling practices of WhatsApp Inc. | series = Report of Findings | id = 2013-001 | url = http://www.priv.gc.ca/cf-dc/2013/2013_001_0115_e.asp | publisher = [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] | work = Findings under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) | date = January 15, 2013 | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "IDG_2013-01-28"&gt;{{cite news | last =gh| first = h | title = WhatsApp could face prosecution on poor privacy | url = http://www.csoonline.com/article/727756/whatsapp-could-face-prosecution-on-poor-privacy | quote = Dutch and Canadian privacy commissioners conducted a yearlong investigation into the popular mobile app |work=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | publisher = CXO Media | date = January 28, 2013 | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "WhatsApp legal"&gt;{{cite web | title = Legal Info | url = https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/ | publisher = WhatsApp | date = July 7, 2012 | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late 2015, the Dutch government released a press-statement claiming that WhatsApp had changed its hashing method, making it much harder to reverse, and thus now fully complies with all rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/news/dutch-dpa-whatsapp-non-users-better-protected|title=Dutch DPA: WhatsApp non-users better protected|date=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A user does not need to send a friend request to send messages to another user, due to the contact discovery mentioned above.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In November 2014, WhatsApp introduced a feature named Read Receipts which alerts senders when their messages are read by recipients. Within a week, WhatsApp introduced an update allowing users to disable this feature so that message recipients do not send acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.phonehorn.com/2014/11/whatsapp-now-lets-disable-read-notifications/ | title = Whatsapp now lets you disable Read notifications | date = November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 1, 2014, Indrajeet Bhuyan and Saurav Kar, both 17 years old, demonstrated the WhatsApp Message Handler Vulnerability, which allows anyone to remotely crash WhatsApp just by sending a specially crafted message of 2kb in size. To escape the problem, the user who receives the specially crafted message has to delete his/her whole conversation and start a fresh chat, because opening the message keeps on crashing WhatsApp unless the chat is deleted completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehackernews.com/2014/12/crash-your-friends-whatsapp-remotely_1.html |title=Crash Your Friends' WhatsApp Remotely with Just a Message |date=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=December 1, 2014 |publisher=TheHackerNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, after WhatsApp launched a web client that can be used from the browser, Bhuyan also found that it had two security issues that compromised user privacy: the WhatsApp Photo Privacy Bug and the WhatsApp Web Photo Sync Bug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hackatrick.com/2015/02/multiple-vulneribilities-found-in.html |title=Multiple Vulneribilities found in Whatsapp Web |date=January 29, 2015 |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |publisher=Hackatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/01/whatsapp-web-mobile-app.html |title=17-Year-Old Found Bugs in WhatsApp Web and Mobile App |date=January 29, 2015 |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |publisher=TheHackerNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, a Dutch university student named Maikel Zweerink published an app that set out to prove that anyone could track a WhatsApp user's status and also keep an eye of their changing profile pictures, privacy settings or status messages regardless of their privacy settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/whatsapp-security-flaw-allows-anyone-to-track-you-regardless-of-your-privacy-settings-254265.html |title=WhatsApp security flaw allows anyone to track you regardless of your privacy settings |author=tech2 News Staff |publisher=Firstpost |date=February 13, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016==

On March 2, 2016, WhatsApp introduced its document-sharing feature, initially allowing users to share PDF files with their contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/whatsapp-adds-support-for-document-sharing-but-only-pdfs-at-launch/|title=WhatsApp adds support for document sharing, but only PDFs at launch|publisher=TechCrunch|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, WhatsApp's default state of automatically downloading attachments raised some concerns in the press about risk and security once support for document sharing expanded beyond PDF files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.en.softonic.com/your-mobile-could-be-at-risk-if-you-dont-deactivate-the-new-function-on-whatsapp-2|title=Your mobile could be at risk if you don't deactivate the new function on WhatsApp|publisher=Softonic|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, WhatsApp announced that it will start sharing account information with Facebook, consisting of the phone number of the account owner and aggregated analytical data. The address books and [[metadata]] of users are not shared. According to WhatsApp, this account information is shared to "track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp. And by connecting your phone number with Facebook's systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them." This means that Facebook can target advertisements on the Facebook Platform better by making links between users based on the phone numbers, and make "friend suggestions" to its users based on WhatsApp's data. User data will not be shared with advertisers, and is only used internally on the Facebook services. WhatsApp emphasizes the content of user messages is still kept private thanks to its end-to-end encryption, which means WhatsApp cannot read the content of chats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000627/Looking-ahead-for-WhatsApp |title=Looking ahead for WhatsApp |author=Jan Koum |publisher=WhatsApp |date=August 25, 2016 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook# |title=WhatsApp to start sharing user data with Facebook |author=James Vincent |publisher=The Verge |date=August 25, 2016 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, users are given the choice to opt out of sharing this data with Facebook for advertisement purposes.&lt;ref name="Lomas-2016-08-26"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=How to opt out of sharing your WhatsApp info with Facebook|url=https://techcrunch.com/gallery/how-to-opt-out-of-sharing-your-whatsapp-info-with-facebook/|website=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc.|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2016, Article 29 Working Party stated that it has  serious concerns regarding the manner in which the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users’ consent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/20161027_letter_of_the_chair_of_the_art_29_wp_whatsapp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 5, 2016, end-to-end encryption for all users' communications, including file transfers and voice calls, is supported for users of the latest client, encryption being enabled by default. It uses [[Curve25519]] for key exchange, [[HKDF]] for generation of session keys ([[AES-256]] in [[Cipher Block Chaining|CBC]] mode for encryption and [[HMAC]]-[[SHA256]] for integrity verification) and [[SHA512]] for generating the two 30 digit fingerprints of both users' identity keys so they can verify each other as needed. Even the company would be unable to decrypt users' communications. [[Amnesty International]] and security professionals praised the move; the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] criticised it as threatening the work of law enforcement.&lt;ref name=bbc160406&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35969739 |title=Whatsapp adds end-to-end encryption |website= BBC News|date= April 6, 2016 |author= &lt;!--not named--&gt;|accessdate= April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telegram, another messaging service, is reported by the [[BBC]] to be used by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|"Islamic State"]] extremists.&lt;ref name=bbc160406/&gt;

WhatsApp is not the only [[Comparison of instant messaging clients#Secure messengers|messaging service that provides end-to-end encryption]]; among others, [[Threema]], [[Wickr]], [[Signal (software)|Signal]], [[Silent Circle (software)|Silent Phone]], and [[Line (application)|Line]] also provide such encryption by default. [[iMessage]] and [[Viber]] provide it under special circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Micah|title=You Should Really Consider Installing Signal, an Encrypted Messaging App for iPhone|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/03/02/signal-iphones-encrypted-messaging-app-now-supports-text/|website=The Intercept|publisher=First Look Media|accessdate=12 January 2016|date=2 March 2015|quote=Apple’s iMessage ... employs strong encryption, but only when communicating between two Apple devices and only when there is a proper data connection.

{{As of|2016|4|5|df=US}}, WhatsApp has a score of 6 out of 7 points on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s "Secure Messaging Scorecard". It has received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn't have access to, allowing users to verify contacts' identities, having past messages secure if the encryption keys are stolen, having completed a recent independent security audit, and having the security designs properly documented. It is missing a point because the code is not open to independent review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|title=Secure Messaging Scorecard.

==2017==

On January 13, 2017, ''The Guardian'' reported that security researcher Tobias Boelter had found that WhatsApp's policy of forcing re-encryption of initially undelivered messages, without informing the recipient, constituted a serious loophole whereby WhatsApp could disclose, or be compelled to disclose, the content of these messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manisha|first1=Ganguly|title=WhatsApp vulnerability allows snooping on encrypted messages|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 February 2017|date=13 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WhatsApp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dan|first1=Goodin|title=Reported "backdoor" in WhatsApp is in fact a feature, defenders say|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/01/whatsapp-and-friends-take-umbrage-at-report-its-crypto-is-backdoored/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=21 February 2017|date=13 January 2017 |quote=WhatsApp does not give governments a "backdoor" into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor.

A follow-up article by Boelter himself explained in greater detail what he considered to be the specific vulnerability. This article has since been removed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WhatsApp vulnerability explained: by the man who discovered it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/16/whatsapp-vulnerability-facebook|accessdate=17 June 2018|work=The Guardian|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by The Guardian due to the inaccuracies in Boelter’s representation of the facts.

Therefore, in June 2017, ''The Guardian'' readers’ editor Paul Chadwick wrote that "The Guardian was wrong to report in January that the popular messaging service WhatsApp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech."&lt;ref name="Chadwick-2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chadwick|first1=Paul|title=Flawed reporting about WhatsApp|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/flawed-reporting-about-whatsapp|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case."|author=Paul Chadwick, ''The Guardian''&lt;ref name="Chadwick-2017"/&gt;}}

Chadwick also noted that since the Guardian article, WhatsApp has been "better secured by the introduction of optional [[two-factor authentication|two-factor verification]] in February."&lt;ref name="Chadwick-2017"/&gt; However, it is important to note that this feature was already introduced in public beta versions of WhatsApp as early as November 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13586488/whatsapp-two-factor-authentication-beta-available |title=WhatsApp is rolling out two-factor authentication |date=November 10, 2016 |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |website=The Verge |author=Russell Brandom}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was months before The Guardian wrote about the alleged issue. 

In October 2017, the German software company [[Open-Xchange]] criticised WhatApps and [[Slack (software)|Slack]] for using proprietary software and stated plans to create an open source alternative.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/12/openxchange_imap_chat_killer_app/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rental value''' is the [[fair market value]] of [[property]] while [[renting|rent]]ed out in a [[lease]].  More generally, it may be the [[consideration]] paid under the lease for the right to occupy, or the [[royalties]] or [[returning|return]] received by a [[wikt:lessor|lessor]] ([[landlord]]) under a license to [[real property]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the science and art of [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]], it is the amount that would be paid for [[rental]] of similar real property in the same condition and in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-dictionary.freedictionery.com/rental+value Free legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1791&amp;bold=7%C7%C7%C7%C Law dictionary online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Determining Rental Rates'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rentruby.com/blog/rental-rates/rental-rates-rental-investment-values/|title=Rental Rates and Rental Investment Values|date=2017-07-29|work=Rent Ruby|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deciding on a rental rate doesn’t just mean figuring out the highest possible price you could list your rental for. Increasing the rental rate to the top of the market, can also increase the number of calls or issues a tenant may complain about during the term of the lease.

e.g. If you’re paying top dollar for something, you expect an exceptional experience. If you pay a below market rent, you are likely to not complain about smaller issues since you’re paying less.

Pricing your rental should be a strategy in order to maximize your net income. The longer you own the property, the easier this becomes.

==Other Definitions==

In [[economic]] terms, the rental value is the [[added value]] an individual contributes when goods are being exchanged or traded for profit. This additional quality is often fixed and is alone under the trader’s ownership. The characteristic can be tangible such as a signature method of use or intangible such as exclusive knowledge pertaining to a product; also known as [[intellectual property]]. The value arises from when the [[Market (economics)|market]] or [[Economic model|model]] is in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and it is advantages for an individual to take part in trading activities rather than not participate, considering profit or utility can be achieved.&lt;ref name="Glossary master"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vleugels|first=Jan|title=(Economic) Rent|url=http://www.sfb504.uni-mannheim.de/glossary/rent.htm|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two separate but ideally identical exchange scenarios may occur but may have completely different values calculated.&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lister|first=John|title=What is Economic Rent?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-economic-rent.htm|publisher=Conjecture Corporation|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is explained by two classic examples, a [[consumer]] achieves a [[wikt:surplus|surplus]] or profit when buying goods if they are able to buy all quantities at a single price. The producer lacks knowledge concerning the relationship between an individual’s [[willingness-to-pay]] and quantity. This means the producer cannot [[price discriminate]] according to the consumer’s demand marginality. In this example the buyer has achieved a beneficial rent. If the seller were to discover the buyers [[willingness-to-pay]] at different quantities, the seller could maximize their profit by selling quantities at different prices. In most situations this is achieved by slightly lowering the price as more products are bought. In this example the seller achieves a beneficial rent.&lt;ref name="Glossary master"/&gt;  Economic theories suggest that a [[free market]] would correct itself of rents. Considering the producer surplus example, if the gradual discounting of prices also attracted more consumers, the producer would have to re-evaluate their strategy.  Often, consumers have different willingness’-to-pay for goods. Following this assumption, profit would not be maximized because the price strategy would not be applicable to all buyers.  However, if analyzed in reality, through means such as market research, the producer can find a willingness-to-pay that represents most buyers. Consumer rent from the individuals who still pay for goods lower than willing and the producer rent from ability to price discriminate would then counter one another, resulting in [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="Lister"/&gt;

In a [[contract law]]suit, the lessor could collect the ''rental value'' of the [[premises]] from the [[State room|saloon]] [[lessee]] ([[Leasehold estate|tenant]]) who had violated a lease.&lt;ref&gt;''Geolet v. National Insur, Co.'', 164 N.E. 101, 62 A.L.R. 425, Landlord &amp; Tenant (key #) 184(1)(year?).&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Usable value''' is ''not'' the same as rental value, but is equivalent, and has been used in a [[Eminent domain|condemnation]] proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;''Reisert c. City of New York'', 66 N.E. 731, 174 N.Y. 196 (year?).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rental value can also be used in a [[divorce]], [[Legal separation|separation]], or [[annulment]] action for [[equitable distribution]], in those states ''lacking'' [[Community property]] laws. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Fair market rent in the US==
''Fair Market Rent'' in the US context is the amount of money that a given property would command, if it were open for leasing at the moment.

Fair market rent is an important concept both in the [[Housing and Urban Development]]'s ability to determine how much of the rent is covered by the government for those tenants who are part of [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]], as well as by other governmental institutions.&lt;ref name="HUD"&gt;[http://www.huduser.org/datasets/fmr.html HUD USER - Datasets: Fair Market Rents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fair market rent is sometimes used by [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] districts to determine tax rates. &lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/dab/decisions/dab1594.html 1996.08.05 DAB1594 Putnam-Clay-Flagler Economic Opportunity Council, Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R) publishes [http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/fmr.html Fair Market Rents] and [http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/il.html Income Limits] (respectively, the basis for how much program administrators will subsidize housing units, and the maximum incomes that tenants may not exceed in order to qualify for subsidized housing) on an annual basis. These figures vary throughout the country based on a number of determining factors, such as local economic conditions and housing demand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2476">In [[France]], the '''schéma directeur d'aménagement et de gestion des eaux''' (SDAGE) aims to put into effect the principles of the law of 3 January 1992 on the level of the major [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] [[drainage basin|basins]]. In translation, its name is '''outline for the organization of the development and management of water resources'''.

==Rationale==
[[Water]] is a part of the nation's common heritage. Its protection, exploitation and setting into a usable state while respecting natural balances, are of general interest.

The use of water belongs to all, within the framework of laws and regulations as well as of rights already established.

==The law==
The law of 3 January 1991 is like a [[United Kingdom]] [[Act of Parliament]]. The main subjects addressed by the SDAGE are written into the law:
* preservation of aquatic ecosystems, their sites and [[wetland]]s,
* protection against any [[pollution]] and [[Water purification|restoration]] of the quality of the water,
* development and protection of the resource as [[drinking water]]
* exploitation of water as an economic resource and sharing that resource.

The SDAGE scheme was drawn up together by the national, regional and département governments and is managed by the ''agence de l'eau'' (water agency).

==How it works==
The SDAGE serves as a general framework for the development and management of the water of each hydrographic unit, system or [[aquifer]]). These are the '''schémas d'aménagement et de gestion des eaux''' (SAGE), that is '''water resource development and management outlines'''.

The aquifer and the hydro-electric and recreational uses of water in the [[Ain River|Ain]] valley compose a clear example of a site where a coordinated approach could be productive. However, the ''schéma'' is flexible enough to include specific needs as for example, that of [[Artois]]-[[Picardie]] which is concerned specifically with the former mining basin of the [[Nord (département)|Nord]] and [[Pas-de-Calais]] [[département in France|départements]] and the consequences of past and current exploitation of the [[Région in France|région's]] [[coal]].

The '''Singapore National Front''' ([[abbreviation|abbrev]]: '''SNF'''; [[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 新加坡国民阵线), is a Singapore Malay-based political party formed by exit faction members from Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura ([[Singapore Malay National Organisation]]) members whom was a group of Malay professionals in 15 August 1991.

It did not take part in any elections to date and hence little notability was known to the general public in Singapore, even when it has announced to join [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] in 2011 where its rival was. 

==Reasons of apparent lack of notability==
Despite its appearance on a day after the Writ of Election for [[Singaporean general election, 2011|2011 general election]] was issued whereby prospective candidates from various independents or various parties had come to collect the relevant nomination papers as a first step to be nominated as a candidate on the nomination day, SNF still failed to send any candidates in 2011 elections, despite being under the SDA banner.

'''Social fascism''' was a theory supported by the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) during the early 1930s, which held that [[social democracy]] was a variant of [[fascism]] because—in addition to a shared [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic model—it stood in the way of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. At the time, the leaders of the Comintern, such as [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Rajani Palme Dutt]], argued that [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society had entered the "[[Third Period]]" in which a [[Proletariat revolution|working class revolution]] was imminent, but could be prevented by social democrats and other "fascist" forces. The term "social fascist" was used pejoratively to describe social democratic parties, anti-Comintern and progressive socialist parties and dissenters within Comintern affiliates throughout the [[interwar period]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Mrppposter.jpg|thumb|160px|Poster of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[MRPP]] from the 1970s, commemorating a killed party member, whose slogan reads: "Neither Fascism, nor Social fascism. Popular Government"]]
At the Sixth Congress of the Comintern in 1928, the end of capitalist stability and the beginning of the "Third Period" was proclaimed. The end of capitalism, accompanied with a working class revolution, was expected and social democracy was identified as the main enemy of the [[Communism|communists]]. This Comintern's theory had roots in [[Grigory Zinoviev]]'s argument that international social democracy is a wing of fascism. This view was accepted by Joseph Stalin who described fascism and social democracy as "twin brothers", arguing that fascism depends on the active support of the social democracy and that the social democracy depends on the active support of fascism. After it was declared at the Sixth Congress, the theory of social fascism became accepted by the [[World communism|world communist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Hildebrand]], ''The Third Reich'', Routledge (1984), {{ISBN|0-415-07861-X}}, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new direction was closely linked to the internal politics of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). After a faction fight inside that party following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in 1924, the victorious group around Stalin shifted decisively to the [[Left-wing politics|left]], advocating the end of the [[mixed economy]] [[New Economic Policy]] and declaring an intensification of the [[Class conflict|class struggle]] inside the [[Soviet Union]]. An atmosphere of [[revolution]]ary fervour was created that saw any enemy of the ruling group around Stalin denounced as "wreckers" and "traitors" and this attitude was translated on to the international stage where both social democrats and communist dissidents were denounced as fascists.

At the same time, under leadership of German [[chancellor]] [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) agreed with anti-communist parties that "[[Red fascism|red equals brown]]".&lt;ref&gt;Adelheid von Saldern, ''The Challenge of Modernity: German Social and Cultural Studies, 1890-1960'', University of Michigan Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-472-10986-3}}, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to mutual hostility between social democrats and communists, which were additionally intensified in 1929 when Berlin's police (under control of the SPD government) shot down communist workers demonstrating on [[May Day]] (Berlin's Bloody May). This and the repressive legislation against the communists that followed served as further evidence to communists that social democrats were indeed "social fascists".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kitchen, ''A History Of Modern Germany 1800-2000'', Blackwell Publishing (2006), {{ISBN|1-4051-0040-0}}, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, in [[Prussia]]—the largest state of Germany—the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD), which referred to the [[Nazism|Nazis]] as "working people's comrades", united with them in unsuccessful attempt to bring down the state government of SPD by means of a plebiscite.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Sewell, ''Germany: From Revolution to Counter-Revolution'', Fortress Books (1988), {{ISBN|1-870958-04-7}}, [http://www.marxist.com/germany/chapter7.html Chapter 7].&lt;/ref&gt; German communists continued to deny any essential difference between Nazism and social democracy even after [[German federal election, March 1933|elections in 1933]]. Under the leadership of [[Ernst Thälmann]], the KPD coined the slogan "After Hitler, our turn!" – strongly believing that united front against Nazis was not needed and that the workers would change their opinion and recognize that Nazism—unlike communism—did not offer a true way out of Germany's difficulties (see also [[Wilhelm Hoegner]] and [[Walter Kolbenhoff]].&lt;ref&gt; Jane Degras, ''The Communist International 1919-1943: documents. 3. 1929-1943'', Routledge (UK), {{ISBN|0-7146-1556-0}}, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power in Germany, the KPD was outlawed and thousands of its members were arrested, including Thälmann. Following these events, the Comintern did a complete turn on the question of alliance with social democrats and the theory of "social fascism" was abandoned. At the Seventh Congress of the Comintern in 1935, [[Georgi Dimitrov]] outlined the new policy of the "[[popular front]]" in his address [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/dimitrov/works/1935/unity.htm "For the Unity of the Working Class Against Fascism"]. The "popular front" did not stop the conclusion of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi-Soviet Pact]].

== Trotsky's criticism ==
[[Leon Trotsky]] argued against the accusations of "social fascism" and in the ''Bulletin of the Opposition'' of March 1932 declared: "Should fascism come to power, it will ride over your skulls and spines like a terrific tank... And only a fighting unity with the Social Democratic workers can bring victory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/germany/1931/311208.htm ''For a Workers' United Front Against Fascism'' B.O. No. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trotsky said in the same essay that any cooperation with the social democrats was only tactical and temporary and that in the final analysis the social democracy would have to be defeated and subverted by the revolutionary faction: &lt;blockquote&gt;The front must now be directed against fascism. And this common front of direct struggle against fascism, embracing the entire proletariat, must be utilized in the struggle against the Social Democracy, directed as a flank attack, but no less effective for all that... No common platform with the Social Democracy, or with the leaders of the German trade unions, no common publications, banners, placards! March separately, but strike together! Agree only how to strike, whom to strike, and when to strike! Such an agreement can be concluded even with the devil himself... No retraction of our criticism of the Social Democracy. No forgetting of all that has been. The whole historical reckoning, including the reckoning for [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], will be presented at the proper time, just as the Russian Bolsheviks finally presented a general reckoning to the [[Menshevik]]s and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Social Revolutionaries]] for the baiting, calumny, imprisonment and murder of workers, soldiers, and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/germany/1931/311208.htm ''For a Workers' United Front Against Fascism'' B.O. No. 32].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Social ownership''' is any of various forms of ownership for the [[means of production]] in [[socialist]] economic systems, encompassing [[public ownership]], [[employee ownership]], [[Worker cooperative|cooperative ownership]], [[citizen ownership of equity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=September 2003 |isbn=0-415-24187-1 |page=71 |quote=In order of increasing decentralisation (at least) three forms of socialised ownership can be distinguished: state-owned firms, employee-owned (or socially) owned firms, and citizen ownership of equity.}},&lt;/ref&gt; [[common ownership]] and [[collective ownership]].&lt;ref name="The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hastings, Mason and Pyper |first=Adrian, Alistair and Hugh |title=The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=December 21, 2000 |isbn=978-0-19-860024-4 |page=677 |quote=Socialists have always recognized that there are many possible forms of social ownership of which co-operative ownership is one. Nationalization in itself has nothing particularly to do with socialism and has existed under non-socialist and anti-socialist regimes. Kautsky in 1891 pointed out that a ‘co-operative commonwealth’ could not be the result of the ‘general nationalization of all industries’ unless there was a change in ‘the character of the state’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically social ownership implied that [[Capital market|capital]] and [[factor market]]s would cease to exist under the assumption that market exchanges within the production process would be made redundant if capital goods were owned by a single entity or network of entities representing society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=David Ramsay |title=From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher=Open Court |date=September 1999 |isbn=978-0-87548-449-5 |pages=175–177 |quote=Especially before the 1930s, many socialists and anti-socialists implicitly accepted some form of the following for the incompatibility of state-owned industry and factor markets. A market transaction is an exchange of property titles between two independent transactors. Thus internal market exchanges cease when all of industry is brought into the ownership of a single entity, whether the state or some other organization...the discussion applies equally to any form of social or community ownership, where the owning entity is conceived as a single organization or administration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the articulation of models of [[market socialism]] where factor markets are utilized for allocating capital goods between socially owned enterprises broadened the definition to include autonomous entities within a market economy. Social ownership of the means of production is the common defining characteristic of all the various forms of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Busky |first=Donald F. |title=Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey |publisher=Praeger |date=July 20, 2000 |isbn=978-0-275-96886-1 |pages=2 |quote=Socialism may be defined as movements for social ownership and control of the economy. It is this idea that is the common element found in the many forms of socialism. Yet having stated this as the common definition of socialism, one must necessarily admit that there are a wide variety of views among socialists of various stripes as to just what constitutes social ownership and control of the means of production, distribution and exchange.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major forms of social ownership are society-wide public ownership and cooperative ownership. The distinction between these two forms lies in the distribution of the [[surplus product]]. With society-wide public ownership, the surplus is distributed to all members of the public through a [[social dividend]], whereas with co-operative ownership the economic surplus of an enterprise is controlled by all the worker-members of that specific enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward a Socialism for the Future, in the Wake of the Demise of the Socialism of the Past'', by Weisskopf, Thomas E. 1992. Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 24, No. 3-4, pp. 10: "Here again there are two principal variants of such social claims to income, depending on the nature of the community holding the claim: (1) Public surplus appropriation: the surplus of the enterprise is distributed to an agency of the government (at the national, regional, or local level), representing a corresponding community of citizens. (2) Worker surplus appropriation: the surplus of the enterprise is distributed to enterprise workers."&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of social ownership is to eliminate the distinction between the class of private owners who are the recipients of [[Property income|passive property income]] and workers who are the recipients of labor income (wages, salaries and commissions), so that the surplus product (or [[economic profits]] in the case of market socialism) belong either to society as a whole or to the members of a given enterprise. Social ownership would enable productivity gains from labor automation to progressively reduce the average length of the working day instead of creating job insecurity and unemployment. Reduction of necessary work time is central to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of human freedom and overcoming alienation, a concept widely shared by Marxist and non-Marxist socialists alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peffer |first=Rodney G. |title=Marxism, Morality, and Social Justice |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-691-60888-4 |page=73 |quote=Marx believed the reduction of necessary labor time to be, evaluatively speaking, an absolute necessity. He claims that real wealth is the developed productive force of all individuals. It is no longer the labor time but the disposable time that is the measure of wealth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saros |first=Daniel E. |title=Information Technology and Socialist Construction: The end of Capital and the Transition to Socialism |publisher=Routledge |date=May 1, 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-74292-4 |pages=61 |quote=Another characteristic that Marx and Engels emphasized as a central feature of a future socialist society was a shorter workday. According to Tucker, Marx had a ‘vision of man in a future condition of freedom-creative leisure’ that he described in volume 3 of Capital.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
Social ownership is variously advocated to end the [[Exploitation of labour|Marxian concept of exploitation]], to ensure that income distribution reflects [[To each according to his contribution|individual contributions to the social product]], to eliminate unemployment arising from technological change, to ensure a more [[egalitarian]] distribution of the economy's surplus,&lt;ref name="Market Socialism, a case for rejuvenation"&gt;''Market Socialism, a case for rejuvenation'', by Pranab Bardhan and John Roemer. 1992. Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 101-116: "Public ownership in the narrow sense of state control of firms is not necessary to achieve one of socialism's goals, a relatively egalitarian distribution of the economy's surplus. We take public ownership, in a wider sense, to mean that the distribution of the profits of firms is decided by the political democratic process{{spnd}}yet control of firms might well be in the hands of agents that do not represent the state."&lt;/ref&gt; or to create the foundations for a non-market socialist economy.

In [[Karl Marx]]'s analysis of capitalism, social ownership of the means of production emerges in response to the contradictions between socialized production and private appropriation of surplus value in capitalism. Marx argued that productivity gains arising from the substitution of [[variable capital]] (labor inputs) for [[constant capital]] (capital inputs) would cause labor displacement to outstrip the demand for labor. This process would lead to stagnant wages and rising unemployment for the working class alongside rising property income for the capitalist class, further leading to an [[Overaccumulation|over-accumulation of capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woirol |first=Gregory R. |title=The Technological Unemployment and Structural Unemployment Debates |publisher=Praeger |date=July 30, 1996 |isbn=978-0-313-29892-9 |pages=20 |quote=The changing-organic-composition-of-capital argument was based on Marx's claim that technological change constantly increased the ratio of fixed to circulating capital. Since labor demand depended solely on the amount of circulating capital, the demand for labor decreased relative to a rise in total capital. The result was a tendency to increase the level of unemployment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argued that this dynamic would reach a point where social ownership of the highly automated means of production would be necessitated to resolve this contradiction and resulting social strife. Thus the Marxist case for social ownership and socialism is not based on any moral critique of the distribution of property income (wealth) in capitalism, but rather the Marxist case for socialism is based on a systematic analysis of the development and limits of the dynamic of capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism'', by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: "It was not the moral unworthiness of the exploitive surplus value mechanism which Marx proposed as the instrumentality of the collapse of capitalism. It was rather the consequences of that mechanism in providing capitalists with so much ill-gotten income that it would ultimately effectively ‘choke’ the system."&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marx, social ownership would lay the foundations for the transcendence of the capitalist law of value and the accumulation of capital, thereby creating the foundation for socialist planning. The ultimate goal of social ownership of productive property for Marx was to expand the "realm of freedom" by shortening average work hours so that individuals would have progressively larger portion of their time to pursue their genuine and creative interests. Thus the end goal of social ownership is the transcendence of the Marxist concept of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=John Cunningham |title=Karl Marx's Economics: Critical Assessments, Volume 1 |publisher=Routledge |date=March 26, 1996 |isbn=978-0-415-08714-8 |pages=247–248 |quote=It is certainly true that, according to Marx, social ownership does facilitate central planning&amp;nbsp;... But the substitution of commodity production [central planning] for market exchange is not an ‘end’ in Marx’s analysis. The fundamental ‘end’ of Marxist socialism is the supersession of alienation, the ‘emancipation’ of mankind, and the creation of opportunities for the full development of man’s productive and human potentialities. Clearly, Marx perceived both social ownership and supersession of commodity production as a means to this end.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist David McMullen identifies five major benefits of social ownership, where he defines it as society-wide ownership of productive property: first, workers would be more productive and have greater motivation since they would directly benefit from increased productivity, secondly this ownership stake would enable greater accountability on the part of individuals and organizations, thirdly social ownership would eliminate unemployment, fourth it would enable the better flow of information within the economy, and finally it would eliminate wasteful activities associated with "wheeling and dealing" and wasteful government activities intended to curb such behavior and deal with unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMullen |first=David |title=Bright Future: Abundance and Progress in the 21st Century |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |date=January 2007 |isbn=978-0-646-46832-7 |page=181 |quote=The five categories are: (1) the greater productivity of more motivated workers, (2) the greater accountability of individuals and organizations, (3) the elimination of unemployment, (4) the better flow of information and (5) the elimination of various resource wasting activities associated with wheeling and dealing, and with the activities of government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a non-Marxist, market socialist perspective, the clearest benefit of social ownership is an equalization of the distribution of property income, eliminating the vast disparities in wealth that arise from private ownership under capitalism. Property income (profit, interest and rent) is distinguished from labor income (wages and salaries) which in a socialist system would continue to be unequal based on one's [[marginal product of labor]]{{spnd}}social ownership would only equalize passive property income.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism'', by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: "The ‘first order effect’ of socialization will be an equalization of the property return, and it is to this that we must turn for the clearest and most certain benefit...The clearest, most immediate, and most obvious social improvement from socialism would be the abrogation of the pathologically unequal distribution of property return under capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable non-Marxist and Marxist socialist theorists alike have argued that the most significant argument for social ownership of the means of production is to enable productivity gains to ease the work burden for all individuals in society, resulting in progressively shorter hours of work with increasing automation and thus a greater amount of free time for individuals to engage in creative pursuits and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |title=You might like socialism; a way of life for modern man |publisher=Modern Age Books, Inc |year=1939 |month= |isbn=978-1-330-53101-3 |pages=239–240 |quote=Under socialism, with its economic security and progressively shorter hours of work, the leisure class is everyone. This new leisure class is not just a passive recipient and consumer of culture; it actively participates and creates, putting into effect the principle enunciated by the late American painter, Robert Hallowell, that ‘Each bears a gift for all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''To The Rural Poor'', by Lenin, Vladimir Ilich. Collected Works, 6, Marxists, p. 366: "Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html |title=In Praise of Idleness |author=Bertrand Russell |date=1932 |publisher=Zpub |accessdate=16 November 2015 |quote="I do not regard Socialism as a gospel of proletarian revenge, nor even, primarily, as a means of securing economic justice. I regard it primarily as an adjustment to machine production demanded by considerations of common sense, and calculated to increase happiness, not only of proletarians, but of all except a tiny minority of the human race."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of private ownership ===
{{See also|Socialist critique of capitalism}}
Social ownership is contrasted with the concept of [[private ownership]] of the means of production, promoted as a solution to what its proponents see as being inherent issues to private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Scott |title=The Philosophy and Economics of Market Socialism: A Critical Study |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-19-508827-4 |pages=44 |quote=First, social ownership is best understood by way of contrast with the characteristic form of ownership in free enterprise systems, namely, full liberal ownership. Second, and perhaps more important, the social vices attributed to existing free enterprise systems are traced to the ownership rights that defined that type of a system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Market socialism|Market socialists]] and non-market [[Socialism|socialists]] therefore have slightly different conceptions of social ownership. The former believe that private ownership and private appropriation of [[property income]] is the fundamental issue with capitalism, and thus believe that the process of capital accumulation and profit-maximizing enterprise can be retained, with their profits being used to benefit society in the form of a [[social dividend]]. By contrast, non-market socialists argue that the major problems with capitalism arise from its contradictory economic laws that make it unsustainable and historically limited. Therefore, social ownership is seen as a component of the establishment of non-market coordination and alternative "socialist laws of motion" that overcome the systemic issues of capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saros |first=Daniel E. |title=Information Technology and Socialist Construction: The end of Capital and the Transition to Socialism |publisher=Routledge |date=May 1, 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-74292-4 |pages=4–5 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Marx’s only option was to study and investigate the laws of motion of capital, realizing that this work would be essential to the discovery of socialist laws of motion in the future. Whereas Mises asserted the logical impossibility of socialist economic calculation, Marx had the foresight to vaguely recognize that such calculation depended on the development of society’s productive forces.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist critique of private ownership is heavily influenced by the Marxian analysis of capitalist property forms as part of its broader critique of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation in capitalism. Although there is considerable disagreement among socialists about the validity of certain aspects of Marxian analysis, the majority of socialists are sympathetic to Marx's views on exploitation and alienation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Scott |title=The Philosophy and Economics of Market Socialism: A Critical Study |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-19-508827-4 |pages=50 |quote=Though socialists have disagreed with Marx about how to conceptualize the notion of class, about the dynamics of class societies, and indeed about a whole host of other matters, most socialists seem to be broadly sympathetic to his views about what is wrong with the capitalist (free enterprise) economic system and, by implication, capitalist society&amp;nbsp;... Marx’s critique attributes basically two systemic evils to capitalism’s economic system: alienation and exploitation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists critique the private appropriation of property income on the grounds that because such income does not correspond to a return on any productive activity and is generated by the working class, it represents exploitation. The property-owning (capitalist) class lives off passive property income produced by the working population by virtue of their claim to ownership in the form of stock, bonds or private equity. This exploitative arrangement is perpetuated due to the structure of capitalist society. From this perspective, capitalism is regarded as class system akin to historical class systems like slavery and feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=September 2003 |isbn=0-415-24187-1 |page=1135 |quote=Property income is, by definition, received by virtue of owning property&amp;nbsp;... Since such income is not an equivalent return for any productive activity, it amounts to an entitlement to a portion of the aggregate output of others’ productive activity. The workforce produces output, but surrenders part of it to people who have nothing directly to do with production. Arguably, this occurs by virtue of a social system to which those in the workforce have never given their full consent, i.e. that of private property. Alternatively, it occurs by virtue of a structure of power to which the workforce is subject: property income is the fruit of exploitation. The fact that it is essential to capitalism makes the latter a class system akin to such other historical cases as slavery and feudalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private ownership has also been criticized on ethical grounds by the economist James Yunker. Yunker argues that because passive property income requires no mental or physical exertion on the part of the recipient and because its appropriation by a small group of private owners is the source of the vast inequalities in contemporary capitalism, this establishes the ethical case for social ownership and socialist transformation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism'', by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: "From the human point of view, return paid to non-human factors of production is unearned and equivalent to a free gift of nature. It is the personal appropriation of this free gift of nature by a small minority of society under contemporary capitalism which establishes the ethical unworthiness of capitalism and the desirability of a socialist transformation...The employment of capital instruments and natural resources in economic production requires no personal hardship or exertion from any human being. The economic services provided by these factors of production are not corporeally inherent in human beings. The opposite is true of labor services, which can only be provided through the physical and mental activity of human beings...the really grossly exaggerated personal incomes in society are dominated by property income, and this source of inequality would be abrogated by the equalization of property income distribution."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socialization as a process ==
Socialization is conceived as a process that transforms the economic processes and, by extension, the social relations within an economy. As such, it is distinct from the process of "nationalization" which does not necessarily imply a transformation of the organizational structure of organizations or the transformation of the economic framework under which economic organizations operate.

Marxists envision socialization as a restructuring of social relations to overcome alienation, replacing hierarchical social relations within the workplace with an association of members. &lt;!-- Economics and Politics of Socialism, Brus, pp 95 --&gt;

=== Socialization debates ===
{{distinguish|Socialist calculation debate}}

During the 1920s, socialists in Austria and Germany were engaged in a comprehensive dialogue about the nature of socialization and how a program of socialization could be effectively carried out.&lt;ref name="Political Economy: Theory, Practice, and Philosophical Consequences, Socialization debates: Political and theoretical developments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neurath/political-economy.html |title=Political Economy: Theory, Practice, and Philosophical Consequences |author=Jordi Cat |date=2014 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian scientific thinkers whose ideas were based on [[Ernst Mach]]'s empiricist notion of energy and technological optimism, including Josef Popper-Lynkeus and Carl Ballod, proposed plans for rational allocation of exhaustible energy and materials through statistical empirical methods. This conception of non-capitalist calculation involved the use of energy and time units, the latter being viewed as the standard cardinal unity of measurement for socialist calculation. These thinkers belonged to a technical school of thought called "scientific utopianism", which is an approach to social engineering that explores possible forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="Political Economy: Theory, Practice, and Philosophical Consequences, Socialization debates: Political and theoretical developments" /&gt;

The most notable thinker belonging to this school of thought was the Viennese philosopher and economist [[Otto Neurath]], whose conception of socialism as a natural, non-monetary economic system became widespread within the socialist movement following the end of World War I. Neurath's position was held in contrast to other socialists in this period, including the revisionist perspective stemming from [[Eduard Bernstein]], the orthodox social democratic perspective of [[Karl Kautsky]], the Austro-Marxism models of [[labor-time calculation]] from Otto Bauer and the emerging school of neoclassical market socialism. Neurath's position opposed all models of market socialism because it rejected the use of money, but was also held in contrast with the more orthodox Marxist conception of socialism held by Karl Kautsky, where socialism only entails the elimination of money as capital along with super-session of the process of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name="Political Economy: Theory, Practice, and Philosophical Consequences, Socialization debates: Political and theoretical developments" /&gt;

Otto Neurath conceptualized a comprehensive view of socialization during the socialization debates. "Total socialization" involved not only a form of ownership but also the establishment of economic planning based on [[calculation in kind]], and was contrasted with "partial socialization". "Partial socialization" involved the use of in-kind calculation and planning within a single organization, which externally operated within the framework of a monetary market economy. Neurath's conception of socialism was the initial point of criticism of [[Ludwig Von Mises]] in the [[socialist calculation debate]].&lt;ref name="Otto Neurath’s Economics in Context, 2007. P.212-13"&gt;''Otto Neurath’s Economics in Context'', by Nemeth, Elisabeth; Schmitz, Stefan W.; Uebel, Thomas E. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent socialist calculation debates, a dichotomy between socialists emerged between those who argued that socialization entailed the end of monetary valuation and capital markets, and those who argued that monetary prices could be used within a socialized economy. A further distinction arose between market socialists who argued that social ownership can be achieved within the context of a market economy, where worker-owned or publicly owned enterprises maximized profit and those who argued that socially owned enterprises operate according to other criteria, like marginal cost pricing.

== Typology ==
Social ownership and socialization is categorically distinct from the process of [[nationalization]]. In most cases, "socialization" is understood to be a deeper process of transforming the [[social relations of production]] within economic organizations as opposed to simply changing titles of ownership. In this sense, "socialization" often involves both a change in ownership and a change in organizational management, including [[Self-managed economy|self-management]] or some form of workplace democracy in place of a strict hierarchical form of control. More fundamentally, social ownership implies that the surplus product (or economic profits) generated by publicly owned enterprise accrues to all of society{{spnd}}state ownership does not necessarily imply this.&lt;ref name="The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Market Socialism, a case for rejuvenation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolff and Resnick |first=Richard and Stephen |title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |date=August 1, 1987 |isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6 |pages=226–227 |quote=For Marxian theory, socialism and communism represent societies built around a different, noncapitalist form of the fundamental class process. That is a very different thing from a society in which the state appropriates surplus value from the productive laborers it hires and exploits&amp;nbsp;... These characteristics imply that any person who participates in the communist fundamental class is both a performer and appropriator of surplus labor&amp;nbsp;... the decision of a state to operate capitalist industrial enterprises has no necessary relation to socialism...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamentally, there are two major forms of "social ownership". The first is society-wide public ownership by an entity or network of entities representing society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Scott |title=The Philosophy and Economics of Market Socialism: A Critical Study |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-19-508827-4 |pages=44 |quote=One conception holds that the means of production should be owned by society (or possible the working class) as a whole. By itself, this idea has not clear meaning; some institutional stand-in for society has to be found...the most obvious candidate in modern societies for that role has been the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second major form of social ownership is employee-owned cooperative enterprise, with the members of each individual enterprise being co-owners of their organization.

Additionally, there are two major forms of management or "social control" for socially owned organizations, both of which can exist alongside the two major modes of social ownership. The first variant of control is public management, where enterprises are run by management held accountable to an agency representing the public either at the level of national, regional or local government. The second form of social control is [[worker self-management]], where managers are elected by the member-workers of each individual enterprise or enterprises are run according to self-directed work processes.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward a Socialism for the Future, in the Wake of the Demise of the Socialism of the Past'', by Weisskopf, Thomas E. 1992. Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 24, No. 3-4, pp. 9: "There are two principal variants of such control, depending on the nature of the community in whom control rights are vested: (1) Public management: enterprises are run by managers who are appointed by and accountable to an agency of government (at the national, regional, or local level), which agency represents a corresponding politically-constituted community of citizens. (2) Worker self-management: enterprises are run by managers who are appointed by and accountable to those who work in them...with control rights resting ultimately with the community of enterprise workers&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact forms of social ownership vary depending on whether or not they are conceptualized as part of a market economy or as part of a non-market planned economy.

=== Public ownership ===
Public ownership can exist both within the framework of a market economy and within the framework of a non-market planned economy. In market socialist proposals, public ownership takes the form of state-owned enterprises that acquire capital goods in capital markets and operate to maximize profits, which are then distributed among the entire population in the form of a social dividend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Scott |title=The Philosophy and Economics of Market Socialism: A Critical Study |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-19-508827-4 |pages=44 |quote=Although societies in which the state owns the means of production historically have had centrally planned economies, this form of ownership is in principle compatible with a market economy&amp;nbsp;... These firms would by inputs from each other and sell outputs to each other and to consumers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-market models of socialism, public ownership takes the form of a single entity or a network of public entities coordinated by economic planning. A contemporary approach to socialism involves linking together production and distribution units by modern computers to achieve rapid feedback in the allocation of capital inputs to achieve efficient economic planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosser |first=Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr. |title=Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy |publisher=MIT Press |date=July 23, 2003 |isbn=978-0-262-18234-8 |pages=69 |quote=One approach suggests that modern computers can be linked together to overcome the Hayekian information problems and achieve rapid feedback that will maintain balances and lead to efficient planning, but with goods distributed in markets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Alec Nove]] defines social ownership as a form of autonomous [[public ownership]], drawing a distinction between state-owned and directed enterprises. Nove advocates for the existence of both forms of enterprise in his model of feasible socialism.&lt;ref name="The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisted, 1991. P.212-13"&gt;''The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisited'', by Nove, Alexander. 1991. (P.212-213): "Radoslav Selucky opts for what he calls 'social ownership', with 'means of production managed by those who make use of them', separated from the state...1) State enterprises, centrally controlled and administered, hereinafter referred to as ''centralized state corporations''. 2) Publicly owned (or socially owned) enterprises with full autonomy and a management responsible to the workforce, hereinafter ''socialized enterprises''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Public ownership was advocated by neoclassical socialist economists during the interwar socialist calculation debate, most notable [[Oskar Lange]], [[Fred M. Taylor]], [[Abba P. Lerner]] and [[Maurice Dobb]].

Neoclassical market socialist economists in the latter half of the 20th century who advocated public ownership highlighted the distinction between "control" and "ownership". John Roemer and Pranab Bardhan argued that public ownership, meaning a relatively egalitarian distribution of enterprise profits, does not require state control{{spnd}}Publicly owned enterprises can be controlled by agents who don't represent the state.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism, a case for rejuvenation" /&gt;

David McMullen's concept of decentralized non-market socialism advocates social ownership of the means of production, believing it to be far more efficient than private ownership. In his proposal, property titles would be replaced by "usership" rights and the exchange of capital goods would no longer be possible. Market exchange in capital goods would be replaced by internal transfers of resources, but an internal and decentralized price system would be fundamental to this systems' operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMullen |first=David |title=Bright Future: Abundance and Progress in the 21st Century |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |date=January 2007 |isbn=978-0-646-46832-7 |page= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by itself public ownership is not socialist as it can exist under a wide variety of different [[Political system|political]] and [[economic system]]s. State ownership by itself does not imply social ownership where income rights belong to society as a whole. As such, state ownership is only one possible expression of public ownership, which itself is one variation of the broader concept of social ownership.&lt;ref name="The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellman |first=Michael |title=Socialist Planning |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-35866-3 |page=327 |quote=State ownership of the means of production is not necessarily social ownership and state ownership can hinder efficiency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social ownership of equity ===
The social ownership of capital and corporate stock have been proposed in the context of a market socialist system, where social ownership is achieved either by having a public body or employee-owned pension funds own corporate stock.

The American economist [[John Roemer]] developed a model of market socialism that features a form of public ownership where individuals receive a non-transferable coupon entitling them to a share of the profits generated by autonomous non-governmental publicly owned enterprises. In this model, "social ownership" refers to citizen ownership of equity in a market economy.

James Yunker argues that public ownership of the means of production can be achieved in the same way private ownership is achieved in modern capitalism, using the shareholder system that effectively separates management from ownership. Yunker posits that social ownership can be achieved by having a public body, designated the Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO), own the shares of publicly listed firms without affecting market-based allocation of capital inputs. Yunker termed this model ''Pragmatic market socialism'' and argued that it would be at least as efficient as modern-day capitalism while providing superior social outcomes as public ownership would enable profits to be distributed among the entire population rather than going largely to a class of inheriting [[Economic rent|rentiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yunker |first=James |title=Socialism Revised and Modernized: The Case for Pragmatic Market Socialism |publisher=Praeger |date=April 1992 |isbn=978-0-275-94134-5 |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative form of social ownership of equity is ownership of corporate stock through wage earner funds and pension funds. The underlying concept was first expounded upon in 1976 by the management theorist [[Peter Drucker]], who argued that pension funds could reconcile employees' need for financial security with capital's need to be mobile and diversified, referring to this development as "pension fund socialism". In Sweden during the late 1970s, the Meidner program was advanced by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] as a way to socialize enterprises through employee wage earners' funds, which would be used to purchase corporate stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=September 2003 |isbn=0-415-24187-1 |pages=71–72 |quote=This leads us to the third form of social ownership, through a more equal initial distribution of corporate equity&amp;nbsp;... In his Unseen Revolution, published in 1976, the well-known management theorist Peter Drucker claimed that pension funds were reconciling employees’ need for financial security with capital’s need to be mobile and diversified, a form of ‘pension fund socialism’. Contemporary campaigns focusing on this dynamic include the explicitly socialist Meidner program...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf Meidner]]'s original plan was to require Swedish companies over a certain size to issue shares equal to 20 percent of profits, which would be owned by wage-earner funds controlled by employees through their trade unions. This plan was rejected and a watered-down proposal was adopted in 1984, which left corporate decision making just as it was and limited the scope of employee ownership to less than 3.5% of listed company shares in 1990.&lt;ref name="The Social Ownership of Capital"&gt;''The Social Ownership of Capital'', by Minns, Richard. 1996. New Left Review, Vol. 219, pp. 44-45."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooperative ownership ===
Cooperative ownership is the organization of economic units into enterprises owned by their workforce ([[workers cooperative]]) or by customers who use the products of the enterprise (this latter concept is called a [[Consumers' co-operative|consumer cooperative]]). Cooperatives are often organized around some form of self-management, either in the form of elected managers held accountable to the workforce, or in the form of direct management of work processes by the workers themselves. Cooperatives are often proposed by proponents of market socialism, most notably by the economists Branko Horvat, Jaroslav Vanek and [[Richard D. Wolff|Richard Wolff]].

Cooperative ownership comes in various forms, ranging from direct workers' ownership, [[employee stock ownership plans]] through pension funds, to the weakest version involving profit sharing. Profit-sharing and varying degrees of self-management or "[[Holacracy]]" is practiced in many of the high-technology companies of [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosser |first=Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr. |title=Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy |publisher=MIT Press |date=July 23, 2003 |isbn=978-0-262-18234-8 |pages=73–74 |quote=Its form ranges from straight workers’ ownership in cooperatives, to employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) in which workers’ ownership operates through a trust fund usually based on pension benefits, to paying workers with stock options, to the weakest version involving merely profit sharing. Successful examples of each type in the United States include for cooperatives plywood producers in the Northwest, for ESOPs the Weirton Steel Company of West Virginia (although the prominent example, United Airlnes, declared bankruptcy), and for profit sharing various Silicon Valley high-technology companies&amp;nbsp;... Thus the future of workable socialist forms that fulfill the goals of Karl Marx may be found in models emerging out of existing market capitalist economies in the form of worker-owned cooperatives.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest model of cooperative socialism is [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], proposed by the French anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. In this system, the state would be abolished and economic enterprises would be owned and operated as producer cooperatives, with worker-members compensated in [[labor voucher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Busky |first=Donald F. |title=Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey |publisher=Praeger |date=July 20, 2000 |isbn=978-0-275-96886-1 |pages=4–5 |quote=Under mutualism, the state would be abolished, and factories would be controlled by workers in the form of producer’s cooperatives. Compensation would be retained in the form of labor checks paid to workers by people’s banks, corresponding to the number of hours they worked.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of market socialism promoted in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was based on what was officially called "social ownership", involving an arrangement where workers of each firm each became members and joint-owners and managed their own affairs in a system of workers' self-management.

Contemporary proponents of cooperative ownership cite higher motivation and performance in existing cooperatives. Critics argue that cooperative ownership by itself does not resolve the structural issues of capitalism like economic crises and the business cycle, and that cooperatives have an incentive to limit employment in order to boost the income of existing members.&lt;!-- Add criticism from Benjamin Ward and sources "Comparing Economic Systems in 21st century" and "The Philosophy and Economics of Market Socialism..." --&gt;

=== Commons and peer-to-peer ===
&lt;!-- Pat Devine, Parecon, P2P commons --&gt;
{{See also|Social peer-to-peer processes}}

In the context of non-market proposals, social ownership can include holding the means of producing wealth in common ([[common ownership]]), with the concept of "usership" replacing the concept of ownership. [[Commons-based peer production]] involves the distribution of a critical mass of inputs and all outputs through information networks as free goods rather than commodities to be sold for profit by capitalist firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmitt and Anton |first=Richard and Anatole |title=Taking Socialism Seriously |publisher=Lexington Books |date=March 2012 |isbn=978-0-7391-6635-2 |page=160 |quote=Commons-based peer production bears a close family resemblance to the familiar vision of socialism sketched in the first paragraph of this chapter&amp;nbsp;... In commons-based peer production a critical mass of inputs, and all outputs, are distributed within information networks as free goods rather than as commodities to be sold for profit by capitalist firms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist Pat Devine defines social ownership as "ownership by those who are affected by{{spnd}}who have an interest in{{spnd}}the use of the assets involved", distinguishing it from other forms of ownership. Devine argues that this variant of social ownership will be more efficient than the other types of ownership because "it enables the tacit knowledge of all those affected to be drawn upon in the process of negotiating what should be done to further the social interest in any particular context".&lt;ref name="gesd.free.fr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gesd.free.fr/devine.pdf |title=Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrases "social production" and "social peer-to-peer" production have been used to classify the type of workplace relationships and ownership structures found in the [[open-source software]] movement and [[Commons-based peer production]] processes, which operate, value and allocate value without private property and market exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benkler |first=Yochai |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom |publisher=New Haven, Yale University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-300-11056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ownership in Soviet-type economies ==
{{See also|Enterprises in the Soviet Union}}

In [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]], the means of production and natural resources were almost entirely owned by the state and collective enterprises. State enterprises were integrated into a national planning system, where factor inputs were allocated to them by the Ministry for Technical Supply (Gossnab).

According to ''The Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', "socialist ownership" is a form of social ownership that forms the basis for the socialist system, involving the collective appropriation of material wealth by working people. Social ownership arises out of the course of capitalist development, creating the objective conditions for further socialist transformation and for the emergence of a planned economy with the aim of raising the living standards for everyone in society.

== Misuse of the term ==
{{Related articles|Socialized medicine}}Particularly in the United States, the term "socialization" has been mistakenly used to refer to any state or government-operated industry or service (the proper term for such being either [[nationalization]] or [[municipalization]]). It has also been incorrectly used to mean any tax-funded programs, whether privately run or government run.&lt;ref name=defintions&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is ‘Socialized Medicine’?: A Taxonomy of Health Care Systems | url = https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/what-is-socialized-medicine-a-taxonomy-of-health-care-systems/?_r=0 | publisher = The New York Times Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''specialist schools''' programme was a [[UK government]] initiative which encouraged [[secondary school]]s in [[England]] to specialise in certain areas of the curriculum to boost achievement. The [[Specialist Schools and Academies Trust]] was responsible for the delivery of the programme. At the end of the status there were nearly 3,000 specialist schools, which was fully 88% of the state-funded secondary schools in [[England]].&lt;ref name="Standards Site"&gt;{{cite web

==History==

[[File:Specialist-schools.svg|thumb|right|340px|alt=A sigmoid curve with fastest growth around 2004. The most popular specialisms are Technology, Arts, Sport and Science.|Numbers of specialist schools in England by year and first specialism&lt;ref name="Standards Site"/&gt;]]
The [[Education Reform Act 1988]] introduced a new compulsory subject of Technology, but there were insufficient funds to equip all schools to teach the subject.
A first attempt at developing centres of excellence, the [[City Technology College]] programme between 1988 and 1993, had produced only 15 schools.
In 1994, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, at the urging of Sir Cyril Taylor, designated 35 [[grant-maintained school|grant-maintained]] and [[voluntary aided school]]s as [[Technology College]]s.
The schools were required to arrange private sponsorship of £100,000, and would then receive a matching government capital grant and increased recurrent funding.
The following year the programme was opened to all maintained schools, and specialism in [[Language College|Language]]s was added.
Specialisms in [[Arts College|Arts]] and [[Sports College|Sport]] were added in 1996.&lt;ref name="Schagen:Performance"&gt;{{cite book

As specialism implied diversity of schools, it was opposed by many supporters of [[comprehensive school]]s, including many in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].
Nevertheless, in 1997 the new Labour government, also encouraged by Sir Cyril Taylor, adopted the embryonic programme, and the number of specialist schools continued to grow.&lt;ref name="Schagen:Performance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithers"/&gt;
The [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] made it possible for specialist schools to select up to 10% of their intake on aptitude in the existing specialisms in sport, the arts, modern languages and technology, though new selection for aptitude in technology was prohibited in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 [[white paper]] ''Schools Achieving Success'' envisaged expansion of the programme to 50% of secondary schools by 2005, and introduced new specialisms in [[Business and Enterprise College|Business and Enterprise]], [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering]], [[Mathematics and Computing College|Mathematics and Computing]] and [[Science College|Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The emphasis was shifting from centres of excellence to a means of driving up standards in most schools.
The required amount of private sponsorship was halved, and could be made up of goods and services in lieu of cash.&lt;ref name="Schagen:Performance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithers"/&gt;
Software donations had been ineligible due to the difficulty in evaluating the true value of something that has no manufacturing cost and can simply be given away as a form of collateral, but this changed when [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and then [[Microsoft]] were allowed to sponsor the programme with "in kind" donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the government introduced the Partnership Fund, funded at £3 million per annum, to make up the shortfall for schools that were unable to raise the required £50,000 of private sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Castle"/&gt;
Specialisms in [[Humanities College|Humanities]] and [[Music College|Music]] were added in 2004.
By 2008 approximately 90% of maintained secondary schools had become specialist schools.&lt;ref name="Smithers"/&gt;

Extension of the specialist programme to primary schools is being trialled at 34 schools in England, starting in 2007.
The specialisms involved in the pilot are Arts, Music, Languages, Science and Physical Education/Sport.&lt;ref name="Ofsted briefing"/&gt;
A specialist schools programme has been trialled by the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]] of [[Northern Ireland]] from 2006, with 44 schools being awarded the status by September 2009.&lt;ref name="DENISS"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaining specialist school status==
To apply for specialist school status, a school must demonstrate reasonable standards of achievement, and produce a four-year development plan with quantified targets related to learning outcomes. The school must also raise £50,000 in private sector sponsorship.&lt;ref name="DCSF Guidance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schagen:Performance"/&gt;
[[Private sector]] [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] includes charitable trusts, internal fund raising and donations from private companies.  In some cases donations can be made in cash from entities in the private sector such as [[Arcadia Group|Arcadia]] and [[HSBC]], but may also be donations "in kind" of goods or services.  The total sponsorship to date is of the order of £100m.

A school may specialise in any of the following fields, or combine specialisms in two of them (at the same level of funding):&lt;ref name="DCSF Guidance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ofsted briefing"/&gt;
* [[Arts College|Arts]] (can be Media, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, or combination of these)
* [[Business and Enterprise College|Business &amp; Enterprise]]
* [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering]]
* [[Humanities College|Humanities]]
* [[Language College|Languages]]
* [[Mathematics and Computing College|Mathematics &amp; Computing]]
* [[Music College|Music]]
* [[Science College|Science]]
* [[Sports College|Sports]]
* [[Technology College|Technology]]

Specialist schools must still meet the full requirements of the English [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|national curriculum]], so the specialism is seen as adding value to the existing statutory provision rather than being a radical departure from it. The important aspect in the eyes of the government is the focus that the specialism provides for providing leadership in the quest for whole school improvement.&lt;ref name="Ofsted briefing"/&gt;

The reward for achieving specialist status is a government grant of £100,000 to go with the £50,000 in sponsorship for a capital project related to the specialism and an extra £129 per pupil per year for four years to support the development plan. This is normally targeted on additional staffing and professional development, though up to 30% may be spent on equipment.&lt;ref name="DCSF Guidance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ofsted briefing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithers"/&gt;

Schools that make a good attempt at achieving their targets over the 4 year development plan period normally have their grants renewed at 3-year intervals with no further need to raise sponsorship.  However since 2008, the government has sought to encourage long-term relationships with business partners by offering a matching grant to redesignating specialist schools that are able to raise a further £25,000 in private sponsorship.

==High Performing Specialist Status==
Some schools that demonstrated that they were achieving significantly higher results than other schools were invited to apply to be designated as '''High Performing Specialist Schools'''. This typically allowed the school to apply for a further specialism, which brought with it additional funding so that the school could develop that further specialism.&lt;ref name="DCSF Guidance"/&gt;
By 2009 some 900 schools (30% of specialist schools) had achieved this status.&lt;ref name="Ofsted briefing"/&gt;

==Evaluation==

=== Results ===
David Jesson of the [[University of York]] published a series of annual studies of the results of the specialist schools program, on behalf of the SSAT.
These studies reported that non-selective specialist schools achieved significantly higher results at [[GCSE]] results than non-specialist [[comprehensive school]]s, that they achieved higher 'added value' when prior achievement was taken into account, and that the gains had increased with the length of time the school had been specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Systemic effects===
Specialist schools and [[Academy (English school)|academies]] were promoted, notably by [[Estelle Morris]] (Education Secretary 2001&amp;ndash;2002), as part of an attempt to improve standards by 'increasing diversity' in secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Left wing commentators had criticised this move away from the comprehensive ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 8 July 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The two biggest UK teaching unions had opposed the programme because they said that it created a two-tier education system, made up of specialist schools with extra funding and non-specialist schools which could not have benefited from any extra money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also evidence that specialist schools took fewer children from poorer families than non-specialist schools.&lt;ref name="Castle"/&gt;
One possible cause was that it may have been easier for middle-class parents to raise the necessary sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Schagen&amp;Goldstein"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Sustainable seafood''' is [[seafood]] that is either [[Wild fisheries|caught]] or [[Aquaculture|farmed]] in ways that consider the long-term vitality of harvested species and the well-being of the oceans, as well as the livelihoods of fisheries-dependent communities. It was first promoted through the sustainable seafood movement which began in the 1990s. This operation highlights [[overfishing]] and environmentally destructive fishing methods. Through a number of initiatives, the movement has increased awareness and raised concerns over the way our seafood is obtained.

==Importance==
[[File:Global total fish harvest.svg|lang=en|thumb|Global total fish harvest]]

[[Marine environment]]s are currently under immense pressure. Their problems primarily arise through [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] causes, such as overfishing and environmental destruction. However, research suggests that fisheries are able to recover or stabilize their populations when responsible management and regulations are in place.&lt;ref name="bassan8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bassan|first=Janine|title=Not all seafood is equal|journal=South African Journal of Science|date=May–June 2011|volume=107|issue=5/6|pages=8–10|doi=10.4102/sajs.v107i5/6.718}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, most seafood is obtained through “irresponsible fishing practices that continue to modify some marine ecosystem.”&lt;ref name="bassan8"/&gt;  This has resulted in record depleted stocks.&lt;ref name="bassan8"/&gt; For example, “85 percent of the world’s fisheries are fished at or beyond their maximum sustainable limit.”&lt;ref name="bassan8"/&gt;  Considering the rising global population and the pressure that it has, and will continue to exert on the Earth's resources, a more sustainable method of fishing is necessary if humans wish to utilize its natural abundance.

==Sustainable Seafood Movement==

The Sustainable Seafood Movement is an initiative born through the realization that the [[marine ecosystems]] of the world were being overexploited and destroyed.&lt;ref name="cooke911"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=Steven J|author2=Murchie, Karen J. |author3=Danylchuk, Andy J. |title=Sustainable "Seafood" Ecolabeling and Awareness Initaitives in the Context of Inland fisheries: Increasing Food Security and Protecting Ecosystems|journal=BioScience|date=November 2011|volume=61|issue=11|pages=911–918|doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.11.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began in the 1990s and was driven by [[social marketing]] through [[ecolabeling|Ecolabel]] and awareness campaigns.&lt;ref name="roheim301"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roheim|first=Cathy, A|title=An Evaluation of Sustainable Seafood Guides: Implications for Environmental Groups and the Seafood Industry|journal=Marine Resource Economics|year=2009|volume=24|pages=301–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through social marketing, the collaboration between environmental [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) and industry allowed for the consumer to make informed choices,  potentially contributing to the conservation of marine [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="cooke911"/&gt;

===Ecolabeling===
Ecolabeling programs evaluate the production process with environmental standards set by an independent third party. Should the process fulfill the specific requirements, the producer or marketer may purchase a license to use an ecolabel in its marketing. This label allows the consumer to know that the product was produced sustainably.&lt;ref name="roheim301"/&gt;  Labeling is not only an effective regulatory tool in encouraging consumers to make environmentally friendly choices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Czarnezki|first=Jason J.|title=The Future of Food Eco-Labeling: Organic, Carbon Footprint, and Environmental Life-Cyscle Analysis|journal=Stanford Environmental Law Journal|date=1 February 2011|volume=30|series=3|issue=1|pages=3–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it also provides a financial benefit to producers. In 1996 the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC)  implemented the first certification program&lt;ref name="cooke911"/&gt; Since then, they have not only made a distinct effort to maintain the health of ecosystems, but they have also contributed to more financial success for producers. For instance, once the American Albacore Fishing Association had its tuna certified to the MSC standard, they were able to obtain premium prices for their product.&lt;ref name="green41"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green Futures|journal=Green Futures|date=July 2010|issue=77|pages=41-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the small fishing community in Bonita, California, certification allowed them to sell direct, as opposed to depending on the instability on the dock.&lt;ref name="green41"/&gt;  They were able to make a profit of $2,260 rather than $1,700 per tonne.&lt;ref name="green41"/&gt;  More companies and organizations are choosing to use environmentally sustainable production, such as ecolabeling, to gain a greater market share and higher profits.&lt;ref name="cooke911"/&gt;

===Awareness Campaigns===
Awareness campaigns focus on educating the public and encouraging them to purchase products that consider the vitality of marine species.&lt;ref name="roheim301"/&gt; They do so through boycotts of certain species and products as well as through seafood guides. Seafood guides highlight which species are acceptable to consume and which are not based on their environmental impact.&lt;ref name="roheim301"/&gt;  Guides are typically constructed into three categories, some using the analogy of a traffic light's colours: red, yellow, and green.&lt;ref name="roheim301"/&gt;  These rankings are based on how the fish responds to fishing pressure, abundance, gear impact, [[bycatch]], and management. Red represents items to avoid, yellow is a good alternative, and green is the best choice.&lt;ref name="roheim301"/&gt;  Several organizations, including the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], have developed their own guides or wallet cards to be distributed to the public.&lt;ref name="cooke911"/&gt;

In September 2016, a partnership of Google and [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] and [[Skytruth]] introduced [[Global Fishing Watch]], a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/global-fishing-watch-google/ Google Launches Global Fishing Watch]—''[[Digital Trends]]'' (September 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-sharpless/oceana-unveils-global-fis_b_12030462.html Oceana Unveils Global Fishing Watch]—''[[Huffington Post]]'' (September 15, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-16/illegal-fishing-watch-site-crowdsourced-solution-overfishing/7851064 Illegal fishing targeted by crowdsourcing thanks to new Global Fishing Watch website]—[[ABC News (Australia)|''ABC News'' (Australia)]] (September 15, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seafood Guide==
The Seafood Guide below, made by SeaChoice, highlights which species are best to eat, and which should be avoided based on their management, abundance, and whether they have been caught or farmed in environmentally sustainable ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SeaChoice|title=Make Smart Seafood Decisions for Today and Tomorrow|url=http://www.seachoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SC_card_2012_5panel_web.pdf|publisher=SeaChoice|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It allows consumers to be informed of their choices and vote with their wallets.

==Fishing Methods==
[[File:Chilean purse seine.jpg|thumb|Chilean purse seine]]
There are a wide variety of fishing methods used. Each has its own environment impact that varies on intensity. The table below highlights a fishing method along with its environmental repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_gear.aspx?c=ln |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511141214/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_gear.aspx?c=ln |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)==
The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) is a national [[government agency]] that has authority over conservation, marine fisheries, and management.&lt;ref name= "fishwatch"&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/ FishWatch]&lt;/ref&gt; The NOAA has created FishWatch to help guide concerned consumers to sustainable seafood choices.&lt;ref name="fishwatch"/&gt; The fisheries in the United States are overseen by the Ten National Standards of the [[Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act]].&lt;ref name="fishwatch"/&gt; Therefore, the National Standards are protecting the fish population and eliminating overfishing. Along with the Magnuson-Stevens Act, U.S. fisheries are also regulated under the [[Endangered Species Act]] and Marine Mammal Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ocs/mafac/meetings/2008_07/docs/MAFAC_Ecolabeling_NMFS_White_Paper_v2.doc December 2007 MAFAC Action Item: Response from NOAA Fisheries on Ecolabeling and Seafood Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NOAA fisheries service has started using aquaculture to produce sustainable seafood. [[Aquaculture]] is fish or shellfish farming.&lt;ref name="aquaculture"&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/what_is_aquaculture.html "NOAA:Aquaculture"]&lt;/ref&gt; The aquaculture fisheries hatch and raise the fish until market size.&lt;ref name="aquaculture"/&gt; By using aquaculture the wild fish will be able to repopulate without the threat of overfishing. The aquaculture fish have a variety of uses including: food, nutritional, and pharmaceutical.&lt;ref name="aquaculture"/&gt; Two types of aquaculture exist. Marine aquaculture farms the fish species that live in the ocean and fresh water aquaculture is the fish species that live in freshwater.&lt;ref name="aquaculture"/&gt; NOAA is focusing on an alternative seafood source to help repopulate and save the ocean's ecosystems.

==Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)==
The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] is a global non-profit organization looking to conserve the oceans. Their mission is to use a combination of certified fisheries and ecolabeling to make people aware of how important it is to preserve our oceans.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council"&gt;[http://www.msc.org/about-us/what-we-do]&lt;/ref&gt; The MSC works with fisheries, scientists, seafood companies, conservation groups and the public to encourage environmentally friendly seafood choices. The two main ways the MSC regulates sustainable seafood is by setting standards for certified fisheries and ecolabeling.

The certified fisheries are judged on the three standards the MSC provides. The MSC, however, does not certify the fisheries.  They are certified by a third party system to remove any bias.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council Fishery Certification"&gt;[http://www.msc.org/get-certified/fisheries/assessment-process/know-the-basics#what-are-fisheries-assessed"]&lt;/ref&gt; The standards were created to decrease overfishing and maintain healthy ecosystems.
The three standards are:
* Maintaining Sustainable Fish Stocks
:* The fishery may not overexploit any of its resources.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council Fishery Certification"/&gt;
* Environmental Impact
:* Each fishery is judged on the amount of environmental impact they contribute to the ocean. The fishery may not use any form of fishing that destroys the structure, productivity, function, or diversity of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council Fishery Certification"/&gt;
* Effective Management
:*Not only does the fishery have to follow the two other MSC standards, but they also have to follow all local, national, and international laws.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council Fishery Certification"/&gt;

[[File:Marine Stewardship Council Ecolabel.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The MSC ecolabel&lt;center&gt;]]

Once a fishery has been reviewed and certified, their certification lasts for 5 years. In that 5 years, the fishery will be inspected and held to the environmental standards of the MSC. After the 5 years have passed, the fishery will have to go through the approval process again.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council Fishery Certification"/&gt;

The second way the MSC regulates seafood to the public is by using their [[ecolabel]]. The ecolabel on seafood products guarantees the seafood has come from a sustainable source and certified fishery.&lt;ref name="Marine Stewardship Council Ecolabel"&gt;[http://www.msc.org/get-certified/use-the-msc-ecolabel/why"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ecolabel can be found around the world. The consumer can feel good about buying seafood with a MSC ecolabel.

Before a seafood product can carry the MSC eco-label, the fishery must acquire the MSC Fisheries [[certification]]. Additionally,  all companies in the supply chain that take ownership of the product including distributors, wholesalers, manufacturers, pack houses, traders, retailers, catering organizations and restaurants must acquire the MSC Chain of Custody Certification.

=== Criticism of the Marine Stewardship Council ===

Critics condemn the Marine Stewardship Council for certifying specific fisheries that may be in trouble, harmful to the environment, or where there is a lack of information available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Sustainable-Labeled Seafood Really Sustainable?|url = https://www.npr.org/2013/02/11/171376509/is-sustainable-labeled-seafood-really-sustainable|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-06-08|first = Daniel Zwerdling Margot|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Antarctic toothfish fishery in the Ross Sea was awarded an MSC label, despite a lack of basic information on the stock itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainable fish customers 'duped' by Marine Stewardship Council|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/06/fish-marine-stewardship-council|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-06-08|first = Lewis|last = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Marine Policy'' study that analyzed the stocks of MSC fisheries found that 31% of the stocks were overfished, and 11% did not have suitable information available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Evaluation and legal assessment of certified seafood|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X12000619||accessdate = 2015-06-08|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2012.03.017|volume=36|journal=Marine Policy|pages=1284–1289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Page, a Greenpeace oceans campaigner stated "I will go as far as to say consumers are being duped. They think they are buying fish that are sustainable and can eat them with a clean conscience."  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Friend of the Sea==
{{main|Friend of the Sea}}

[[Friend of the Sea]] is a non-profit international organization that supports the conservation of oceans. It was founded by Dr. Paolo Bay who started the sustainable seafood movement in Europe. Friends of the Sea uses aquaculture and certified fisheries to maintain the seafood stock. The certified fisheries are audited by [[International Organization for Standardization]].&lt;ref name="Friends of the Sea"&gt;[http://www.friendofthesea.org/faq.asp "Friends of the Sea"]&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria to become a certified fishery is:
* The fish stock may not be [[overexploited]]
* No [[habitat destruction]]
* No [[bycatch]] of endangered species
* Must follow all laws and regulations
* Reduction of the [[carbon footprint]]
Currently 30 fisheries around the world are certified under the Friends of the Sea.&lt;ref name="Fisheries"&gt;[http://www.friendofthesea.org/fisheries.asp "Friends of the Sea Fisheries"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friends of The Sea also participate in the certification of aquaculture. The establishment of aquaculture helps reduce the number of wild species caught. The ISO also audits the aquaculture farms before certification. The criteria of aquaculture is:
* There is no environmental impact where the farm is placed
* Must follow all waste water guidelines
* A very low percentage of escapes
* No genetically modified organisms, growth hormones, or antibiotics
* Reduction of the carbon footprint
In 2004, aquaculture accounted for 32% of the total production of fish. Aquaculture is becoming more popular with an 8% rise per year in the last 30 years. Currently there are 75 aquaculture certified by Friends of the Sea.&lt;ref name="Aquaculture"&gt;[http://www.friendofthesea.org/aquaculture.asp "Friends of the Sea Aquaculture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chefs and restaurants==
Due to growing public concern about [[overfishing]], many seafood restaurants have begun to offer more sustainable seafood options, with some restaurants specializing in sustainable seafood, exemplified by [[Miya's]], a restaurant headed by chef [[Bun Lai]], a 2016 White House Champions of Change for Sustainable Seafood recipient. &lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/champions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708190643/https://www.whitehouse.gov/champions |archivedate=2015-07-08 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.ctbites.com/home/2016/10/7/white-house-honors-new-haven-sushi-chef-bun-lai-of-mayas-sus.html"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/sustainable_fish/"&lt;/ref&gt;[[Miya's]] is on the vanguard of the sustainable seafood movement as the first sushi restaurant to specialize in sustainable seafood. Today, there are [[sustainable sushi]] restaurants throughout the U.S., Canada, and England, and many more sustainable seafood restaurants in general.&lt;ref&gt;"http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/safer-sushi/?_r=0"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"http://londonist.com/2013/12/10-sustainable-restaurants-with-a-conscience-in-london"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/01/14/toronto-sushi-ocean-wise-vancouver-aquarium_n_4598531.html"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc.org/newsroom/press_releases/archive-2008/fifteen-restaurant-to-serve-msc-certified Fifteen restaurant to serve MSC certified sustainable fish]&lt;/ref&gt;Due to eco-labeling, seafood guides, traceability schemes, sourcing policies, and awareness initiatives there are more chefs and restaurants involved in the sustainable seafood movement than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/sustainability/ocean-table"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"http://mashable.com/2015/12/15/sustainable-seafood/#VCEZXHycEkqK"&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as [[Seafood Choices Alliance]] have helped educate chefs about the choices they make in order to encourage more chefs and restaurants to offer sustainable options. This is in line with the strict international standards set by 'Eco Friendly Chef' www.ecofriendlychef.com and 'Eco Friendly Approved' www.EcoFriendlyApproved.com in association with Oceans 5. www.oceans-5.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://seafoodchoices.com/home.php Seafood Choices Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042901/http://www.seafoodchoices.com/home.php |date=2008-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grenzwache EuroAirport 2014.JPG|thumb|Vehicles of the Swiss Border Guard at the [[EuroAirport]] (2014).]]

'''Swiss Border Guard''' ({{lang-fr|Corps des gardes-frontière}}, {{lang-de|Grenzwachtkorps}}, {{lang-it|Corpo delle guardie di confine}}) are a [[Federal government|federal]] [[law enforcement agency]], which acts as both the [[border guard]] and [[customs service]] for [[Switzerland]]. It is a uniformed and armed section of the [[Swiss Federal Customs Administration|Federal Customs Administration]], which is attached to the [[Federal Department of Finance]]. It is the largest civilian security agency on a federal level. Its members are subjected to military criminal law.

The Swiss Border Guard takes care of the prevention, intervention and repression concerning customs and migration related matters. It enforces border security and national compensating measures under the [[Schengen Agreement]]. The guard participates in international missions of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders ([[Frontex]]).

== Tasks ==
The Swiss Border Guard controls people and merchandise crossing the Swiss border, while combating smuggling and trans-border crime. It also participates in international missions. Furthermore, the Swiss Border Guard supplies agents (Ground- and Airmarshals) to the [[Federal Office of Police]], the agents being tasked with preventing incidents on board aircraft and at airports. In its entirety, the Swiss Border Guard is tasked with enforcing over 150 national laws.

In essence, the Swiss Border Guard works within the same realm as the customs authorities of Switzerland, with both sides cooperating on a regular basis.

The Swiss Border Guard has three strategic areas of work:
* Customs related duties.
* Security and policing duties.
* Migration related duties.

These strategic areas fall within the original legal framework of the Swiss Border Guard. However, customs related duties are heavily prioritised and customs law is relied upon to fulfil all additional duties. Additionally, the cantons of Switzerland can and have delegated additional competences to the Swiss Border Guard.
The Swiss Border Guard has no own aircraft, therefore  the Swiss Border Guard  is supported by the [[Swiss Air Force]] with Helicopters (with and without FLIR) and the [[RUAG Ranger]].

===Customs duties===
Customs duties fulfilled by the Border Guard include:
*The fight against smuggling, including the smuggling of prohibited goods such as weapons, narcotics etc.
*The collection of taxes and duties such as VAT, customs, and road taxes.
*The fulfillment of economic, commercial, health and environmental police tasks, such as the fight against undeclared work, the trade in counterfeit branded goods and medicines, as well as the trade in protected animal and plant species.

===Security Police duties===
Security duties include:
*The investigation of persons, objects and vehicles and the detection of counterfeit documents to combat cross-border crime.
*The control of cross-border cash transactions to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
*Security operations to ward off criminal acts on board Swiss aircraft in international commercial aviation.

===Migration duties===
Migration duties include:
*Passport controls at the Schengen external borders of Switzerland at the international airports of [[Geneva Airport|Geneva]], [[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg|Basel]], and [[Lugano Airport|Lugano-Agno]]. (At [[Zürich Airport]], this is carried out by the cantonal police in Zurich, at [[Bern Airport]] by the Bernese cantonal police), as well as random passport controls at the land borders (Schengen-Binnengrezen) and inland foreigner controls near the border.
*The prevention of illegal entry, departure or transit as well as illegal residence.
*The fight against smuggling and trafficking.

===Aircraft===
The Border Guard do not have their own aircraft, but are supported with [[Helicopters]] and [[UAV]]s from the [[Swiss Air Force]]

==Organisation==
The Border Guard is divided into the following three hierarchical levels:

===Strategic level===
The Border Guard Corps Command (''Kommando Grenzwachtkorps'') (Kdo GWK) based in the Customs Directorate (''Oberzolldirektion'') (OZD) in Bern forms the strategic level. It is divided into the sections staff services, operations, technology/logistics, teaching association, and special formation. It is managed by the Chief Border Guard (''Chef Grenzwachtkorps'') (C GWK).

The border guard corps command performs strategic and operational tasks. These include the planning and management of national and international operations, national large scale training, foreign assignments, and training.

Additional elements of management support include:
*The Situation and News Center of the Border Guard (LNZ GWK) in the Central Customs Directorate (OZD) in Bern evaluates u. a. national and international reports, processes and disseminates findings and compiles information bulletins.
*The training centers (AZL / KOSIT) of the Federal Customs Administration (AZL) in Liestal and the Competence Center for Security and Intervention (KOSIT) in Interlaken provide training and further education.

===Operational level===
[[File:Swiss Border Guard regions map.png|thumb|250px|Map of seven regional divisions.]]
The seven border guard regions form the operational level. They are provided with the corresponding Roman numerals and a place name and defined according to geotactic aspects. They are led by border guard commanders (Gzw Kdt).

Border guard regions carry out operational tasks that are not performed centrally. If required, this also includes the supraregional planning and management of major events and operations, large scale training and foreign assignments.

===Tactical level===

The 44 border guard posts (Gzw Po) and four operational centers (EZ GWK) of the border guard regions form the tactical level. They are led by post chiefs (Pch). The border guards ensure service operation and daily service execution.

The following organizational units serve as important elements of leadership support:
(The Einsatzzentrale Grenzwachtkorps (EZ GWK) 
*The four operational centers in Basel (EZ GWK North), Chur (EZ GWK East), Chiasso (EZ GWK South) and Geneva (EZ GWK West) are responsible for routine work. 
*Coordination Centers (CCPD), the two Police and Customs Co-operation Centers (CCPD) in Chiasso and Geneva enable a rapid exchange of information between Switzerland and Italy and France respectively.

===Border Guard Regions===
In addition to the Border Guard Command at the Swiss Federal Customs Administration in Bern, there are seven regional commandos, called Border Guard Regions:
*Border Guard Region I - Basel (cantons BS, BL, SO, AG, BE, LU, OW, NW) Gren
*Border Guard Region II - Schaffhausen (Cantons ZH, SH, TG, SZ, UR, ZG) 
*Border Guard Region III - Chur (cantons SG, GR, AR, AI, GL and Principality of Liechtenstein) 
*Border Guard Region IV - Lugano (Canton TI, command in the municipality of Paradiso ) 
*Border Guard Region V - Lausanne (cantons VS, VD, FR) 
*Border Guard VI - Geneva (Canton GE) 
*Border Guard VIII - Pruntrut (cantons NE, JU)

The original eight border guard regions were introduced on January 1, 2007, as a replacement for the previous four border guard circles.&lt;ref&gt;NZZ Online: ''[http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/articleETCZ3-1.95804 New border guard region Aargau - Zurich started]'', 12 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Border Guard Region VII (Aargau / Zurich) with command at Zurich Airport was dissolved on April 1, 2011, and divided into border guard regions I (Canton Aargau) and II (Canton Zurich).&lt;ref&gt;Tages-Anzeiger: ''[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/gemeinde/Mehr-Waffen-beschlagnahmt/story/29131478 More weapons confiscated]'', 14 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranks==
[[File:Stabsadjutant Swiss Border Guards.jpg|thumb|100px|Rank insignia of a Stabsadjutant GWK, assigned to working in Border Guard Corps Command]]
The rank insignia on the shoulder straps of the Border Guard correspond to the military ranks of the Swiss Army. The shoulder straps are additionally provided with the ray cross or Roman numerals (I-VIII). The beam cross indicates carriers assigned to the Border Guard Corps command. The Roman numerals correspond to the respective border guard region in which the guard works.

==Equipment==
Border Guards are issued [[Heckler &amp; Koch P30]] V4 with RUAG ACTION 4 9MM ammunition. Additionally, [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] are available either on some border crossings (kept in dedicated safes) or are loaded onto patrol cars at the beginning of a shift.

[[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] is a former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and former chair of the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]].

The appointment of Lagos was controversial among Chilean environmental groups who questioned his  track record on the matter, claiming that he 'showed an utter lack of consideration for the environment, promoted policies against environmental sustainability and favored the interests of big economic groups, even defending crimes against nature internationally'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''United Response''' is a top 100 [[Charitable organization|charity]] operating in [[England and Wales]], providing a range of support and services for more than 2,000 people with [[learning disabilities]], [[mental health]] needs or [[physical disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/aug/25/societyguardianlive3 The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their mission is to ensure that individuals with learning disabilities, mental health needs and physical disabilities have the opportunity to live their lives to the full.

Their vision is a society where everyone has equal access to the same rights and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/why-we-exist United Response: mission statement and vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
United Response was founded in 1973 by Su Sayer, CBE. She opened the first service in Tillington, West Sussex. By 1979, it was the largest provider of support for people with learning disabilities in the region. In 1983, United Response expanded to the north of England, setting up its first service in Chesterfield. In 1990, the charity started working with people with mental health needs.

Seven years later, it began implementing person-centred active support under the guidance of the late Professor Jim Mansell, CBE, who joined the Board of Trustees in 1995. In 1999, United Response launched the first of many social enterprises, a cleaning company under its trading arm, UR in Business. The company employed people with a learning disability. In 2002 the charity began working with the [[University of Kent]]’s Tizard Centre to study, monitor and evaluate the quality of its support.

In 2006, United Response ran a project entitled Mental Wealth to raise awareness of issues facing people with mental health needs as a backdrop to the then-Mental Health Bill. In 2008 the charity launched Making Money Easier – a suite of accessible resources to support people with learning disabilities access banks and manage their money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/with-money United Response: How we help with money]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, United Response began its Every Vote Counts campaign, which it repeated in 2015, encouraging more people with learning disabilities to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/every-vote-counts United Response: Every Vote Counts campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, United Response launched Easy News, the first accessible news magazine for people with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/easy-news United Response: About Easy News]&lt;/ref&gt;

United Response supports over 2,000 people, works in more than 300 locations across England and Wales, and employs over 3,500 staff.

==Services==
The services United Response provides depend on each person they work with. United Response provides 24-hour support for people with profound physical needs, or just a few hours for those who need less support to live their lives.

They job coach people into meaningful paid employment and can provide outreach support for those with a mental health need or help people who find it difficult to communicate by making information more accessible.

One of United Response’s primary support techniques is [[person-centred thinking]]: they work with each person to do the things they want to do, supporting them to communicate what it is they want.

They have also pioneered active support and [[positive behaviour support]] as ways of involving people with even the most complex needs and [[challenging behaviour]] in all areas of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=265249&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 The Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
In support of United Response's vision, they also campaign to improve the lives of people with disabilities in society. This may mean lobbying decision makers such as [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablemagazine.co.uk/charity-urges-government-to-make-social-care-a-budget-priority/ Able Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that people's voices are heard or it might mean working directly with [[disabled people]] so that they can be more directly engaged in the [[democratic process]].

United Response also works with employers to ensure that more people with learning disabilities, mental health needs and physical disabilities get a fair opportunity to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodg.org.uk/members/united-response.html Voluntary Organisations Disability Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Every Vote Counts===
United Response’s most recent major campaign is Every Vote Counts, which aims to make politics and voting accessible to people with learning disabilities. Currently, at least half a million people with learning disabilities in the UK have the right to vote but don't use it, due to low awareness of their rights and the complexity of the political system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/may/01/pre-election-charity-campaigns-hear-their-voices-powerful The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the charity has been working with people with learning disabilities and politicians to change this by publishing easy read guides to voting,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/jun/17/people-learning-disabilities-information-vote The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; urging all political parties to communicate more accessibly, and campaigning publicly for greater awareness of the fact that most people with learning disabilities are entitled and have the mental capacity to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-30920778 BBC Ouch]&lt;/ref&gt;

United Response is committed to ensuring that people with learning disabilities are able to advocate for themselves whenever possible and use their own voices to promote change. When the campaign was re-launched ahead of the 2015 general election,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmagazine.co.uk/vote-confidence-disability-democracy/ Access Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; the charity recruited political correspondent David Allkins,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/update/2015-05-02/charity-encourages-people-with-special-needs-to-vote/ ITV News]&lt;/ref&gt; who has [[Asperger syndrome]] and communication difficulties, to create a series of exclusive video interviews and special reports aimed at making politics easier to understand for people with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politicshome.com/document/press-release/united-response/united-response%E2%80%99s-political-correspondent-files-video-report Politics Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the general election, United Response quantified the results of its Every Vote Counts campaign and found that 43% of people it supports with learning disabilities voted – a 10% increase on the numbers that voted in 2010. The survey also revealed the extent to which the campaign has reached out to new voters, with some 31% stating that they had voted for the first time, of which only 14% stated that this was due to age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enablemagazine.co.uk/every-vote-counts-accessible-campaign-achieves-10-increase-in-number-of-people-with-learning-disabilities-voting/ Enable Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcards from the Edges===
In 2013, to mark its 40th anniversary, United Response launched the creative campaign Postcards from the Edges. Through its dedicated Postcards from the Edges website, the charity invited people with, or affected by, disabilities to create postcards about what is important to them, and in the first year alone attracted more than 500 contributors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2013/aug/16/postcards-from-the-edges-disability The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the project is to counter preconceptions people may have about disability and aid understanding, and provide those affected with a platform for expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/21/postcards-from-edges-disability-mental-health The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

The postcards have been exhibited throughout the UK, including the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Bristol, London and Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Opportunities?show_archive=1&amp;offset=825&amp;item=3906 Disability Arts Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its conception, the project has grown to feature several specific campaigns boards, including a [[general election]] board that ran alongside the Every Vote Counts campaign.

===Campaigns Panel reports===
United Response’s Campaigns Panel is an informal network made up of around 20 people it supports with disabilities around the country, plus some family members.

The panel volunteer their time to ensure the charity’s campaigning is focused on the issues that matter most to the people it supports.

Over the past five years, United Response has published reports on issues important to the Campaigns Panel, such as what good care looks like,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jan/10/social-care-funding-reforms-cross-party-talks The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; what the government should be doing to support disabled people and the legacy of the 2013 [[Paralympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesocialissue.com/2013/09/the-man-dreaming-of-being-ordinary-and-the-campaign-to-help-him/ The Social Issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==
