{{Centurybox|-7}}
The '''7th century BC''' began the first day of [[700 BC]] and ended the last day of [[601 BC]].

The [[Assyrian Empire]] continued to dominate the [[Near East]] during this century, exercising formidable power over neighbors like [[Babylon]] and [[Egypt]]. In the last two decades of the century, however, the empire began to unravel as numerous enemies made alliances and waged war from all sides. The Assyrians finally left the world stage permanently when their capital [[Nineveh]] was destroyed in 612 BC. These events gave rise to the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], which would dominate the region for much of the following century.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Agnidhriyam.JPG|thumb]]
{{Hinduism small}}
The '''Agnicayana''' (''{{IAST|ati-rātrá  agní-cayana}}'' "the building up of the fire altar"){{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=36}} or '''Athirathram''' ({{lang-ml|അതിരാത്രം}}) is a category of advanced [[Śrauta]] rituals.

After one has established the routine of the twice-daily routine of [[Agnihotra]] offerings and biweekly ''dara-purna-masa'' offerings, one is eligible to perform the Agnistoma, the simplest [[soma (drink)|soma]] rite.{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=41-49, 220-221}} After the agnistoma, one is eligible to perform more extensive soma rites and Agnicayana rites.{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=46-47, 220-233}}  There are various varieties of Agnicayana.{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=222-233}}

Agnicayana continues to be performed in [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]].{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=46}}

==Overview==
[[File:ചിതിയുടെയും-ഉപകരണങ്ങളുടെയും മാതൃക.jpg|thumb|left|Replica of the altar and utensils used during Athirathram]]
The entire ritual takes twelve days to perform, in the course of which a great bird-shaped altar, the ''uttaravedi'' "northern altar" is built out of 1005 bricks. The liturgical text is in Chapters 20 through 25 of the ''[[Yajurveda|Krishna Yajurveda]]''. The immediate purpose of the Agnicayana is to build up for the sacrificer an immortal body that is permanently beyond the reach of the transitory nature of life, suffering and death that, according to this rite, characterizes man's mortal existence.&lt;ref name="Converse"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1062002|title= The Agnicayana Rite: Indigenous Origin?|author= Hyla Stuntz Converse|date= November 1974|journal=History of Religions |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=81–95 |doi=10.1086/462716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual emerged from predecessor rituals, which were incorporated as building blocks, around the 10th century BCE, and was likely continuously practiced until the late [[Vedic period]], or the 6th century BCE. In post-Vedic times, there were various revivals of the practice, under the [[Gupta Empire]] in the north  (ca. 4th to 6th century), and under the [[Chola Empire]] in the south (ca. 9th century), but by the 11th century, the practice was held to have been discontinued, with the exception of the Nambudiris of Kerala.
 
The 1975 [[Nambudiri]] Agnicayana filmed by [[Frits Staal]], was criticized by Andhra Śrautins who claimed the Nambudiri omitted animal sacrifice, which is an element in their own opinion.{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=215}}

'''Al-Yamamah''' ({{lang-ar|اليمامة|al-Yamāmah}}) is an ancient [[historical region]] lying to the east of the plateau of [[Najd]] in modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]], or sometimes more specifically, the now-extinct ancient village of Jaww Al-Yamamah, near [[Al-Kharj]], after which the rest of the region was named.  Only a handful of centralized states ever arose in Yamamah, but it figured prominently in early Islamic history due to it becoming a central theater in the [[Ridda Wars]] immediately following [[Muhammad]]'s death.  The region was gradually subsumed in recent centuries under the term "Najd", which encompasses a larger area.  However, the term "Al-Yamamah" still lives on as a nostalgic historical term that is invoked to emphasize the region's ties with its ancient past.  The current headquarters of the [[Saudi]] government in [[Riyadh]], for example, is known as the [[Palace of Yamamah]].

Salit bin Amri was sent by Muhammad with a letter to Hozah bin Ali to the king of Yamama to invite him to Islam during the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)|Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha]]&lt;ref&gt;Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&amp;pg=PA227 The Sealed Nectar], p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;[Akbar Shāh Ḵẖān Najībābādī, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=L8VHVM-lPNT77Aaiw4CICw&amp;id=Pi5tAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kalbi History of Islam, Volume 1], p. 194.

'''Alfred Louis Kroeber''' (June 11, 1876 – October 5, 1960) was an American [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]]. He received his Ph.D. under [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1901, the first doctorate in [[anthropology]] awarded by Columbia. He was also the first professor appointed to the Department of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="ucb-anthro-history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/content/history | title=History, Anthropology Department, UC Berkeley | publisher=University of California, Berkeley | accessdate=7 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009153302/http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/content/history | archive-date=2014-10-09 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played an integral role in the early days of its [[Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology|Museum of Anthropology]], where he served as director from 1909 through 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/museum/history.php Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology – History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725180800/http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/museum/history.php |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kroeber provided detailed information about [[Ishi]], the last surviving member of the [[Yahi people]], whom he studied over a period of years. He was the father of the acclaimed novelist, poet, and writer of short stories [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].

==Life==
Kroeber was born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/1960/10/06/archives/drkroeberdies-anthropologist-authority-on-indians-taught-at.html "Dr. Kroeber Dies; Anthropologist; Authority on Indians Taught at California 45 Years—Wrote Standard Text"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 6, 1960. Accessed February 6, 2013. "A native of Hoboken, N. J., Dr. Kroeber was graduated from Columbia in 1896."&lt;/ref&gt; to upper middle-class parents: Florence Kroeber, who immigrated at the age of 10 to the United States with his parents and family from Germany, and Johanna Muller, who was of German descent.  His family moved into New York when Alfred was quite young, and he was tutored and attended private schools there.  He had three younger siblings and all had scholarly interests. The family was bilingual, speaking German at home, and Kroeber also began to study [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] in school, beginning a lifelong interest in languages.&lt;ref name=Steward/&gt; He attended [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] at the age of 16, joining the [[Philolexian Society]] and earning an A.B. in English in 1896 and an M.A. in Romantic drama in 1897. Changing fields to the new one of [[anthropology]], he received his Ph.D. under [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1901, basing his 28-page dissertation on decorative symbolism on his field work among the [[Arapaho]]. It was the first doctorate in anthropology awarded by Columbia.

Kroeber spent most of his career in California, primarily at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  He was both a Professor of Anthropology and the Director of what was then the University of California Museum of Anthropology (now the [[Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology]]). The anthropology department's headquarters building at the University of California is named Kroeber Hall in his honor. He was associated with Berkeley until his retirement in 1946.

==Personal life==
Kroeber married Henrietta Rothschild in 1906.  She contracted [[tuberculosis]] (TB) and died in 1913, after several years of illness.&lt;ref name=Steward/&gt;

In 1926 he married again, to [[Theodora Kroeber|Theodora Kracaw Brown]], a widow whom he met as a student in one of his graduate seminars.&lt;ref name=Steward/&gt; They had two children: [[Karl Kroeber]], a literary critic, and the science fiction writer [[Ursula Kroeber Le Guin]]. In addition, Alfred adopted Theodora's sons by her first marriage, Ted and [[Clifton Kroeber|Clifton Brown]], who both took his surname.

In 2003, Clifton and Karl Kroeber published a book of essays on [[Ishi]]'s story, which they co-edited, called, ''Ishi in Three Centuries''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton and Karl Kroeber (2002) ''Ishi in Three Centuries'', Univ. of Nebraska Press {{ISBN|0803222505}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first scholarly book on Ishi to contain essays by Native American writers and academics.

==Death==
Alfred Kroeber died in [[Paris]] on October 5, 1960.

==Influence==
Although he is known primarily as a [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]], he did significant work in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropological linguistics]], and he contributed to anthropology by making connections between archaeology and culture. He conducted excavations in [[New Mexico]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]]. In Peru he helped found the [[Institute for Andean Studies]] (IAS) with the Peruvian anthropologist [[Julio C. Tello]] and other major scholars.

Kroeber and his students did important work collecting cultural data on western tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The work done in preserving information about California tribes appeared in ''Handbook of the Indians of California'' (1925). In that book, Kroeber first described a pattern in California groups where a social unit was smaller and less hierarchically organized than a [[tribe]],&lt;ref name=kroeber1976handbook&gt;{{cite book | last = Kroeber | first = A | title = Handbook of the Indians of California | pages=160–163, 228–230, 234–235 | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1976 | isbn = 0486233685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=golla2011&gt;{{cite book | last = Golla | first = Victor | title = California Indian languages | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2011 | isbn = 0520266676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was elaborated upon in ''The Patwin and their Neighbors''&lt;ref name=kroeberpatwin&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = bUniversity of California Press | last = Kroeber | first = A.L. | title = The Patwin and their neighbors | year = 1932
| url = http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/anthpubs/ucb/text/ucp029-005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Kroeber first coined the term "tribelet" to describe this level of organization. Kroeber is credited with developing the concepts of [[culture area]], cultural configuration (''Cultural and Natural Areas of Native North America'', 1939), and cultural fatigue (''Anthropology'', 1963).

Kroeber's influence was so strong that many contemporaries adopted his style of beard and mustache as well as his views as a cultural historian. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} During his lifetime, he was known as the "Dean of American Anthropologists".  Kroeber and [[Roland Burrage Dixon|Roland B. Dixon]] were very influential in the genetic classification of [[Native American languages]] in North America, being responsible for theoretical groupings such as [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] and [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], based on common languages.

He is noted for working with [[Ishi]], who was claimed to be the last California [[Yahi]] Indian. (Ishi may have been of mixed ethnic heritage, with a father from the Wintu, Maidu or Nomlaki tribes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arf.berkeley.edu/archaeology-news/arf-newsletter-1996-v3-2 |title=ARF Newsletter 1996 v3-2 &amp;#124; Archaeological Research Facility |publisher=Arf.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife, [[Theodora Kroeber|Theodora Kracaw Kroeber]], wrote a well-known biography of Ishi, ''Ishi in Two Worlds''. Kroeber's relationship with Ishi was the subject of a film, ''[[The Last of His Tribe]]'' (1992), starring [[Jon Voight]] as Kroeber and [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] as Ishi.

Kroeber's textbook, ''Anthropology'' (1923, 1948), was widely used for many years. In the late 1940s, it was one of ten books required as reading for all students during their first year at [[Columbia University]]. His book, ''Configurations of Cultural Growth'' (1944), had a lasting impact on social scientific research on [[genius]] and [[greatness]]; Kroeber believed that genius arose out of culture at particular times, rather than holding to "the great man" theory.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D.K. 1994.  ''Greatness: Who Makes History and Why''.  New York: The Guilford Press. p375-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian land claims==
Kroeber served early on as the plaintiffs' director of research in ''Indians of California v. the United States'', a land claim case.&lt;ref&gt;13 ''Ind. Cl. Comm.'' 369 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;  His associate director and the director of research for the federal government in the case had both been students of his: [[Omer Stewart]] of the University of Colorado, and [[Ralph Beals]] of the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Beals, R. L.  (1985). "The Anthropologist as Expert Witness: Illustrations from the California Indian Land Claims Case," in ''Irredeemable America: the Indians' Estate and Land Claims,'' ed. I. Sutton (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press); ch. 6. Heizer, Robert F., and Alfred L. Kroeber (1976). "For Sale: California at 47 Cents per Acre," ''Journal of California Anthropology'' 3:38-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Kroeber's impact on the [[Indian Claims Commission]] may well have established the way expert witnesses presented testimony before the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Omer C. (1961). "Kroeber and the Indian Claims Commission Cases," ''Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers,'' 25: 181-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his former students also served as expert witnesses; for instance, Stewart directed the plaintiff research for the [[Ute people|Ute]] and for the [[Shoshone]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Omer C. (1985). "The Shoshone Claims Cases," in ''Irredeemable America...,'' op. cit., ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ana María Groot de Mahecha (other sources give second last name Sáenz)&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; was born in Bogotá on August 29, 1952. She attended the ''Colegio Santa Francisca Romana'' and studied anthropology at the [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|Universidad de los Andes]], obtaining her MSc. title in 1974 with a thesis named ''Excavaciones Arqueológicas en Tierradentro. Estudio sobre cerámica y su posible uso en la elaboración de la sal'' ("Archaeological excavations in Tierradentro. Study about ceramics and its possible use in the elaboration of salt"). In 2008 Ana María Groot obtained her PhD degree in history of the [[National University of Colombia|Universidad Nacional de Colombia]] with a thesis named ''Trabajo y vida cotidiana en los pueblos productores de sal en el altiplano de Bogotá, siglos XVI-XVII'' ("Daily work and life of the salt producing peoples on the Bogotá plateau, 16th-17th centuries").&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

Groot has published on the archaeology and anthropology of [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous cultures]] such as [[Tierradentro]], [[San Agustín, Huila|San Agustín]], [[Nariño Department|Nariño]], [[Tairona]] and the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], predominantly about their use of [[halite|salt]] from the mines of [[Nemocón]] and [[Zipaquirá]].&lt;ref name=WorldCat&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n92114803/ List of works by Ana María Groot] – WorldCat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dropbox&gt;{{es}} [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jt7q686cgzy3iqp/Ana%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Groot.docx?dl=0 List of works by Ana María Groot]&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[Henri Saint-Simon]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Comte developed the ''positive philosophy'' in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the [[French Revolution]], calling for a new social doctrine based on the [[sciences]]. Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture25a.html#course&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''sociologie'' and  [[social evolutionism]] set the tone for early [[social theorist]]s and [[anthropologist]]s such as [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], evolving into modern academic sociology presented by [[Émile Durkheim]] as practical and objective [[social research]].

Comte's social theories culminated in his "[[Religion of Humanity]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; which presaged the development of non-theistic [[Religious humanism|religious humanist]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]] organizations in the 19th century. Comte may have coined the word ''altruisme'' ([[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Auguste Comte was born in [[Montpellier]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Hérault]] on 19 January 1798. After attending the [[Citadel of Montpellier|Lycée Joffre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mediatheque.montpellier-agglo.com/22887393/0/fiche___document/&amp;RH=1219250799417 |publisher= Montpellier Agglomeration |title= Rencontre avec Annie Petit "Auguste Comte" |date= 2007-10-19 |accessdate= 2008-10-15 |quote= "''Né à Montpellier, brillant élève du Lycée Joffre''..." Translation: "Born in Montpellier, shining student of the Lycée Joffre..." |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090215021044/http://mediatheque.montpellier-agglo.com/22887393/0/fiche___document/%26RH%3D1219250799417 |archivedate= 15 February 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the [[University of Montpellier]], Comte was admitted to the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris. The École Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of [[republicanism]] and [[Progress (history)|progress]]. The École closed in 1816 for reorganization, however, and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the École Polytechnique reopened, he did not request readmission.

Following his return to Montpellier, Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Monarchism|monarchist]] family and set off again for Paris, earning money by small jobs. In August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 [[rue Bonaparte]] in Paris' [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6ème]] (where he lived until 1822) and later that year he became a student and secretary to  [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon, ''L'Industrie'', ''Le Politique'', and ''[[L'Organisateur]]'' ([[Charles Dunoyer]] and [[Charles Comte]]'s ''[[Le Censeur Européen]]''), although he would not publish under his own name until 1819's "La séparation générale entre les opinions et les désirs" ("The general separation of opinions and desires"). In 1824, Comte left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a ''Plan de travaux scientifiques nécessaires pour réorganiser la société'' (1822) (''Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society''). But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name="Pickering 192ff."&gt;Pickering (2006), p. 192ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte married [[Caroline Massin]] in 1825. In 1826, he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured – only stabilized by French alienist [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]] – so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the [[Pont des Arts]]). In the time between this and their divorce in 1842, he published the six volumes of his ''Cours.''

Comte developed a close friendship with [[John Stuart Mill]]. From 1844, he fell deeply in love with the Catholic [[Clotilde de Vaux]], although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new "[[Religion of Humanity]]". [[John Kells Ingram]], an adherent of Comte, visited him in Paris in 1855.

He published four volumes of ''[[Système de politique positive]]'' (1851–1854). His final work, the first volume of ''La Synthèse Subjective'' ("The Subjective Synthesis"), was published in 1856.

Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother, Rosalie Boyer, and of Clotilde de Vaux.
His apartment from 1841–1857 is now conserved as the [[Maison d'Auguste Comte]] and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in Paris' [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]].

==Thought==

===Comte's positivism===
{{Main|Positivism|Law of three stages}}
Comte first described the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |title= Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte |website= plato.stanford.edu|chapter= Auguste Comte |publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year= 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His work ''View of Positivism'' would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociological method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Comte offered an [[Sociocultural evolution|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'.

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'' stage, (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'' stage, and (3) the ''positive'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;  (1) The Theological stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in which man's place in society and society's restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in a supernatural power. [[Fetishism]] played a significant role during this time. (2) By the "Metaphysical" stage, Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of [[Aristotle]] or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather, the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of ''universal rights'' as being on a vauntedly higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand, although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of investigation, because people started reasoning and questioning, although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion. (3) In the Scientific stage, which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of [[Napoleon]], people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of ''human rights'' or prophecy of ''the will of God.'' Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard he was similar to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. For its time, this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date, although from a later standpoint, it is too derivative of [[classical physics]] and [[academic history]]. Comte's [[law of three stages]] was one of the first theories of [[social evolutionism]].

[[File:Comte's Theory of Science.png |thumb|left|''Comte's Theory of Science'' – According to Comte, the whole of the sciences consists of theoretical and applied knowledge. Theoretical knowledge can generally be divided into physics and biology, which are the object of his research and can be further partitioned into subfields such as botany, zoology or mineralogy. Comte's ranking of scientific fields - in order, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and sociology - symbolizes a decreasing range of research and complexity of theoretical tools, but a growing complexity of the phenomena under investigation. Each field in this ranking depends upon those that came before it; for instance, our understanding of chemistry depends upon our understanding of physics, as all chemical phenomena are more complicated than the physics that underlie them, and although the laws of chemistry are affected by the laws of physics, the converse is not true. Similarly, sciences that appear earlier in Comte's hierarchy are considered to be older and more advanced than those which come later.]]

The other universal law he called the "encyclopedic law". By combining these laws, Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences, including inorganic physics ([[astronomy]], [[earth science]] and [[chemistry]]) and organic physics ([[biology]] and, for the first time, ''physique sociale'', later renamed ''sociologie''). Independently from [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]]'s introduction of the term in 1780, Comte re-invented "sociologie", and introduced the term as a neologism, in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term "social physics", but that term had been appropriated by others, notably by [[Adolphe Quetelet]].

{{quote|The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand — not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one....This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity", which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names: astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology.|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)}}

This idea of a special science (not the humanities, not [[metaphysics]]) for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term "sociology" (as a term considered coined by Comte) had already been introduced in 1780, albeit with a different meaning, by the French essayist [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836).&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot à la chose, in Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines'', Number 15, November 2006. ''Naissances de la science sociale''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambitious (or many would say 'grandiose') way that Comte conceived of this special science of the social, however, was unique. Comte saw this new science, sociology, as the last and greatest of all sciences, one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out, however, that he noted a seventh science, one even greater than sociology. Namely, Comte considered "[[Anthropology]], or true science of Man [to be] the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science."&lt;ref&gt;1874 translation of ''System of Positive Polity'', Vol. II, pages 356–347, cited in Urbanowicz, Charles F. 1992. "Four-Field Commentary". ''Anthropology Newsletter''. Volume 33, Number 9, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Brazil.svg|left|thumb|The motto ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") in the [[flag of Brazil]] is inspired by Auguste Comte's motto of positivism: ''L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progrès pour but'' ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; Progress as the goal"). Several of those involved in the military coup d'état that deposed the [[Empire of Brazil]] and proclaimed Brazil to be [[Republic of Brazil|a republic]] were followers of the ideas of Comte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wais.stanford.edu/Brazil/brazil_orderandprogress42703.html BRAZIL: Order and Progress, Ronald Hilton, World Association of International Studies Forum Q&amp;A, 4/27/03]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Comte's explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory, practice and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of [[Harriet Martineau]]'s translation of ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'', we see his observation that, "If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts, it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance, our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them: for the most part we could not even perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;Comte, A. b (1974 reprint). ''The positive philosophy of Auguste Comte freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau''. New York: AMS Press. (Original work published in 1855, New York: Calvin Blanchard, p. 27.b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]]. Nevertheless, as with many others of Comte's time, certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific, and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition.

His emphasis on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative [[statistical analysis]], and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM) and [[Continual improvement process|Continuous Quality Improvement]] where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of [[Plan-Do-Check-Act]] ([[PDCA]], the [[Shewhart cycle]]). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Émile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. Debates continue to rage, however, as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, [[Henri de Saint-Simon]].

Comte influenced the [[Young Turks]] political movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/hanioglu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The religion of humanity===
[[File:Templo positivista.jpg|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]]]]
In later years, Comte developed the '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others"), from which comes the word "[[altruism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law of three stages===
{{Main|Law of three stages}}
Comte was agitated by the fact that no one had synthesized physics, chemistry, and biology into a coherent system of ideas, so he began an attempt to reasonably deduce facts about the social world from the use of the sciences. Through his studies, he concluded that the growth of the human mind progresses in stages, and so must societies. He claimed the history of society could be divided into three different stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. The Law of three Stages, an evolutionary theory, describes how history of societies is split into three sections due to new thoughts on philosophy. Comte believed that evolution was the growth of the human mind, splitting into stages and evolving through these stages. Comte concluded that society acts similarly to the mind.&lt;ref name="Delaney, Tim 2003"&gt;Delaney, Tim. "Auguste Comte". Council for Secular Humanism. ''Council for Secular Humanism'', Oct.-Nov. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions&amp;nbsp;{{ndash}} each branch of our knowledge&amp;nbsp;{{ndash}} passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the Theological, or fictitious; the Metaphysical, or abstract; and the Scientific, or positive.|A. Comte&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'' (trans. Harriet Martineau; London, 1853), Vol. I, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system "has lost its power" and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. 10.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"&gt;Comte, Auguste, and Gertrud Lenzer. Auguste Comte and Positivism: The Essential Writings. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an "organic" new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment on society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there needs to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a "series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters".&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage.

# Theological Stage
##The first stage, the theological stage, relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of human behavior because "the human mind, in its search for the primary and final causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the universe as interventions of supernatural agents".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bourdeau, Michel. Auguste Comte. Stanford University. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ [April 28, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; The Theological Stage is the "necessary starting point of human intelligence", when humans turn to supernatural agents as the cause of all phenomena.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"&gt;"Auguste Comte." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6Th Edition (2015): 1. MAS Ultra   School Edition. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage, humans focus on discovering absolute knowledge. Comte disapproved this stage because it turned to simple explanation humans created in their minds that all phenomena was caused by supernatural agents, rather than human reason and experience. Comte refers to Bacon’s philosophy that "there can be no real knowledge except that which rests upon observed facts", but he observes that the primitive mind could not have thought that way because it would have only created a vicious circle between observations and theories.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; "For if, on the one hand, every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or other".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Because the human mind could not have thought in that way in the origin of human knowledge, Comte claims that humans would have been "incapable of remembering facts", and would not have escaped the circle if it were not for theological conceptions, which were less complicated explanations to human life.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Although Comte disliked this stage, he explains that theology was necessary in the beginning of the developing primitive mind. 
## Fetishism
## Polytheism
## Monotheism
# Metaphysical or Abstract Stage
::The second stage, the metaphysical stage, is merely a modification of the first because a supernatural cause is replaced by an "abstract entity";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; it is meant to be a transitional stage, where there is the belief that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings. Because it is a transitional stage between the theological stage and the positive stage, Comte deemed it the least important of the three stages and was only necessary because the human mind cannot make the jump from the theological to the positive stage on its own. 

::The metaphysical stage is the transitional stage. Because "Theology and physics are so profoundly incompatible", and their "conceptions are so radically opposed in character", human intelligence must have a gradual transition.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Other than this, Comte says that there is no other use for this stage. Although it is the least important stage, it is necessary because humans could not handle the significant change in thought from theological to positivity.&lt;ref name="Delaney, Tim 2003"/&gt; The metaphysical stage is just a slight modification of the previous stage, when people believed in the abstract forces rather than the supernatural. The mind begins to notice the facts themselves, caused by the emptiness of the metaphysical agents through "over subtle qualification that all right-minded persons considered them to be only the abstract names of the phenomena in question".&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; The mind becomes familiar with concepts, wanting to seek more, and therefore is prepared to move into the positive stage.

:3. Positive stage
::The last stage – the positive stage – is when the mind stops searching for the cause of phenomena and realizes that laws exist to govern human behavior, and that this stage can be explained rationally with the use of reason and observation, both of which are used to study the social world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Delaney, Tim. Auguste Comte. Council for Secular Humanism, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This stage relies on science, rational thought, and empirical laws. Comte believed that this study of sociology he created was "the science that [came] after all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the task of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; because it organized all of human behavior.

The final, most evolved stage is the positivist stage, the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth, and turn towards discovering, through reasoning and observation, actual laws of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Humans realize that laws exist, and that the world can be rationally explained through science, rational thought, laws, and observation. Comte was a positivist, believing in the natural rather than the supernatural, and so he claimed that his time period, the 1800s, was in the positivist stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He believed that within this stage, there is a hierarchy of sciences: mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial physics, chemistry, and physiology. Mathematics, the "science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes", is the most perfect science of all, and is applied to the most important laws of the universe.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Astronomy is the most simple science, and is the first "to be subjected to positive theories".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy, because it is more complex, having less pure and systemized theories. Physics, as well as chemistry, are the "general laws of the inorganic world", and are harder to distinguish.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Physiology completes the system of natural sciences, and is the most important of all sciences because it is the "only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; This stage will fix the problems in current nations, allowing progression and peace.
 
===A famous error of Comte===
Auguste Comte is famous for writing in his book "''The Positive Philosophy''" that people would never learn the chemical composition of the planets.  In thirty years people were beginning to learn just that through spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/asras/chemcomp_i/chemcomp_i.html How do we know the composition of stars?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora generator starting to smoke.png|thumbnail|right|The diesel generator used in the aurora experiment beginning to smoke.]]

[[Idaho National Laboratory]] ran the '''Aurora Generator Test''' in 2007 to demonstrate how a [[cyberattack]] could destroy physical components of the electric grid.&lt;ref name="CNN article 2007/09/27"/&gt; The experiment used a computer program to rapidly open and close a [[diesel generator]]'s circuit breakers out of phase from the rest of the grid and cause it to explode. This vulnerability is referred to as the ''Aurora Vulnerability''.

This vulnerability is especially a concern because much grid equipment supports using [[Modbus]] and other legacy [[communications protocol]]s that were designed without security in mind. As such, they don't support [[authentication]], [[confidentiality]], or [[Replay attack|replay protection]], which means any attacker that can communicate with the device can control it and use the Aurora Vulnerability to destroy it. This is a serious concern, as the failure of even a single generator could cause widespread outages and possibly [[cascading failure]] of the entire power grid, like what occurred in the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]]. Additionally, even if there are no outages from the removal of a single component (N-1 resilience), there is a large window for a second attack or failure, as it could take more than a year to replace it, because many generators and transformers are custom-built for the substation.

The Aurora vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the out-of-phase opening and closing of the breakers. Some suggested methods include adding functionality in [[Protective relay|protective relays]] to ensure synchronism and adding a time delay for closing breakers.&lt;ref name="Myth or Reality"/&gt; Most modern day generators have many protections against out-of-sync generator breaker operations. Devices such as the IEEE 25 Sync Check relay as well as IEEE 46,47,50, and 53 are commonly used to prevent out-of-phase opening and closing of the breakers from ever happening. In addition the majority of the generator relays used do not have any type of communication they inhibit generator breaker operation by not allowing breaker close circuit from operating.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Experiment ==
To prepare for the experiment, the researchers procured and installed a 2.25 MW generator and connected it to the substation. They also needed access to a programmable digital relay or another device that controls the breaker. That access could have been through a mechanical or digital interface.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 91"/&gt;

In the experiment, the researchers used a cyberattack to open and close the breakers out of sync, to maximize the stress. Each time the breakers were closed, the torque from the synchronization caused the generator to bounce and shake, eventually causing parts of the generator be to ripped apart and sent flying off.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt; Some parts of the generator landed as far as 80 feet away from the generator.&lt;ref name="International Spy Museum, Master Script"/&gt;

The unit was destroyed in roughly three minutes. However, this was only because the researchers assessed the damage from each iteration of the attack. A real attack could have destroyed the unit much more quickly.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt;

The experiment was designated as unclassified, [[For Official Use Only|for official use only]].&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 134"/&gt; On September 27, 2007, CNN published an article based on the information and video DHS released to them,&lt;ref name="CNN article 2007/09/27"/&gt; and on July 3, 2014, DHS released many of the documents related to the experiment as part of an unrelated FOIA request.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA request"/&gt;

== Vulnerability ==
The Aurora vulnerability is caused by bypassing the [[Protective relay|protective relays]].&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt; This would require knowledge of the switchgear for that particular plant and then access to that gear and then physical jumpers placed to enable this to happen.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Proper security of electrical switchgear rooms will prevent this from happening. While certainly plausible this would be highly unlikely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

"A close, but imperfect, analogy would be to imagine the effect of shifting a car into Reverse while it is being driven on a highway, or the effect of revving the engine up while the car is in neutral and then shifting it into Drive."&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt;

"The Aurora attack is designed to open a circuit breaker, wait for the system or generator to slip out of synchronism, and reclose the breaker, all before the protection system recognizes and responds to the attack... Traditional generator protection elements typically actuate and block reclosing in about 15 cycles. Many variables affect this time, and every system needs to be analyzed to determine its specific vulnerability to the Aurora attack... Although the main focus of the Aurora attack is the potential 15-cycle window of opportunity immediately after the target breaker is opened, the overriding issue is how fast the generator moves away from system synchronism."&lt;ref name="Common Questions and Answers"/&gt;

== Mitigations ==

The Aurora vulnerability is caused by the out-of-sync closing of the protective relays. As such, any mechanism that prevents the out-of-sync closing would mitigate the vulnerability.

One mitigation technique is to add a synchronism-check function to all protective relays that potentially connect two systems together. To implement this, the function must prevent the relay from closing unless the voltage and frequency are within a pre-set range. Additionally, the synchronism-check could monitor the rate of change of the frequency and prevent closing above a set rate.&lt;ref name="Myth or Reality"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==

There was some discussion as to whether Aurora hardware mitigation devices (HMD) can cause other failures. In May 2011, Quanta Technology published an article that used [[Real Time Digital Simulator|RTDS (Real Time Digital Simulator)]] testing to examine the "performance of multiple commercial relay devices available" of Aurora HMDs. To quote: "The relays were subject to different test categories to find out if their performance is dependable when they need to operate, and secure in response to typical power system transients such as faults, power swing and load switching... In general, there were technical shortcomings in the protection scheme’s design that were identified and documented using the real time testing results. RTDS testing showed that there is, as yet, no single solution that can be widely applied to any case, and that can present the required reliability level."&lt;ref name="Quanta Technology Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 2, Spring 2011"/&gt; A presentation from Quanta Technology and [[Dominion Resources|Dominion]] succinctly stated in their reliability assessment "HMDs are not dependable, nor secure."&lt;ref name="Quanta Technology and Dominion July 2011 presentation"/&gt;

Joe Weiss, a cybersecurity and control system professional, disputed the findings from this report and claimed that it has misled utilities. He wrote: "This report has done a great deal of damage by implying that the Aurora mitigation devices will cause grid issues. Several utilities have used the Quanta report as a basis for not installing any Aurora mitigation devices. Unfortunately, the report has several very questionable assumptions. They include applying initial conditions that the hardware mitigation was not designed to address such as slower developing faults, or off nominal grid frequencies. Existing protection will address “slower” developing faults and off nominal grid frequencies (&lt;59 Hz or &gt;61 Hz). The Aurora hardware mitigation devices are for the very fast out-of-phase condition faults that are currently gaps in protection (i.e., not protected by any other device) of the grid."&lt;ref name="Unfettered Blog, September 4, 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1022">The '''Ausetani''' were an ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] (pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to have spoken the [[Iberian language]]. They lived in the eponymous region of [[Ausona]] and gave their name to the Roman city of ''Ausa''. 

The Ausetani minted their own coins which bore the inscription ''ausesken'' in [[northeastern Iberian script]] that is interpreted in [[Iberian language]] as a self-reference to the ethnic name of that people: from the Ausetani or from those of ''Ausa''.

'''Brigitte Hamann''' ({{nee|'''Deitert'''}}; 26 July 1940 – 4 October 2016) was a German-Austrian&lt;ref&gt;In an email to HPaul on 28 May 2009, B. Hamann wrote: "Since I have lived for more than forty years in Vienna, I naturally consider myself an Austrian, even though I don't talk like one"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2016}} author and historian based in [[Vienna]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Essen]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], Hamann studied history in [[Münster]] and Vienna. She worked as a journalist in her native Essen for some time. In 1965, she married historian Günther Hamann (1924–1994), moved to Vienna and obtained Austrian citizenship in addition to her German.&lt;ref name=orf&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/stories/89409 ORF-Seite]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three children; one of them is journalist and feminist Sibylle Hamann. Brigitte Hamann worked with her husband at the [[University of Vienna]] and in 1978 obtained a doctor's degree on the basis of a thesis on the life of [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria]]. The thesis was published as a book the same year. She described her working method as follows: "(Coming from Germany) I had a different view of Austria, and I began to write with a certain detachment".&lt;ref name=orf /&gt;

The success of her first book led to further books, notably on [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Winifred Wagner]].{{CN|date=October 2016}}

Hamann's 1996 book ''[[Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship]]'' examined how societal attitudes at the time shaped Hitler's [[anti-Semitic]] views during his time in Vienna between 1908 and 1913, and the effects of his inordinate fear of both infection and women. Following the publication of ''[[The Hidden Hitler]]'' by historian and [[University of Bremen]] professor [[Lothar Machtan]], Hamann investigated claims about [[Hitler's homosexuality]] and appears in the 2004 [[HBO]] documentary film, ''[[Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality]]'', by American documentarians [[Fenton Bailey]] and [[Randy Barbato]].{{CN|date=October 2016}}

In 2005, Hamann released ''Winifred Wagner: A Life at the Heart of Hitler's Bayreuth'', a biography of [[Winifred Wagner]], the British-born woman who became a founding member of the [[Nazi Party]] and a close friend of Hitler. The publication earned her "Book of the Year" honors by ''[[Opernwelt]]'' (Operaworld) magazine and "Historical Book of the Year" honors from ''[[Damals]]'' history magazine. That same year she received the {{Interlanguage link multi|Presseclub Concordia|de}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordia.at/content.php?cid%3Dpreis%26sp%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009172049/http://www.concordia.at/content.php?cid=preis&amp;sp= |archivedate=9 October 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; "{{Interlanguage link multi|Concordia-Preis|de}}" in recognition of her work.

Brigitte Hamann died on 4 October 2016 at the age of 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayr|first1=Lisa|title=Historikerin Brigitte Hamann gestorben (Historian Brigitte Hamann  has died)|url=http://derstandard.at/2000045363563/Historikerin-Brigitte-Hamann-gestorben|website=derstandard.at|publisher=Standard Verlagsgesellschaft m.b.H.|accessdate=23 April 2017|location=Vienna|language=German|date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Charles O'Conor''' ({{lang-ga|Cathal Ó Conchubhair Donn}}; 1764&amp;ndash;1828) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[priest]] and historical [[author]]. He was chaplain and librarian to the Marchioness of Buckingham and catalogued many manuscripts, including the famous Stowe Missal, now in the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. His grandfather was the historian [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Connor]], his brother the historian [[Matthew O'Conor]].

==Description==
:''O’Conor was a man of mild and timid disposition, liked by every one who knew him, and possessing extensive historical and ‘bookish’ information. In appearance he was short and slight, of sallow complexion, with prominent but distinguished looking features, giving him as age advanced a most vulnerable appearance. His manners were a curious compound of Irish and Italian. He was known locally as ‘the Abbé,’ and was for many years daily to be seen walking between Stowe and Buckingham, with his book and gold-headed cane, reading as he walked.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=O'Conor, Charles (1764-1828)|volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Charles O'Conor was educated in [[Pontifical Irish College|Ludovisi College, Rome]] from 1779–91 and was appointed parish priest of Kilkeevin, [[County Roscommon]] (1792–98). In 1796 he published a memoir of his grandfather, the historian [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Connor]] which he later suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/people/staff/oconor.htm Charles O’Conor : Librarian at Stowe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220000121/http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/people/staff/oconor.htm |date=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 he was invited to become chaplain to Mary Nugent, the [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Marchioness of Buckingham]] and to organize and translate a collection of Gaelic manuscripts at [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]]. With him he brought papers of his grandfather to Stowe, including fifty-nine Gaelic manuscripts. In Stowe O'Conor wrote Columbanus ad Hibernos (1810–13),a series of letters supporting the royal veto on Catholic episcopal appointments in Ireland. These were answered by [[Francis Plowden (barrister)|Francis Plowden]] and saw him suspended from duties of parish priest by [[John Troy (bishop)|John Troy]], [[Archbishop of Dublin]]. In his duties as librarian he edited the Four Masters, and other chronicles from the Stowe Library as Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres (1814–26), an edition regarded as unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/people/staff/oconor.htm Charles O’Conor : Librarian at Stowe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220000121/http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/people/staff/oconor.htm |date=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/terms.htm RICORSO: see O’Conor, Charles in Authors A-Z]&lt;/ref&gt;

Connor experienced mental illness. After leaving Stowe in 1827, he was briefly confined in a Dublin asylum. He died in Belenagare and is buried in Ballintober.

'''Claus Bundgård Christensen''' (born 1968 in [[Holstebro]]) is a Danish historian and associate professor at [[Roskilde University]] known for his books related to collaboration and crime in Denmark during and following World War II.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web|url= http://forskning.ruc.dk/site/da/persons/claus-bundgaard-christensen(f85d84f8-d9bb-4fc7-8fc0-fbbf360085cb).html |website= [[Roskilde University|ruc.dk]] |title= Claus Bundgård Christensen - Research - Roskilde University |accessdate= 2017-04-11 |language= da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he and historians Niels Bo Poulsen and Peter Scharff Smith published the book ''{{lang|da|Under hagekors og [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] - danskere i [[Waffen SS]]}}'' (''Under svastika and Dannebrog - Danes in Waffen SS''), acclaimed for its non-apologist and detailed description of the Danes who volunteered for service in the Waffen SS on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://bibliotek.kk.dk/ting/object/870970-basis%3A29015481 |website= bibliotek.kk.dk |title= Under hagekors og Dannebrog : danskere i Waffen SS - Københavns Biblioteker |accessdate= 2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.information.dk/1998/12/hagekors-dannebrog |website= [[Dagbladet Information|information.dk]] |title= 'Under hagekors og Dannebrog' |first= Georg |last= Metz |date= 1998-12-02 |accessdate= 2017-04-11 |language= da |trans-title= 'Under svastika and Dannebrog'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2016 book ''{{lang|da|Waffen-SS : Europas nazistiske soldater}}'' (''Waffen-SS: Europe's Nazi soldiers'') has been translated to [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Christensen |first1= Claus Bundgård |last2= Poulsen |first2= N.

In addition to his World War II era publications he wrote ''{{lang|da|Danskere på Vestfronten 1914-1918}}'' (''Danes on the Western Front 1914-1918''), which also received very positive reviews and won the 'History book of the year' ({{lang|da|Årets historiske bog}}) award in 2009.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.litteratursiden.dk/anmeldelser/danskere-paa-vestfronten-1914-1918-af-claus-bundgaard-christensen |website= litteratursiden.dk |title= Danskere på Vestfronten 1914-1918 af Claus Bundgård Christensen |first= Frederik |last= Schøler |date= 2014-07-09 |accessdate= 2017-04-11 |language= da |trans-title= Danes on the Western Front 1914-1918 by Claus Bundgård Christensen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comandanta Ramona''' (1959 – January 6, 2006) was the [[nom de guerre|''nom de guerre'']] of an officer of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN), a [[revolutionary]] [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] [[autonomist]] organization based in the southern [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Chiapas]]. Perhaps the most famous female Zapatista actor, Ramona was one of seven female commanders in charge of directing an army that consisted of one-third women. A member of the Zapatista leading council, the CCRI ([[Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee]]), she served as a symbol of equality and dignity for indigenous and impoverished women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zwarenstein|first=Carlyn|title=Legacy of a Zapatista Rebel|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=January 11, 2006|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ramona was born in 1959 in a [[Tzotzil]] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] community in the highlands of [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolutionary Women: A Book of Stencils|date=2010|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=1604862009|page=99|author=Queen of the Neighbourhood Collective}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amozurrutia|first=Alina|title=101 Mujeres en la Historia de México|date=2008|publisher=Grijalbo|location=Mexico City|isbn=9708103284|page=301|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining the EZLN, Ramona earned a meager wage by selling artisan crafts. Tired of watching her impoverished community suffer, she joined the EZLN and became the voice of the many women who had been disregarded by the Mexican government for being seen as too small of a minority to influence public policy. This belief was later debunked after around 100,000 people turned out at the main square of Mexico's capital - proving that their presence in the country was big and that they were no longer going to endure laws that did not take their interests into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Comandante Ramona|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/comandante-ramona-6112340.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-11-23|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramona took control of the city of [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], the former capital of Chiapas, during the January 1, 1994 Zapatista uprising. Ramona began a long fight with [[cancer]] the same year; in 1995, she received a [[kidney transplant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davidson|first=Phil|title=Comandanta Ramona; Zapatista Rebel Leader Dies|newspaper=The Independent|date=January 11, 2006|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended her life for over a decade.

In 1996, she broke through a government encirclement when she traveled to Mexico City to help found the National Indigenous Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=John|title=The Zapatistas are Back|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=March 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the first Zapatista rebel to be granted government permission to travel outside of Chiapas for a three conference where she delivered the first of peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=8075|title=LexisNexis® Academic &amp; Library Solutions|website=www.lexisnexis.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramona's peaceful demeanor and perseverance in her fight for the rights of her community turned her into an icon and symbol of equality.

Her last public appearance was at a preparation meeting—a plenary session for [[The Other Campaign]]—in Caracol de La Garrucha in the [[Municipio (Mexico)|municipality]] of [[Francisco Gómez, Chiapas|Francisco Gómez]] on September 16, 2005. After her death, [[Subcomandante Marcos]] suspended The Other Campaign activities for several days in order to be present at Ramona's funeral service.

==Roots of feminist platform==

Comandanta Ramona was not an ordinary soldier. The indigenous Maya of the Chiapas area shifted their political stances when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) was first signed in 1994. This trade agreement required Mexico to welcome commercial agriculture and other foreign investment that would stress the land of the region, and threaten the cultural integrity of the people. NAFTA increased the autonomy that foreign corporations had in Mexico. Indigenous objections from members of EZLN, including comandantas such as  Ramona emphasized the importance of these lands for subsistence purposes of the indigenous community. In addition, EZLN demanded to be part of any decision process where lands were discussed. EZLN was determined to establish a right to life and dignity against foreign corporations and the Mexican government alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolfwood|first1=Terry|title=Who is Comandanta Ramona?|journal=Third World Resurgence|date=1997|issue=84|url=http://schoolsforchiapas.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Who-is-Comandanta-Ramona_.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their prior isolation from politics and their growing personal autonomy, indigenous women took matters into their own hands by creating the Revolutionary Women’s Law. In this law, Ramona helped outline the spaces that needed to be carved out for women both in the nation of Mexico and within their own indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Devon|last2=Ryan|first2=Laura|title=Teaching Women in the Zapatista Movement: Gender, Health and Resistance|url=http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/4.3/hansen.html|website=World History Connected}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolutionary Women’s Law consisted of 10 laws including reproductive health facilities, access to technology and education, small business support, independent decision-making, not being physically, mentally and emotionally abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomvoices.org/stories/ramona.htm|title=EZLN Interview with Commandante Ramona and Major Ana Maria, tr. C. Ross|website=www.freedomvoices.org|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous women had been subjugated under a system of cultural, sexist and class beliefs. However, with the prompting and influence of leaders such as Comandanta Ramona, EZLN recognized the influence of women in their movement, and by the time of the signing of NAFTA one third of their military personnel were women.

Comandanta Ramona is renowned as one of the most iconic indigenous women of her time. She symbolized the truths behind being a ''pobre indigena'' in a primarily male dominated world where globalization increasingly challenged the autonomy of indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belausteguigoitia|first1=Marisa|title=Ramona: El derecho a descansar|journal=Debate Feminista|date=2006|volume=33|url=http://www.debatefeminista.cieg.unam.mx/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/articulos/033_08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{expand section|date=December 2018}}
Ramona was famous for her petite body frame masked and clothed in indigenous dresses. Vendors in her home town created a doll version of Ramona which consisted of a masked peasant woman usually carrying a gun or a baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://schoolsforchiapas.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Who-is-Comandanta-Ramona_.pdf|title = Who Is Comandanta Ramona?|date = August 1997|accessdate = November 20, 2015|website = |publisher = Third World Resurgence No. 84,|last = Wolfwood|first = Terry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''community museum''' exhibits a [[social history]], often of a [[local area]] or an [[ethnic group]].{{fact|date=August 2016}}

Most such museums are [[local museum]]s but could cover a dispersed community such as an ethnic diaspora, gays, a profession or industry, or another group with a common interest such as an ideological movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtc.gov.on.ca/en/museums/museums_standards.shtml Standards for community museums in Ontario]&lt;/ref&gt;

Community museums generally have some relation to the identified community other than to exhibit artifacts under glass.  Some are community centers.  Others are participatory, inviting local commentary or input, folk items, hosting performances, or lending items from their collection out.&lt;ref name=ns&gt;Nina Simon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4759">The ''' Coso artifact''' is an object claimed by its discoverers to be a [[spark plug]] found encased in a lump of hard clay or rock on February 13, 1961, by Wallace Lane, Virginia Maxey and Mike Mikesell while they were [[prospecting]] for [[geode]]s near the town of [[Olancha, California]], and long claimed as an example of an [[out-of-place artifact]].&lt;ref name=stromberg&gt;Stromberg, P., and P. V. Heinrich, 2004, [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rncse_content/vol24/2562_the_coso_artifact_mystery_fro_12_30_1899.asp ''The Coso Artifact Mystery from the Depths of Time?''], Reports of the National Center for Science Education, v. 24, no. 2, pp. 26–30 (March/April 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The artifact has been identified as as a 1920s-era [[Champion (spark plug)|Champion]] spark plug. &lt;ref name=strombergtalkorigins&gt;Stromberg, P., and P. V. Heinrich, 2018, [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/coso.html''The Coso Artifact Mystery from the Depths of Time?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A spark plug encased in a 500,000-year-old "geode" would represent a substantial scientific and historical [[:wikt:anomaly|anomaly]], as spark plugs were invented in the 19th century. Critics say that the stone matrix containing the artifact is not a geode, but concretion that can be explained by natural processes that can take place over decades or years.

==Discovery==
Following its collection, Mikesell destroyed a diamond-edged blade by cutting through the matrix and discovered the item.&lt;ref name=stromberg/&gt; In a letter written to ''Desert Magazine of Outdoor Southwest'' a reader stated that a trained geologist had dated the nodule as at least 500,000 years old.&lt;ref name=Maxey1&gt;Maxey, V., 1961, ''The Coso Geode...'' in Letters...From Our Readers. Desert Magazine of Outdoor Southwest. v. 25, no. 5, p. 4. (May 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;
The identity of the geologist and the means of dating were never clarified, nor were the findings ever published in any known periodical.&lt;ref name=stromberg/&gt; Furthermore, at the time of the artifact's reported discovery there was no method for dating the concretion. &lt;ref name=Walker2005a&gt;Walker, M. (2005) ''Quaternary Dating methods'' Wiley, New York, New York. 304 pp. {{ISBN|978-0470869277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of accretions surrounding [[iron]] or [[steel]] artifacts, some of them discussed by J. M. Cronyn.  &lt;ref name=Cronyn1990a&gt;Cronyn, J. M. (1990) ''The Elements of Archaeological Conservation'' Routledge, New York, New York. 326 pp. {{ISBN|978-0415012072}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and analysis==
There are several [[Pseudoscientific]] theories for the artifact's origin,&lt;ref name=stromberg/&gt; among them:

* An ancient advanced civilization (such as [[Atlantis]]);
* Prehistoric [[Ancient astronaut hypothesis|extraterrestrial visitors]] to Earth;
* Human [[Time travel|time-travellers]] from the future leaving or losing the artifact during a visit to the past.

An investigation by [[Pierre Stromberg]] and [[Paul Heinrich]], with the help of members of the [[Spark Plug Collectors of America]], identified the artifact as a 1920s-era [[Champion (spark plug)|Champion]] spark plug, widely used in the [[Ford Model T]] and [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] engines. SPCA President Chad Windham and other collectors concurred with his assessment.&lt;ref name="stromberg" /&gt;

Stromberg and Heinrich's report&lt;ref name="stromberg" /&gt; indicates that the spark plug became encased in a [[concretion]] composed of iron derived from the [[rust]]ing spark plug. Iron and steel artifacts rapidly form [[iron oxide|iron-oxide]] concretions as they rust in the ground.&lt;ref name=Cronyn1990a/&gt;

On April 12, 2018, Pierre Stromberg was contacted by the family of one of the co-discoverers of the artifact. Offered an opportunity to physically inspect the artifact, Stromberg accepted and also arranged for the artifact to be inspected by a geologist from the [[University of Washington]] Earth and Space Science department. The inspections confirmed the previous conclusion that the artifact was a 1920s-era Champion spark plug.&lt;ref name=strombergtalkorigins&gt;Stromberg, P., and P. V. Heinrich, 2018, [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/coso.html''The Coso Artifact Mystery from the Depths of Time?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''creation of man from clay'''" is a [[Miraculous births|miraculous birth]] [[theme (literature)|theme]] that recurs throughout world religions and mythologies. Examples include:

* In [[Greek mythology]], according to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html#7 1.7.1]), Prometheus molded men out of water and earth.
* In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]] the gods [[Enki]] or [[Enlil]] create a servant of the gods, humankind, out of clay and blood (see [[Enki#Enki and the Making of Man|Enki and the Making of Man]]). In another Sumerian story, both [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursag|Ninmah]] create humans from the clay of the [[Abzu]], the fresh water of the underground. They take turns in creating and decreeing the fate of the humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr112.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Egyptian mythology]] the god [[Khnum]] creates human children from clay before placing them into their mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316758/Khnum&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Chinese mythology]] (see ''[[Chu Ci]]'' and ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]''), [[Nüwa]] molded figures from the yellow earth, giving them life and the ability to bear children.
* In the Babylonian creation epic [[Enuma Elish]], the goddess [[Ninhursag]] created humans from clay.
* According to [[Hindu mythology]] the mother of Ganesh, Parvati, made Ganesh from clay and turned the clay into flesh and blood.
* According to some [[Laotian folk religion]], there are stories of humans created from mud or clay.
* The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] culture holds that the god [[Obatala]] likewise created the human race from clay.
* According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:7 "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul".
* According to the [[Qur'an]]{{quran-usc|23|12|end=15|expand=no}}, God created man from clay.

[[Image:Korean.culture-Jesa-01.jpg|thumb|right|A ''jesasang'' (제사상), literally "death anniversary table" - a table used in Korean death anniversary ceremonies]]
A '''death anniversary''' is the [[anniversary]] of the death of a person. It is the opposite of [[birthday]]. It is a custom in several Asian cultures, including [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Korea]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Vietnam]], as well as in other places with significant overseas [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]], [[Jewish]], [[Korean diaspora|Korean]], and [[Overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese]] populations, to observe the anniversary on which a family member or other significant individual [[death|died]]. There are also similar memorial services that are held at different intervals, such as every week.

Although primarily a manifestation of [[ancestor worship]], the tradition has also been associated with [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]] (in [[East Asian]] cultural civilizations) or [[Hinduism]] ([[South Asia]] but mainly in [[India]]). In [[Judaism]] (the majority religion of Israel), such a commemoration is called a ''[[yahrtzeit]]'' (among other terms). Celebration of mass in memory of a loved one on or near the anniversary of their death is also a part of [[Roman Catholic]] tradition.

== By culture ==

===China===
In China, a death anniversary is called {{lang-zh|c=忌辰|p=jìchén|labels=no}} or {{lang-zh|c=忌日|p=jìrì|labels=no}}.&lt;!--Needs to be checked--&gt; This type of ceremony dates back thousands of years in China (at least to the [[Shang Dynasty]]) and historically involved making sacrifices to the spirits of one's ancestors.

===Indian subcontinent===
{{main|Śrāddha}}
In Nepal and India, a death anniversary is known as ''[[Śrāddha|shraadh]]''.&lt;!--Is it associated with only Hinduism, or also with the Jain, Sikh, Buddhist, or Muslim traditions of Nepal and India?--&gt; The first death anniversary is called a ''barsy'', from the word ''baras'', meaning year in the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi language]]s.

''Shraadh''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siddhashram.org/s20000849.shtml |title=Shraadh Pitra Santushti Sadhana |publisher=Siddhashram.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207194737/http://www.siddhashram.org/s20000849.shtml |archivedate=2013-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; means to give with devotion or to offer one's respect. ''Shraadh'' is a ritual for expressing one's respectful feelings for the ancestors. According to Nepali and Indian texts, a soul has to wander about in the various worlds after death and has to suffer a lot due to past karmas. ''Shraadh'' is a means of alleviating this suffering.

''Shraddhyaa Kriyate Yaa Saa'': ''Shraadh'' is the ritual accomplished to satiate one's ancestors. ''Shraadh'' is a private ceremony performed by the family members of the departed soul. Though not mandated spiritually, it is typically performed by the eldest son and other siblings join in offering prayers together.

===Japan===
In Japan, a death anniversary is called {{Nihongo||命日|meinichi}}, {{Nihongo||忌辰|kishin}}, or {{Nihongo||忌日|kijitsu/kinichi}}. Monthly observances of a death are known as {{Nihongo||月命日|tsuki meinichi}}, while annual anniversaries are known as {{Nihongo||祥月命日|shōtsuki meinichi}}.

===Judaism===
{{main|Yahrtzeit}}
Observant Jews commemorate the ''yahrtzeit'' ({{lang-yi|יאָרצײַט|yortsayt}}) of the death of parents, siblings, spouses, or children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/death.htm|title=Judaism 101: Life, Death and Mourning|work=jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Hebrew calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/yahrzeit-date.htm|title=Jewish Funeral Guide - Remembrance - Yahrzeit Date Calculation|work=jewish-funeral-guide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main observance involves recitation of ''[[kaddish]]'' prayer, and a widely practiced [[Minhag|custom]] is to light a special candle that burns for 24 hours, called a [[yahrtzeit candle]].

===Korea===
{{main|Jesa}}
In Korea, ancestor worship ceremonies are referred to by the generic term ''jerye'' ({{lang|ko|제례}})&lt;!-- 祭禮 --&gt;. Notable examples of ''jerye'' include ''[[Munmyo]] jerye'' and ''[[Jongmyo]] jerye'', which are performed periodically each year for venerated [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars and kings of ancient times, respectively.

The ceremony held on the anniversary of a family member's death is called ''gije'' ({{lang|ko|기제}}) &lt;!--忌祭--&gt;, and is celebrated by families as a private ceremony. For such occasions, the women of the family traditionally prepare an elaborate set of dishes, including ''[[tteok]]'', ''[[jeon (food)|jeon]]'', ''[[jeok (food)|jeok]]'', and so forth.

=== Philippines ===
{{main|Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines}}In the Philippines, the funeral is only one part of an elaborate mourning tradition. For nine days after the funeral has taken place, [[novena]] prayers are offered in a practice called ''pasiyam'' (although some start the practice the night after the death).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thelasallian.com/2013/11/23/crash-course-funeral-practices-in-the-philippines/|title=Crash Course: Funeral practices in the Philippines|last=Loyola Jr.|first=Roy|last2=Mendoza|first2=Andrea|date=2013-11-23|website=The LaSallian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also customary for another service to be given on the fortieth day after the death, as it is traditionally believed that the souls of the dead wander the Earth for forty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twoagespilgrims.com/doctrine/why-have-a-ritual-service-40-days-after-death/|title=Why Have a Ritual Service 40 Days After Death?|last=|first=|date=|website=Doctrine Unites!|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the death, the first year death anniversary ({{Lang-tl|babang luksa}}, literally "lowering of mourning") is commemorated with the final service. After the ''babang luksa'', the spouse of the deceased can remarry, and the family can once again hold birthday celebrations and attend parties. The miscellaneous non-valuable belongings of the deceased will also be symbolically burned to represent the mourners being able to move on with their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://juny.expertscolumn.com/article/common-funeral-tradition-and-custom-philippines-part-3|title=Common Funeral Tradition And Custom In The Philippines Part 3|last=Oballes|first=Jane|date=2012-06-23|website=Experts Column|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Babang luksa'' is normally commemorated with a meal and prayers ("''padagal''") for the deceased. For one year after a death, mourners dress all in black or wear a black pin as a remembrance during their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tagaloglang.com/luksa/|title=Luksa (dictionary entry)|last=|first=|date=2017-02-15|work=TagalogLang Online Tagalog-English Dictionary|access-date=2017-08-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''babang luksa'', the mourners may once again return to their normal dress, although depending on circumstances, some may opt to wear their mourning attire for longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Philippines/sub5_6c/entry-3864.html#chapter-3|title=Funerals in the Philippines|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|date=|year=2013|website=Facts and Details|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the first anniversary of the death is specifically commemorated, Filipinos further commemorate the deaths of all of their ancestors at their grave sites on [[All Saints' Day]] (November 1) and [[All Souls' Day]] (November 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/648202/tradition-reunions-bring-filipinos-to-cemeteries-on-day-of-the-dead|title=Tradition, reunions, tribute, business for Filipinos on ‘day of the dead’|last=Corrales|first=Nestor|date=2014-11-02|work=|access-date=2017-08-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Xoigac.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Special desserts for Vietnamese death anniversary banquets]] --&gt;
In Vietnam, a death anniversary is called {{lang|vi|[[:vi:giỗ|giỗ]]}}, {{lang|vi|ngày giỗ}} (literally "{{lang|vi|giỗ}} day"), {{lang|vi|đám giỗ}} (literally "{{lang|vi|giỗ}} ceremony"), or {{lang|vi|bữa giỗ}} (literally "{{lang|vi|giỗ}} meal"). It is a festive occasion, at which members of an extended family gather together. Female family members traditionally spend the entire day cooking an elaborate banquet in honor of the deceased individual, which will then be enjoyed by all the family members. In addition, sticks of [[incense]] are burned in honor and commemoration of the deceased person. It is not unusual for a family to celebrate several {{lang|vi|giỗ}} per year, so the ceremony serves as a time for families to reunite, much like the Vietnamese new year, [[Tết]].  The rituals are the responsibility of whoever inherits the ancestral estates, typically the deceased's most senior [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendant.

Although a {{lang|vi|giỗ}} is usually a private ceremony attended only by family members (and occasionally also close friends), some are commemorated by large segments of the population.  The commemoration of the {{lang|vi|[[Hùng Vương|Hung Kings]]}} ({{lang|vi|[[Giỗ tổ Hùng Vương]]}}), the legendary founders of the first Vietnamese kingdom in Vietnam's remote past, and of the [[Trung Sisters]] are widely participated.  In March 2007 {{lang|vi|[[Giỗ tổ Hùng Vương]]}} became a [[Public holidays in Vietnam|public holiday in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vietbao.vn/Xa-hoi/Thong-qua-phuong-an-xay-nha-Quoc-hoi-va-nghi-ngay-gio-To/30173078/157/ |title=Thông qua phương án xây nhà Quốc hội và nghỉ ngày giỗ Tổ |publisher=Vietbao.vn |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in all traditional commemorations, the [[Chinese calendar]] is used.

In Vietnamese culture, certain special, traditional dishes (particularly desserts) are only prepared for death anniversary banquets. In addition, favorite foods of the deceased person being honored are also prepared.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scootersaigontour.com/death-anniversary-in-vietnam/|title=Death Anniversary in Vietnam - Scooter Saigon Tour|date=2017-05-31|work=Scooter Saigon Tour|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicken]], a particularly prized meat in Vietnam, is often cooked as well. In Central Vietnam, small stuffed [[glutinous rice]] [[Rice flour|flour]] balls wrapped in leaves&lt;!--Leaves of what plant?--&gt; called {{lang|vi|[[bánh]] ít}} are such a dish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because the preparation of so many complex dishes is time-consuming, some families purchase or hire caterers to prepare certain dishes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also common that a soft-boiled egg be prepared and then given to the oldest grandson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Expand German|Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters|date=January 2017}}
The '''''Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters''''' (''German Archive for Research into the Middle Ages''; often shortened to '''''Deutsches Archiv''''' or '''''DA''''') is a historical journal on history between 400 CE and 1500 CE, published by the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] (MGH), the German institute for study of the Middle Ages. It numbers its volumes from 1937, named the ''Deutsches Archiv für Geschichte des Mittelalters'' (''German Archive for Medieval History'') from volume 7 (1944). Its forerunners were the twelve-volume 1820-1874 ''Archiv der Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde'' (''Archive for study of earlier German history'') and the fifty-volume 1876-1935 ''Neue Archiv der Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde'' (''New Archive for the study of earlier German history'' or ''NA''). It has been published in [[Weimar]] then [[Cologne]] by [[Böhlau Verlag]], its current publisher, and is the oldest German-language journal on medieval history.

==History==

Endgame was started in 2008 by Chris Rouland and other executives who previously worked with the [[CIA]] and ISS. In October 2010 it saw an investment of 29 million USD, raised from [[Bessemer Venture Partners|Bessemer Ventures]], Columbia Capital, [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers|Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] (KPCB), and [http://techoperators.com/ TechOperators].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.firedoglake.com/2013/07/02/endgame-inc-inside-the-company-inside-your-cell-phone/ |title=

In February 2011, the company announced partnerships with [[Hewlett-Packard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/021411-hp-malware.html |title=HP combining IPS and SIEM to better fight malware |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812184236/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/021411-hp-malware.html |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IBM]] to use Endgame's IP Reputation Intelligence service within HP's TippingPoint Digital Vaccine service and IBM's managed services offerings. That same month emails sent to [[HB Gary]] from Endgame were leaked which revealed that the company sold [[Zero-day attack|zero-day vulnerabilities]].&lt;ref name="Meer 10 Mar 2011"/&gt; As of 2014 Endgame has moved away from zero-day exploitations to identifying and protecting consumers from potential cyber threats.

'''Engelbert Mühlbacher''' (4 October 1843 &amp;ndash; 17 July 1903) was an [[Austria]]n [[historian]]. 

Born in [[Gresten]], he received his classical education in [[Linz]], Upper Austria being his family's home region. In 1862 he became a novice among the [[Abbey#Austin Canons|Austin Canons]] in [[Sankt Florian]]. After completing his theological studies there, he was ordained priest in 1867. As [[Alfred Ritter von Arneth]] relates in his memoirs, historical studies had been successfully cultivated at St. Florian's since Provost Arneth's time, and Mühlbacher was soon active in this domain. Among his writings are articles on St. Florian's [[Gerhoh von Reichersberg]], and the literary productions of St. Florian's. 

In 1872 he was studying history under [[Julius von Ficker]] in [[Innsbruck]], where after two years he received the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]]. He then hastened to Vienna to finish his historical training under [[Theodor von Sickel]]'s guidance. When Ficker entrusted the youthful scholar with the revision of the [[Carolingian]] period of [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer|Böhmer]]'s "Regesta", he was directing him to a domain in which he was to do much work. In 1878 he was formally received as academical lecturer into the philosophical faculty of the [[University of Innsbruck]], and between 1880 and 1889 published his edition of the imperial "Regesta" of the Carolingian period. As [[Oswald Redlich]] says, "the technique of compiling regesta received exemplary development at Mühlbacher's hands, and his work served as a model for the entire new edition of the imperial ''Regesta''". 

In 1892 Mühlbacher was entrusted with the editing of the Carolingian charters for the ''Monumenta Germaniæ Historica''. At the same time it became necessary to bring out a new edition of his Carolingian "Regesta". The two works proved of mutual assistance. He was able to see only the first part of each work through the press, but left considerable material for the use of his successors. No other German scholar was so well qualified to write the ''Deutsche Geschichte unter den Karolingern'', which appeared in 1896. After 1879 Mühlbacher edited the ''[[Mitteilungen des Instituts für österreichische Geschichtsforschung]]'' (Publications of the Institute for Austrian Historical Research). In 1881 he was appointed extraordinary, and in 1896 ordinary professor at Vienna. In 1895 Ficker turned over to him the management of the ''Regesta Imperii''. He took in hand the arrangement of the Austrian State Archives, and the preparation of the more recent history of Austria. He was chosen an active member of the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences]] in Vienna. 

When Mühlbacher died in Vienna in the age of only 59 years of pneumonia (an illness made worse by neglect and his enthusiasm for his work), he left the almost completed manuscript of his edition of the charters of [[Pepin the Short]], [[Carloman I]] and [[Charlemagne]]. This volume was published posthumously in 1906 (''Die Urkunden Pippins, Karlmanns und Karls des Großen'', MGH Diplomata Karolinorum I, [http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:12-bsb00000358-9 book in digital form]) and is the authoritative edition of the charters of these three kings until today.

{{Campaignbox Post-Soviet Conflicts}}

The '''Georgian Civil War''' comprised inter-ethnic and intranational conflicts in the regions of [[South Ossetia]] (1988–1992) and [[Abkhazia]] (1992–1993), as well as the violent military ''[[coup d'état]]'' of December 22, 1991 – December 31, 1993, against the first democratically elected [[President of Georgia]], [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] and his subsequent uprising in an attempt to regain power (1993).

While the Gamsakhurdia rebellion was eventually defeated, the South Ossetia and Abkhazia conflicts resulted in the de facto secession of both regions from Georgia. As a result, both conflicts have lingered on, with occasional flare-ups.

== Ethnic conflicts ==
Ethnic minority separatist movements – primarily on the part of the [[Ossetians]] and the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], demanded fuller recognition in the new order of the early 1990s. Asserting its newly gained national prerogatives, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] responded with military attempts to restrain separatism forcibly. On January 5, 1991 Georgia's National Guard entered [[Tskhinvali]], [[South Ossetia]]n capital and fighting broke out in and around the city. The [[Georgian-Ossetian Conflict]] was the first major crisis faced by Gamsakhurdia's government.

At the time of the [[dissolution of the USSR]], the [[United States]] government [[Stimson Doctrine|recognized as legitimate]] the pre-[[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] 1933 borders of the country (the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] government established diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746345,00.html "Pretty Fat Turkey"], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', November 27, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;). Because of this, the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration openly supported the secession of the [[Baltic states|Baltic SSRs]], but regarded the questions related to the independence and territorial conflicts of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and the rest of the [[Transcaucasus]] — which were integral part of the USSR with international borders unaltered since the 1920s — as internal Soviet affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973116,00.html America Abroad], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', June 10, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil unrest ==
Activity of the opposition against the authoritarian Government of [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] caused an acute political dispute, which soon turned violent in the fall of 1991. Following the police dispersion of a large opposition demonstration in [[Tbilisi]] on September 2, several oppositionists were arrested and their offices raided and pro-opposition newspapers were closed. The National Guard of Georgia, the major paramilitary force in the country split into two, pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia factions. Another powerful paramilitary organization, the [[Mkhedrioni]] led by [[Jaba Ioseliani]] also sided with the opposition.

Demonstrations and barricade-building marked the next three months. On 22 September, there were the first fatalities in [[Tbilisi]]. On September 24, state of emergency was declared in Tbilisi. On October 4 anti-Gamsakhurdia groups attacked the supporters of Gamsakhurdia; one supporter of the President was killed. By late October 1991, most of the leadership of the oppositional National Democratic Party (NDP), headed by [[Giorgi Chanturia]], had been arrested. A stand-off followed because former National Guard leader [[Tengiz Kitovani]]'s armed supporters withdrew to the outskirts of [[Tbilisi]] where they remained until late December 1991 when the power struggle intensified with the opposition claiming that President Gamsakhurdia had left no chance to peaceful settlement of the crisis.

== Coup d'état ==
On 20 December 1991, Kitovani's fighters returned in force to begin the final onslaught against Gamsakhurdia. The armed oppositionists released [[Jaba Ioseliani]], the leader of "[[Mkhedrioni]]" and mounted barricades in central Tbilisi. On December 22, the rebels seized several official buildings, and attacked the Parliament building where Gamsakhurdia and his supporters were holding the position. Simultaneously, the rebels already controlling most of the city, brutally suppressed pro-Gamsakhurdia protests in and around Tbilisi. They fired on the crowds, killing and wounding several people.

On 6 January 1992, President Gamsakhurdia with other members of his government was forced to flee first to [[Armenia]] and then to [[Chechnya]], where he led a form of government-in-exile for the next 18 months.

Within several days of the fighting the main boulevard in the city, [[Rustaveli Avenue]], had been destroyed and at least 113 people were killed.

== "Zviadist" resistance ==
After the successful coup, an interim government, the Military Council, was formed in Georgia. Initially it was led by a triumvirate of [[Jaba Ioseliani]], [[Tengiz Sigua]] and [[Tengiz Kitovani]], but it was soon chaired by [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], the former Communist leader who returned to Tbilisi in March 1992. The 1992 elections established Shevardnadze as the Chairman of Parliament and the Head of State.

Zviad Gamsakhurdia, despite his absence, continued to enjoy substantial support within Georgia, especially in rural areas and in his home region of [[Samegrelo]] in western Georgia. The supporters of the ousted president, the "Zviadists," responded to the coup with spontaneous street demonstrations, which were brutally suppressed by the government forces and paramilitary groups. Clashes between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia forces continued throughout 1992 and 1993 with [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]]'s supporters taking captive government officials and government forces retaliating with reprisal raids. One of the most serious incidents occurred in [[Tbilisi]] on June 24, 1992, when armed Gamsakhurdia supporters seized the state television center. However, they were driven out within a few hours by the National Guard.

The armed "Zviadists" actually prevented the new government forces from gaining control of Gamsakhurdia's native [[Samegrelo]] region, which became the stronghold of the overthrown president's supporters. Numerous acts of violence and atrocities committed by the [[Mkhedrioni]] and government forces in this region contributed to further confrontation between the local population and Shevardnadze's regime.

Following the coup and armed clashes in western Georgia, [[Aslan Abashidze]], the leader of southwestern autonomous province of [[Adjara]], closed an administrative border and prevented both sides from entering Adjarian territory. This established Abashidze's authoritarian semi-separatist regime within the region, and created long-term problems in relations between the regional government and the central government of Georgia.

== South Ossetian and Abkhazian wars ==
{{Main|1991–1992 South Ossetia War|Abkhaz–Georgian conflict}}

In February 1992, the fighting escalated in [[South Ossetia]], with sporadic Russian involvement. Facing interior instability and political chaos, Shevardnadze agreed to negotiations to avoid a confrontation with  [[Russia|Russia]]. A cease-fire was agreed upon and on 14 July 1992, a peacekeeping operation began, consisting of a Joint Control Commission and joint [[Russia]]n – [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] – [[Ossetia]]n military patrols.

By the summer of 1992, tensions in another secessionist region, [[Abkhazia]], were close to developing into a full-scale [[Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]]. On August 14, Georgian forces entered [[Abkhazia]] to disarm separatist militias. By the end of September 1993, Russian-backed separatists fought back and took the region's capital, [[Sukhumi]], after fierce fighting on September 27. Georgia's military defeat was followed by the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Georgian majority in Abkhazia. The war produced approximately 20,000 deaths on both sides, and about 260,000 refugees and [[IDPs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=401&amp;issue_id=3024&amp;article_id=2368290 |title=Programs – The Jamestown Foundation Volume 1, Issue 57|date=July 22, 2004|work=jamestown.org|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Georgia (country)}}

== The 1993 civil war ==
During the Abkhazian war, the role of Vakhtang (Loti) Kobalia's militia, the major force of the former President's supporters, continued to be controversial. Kobalia's militia fought on the Georgian side near the village of [[Tamish, Georgia|Tamish]] in [[Abkhazia]] and played an important role in defeating the Abkhaz-North Caucasian commandos. This step was assessed by Shevardnadze as a 'beginning of national reconciliation'. At the same time, they stirred their activities in anticipation of the fall of Sukhumi and public discontent with Shevardnadze's policy which they expected to follow (as they openly stated). On July 9–10, 72 deputies of the former Supreme Council that had been ousted in January 1992, held a session in [[Zugdidi]] and declared the 'restoration of the legitimate government' there. Broadcasting on their TV channel became more frequent. From July to August Kobalia's militia effectively established its control in a significant part of the [[Samegrelo]] province.

In September 1993, [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] took advantage of the struggle in [[Abkhazia]] to return to the city of Zugdidi, western Georgia, and rally enthusiastic but disorganized Georgians in Samegrelo region against the demoralized and unpopular government of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. Although Gamsakhurdia initially represented his return as a rescue of Georgian forces after the Abkhazian disaster, he actually disarmed part of the Georgian troops retreating from the breakaway region and established his control over the significant part of Samegrelo. Ex-president's advance made Shevardnadze to join the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and appeal for [[Russia]]n military assistance. In mid-October, the addition of [[Russia]]n weapons, supply-line security, and technical assistance turned the tide against Gamsakhurdia. On October 20, around 2,000 Russian troops moved to protect Georgian railroads.

On October 22, 1993, the government forces launched an offensive against pro-Gamsakhurdia rebels led by Colonel Loti Kobalia and, with the help of Russian military, occupied most of [[Samegrelo]] province. The ex-president forces counter-attacked on October 27. Heavy fighting concentrated around the towns of [[Khobi]] and [[Senaki]]. On November 2, following an agreement between [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral E. Baltin, units of the Russian fleet landed in [[Poti]] to consolidate the government control over the key harbor and help establish order in the town. On November 4, 1993, the government forces broke through the defence lines of the Zviadist militias and entered [[Zugdidi]] without fighting on November 6. [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] and his bodyguards escaped to the forests chased by the government forces. He died in late December under controversial circumstances. It was later reported that Gamsakhurdia had shot himself on December 31, in a village [[Jikhashkari]] ([[Samegrelo]] region of Western Georgia). The revolt was crushed and the region was overrun by the pro-governmental paramilitaries. Several Zviadist leaders were arrested in the following years.

== Aftermath ==
The three-year civil war produced a decade of political instability, permanent financial, economic and social crises. The situation began to stabilize in 1995. However, radical "Zviadists" organized several acts of terrorism and sabotage. They were charged for the assassination attempt of President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] on 9 February 1998. A few days later, supporters of former president kidnapped four observers from the [[United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia]] from their compound in [[Zugdidi]] in western Georgia. Some of the hostage takers surrendered, but Gocha Esebua, the leader of the Zviadist team, escaped and was killed in a shootout with police on 31 March.

On October 18, 1998, there was an [[Georgia military mutiny, 1998|attempted revolt]] led by Colonel [[Akaki Eliava]], former ''Zviadist'' officer near [[Kutaisi]], Georgia's second largest city. After the collapse of the mutiny, Eliava and his followers hid in the forests of [[Samegrelo]]. He had produced permanent problems for the government until he was shot by security officers in 2000.

On January 26, 2004, the newly elected President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] officially rehabilitated Gamsakhurdia to resolve the lingering political effects of his overthrow in an effort to "put an end to disunity in our society", as Saakashvili put it. He also released 32 Gamsakhurdia supporters arrested by Shevardnadze's government in 1993–1994 and still remaining in prisons.

The relationship between Georgia and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remained tense and lead to renewed warfare during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].

'''''Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies''''' (also titled '''''Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years''''') is a 1997 [[transdisciplinary]] non-fiction book by [[Jared Diamond]], professor of [[geography]] and [[physiology]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). In 1998, ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|general nonfiction]] and the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize for Best Science Book]]. A documentary based on the book, and produced by the [[National Geographic Society]], was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite web | last = Lovgren

The book attempts to explain why [[Eurasia]]n and [[North Africa]]n civilizations have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian [[hegemony]] is due to any form of Eurasian [[Heritability of IQ|intellectual]], [[morality|moral]], or [[Heritability|inherent genetic]] [[Race and intelligence|superiority]]. Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.

== Synopsis ==

The prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term "[[Cargo cult|cargo]]" for inventions and manufactured goods, "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?" (p.&amp;nbsp;14)

Diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: "People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power." Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, "have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists." (p.&amp;nbsp;15)

The peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technologic and immunologic advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].

=== Title ===

The book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered – superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.

Diamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.

=== Outline of theory ===
Diamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.

The first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted [[agrarian society]]. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.

As early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000–5,000 years ago. Sub-Saharan biological relatives of the horse including [[zebra]]s and [[onager]]s proved untameable; and although [[African elephant]]s can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity;&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt; Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 "candidates") as an instance of the [[Anna Karenina principle]]: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He also makes the intriguing argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 | pages=168–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullock]]s for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.

[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]

Eurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt;

The plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of nonfarming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.

Eurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around (the "trade" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia: endemic malaria and [[yellow fever]] made these regions notorious as the "white man's grave";&lt;ref name="RossMacGregor1903 offightAgainstMalaria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Fight against Malaria: An Industrial Necessity for Our African Colonies |author1=Ross, R. |author2=MacGregor, W. | journal=Journal of the Royal African Society | volume=2 | issue=6 | date=January 1903| pages=149–160 |jstor=714548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[syphilis]] may have originated in the Americas).&lt;ref name="OriginOfSyphilis"&gt;The origin of syphilis is still debated. Some researchers think it was known to [[Hippocrates]]: {{cite web |url = http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article266422.ece |title = English syphilis epidemic pre-dated European outbreaks by 150 years |author = Keys, David |accessdate = 2007-09-22 |publisher = Independent News and Media Limited |year = 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015045621/http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article266422.ece |archivedate = October 15, 2007 |df = mdy-all }} Others think it was brought from the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and his successors: {{cite web | title=Columbus blamed for spread of syphilis | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13186-columbus-blamed-for-spread-of-syphilis-.html | date=January 2008 | publisher=NewScientist.com news service | author=MacKenzie, D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European diseases&amp;nbsp;– the [[Germ (microorganism)|germ]]s of the book's title&amp;nbsp;– decimated indigenous populations so that relatively small numbers of Europeans could maintain their dominance.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt;

Diamond also proposes geographical explanations for why western European societies, rather than other Eurasian powers such as China, have been the dominant colonizers,&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamond1999HowToGetRich"&gt;{{cite web | title=How to get rich | url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond_rich/rich_p1.html | author=Diamond, J. |date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Europe's geography favored [[balkanization]] into smaller, closer, nation-states, bordered by natural barriers of mountains, rivers, and coastline. Threats posed by immediate neighbours ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were outcompeted relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].

=== Agriculture ===
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, [[division of labor]] allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.

The crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and [[pulse (legume)|pulse]] species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].

Also important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' [[domestication|domesticable]] animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.

Due to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the [[zebra]], [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).

Smaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.

=== Geography ===
Diamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.

The dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the [[Fertile Crescent]], until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.

Diamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.

Diamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing [[nation-state]]s. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.

=== Germs ===
In the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)]] and in [[History of South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that the most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers. 

He mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.

=== Success and failure ===
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.

== Intellectual background ==
In the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue durée|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1998GeographyRedux"&gt;{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | publisher = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of "why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?" in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).

== Reception ==
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the 1997 [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_Infoview.aspx?t=&amp;id=57 | title=1997 Phi Beta Kappa Science Book Award | publisher=Phi Beta Kappa | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5DBVfgGvk?url=http://www.geeky.net/images/webbadge.gif | archivedate=January 24, 2006 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, it won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]], in recognition of its powerful synthesis of many disciplines, and the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Rhône-Poulenc Prize]] for Science Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1998 | title=The Pulitzer Prizes for 1998 | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/ | title=Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists | publisher=The [[Royal Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Geographic Society]] produced a documentary of the same title based on the book that was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in July 2005.&lt;ref name=natgeo/&gt;

=== Academic reviews ===
In a review of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' that ultimately commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, "Given the magnitude of the task he has set himself, it is inevitable that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1998GGSreview"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 1998|url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|title = Review:Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|publisher = Institute of Historical Research | accessdate = 2008-03-14 | last=Tom Tomlinson |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historian, professor [[J. R. McNeill]], was on the whole complimentary, but thought Diamond oversold geography as an explanation for history and underemphasized cultural autonomy.&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World According to Jared Diamond |url=http://videosdigitals.uab.cat/cr-vet/www/40300/1_2_McNeil01_ht34_world%20according%20to%20Diamond.pdf |author=McNeill, J.R. |journal=The History Teacher |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=February 2001 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=44 |issue=11 |date=June 26, 1997 |author=Jared Diamond; Reply by William H.

In his last book published in 2000, the anthropologist and geographer [[James Morris Blaut]] criticized ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'', among other reasons, for reviving the theory of [[environmental determinism]], and described Diamond as an example of a modern [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] historian.&lt;ref name="Blaut2000EightEurocentricHistorians"&gt;{{cite book | last = James M.

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] International Relations (IR) scholar [[Stephen Walt]] called the book "an exhilarating read" and put it on a list of the ten books every IR student should read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/09/my-top-ten-books-every-student-of-international-relations-should-read/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225221006/http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/09/my-top-ten-books-every-student-of-international-relations-should-read | archivedate=2014-12-25 | title=My "top ten" books every student of International Relations should read | date=April 9, 2009 | accessdate=2016-01-02 | last=Johnson | first=Matt | website=[[Foreign Policy]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] economist [[J.

John Brätland, an [[Austrian school]] economist of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]], complained in a ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'' article that ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' entirely neglects individual action, concentrating solely on the centralized state; fails to understand how societies form (assessing that societies do not exist or form without a strong government); and ignores various economical institutions, such as monetary exchange that would allow societies to "rationally reckon scarcities and the value of actions required to replace what is depleted through human use". Instead, the author concludes that because there was no sophisticated division of labor, private property rights, and monetary exchange, societies like that on Easter Island could never progress from the nomadic stage to a complex society. Those factors, according to Brätland, are crucial, and at the same time neglected by Diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/22_1_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document |title=An Austrian Reexamination of Recent Thoughts on the Rise and Collapse of Societies |author=John Brätland |date= |website=mises.org |publisher= |access-date=January 9, 2017 |quote=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Jason Antrosio described  ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a form of "academic porn," writing, "Diamond's account makes all the factors of European domination a product of a distant and accidental history" and "has almost no role for human agency–the ability people have to make decisions and influence outcomes. Europeans become inadvertent, accidental conquerors. Natives succumb passively to their fate." He added, "Jared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history. He has tremendously distorted the role of domestication and agriculture in that history. Unfortunately his story-telling abilities are so compelling that he has seduced a generation of college-educated readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livinganthropologically.com/archaeology/guns-germs-and-steel-jared-diamond/|title=''Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond: Against History''|website=''Living Anthropologically''|first=Jason|last=Antrosio|date=July 7, 2011|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques have been made over the author's position on the agricultural revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford-delong.com/2016/06/the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race.html|title=Agriculture the Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race?: Today's Economic History|website=bradford-delong.com|author=J.

'''Henryk Biegeleisen''' (1855–1934) was a [[Polish Jewish]] historian, literary critic, publisher, journalist, and ethnographer specializing in the history of [[Polish literature]] from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century. His greatest accomplishment in the field of publishing included a series of books devoted to [[Romanticism in Poland]]. He prepared annotated editions of works of the [[Three Bards|Polish national bards]]: [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Juliusz Słowacki]], and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]].&lt;ref name="yivoencyclopedia"/&gt;

==Career==
Between 1899 and 1906 Biegeleisen wrote and published a five volume literary study titled An Illustrated History of Polish Literature (''Ilustrowane dzieje literatury polskiej''), which was a rare and valuable compendium and recapitulation of his lifelong research. His other work published between 1927 and 1931 were studies of Polish customs, beliefs and age-old traditions in several volumes titles Mother and Child in the Rites, Beliefs, and Customs of the Polish Folk (''Matka i dziecko w obrzędach, wierzeniach i zwyczajach ludu polskiego''), Medicine of the Polish Folk (''Lecznictwo ludu polskiego''), Weddings (''Wesele''), At the Cradle – Before the Altar – By the Tomb (''U kolebki – przed ołtarzem – nad mogiła''), and Death in the Rites, Customs, and Beliefs of the Polish Folk (''Śmierć w obrzędach, zwyczajach wierzeniach ludu polskiego'').&lt;ref name="yivoencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Biegeleisen_Henryk | title=Biegeleisen, Henryk | publisher=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. | work=Wilhelm Babrasz, Józef Gajek, Stanislaw Łempicki, and Jan Muszkowski, eds., ''Henryk Biegeleisen'', Lwów, 1936.

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of art''' focuses on objects made by humans in visual form for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes. [[Visual art]] [[art#Forms, genres, media and styles|can be classified in diverse ways]], such as separating [[fine art]]s from [[applied arts]]; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[film]], [[photography]], and [[graphic arts]].  In recent years, technological advances have led to [[video]] art, [[Digital art|computer art]], [[Performance art]], [[animation]], [[television]], and [[Video game|videogames]].

The history of art is often told as a chronology of [[masterpiece]]s created during each [[civilization]]. It can thus be framed as a story of [[high culture]], epitomized by the [[Wonders of the World]]. On the other hand, [[vernacular]] art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as [[folk arts]] or [[craft]]. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of [[low culture]], the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining [[visual culture]] or [[material culture]], or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as [[anthropology]] or [[archaeology]]. In the latter cases art objects may be referred to as [[Artifact (archaeology)|archeological artifacts]].

{{Main|Prehistoric art}}

The oldest human art that has been found dates to the [[Stone Age]], when the first creative works were made from shell, stone, and paint. During the Paleolithic (25,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE), humans practiced [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] and lived in [[cave]]s, where [[cave painting]] was developed.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=2}} During the Neolithic period (6000–3000&amp;nbsp;BCE), the production of [[handicrafts]] commenced.

The earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship  existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier. Engraved shells created by [[homo erectus]] dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as ‘art’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html |title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved |journal=[[New Scientist]] |first=Catherine |last=Brahic |date=3 December 2014 |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F07 0054.Ma.JPG|thumb|''[[Bison Licking Insect Bite]]'', in carved [[antler]], Museum of Prehistory, [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]]]]
The [[Paleolithic]] had its first artistic manifestation in 25,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, reaching its peak in the [[Magdalenian]] period (±15,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE). Surviving art from this period includes small carvings in stone or bone and [[cave painting]]. The first traces of human-made objects appeared in southern [[Africa]], the [[Western Mediterranean]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Adriatic Sea]]), [[Siberia]] ([[Baikal Lake]]), India and Australia. These first traces are generally worked stone ([[flint]], [[obsidian]]), wood or [[bone]] tools. To [[painting|paint]] in [[red]], [[iron oxide]] was used.  Cave paintings have been found in the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]]. There are pictures that are [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as pictures that are [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]].  Animals were painted in the caves of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]], [[Trois Frères]], [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]]. [[Sculpture]] is represented by the so-called ''[[Venus figurines]]'', feminine figures which may have been used in [[fertility cult]]s, such as the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]''.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=3-4}} There is a theory that these figures may have been made by women as expressions of their own body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoid|first1=Catherine Hodge|last2=McDermott|first2=Leroy D.|date=1996|title=Toward Decolonizing Gender: Female Vision in the Upper Paleolithic|jstor=682890|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=98|issue=2|pages=319–326|doi=10.1525/aa.1996.98.2.02a00080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other representative works of this period are the ''Man from [[Brno]]''&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A World History of Art|author1=Honour, H.|author2=Fleming, J.|date=2005|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=9781856694513|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT38|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Venus of Brassempouy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Honour-Fleming (2002), p. 36-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesolithic===
{{Hatnote|Main article: [[Mesolithic]]}}

In Old World archaeology, Mesolithic ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: μέσος, ''mesos'' "middle"; λίθος, ''lithos'' "stone") is the period between
the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside [[northern Europe]], and for the corresponding period in [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]].
The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia.
It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and West Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&amp;nbsp;BP, in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&amp;nbsp;BP.
The term is less used of areas further east, and not all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.

The Neolithic period began in about 8,000 BCE. The [[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]]—dated between the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras—contained small, schematic paintings of human figures, with notable examples in [[Roca dels Moros|El Cogul]], Valltorta, [[Alpera]] and Minateda.

Neolithic painting is similar to paintings found in northern Africa ([[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. Neolithic painting is often schematic, made with basic strokes (men in the form of a [[cross]] and women in a [[triangle|triangular]] shape). There are also cave paintings in [[Pinturas River]] in [[Argentina]], especially the [[Cueva de las Manos]]. In [[portable art]], a style called [[Cardium Pottery]] was produced, decorated with imprints of [[seashell]]s. New materials were used in art, such as [[amber]], [[crystal]], and [[jasper]]. In this period, the first traces of urban planning appeared, such as the remains in [[Jericho#Tell es-Sultan|Tell as-Sultan]] ([[Jericho]]), [[Jarmo]] (Iraq) and [[Çatalhöyük]] ([[Anatolia]]).{{sfn|Onians|2004|p=20-25}} In South-Eastern Europe appeared many cultures, such as the [[Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]] and the [[Hamangia culture]], from [[Romania]], [[Republic of Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]. Another region with many cultures is China most notable being the [[Yangshao culture]] and the [[Longshan culture]].

===Metal Age===

The last prehistoric phase is the Metal Age (or [[Three-age system]]), during which the use of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] transformed ancient societies. When humans could smelt metal and forge metal implements could make new tools, weapons, and art.

In the [[Chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) [[megalith]]s emerged. Examples include the [[dolmen]] and [[menhir]] and the [[England|English]] [[wikt:cromlech|cromlech]], as can be seen in the complexes at [[Newgrange]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=12}} In Spain the [[Los Millares]] culture was formed which was characterized by the [[Beaker culture]]. In [[Malta]], the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|temple complexes]] of [[Ħaġar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]], [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien]] and [[Ġgantija]] were built. In the [[Balearic Islands]] notable megalithic cultures developed, with different types of monuments: the ''[[naveta]]'', a tomb shaped like a truncated [[pyramid]], with an elongated burial chamber; the ''[[taula]]'', two large stones, one put vertically and the other horizontally above each other; and the ''[[talaiot]]'', a tower with a covered chamber and a false [[dome]].&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iron Age]] the cultures of [[Hallstatt]] (Austria) and [[La Tene]] ([[Switzerland]]) emerged in Europe. The first was developed between the 7th and 5th century BCE by the [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] with tumular tombs and a wooden burial chamber in the form of a house, often accompanied by a four-wheeled cart. The pottery was [[Polychrome|polychromic]], with [[geometry|geometric]] decorations and applications of metallic ornaments. La Tene was developed between the 5th and 4th century BCE, and is more popularly known as early [[Celtic art]]. It produced many iron objects such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s, which have not survived well to the 2000s due to rust.

The [[Bronze Age]] refers to the period when bronze was the best material available.  Bronze was used for highly decorated [[shield]]s, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], and other objects, with different stages of evolution of the style. Decoration was influenced by [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Scythian art]].{{sfn|Onians|2004|p=30-31}}

In the first period of recorded history, art coincided with [[writing]]. The great civilizations of the [[Near East]]: [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] arose. Globally, during this period the first great cities appeared near major rivers: the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], [[Indus]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] Rivers.

One of the great advances of this period was writing, which was developed from the tradition of communication using pictures. The first form of writing were the [[Jiahu symbols]] from neolithic China, but the first true writing was [[cuneiform script]], which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500&amp;nbsp;BCE, written on [[clay]] tablets. It was based on [[Pictogram|pictographic]] and [[Ideogram|ideographic]] elements, while later Sumerians developed [[syllable]]s for writing, reflecting the [[phonology]] and [[syntax]] of the [[Sumerian language]]. In Egypt [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] was developed using pictures as well, appearing on art such as the [[Narmer Palette]] (3,100&amp;nbsp;BCE). The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sculpted seals with short texts and decorated with representations of animals and people. Meanwhile, the [[Olmecs]] sculpted [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] and decorated other sculptures with [[Olmecs#Writing|their own hierglyphs]].

[[Mesopotamian art]] was developed in the area between [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers in modern day Syria and Iraq, where since the 4th millennium BCE many different cultures existed such as [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Amorite]] and [[Chaldea]]. [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian architecture]] was characterized by the use of [[brick]]s, [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and [[cone mosaic]]. Notable are the [[ziggurat]]s, large [[temple]]s in the form of [[step pyramid]]s. The tomb was a chamber covered with a false [[dome]], as in some examples found at [[Ur]]. There were also [[palace]]s walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, where gardens were an important feature. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

[[Relief]] sculpture was developed in [[wood carving|wood]] and [[stone]]. Sculpture depicted religious, military, and hunting scenes, including both human and animal figures. In the [[Sumer]]ian period, small statues of people were produced. These statues had an angular form and were produced from colored stone. The figures typically had bald head with hands folded on the chest. In the Akkadian period, statues depicted figures with long hair and beards, such as the [[stele]] of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian), statues represented kings from [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], with their mantle and a turban on their heads and their hands on their chests. During Babylonian rule, the stele of [[Hammurabi]] was important, as it depicted the great king Hammurabi above a written copy of the laws that he introduced. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its [[anthropomorphism]] of cattle and the [[winged genie]], which is depicted flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, such as in the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III|Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]].&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 36–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]] is perhaps the most iconic object to suvive from ancient Egypt]]
One of the first great civilizations arose in [[Egypt]], which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the [[pharaoh]], including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes [[Coptic art|Coptic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] art.

The [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid [[column]]s. Funerary monuments included [[mastaba]], tombs of rectangular form; [[pyramid]]s, which included step pyramids ([[Saqqarah]]) or smooth-sided pyramids ([[Giza]]); and the [[hypogeum]], underground tombs ([[Valley of the Kings]]). Other great buildings were the [[temple]], which tended to be monumental complexes preceded by an avenue of [[sphinx]]es and [[obelisk]]s. Temples used [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and [[trapezoid]] walls with [[hypaethros]] and [[hypostyle]] halls and [[shrine]]s. The temples of [[Karnak]], [[Luxor]], [[Philae]] and [[Edfu]] are good examples. Another type of temple is the [[rock temple]], in the form of a [[hypogeum]], found in [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].

Painting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side. Egyptians painted the outline of the head and limbs in profile, while the torso, hands, and eyes were painted from the front. [[Applied arts]] were developed in Egypt, in particular [[Cabinet making|woodwork]] and [[Goldsmith|metalwork]]. There are superb examples such as [[cedrus|cedar]] furniture [[Inlay|inlaid]] with [[ebony]] and [[ivory]] which can be seen in the tombs at the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Other examples include the pieces found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, which are of great artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered long after the contemporary civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] or Harappan civilization (circa 2400–1900 BC) is now recognized as extraordinaly advansed, comparable in many ways with those cultures.

Various sculptures, seals, bronze vessels [[Indian Pottery|pottery]], gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in [[terracotta]], bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC|first=Jane|last=McIntosh|page=248|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] reacted with surprise when he saw the famous Indus bronze statuette of a slender-limbed [[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|dancing girl]] in Mohenjo-daro:

{{quote|When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric; they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art, and culture. Modeling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the Hellenistic age of Greece, and I thought, therefore, that some mistake must surely have been made; that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years older than those to which they properly belonged&amp;nbsp;.... Now, in these statuettes, it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling; that makes us wonder whether, in this all-important matter, Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India discovered|page=172|publisher=Collins|author=John Keay|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seals have been found at [[Mohenjo-daro]] depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose (see image, the so-called ''Pashupati'', below).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This figure, sometimes known as a [[Pashupati seal|Pashupati]], has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Sir John.

[[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artists built on the artistic foundations of Egypt, further developing the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, and ceramics. Greek art started as smaller and simpler than Egyptian art, and the influence of Egyptian art on the Greeks started in the Cycladic islands between 3300–3200 BCE. [[Cycladic art|Cycladic]] statues were simple, lacking facial features except for the nose.

Greek art eventually included life-sized statues, such as [[Kouros]] figures. The standing Kouros of Attica is typical of early Greek sculpture and dates from 600 BCE. From this early stage, the art of Greece moved into the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]]. Sculpture from this time period includes the characteristic [[Archaic smile]]. This distinctive smile may have conveyed that the subject of the sculpture had been alive or that the subject had been blessed by the gods and was well.

Phoenician art lacks unique characteristics that might distinguish it from its contemporaries. This is due to its being highly influenced by foreign artistic cultures: primarily [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece and [[Assyria]]. Phoenicians who were taught on the banks of the [[Nile]] and the [[Euphrates]] gained a wide artistic experience and finally came to create their own art, which was an amalgam of foreign models and perspectives. Even so, Phoenician influenced other styles, inclusive [[Iberian sculpture]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/01/05/81740354.pdf|title=Phoenician Art|format=PDF|work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=1879-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on January 5, 1879, Phoenician art was described by the following:

{{bquote|He entered into other men's labors and made most of his heritage. The [[Sphinx]] of Egypt became [[Asian people|Asiatic]], and its new form was transplanted to [[Nineveh]] on the one side and to Greece on the other. The rosettes and other patterns of the [[Babylonia]]n cylinders were introduced into the handiwork of Phoenicia, and so passed on to the West, while the hero of the ancient [[Chaldea]]n epic became first the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] [[Melkart]]h, and then the [[Herakles]] of Hellas.}}

[[Etruscan art]] was produced by the [[Etruscan civilization]] in [[central Italy]] between the 9th and 2nd centuries BCE. From around 600 BCE it was heavily influenced by [[Greek art]], which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics.  Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] or temples), wall-painting and [[metalworking]] especially in bronze. Jewellery and [[engraved gem]]s of high quality were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |last=Boardman |first=John |author-link=John Boardman (art historian) |title=The Oxford History of Classical Art |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1993 |pages=350–351 |isbn=0198143869 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pcDpAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.

The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with [[sarcophagi]] and [[grave goods]], and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples.  Tombs have produced all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.

[[Dacian art]] is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or ''North [[Thracians]]''; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of [[Scythians]] and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in flolral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}} Today, a big collection of Dacic masterpieces is in the [[National Museum of Romanian History]] ([[Bucharest]]), one of the most famous being the [[Helmet of Coțofenești]].

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}

Pre-Roman Iberian art refers to the styles developed by the [[Iberians]] from the [[Bronze age]] up to the [[Roman conquest of Hispania|Roman conquest]].  For this reason it is sometimes described as "Iberian art".

Almost all extant works of Iberian sculpture visibly reflect [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phoenicia]]n influences, and [[Assyria]]n, [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Egypt]]ian influences from which those derived; yet they have their own unique character. Within this complex stylistic heritage, individual works can be placed within a spectrum of influences- some of more obvious Phoenician derivation, and some so similar to Greek works that they could have been directly imported from that region. Overall the degree of influence is correlated to the work's region of origin, and hence they are classified into groups on that basis.

=== Hittite ===
{{main|Hittite art}}
[[File:IvrizRelief.JPG|thumb|left|The ''[[İvriz relief]]'', king [[Warpalawas]] (right) before the god [[Tarhunzas]]]]
Hittite art was produced by the [[Hittites|Hittite civilization]] in ancient [[Anatolia]], in modern-day [[Turkey]], and also stretching into [[Syria]] during the second millennium BCE from the nineteenth century up until the twelfth century BCE. This period falls under the Anatolian [[Bronze Age]]. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. &lt;blockquote&gt;“Owing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating the units to form more complex compositions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sculpture and Sculptors of Yazılıkaya|last=Alexander|first=Robert L.|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Newark|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of [[Hittite mythology and religion|Hittite deities and ritual practices]]. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like [[Alaca Höyük]], or the Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]] near modern-day [[Boğazkale]]. Scholars do have difficulty dating a large portion of Hittite art, citing the fact that there is a lack of inscription and much of the found material, especially from burial sites, was moved from their original locations and distributed among museums during the nineteenth century.

The Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex is the modern archaeological designation for a [[Bronze Age]] [[civilization]] of [[Central Asia]], dated to c. 2300–1700 BCE, located in present-day northern [[Afghanistan]], eastern [[Turkmenistan]], southern [[Uzbekistan]] and western [[Tajikistan]], centred on the upper [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus River). Its sites were discovered and named by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archaeologist [[Viktor Sarianidi]] (1976).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

BMAC materials have been found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], on the [[Iranian Plateau]], and in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="LambergKarlovskyArchaeology"&gt;C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, "Archaeology and Language: The Indo-Iranians", ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 43, no. 1 (Feb.  2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a [[Harappa]]n seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe.{{sfn|Kohl|2007|pp=196–199}} The relationship between Altyn-Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two [[Harappa]]n seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of [[Shortugai]] in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] probably served as a trading station.&lt;ref name="MassonThe"&gt;V. M. Masson, "The Bronze Age in Khorasan and Transoxiana," chapter 10 in A.H. Dani and Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson (eds.), ''History of civilizations of Central Asia'', volume 1: ''The dawn of civilization: earliest times to 700 BCE'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous type of Bactrian artworks are the "Bactrian pricesses". Wearing large stylized dresses with puffed sleeves, as well as headdresses that merge with the hair, they embody the ranking goddess, character of the central Asian mythology that plays a regulatory role, pacifying the untamed forces.

=== Celtic ===

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as [[Celts]]; those who spoke the [[Celtic languages]] in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period. It also refers to the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BCE onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the [[La Tène]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BCE) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation &amp; that their article will only cover the La Tène period.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent "Late Celtic art" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and "Late Celtic art" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.

Achaemenid art includes [[frieze]] reliefs, metalwork, decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. Most survivals of court art are monumental sculpture, above all the [[relief]]s, double animal-headed [[Persian column]] capitals and other sculptures of [[Persepolis]] (see below for the few but impressive Achaemenid rock reliefs).&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"&gt;Cotterell, 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Lipiński, Karel van Lerberghe, Antoon Schoors|author2=Karel Van Lerberghe|author3=Antoon Schoors| title = Immigration and emigration within the ancient Near East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thIxCmwfNoMC| year = 1995| publisher = Peeters Publishers| isbn = 978-90-6831-727-5| page = 119 }}; Cotterell, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of earlier sites.

[[Roman art]] is sometimes viewed as derived from Greek precedents, but also has its own distinguishing features. Roman sculpture is often less idealized than the Greek precedents, being very realistic. Roman architecture often used [[concrete]], and features such as the round [[arch]] and [[dome]] were invented.

Roman artwork was influenced by the nation-state's interaction with other people's, such as ancient [[Judea]]. A major monument is the Arch of Titus, which was erected by the Emperor Titus. Scenes of Romans looting the Jewish temple in Jerusalem are depicted in low-relief sculptures around the arch's perimeter.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]] was not a luxury product, but a vast production of "fine wares" in ''[[terra sigillata]]'' were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. [[Roman coins]] were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.

===Medieval===
{{main|Medieval art}}
With the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Medieval art|Medieval era]] began, lasting for a millennium. [[Early Christian art]] begins the period, followed by [[Byzantine art]], [[Anglo-Saxon art]], [[Viking art]], [[Ottonian art]], [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]], with [[Islamic art]] dominating the eastern Mediterranean.

In Byzantine and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] art of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church resulted in a large amount of religious art.  There was extensive use of gold in paintings, which presented figures in simplified forms.

Anglo-Saxon art covers art produced within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period of English history, beginning with the [[Migration period art|Migration period]] style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the [[Norman Conquest]] of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe.  The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions.  By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.  The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in [[Northumbria]], especially in the early period, and [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] near the south coast.

====Ottonian art====
{{main|Ottonian art}}
[[File:Kreuzmitdengroßen Senkschmelzen.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The ''[[Essen cross with large enamels]]''; part of the [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]]]]
Ottonian art is a [[style (visual arts)|style]] in [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-romanesque]] [[German art]], covering also some works from the [[Low Countries]], northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian [[Hubert Janitschek]] after the [[Ottonian dynasty]] which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], [[Otto I]], [[Otto II]], [[Otto III]] and [[Emperor Henry II|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arthistorians.info/janitschekh |title=Dictionary of Art Historians: Janitschek, Hubert |access-date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ottonian architecture]], it is a key component of the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] (circa 951–1024).  However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.  It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic "style label" of its own.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524"&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.

====Viking art====
{{main|Viking art}}
Viking art, also known commonly as Norse art, is a term widely accepted for the [[art]] of [[Scandinavia]]n [[Norsemen]] and [[Vikings|Viking]] settlements further afield—particularly in the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]]—during the [[Viking Age]] of the 8th-11th centuries CE. Viking art has many design elements in common with [[Celtic Art|Celtic]], [[Migration Period art|Germanic]], the later [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and Eastern European art, sharing many influences with each of these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;*Maurizio Tani, ''Le origini mediterranee ed eurasiatiche dell’arte vichinga.

{{main|Culture of ancient Rus}}
Slavic architecure is a mix of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and Pagan architecture. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Most iconic buildings are the [[Russian architecture|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian culture#Architecture|Ukrainian]] cathedrals. These cathedrals are well known for their unsusual [[onion domes]], which are decorated with geometric and colorful patterns. It is not completely clear when and why onion domes became a typical feature of [[Russian architecture]]. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Russian architecture used the dome shape not only for churches but also for other buildings.

[[South Slavs|South Slavic]] art was highly influenced by Byzantine art and architecture, more than the [[East Slavs]]. They were also influenced by Greek culture, but not really much.

The use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.

===Renaissance and Baroque===
{{Main|Renaissance art|Baroque art}}

The [[Renaissance]] is the return to a valuation of the material world, and this paradigm shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of [[landscape]]s. Art historians often [[Art periods|periodize]] Renaissance art by century, especially with [[Italian art]]. [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] is traditionally referred to by centuries: [[trecento]] for the fourteenth century, [[quattrocento]] for the fifteenth, [[cinquecento]] for the sixteenth, and [[seicento]] for the seventeenth.

===Neoclassicalism to Realism===

===Pre-Islamic Arabia===

The art of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] is related to that of neighbouring cultures. Pre-Islamic [[Yemen]] produced stylized [[alabaster]] heads of great aesthetic and historic charm.  Most of the pre-Islamic sculptures are made of [[alabaster]].

[[Archaeology]] has revealed some early settled civilizations in [[Saudi Arabia]]: the [[Dilmun]] civilization on the east of the Arabian Peninsula, [[Thamud]] north of the [[Hejaz]], and [[Kindah]] kingdom and [[Al-Magar]] civilization in the central of Arabian Peninsula.
The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, the role of [[South Arabia]]n societies such as Saba ([[Sheba]]) in the production and trade of aromatics not only brought such kigdoms wealth but also tied the [[Arabian peninsula]] into trade networks, resulting in far-ranging artistic influences.

It seems probable that before around 4000 BCE the Arabian climate was somewhat wetter that today, benefitting from a monsoon system that has since moved south.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} During the late fourth millennium BCE permanent settlements began to appear, and inhabitants adjusted to the emerging dryer conditions. In south-west Arabia (modern [[Yemen]]) a moister climate supported several kingdoms during the second and first millennia BCE. The most famos of these is [[Sheba]], the kingdom of the biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]. These societies used a combination of trade in spices and the natural resources of the region, including aromatics such as frankincense and myrrh, to build wealthy kingdoms. [[Ma'rib#Ancient|Mārib]], the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]] capital, was well positioned to tap into Mediterranean as well as Near Eastern trade, and in kingdoms to the east, in what is today [[Oman]], trading links with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]] and even India were possible. The area was never a part of the [[Assyria]]n or [[Persian empire]]s, and even [[Babylon]]ian control of north-west Arabia seems to have been relatively short-lived. Later Roman attempts to control the region's lucrative trade foundered. This impenetrability to foreign armies doubtless augmented ancient rulers' bargaining power in the spice and incense trade.

Although subject to external  influences, south Arabia retained characteristics particular to itself. The human figure is typically based on strong, square shapes, the fine modeling of detail contrastingwith a stylized simplicity of form.

Some branches of Islam [[Aniconism in Islam|forbid depictions of people]] and other sentient beings, as they may be misused as idols. Religious ideas are thus often represented through geometric designs and [[calligraphy]]. However, there are many Islamic paintings which display religious themes and scenes of stories common among the three Abrahamic [[monotheistic]] faiths of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]].

The influence of [[Chinese ceramics]] has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on [[Islamic art]]s in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2012/chinese-ceramics-on-great-hall-balcony |first=Denise Patry |last=Leidy |title=Evolution of Chinese Ceramics and Their Global Influence are Theme of Entirely New Installation on Metropolitan Museum's Great Hall Balcony |work=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |date=14 September 2012 |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[İznik pottery]] (named after [[İznik]], a city from [[Turkey]]) is one of the best well-known types of Islamic pottery.

The art of the Eskimo people from Siberia is in the same style as the [[Inuit art]] from [[Alaska]] and north Canada. This is because the Native Americans traveled through Siberia to Alaska, and later to the rest of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Including the [[Russian Far East]], the population of [[Siberia]] numbers just above 40 million people. As a result of the 17th-to-19th-century [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] and the subsequent [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|population movements during the Soviet era]], the [[demographics of Siberia]] today is dominated by native speakers of [[Russian language|Russian]].

At a height of {{cvt|11|in|cm|0|order=flip}}, it is one of the largest jade objects ever found in Mesoamerica, [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
The history of art in the Americas begins in [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] times with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous cultures]]. Art historians have focused particularly closely on [[Mesoamerica]] during this early era, because a series of stratified cultures arose there that erected grand architecture and produced [[Mesoamerica#Political and religious art|objects of fine workmanship]] that are comparable to the arts of Western Europe.

===Preclassic===
The art-making tradition of Mesoamerican people begins with the [[Olmec#Art|Olmec]] around 1400&amp;nbsp;BCE, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic era]]. These people are best known for making [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] but also carved [[jade]], erected monumental architecture, made small-scale sculpture, and designed mosaic floors. Two of the most well-studied sites artistically are [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] and [[La Venta]]. After the Olmec culture declined, the [[Maya civilization]] became prominent in the region. Sometimes a transitional [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] period is described, which is a hybrid of Olmec and Maya. A particularly well-studied Epi-Olmec site is [[La Mojarra]], which includes hieroglyphic carvings that have been partially deciphered.

===Classic===
[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] mosaic mask that represents a Bat god, made of 25 pieces of jade, with yellow eyes made of shell. It was found in a tomb at [[Monte Alban]]]]
By the late pre-Classic era, beginning around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE, the Olmec culture had declined but both Central Mexican and Maya peoples were thriving. Throughout much of the Classic period in Central Mexico, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was thriving, as were [[Xochicalco]] and [[El Tajin]]. These sites boasted grand sculpture and architecture. Other Central Mexican peoples included the [[Mixtec#Language, codices, and artwork|Mixtecs]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and people in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]]. [[Maya art]] was at its height during the “Classic” period—a name that mirrors that of [[Classical antiquity|Classical European antiquity]]—and which began around 200 CE. Major Maya sites from this era include [[Copan]], where numerous stelae were carved, and [[Quirigua]] where the largest stelae of Mesoamerica are located along with [[zoomorphic]] altars. A complex [[writing system]] was developed, and [[Maya codices|Maya illuminated manuscripts]] were produced in large numbers on paper made from [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]]. Many sites [[Maya collapse|”collapsed”]] around 1000 CE.

===Postclassic===
At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maya were still powerful, but many communities were paying tribute to [[Aztec society]]. The latter culture was thriving, and it included [[Aztec#Arts|arts]] such as sculpture, painting, and feather mosaics. Perhaps the most well-known work of Aztec art is the [[Aztec sun stone|calendar stone]], which became a national symbol of the state of [[Mexico]]. During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], many of these artistic objects were sent to Europe, where they were placed in [[cabinets of curiosities]], and later redistributed to Western art museums. The Aztec empire was based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was largely destroyed during the colonial era. What remains of it was buried beneath [[Mexico City]]. A few buildings, such as the foundation of the [[Templo Mayor]] have since been unearthed by archaeologists, but they are in poor condition.

===Art in the Americas===
Art in the Americas since the conquest is characterized by a mixture of indigenous and foreign traditions, including those of European, African, and Asian settlers. Numerous indigenous traditions thrived after the conquest. For example, the [[Plains Indians]] created [[quillwork]], [[beadwork]], [[winter count]]s, [[ledger art]], and [[tipi]]s in the pre-reservation era, and afterwards became assimilated into the world of Modern and Contemporary art through institutions such as the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] which encouraged students to develop a unique Native American style. Many paintings from that school, now called the Studio Style, were exhibited at the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] during its Indian annual held from 1946 to 1979.

Arising from the humblest beginnings as a nomadic group of "uncivilizated" wanderers, the Aztecs created the largets empire in Mesoamerican history, lasting from 1427/1428 to 1521. Tribute from conquered states provided the economic and artistic resources to tranform their capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (0ld [[Mexico City]]) into one of the wonders of the world. Artists from throught mesoamerica creted stunning artworks for their new maters, fashioning delicate golden objects of personal adornment and formidable sculptures of firece gods.

The Aztecs entered the Valley of Mexico (the area of modern [[Mexico City]]) in 1325 and within a centry had taken control of this lush  region brimming with powerful city-states.

Ancient Maya art refers to the material arts of the [[Maya civilization]], an eastern and south-eastern [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that took shape in the course of the later [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic Period]] (500 BCE to 200 CE). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.

Long considered a backwater of culture and aesthetic expression, Central America's dynamic societies are now recognized as robust and innovative contribuitors to the arts of ancient Americas. The people of pre-Columbian Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama developed their own distinctive styles in spite of the region being a crossroads for millennia. Its peoples were not subsumed by outside influences but instead created, adopted and adapted al manner of ideas and technologies to suit their needs and temperaments. The region's isiosyncratic cultural traditions, religious beliefs and sociopolitical systems are reflected in unique artworks. A fundamental spiritual tenet was shamanism, the central principle of which decreedthat in a trance state, transformed into one's spirit companion form, a person could enter the supranatural realm and garner special power to affect worldly affairs. Central American artists devised ingenious ways to portray this transformation by merging into one figure human and animal characteristics; the [[jaguar]], [[Snake|serpent]] and avian raport (falcon, eagle or vulture) were the main spirit forms.

[[Gold]] — the perpetually brilliant metal of status, wealth and power — inspired the Spanish to explore the globe and was an essential accoutrement of prestige, authority and religious ideology among the people of Central America and Colombia.

In Colombia, gold was important for it's relationship to thedivine force of the sun. It was part of a complex ideology of universal binary oppositions: male-female, light-dark, the earth and spirit worlds. Gold body adornments were cast in complex forms, their iconography communicating social, political and spiritual potency through portrayals of powerful shaman-rulers, lineage totems and supranatural protector spirits.

The tropical climate of the Caraibbean islands and the Amazonian rainforest is not favorable to the preservation of artefacts made from wood and other materials. What survived reveals complex societies whose people created art rich in mythological and spiritual meaning.

The [[Taino people]], who occupied the Caraibbean islands when the Spanish arrived, were agriculturalists whose society was centred on hereditary chiefs called ''[[cacique]]s''. Their towns included impressively constructed ceremonial plazas in which ball games were played and religious rituals carried on, linking their culture to that of the Maya from the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Much of Taino art was associated with shamanic rituals and religion, including a ritual in which a shaman or a ''cacique'' enters into a hypnotic state by inhaling the hallucinogetic ''[[cohoba]]'' powder. Sculptures representing the creator god Yocahu often depict a nude male figure in a squatting position with a slightly concave dish on top of his head, to hold the ''cohoba'' powder. Other figures (always male) stand rigidly frontal, the ostentatious display of their genitals apparently to the importance of fertility. The prupose of these rituals was communication with the ancestors and the spirit world. Chiefs and shamans (often the same person) sometimes interceded with spirit beings from a sculpted stool, or ''duho''.

Meanwhile, the [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Marajó|Marajó island]] at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]], in Brazil. Archeologists have found sophisticated [[pottery]] in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Marajó. Evidence of [[mound building]] further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grann|first=David|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|page=315|year=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery that they made is decorated with abastract lines and spirals, suggesting that they probably consumed hallucinogetic plants. The Marajoara culture produced many kinds of vessels including urns, jars, bottles, cups, bowls, plates and dishes.

Inuit art refers to [[Work of art|artwork]] produced by [[Inuit]] people, that is, the people of the Arctic previously known as [[Eskimo]]s, a term that is now often considered offensive outside [[Alaska]]. Historically, their preferred medium was [[walrus ivory]], but since the establishment of southern markets for Inuit art in 1945, [[Printmaking|prints]] and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as [[soapstone]], [[serpentinite]], or [[argillite]] have also become popular. The range of colors is cold, most encountered being: black, brown, grays, white and gray-blue.

The [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]] claims to have the largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[ https://www.wag.ca/about/facts/history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Museum of Inuit Art]] opened in [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miagallery.ca Museum of Inuit Art]&lt;/ref&gt; but closed due to lack of resources in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canadian-museum-of-inuit-art-closing-1.3541737 'Small but mighty' Canadian Museum of Inuit Art closing its doors]&lt;/ref&gt; Carvings Nunavut, owned by Inuk Lori Idlout, opened in 2008 and has grown to have the largest private collection in Nunavut.

{{main|Eastern art history}}[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' by [[Hokusai]]]]
[[Eastern world|Eastern civilization]] broadly includes Asia, and it also includes a complex tradition of art making. One approach to [[Eastern art history]] divides the field by nation, with foci on [[Indian art]], [[Chinese art]], and [[Japanese art]]. Due to the size of the continent, the distinction between Eastern Asia and Southern Asia in the context of arts can be clearly seen. In most of Asia, pottery was a prevalent form of art. The pottery is often decorated with geometric patterns or abstract representations of animals, people or plants. Another very widespread form of art was, and is, sculpture.

=== Central Asia ===

Superb samples of [[Steppes art]] – mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse – are found over vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.

Among the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured – among many other important objects – the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay.  Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.

The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] made anthropomorphic figures. Most famous are the ''[[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|Dancing Girl]]'' and the ''[[Priest-King (figure)|Priest-King]]''. This civilisation made also many [[clay]] pots, most of them decorated with geometric patterns. They made seals decorated with animals, anthropomorphic figures and [[indus script|their script]]. The Indus script (also known as the Harappan script) is a corpus of symbols produced by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] during the [[Kot Diji]] and [[Mature Harappan]] periods between 3500 and 1900 BCE. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, making it difficult to judge whether or not  these symbols constituted a [[Writing system|script]] used to record a language, or even symbolise a [[writing system]].&lt;ref name="Locklear"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Mallory |last1=Locklear |quote="After a century of failing to crack an ancient script, linguists turn to machines." |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14371450/indus-valley-civilization-ancient-seals-symbols-language-algorithms-ai |title=Science: Machine learning could finally crack the 4,000-year-old Indus script |work=[[The Verge]] |location=Manhattan, New York |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of many attempts,&lt;ref&gt;(Possehl, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; the "script" has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing. There is no known [[bilingual inscription]] to help decipher the script, nor does the script show any significant changes over time.  However, some of the syntax (if that is what it may be termed) varies depending upon location.&lt;ref name="Locklear"/&gt;

Early [[Buddhists]] in India developed symbols related to [[Buddha]]. Bhutanese painted "[[thangkas]]" that shows Buddhist iconography. The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives from some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world.  Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 26–47, 105–117&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mathura]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59–70&lt;/ref&gt;  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.

=== Nepalese, Bhutanese &amp; Tibetan ===
{{Main|Nepalese art|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}

For more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, with the main forms being [[thangka]], [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] paintings on cloth, [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, [[stucco]] or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown.

The art of Tibet may be studied in terms of influences which have contributed to it over the centuries, from other [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[Newa art|Nepalese]], [[Indian art|Indian]], and [[sacred art|sacred]] styles. Many bronzes in Tibet that suggest [[Pala Empire|Pala]] influence, are thought to have been either crafted by Indian sculptors or brought from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://himalayanbuddhistart.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/pala-india-maitreya-standing/ |title=Pala India, Maitreya – standing |date=October 16, 2016 |access-date=29 September 2018 |work=Himalayanbuddhistart |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhutanese art]] is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings. The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

In Eastern Asia, painting was derived from the practice of calligraphy, and portraits and landscapes were painted on silk cloth. Most of the paintings represent landscapes or portraits. The  most spectacular sculptures are the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual bronzes]] and the bronze sculptures from [[Sanxingdui]]. A very well-known example of Chinese art is the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.

Chinese art is one of the oldest continuous traditional arts in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].

[[Japanese art]] covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[Jōmon Pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]—modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics—along with a myriad of other types. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BCE, to the present.

The first settlers of Japan, the [[Jōmon]] people (c. 11,000–300 BCE). They crafted [[Jomon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dogū]]''. Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.

[[Korean art]]s include traditions in &lt;!--(alphabetical:)--&gt;calligraphy, music, painting and pottery, often marked by the use of natural forms, surface decoration and bold colors or sounds.

The earliest examples of Korean art consist of [[stone age]] works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of [[votive offering|votive sculptures]] and more recently, [[petroglyph]]s, which were rediscovered.

This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. Korean artists sometimes modified [[Chinese art|Chinese traditions]] with a native preference for simple elegance, spontaneity, and an appreciation for purity of nature.

The [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392) was one of the most prolific periods for a wide range of disciplines, especially pottery.

The Korean art market is concentrated in the [[Insadong]] district of [[Seoul]] where over 50 small galleries exhibit and occasional fine arts auctions. Galleries are cooperatively run, small and often with curated and finely designed exhibits. In every town there are smaller regional galleries, with local artists showing in traditional and contemporary media. Art galleries usually have a mix of media. Attempts at bringing Western conceptual art into the foreground have usually had their best success outside of Korea in New York, San Francisco, London and Paris.

Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

With the millennium of [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BCE, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century CE.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.

By the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.

Traditional Thai art is primarily composed of [[Buddhist art]] and scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai [[sculpture]] almost exclusively depicts [[Buddha image|images of the Buddha]], being very similar with the other styles from [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Traditional Thai [[painting]]s usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as [[palace]]s and [[temple]]s. Over time, thai art was influenced by the other Asian styles, most by [[Indian art|Indian]] and [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.

The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the Khmer art of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), especially in the area around [[Angkor]] and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of [[Angkor Wat]], initially [[Hindu]] and subsequently [[Buddhist]]. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include [[textiles]], non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making.

Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.

Indonesia also has experienced a long [[History of Indonesia|history]], with each period leaves a distinctive arts. From [[Prehistoric Indonesia|prehistoric]] cave paintings and [[megalithic]] ancestral statues of Central Sulawesi, tribal wooden carving traditions of [[Toraja]] and [[Asmat people]], graceful Hindu-Buddhist art of classical Javanese civilization which produced [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], vivid [[Balinese Painting|Balinese paintings]] and [[Balinese dance|performing arts]], [[Islamic art]]s of [[Aceh]], to contemporary arts of modern Indonesian artists. Both Indonesian diversity and history add to complexity on defining and identifying what is Indonesian art.

Most famous Indonesian artworks are the puppets for [[Wayang]], is a form of [[puppet theatre]] art &lt;span lang="ur" dir="rtl"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt; in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia,&lt;ref name=brandon143/&gt; wherein a dramatic story is told through shadows thrown by puppets and sometimes combined with human characters.

African art includes both [[African sculpture|sculpture]], typified by the brass castings of the [[Benin art|Benin people]], as well as [[African folk art|folk art]]. Concurrent with the European Middle Ages, in the eleventh century CE a nation that made grand architecture, gold sculpture, and intricate jewelry was founded in [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Impressive sculpture was concurrently being cast from brass by the [[Yoruba art|Yoruba people]] of what is now Nigeria. Such a culture grew and was ultimately transformed to become the [[Benin art|Benin Kingdom]], where elegant altar tusks, brass heads, plaques of brass, and palatial architecture was created. The Benin Kingdom was ended by the British in 1897, and little of the culture's art now remains in Nigeria. Today, the most significant arts venue in Africa is the [[Johannesburg Biennale]].

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by a high density of cultures. Notable are the, [[Edo people|Edo]], [[yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] people anthe [[Nok civilization]] from Nigeria; [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] and [[Luba people]] from Central Africa; [[Ashanti people]] from Ghana; [[Zulu people]] from [[Southern Africa]]; and [[Fang people]] from [[Equatorial Guinea]] (85%), Cameroon and Gabon; the [[Sao civilization]] people from Chad; [[Kwele people]] from eastern Gabon, [[Republic of the Congo]] and Cameroon.

The Art of Oceania includes the geographic areas of [[Micronesia]], [[Polynesia]], Australia, New Zealand, and [[Melanesia]]. One approach treats the area thematically, with foci on [[ancestry]], warfare, the body, gender, trade, religion, and [[tourism]]. Unfortunately, little ancient art survives from Oceania. Scholars believe that this is likely because artists used perishable materials, such as wood and feathers, which did not survive in the tropical climate, and there are no historical records to refer to most of this material. The understanding of Oceania's artistic cultures thus begins with the documentation of it by Westerners, such as Captain [[James Cook]], in the eighteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]] spent significant amounts of time in Tahiti, living with local people and making modern art—a fact that has become intertwined with Tahitian visual culture to the present day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The indigenous [[Australian art|art of Australia]] often looks like abstract modern art, but it has deep roots in local culture.

The art of [[Oceania]] is the last great tradition of art to be appreciated by the world at large. Despite being one of the longest continuous traditions of art in the world, dating back at leasf fifty millennia, it remained relatively unknown until the second half of the 20th century.

The often ephemeral materials of Aboriginal art of Australia makes it difficult to determine the antiquity of the majority of the forms of art practised today. The most durable forms are the multitudes of rock engravings and rock paintings which are found across the continent. In the Arnhem Land escarpment, evidence suggests that paintings were being made fifty thousand years ago, antedating the Palaeolithic rock paintings of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] &amp; [[Lascaux]] in Europe.

===Origins===

Art historians disagree when [[Modern art]] began, some tracing it as far back as [[Francisco Goya]] in the [[Napoleonic]] period, the mid-19th century with the [[industrial revolution]] or the late 19th century with the advent of [[Impressionism]]. The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 gave rise to further revolutions in thought. In the arts, these included a new self-consciousness about artistic styles and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ozenfant, A. (1952). ''Foundations of Modern Art''. New York: Dover Publications. pp. 2–5. {{OCLC|536109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]] says "a gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years", marked by significant events such as the completion in 1784 of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]''; the exhibition of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s painting ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' in 1855; and the exhibition of [[Édouard Manet]]'s painting ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refusés]]'' in Paris in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Arnason, H. Harvard (1998). ''History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography''. Fourth Edition. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-8109-3439-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

During the 19th century, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] tendency of early modern artists such as [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] was succeeded by newer art movements: [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]],  [[Impressionism]], [[post-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and other movements. Western artists were influenced by Eastern decorative arts, especially [[Japonism|Japanese prints]].

The Impressionists sought to convey movement, spontaneity, and transient effects of light in their work. Their style was adopted by artists in many countries, alongside national movements such as the [[Hudson River School]] and the [[Ashcan School]] in the US.

The history of [[20th-century art]] is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. The art movements of [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[abstract art]], [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]] led to further explorations of new creative styles and manners of expression. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] being influenced by [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African art|African sculpture]] and [[Primitivism]]. [[Japonism]], and Japanese [[woodcut]]s (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by [[Paul Gauguin]]'s interest in [[Oceanic art]] and the sudden popularity among the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]] in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, [[Henri Matisse]], and many of their colleagues. Later in the 20th century, [[Pop Art]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] came to prominence.

Rapid advances in science and technology led to the late Modern and [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] period. In these periods, the art and cultures of the world went through many changes, and there was a great deal of intermixture between cultures, as new [[mass media|communications technologies]] facilitated the national and even global dissemination of music, art and style. The separation of regional cultures that had marked the 19th century was replaced by a global culture. Postmodernism describes a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism which marked a departure from modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism |title=Postmodernism |work=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |first=Ruth |last=Reichl |author-link=Ruth Reichl |date=1989 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |dictionary=[[American Heritage Dictionary]] |title=postmodern |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |archive-date=9 December 2008 |access-date=29 September 2018 |edition=4th |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:H10Protest.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Members of the [[Hollywood Ten]] and their families in 1950, protesting the impending incarceration of the ten]]

The '''Hollywood blacklist'''—as the broader '''entertainment industry blacklist''' is generally known—was the practice of denying employment to screenwriters, actors, directors, musicians, and  American entertainment professionals during the mid-20th century because they were accused of having [[Communist]] ties or sympathies. Artists were barred from work on the basis of their membership, alleged membership in, or sympathy with the [[Communist Party USA]], or their refusal to assist investigations into the party's activities. Even during the period of its strictest enforcement, from the late 1940s through to the late 1950s, the [[blacklist]] was rarely made explicit or verifiable, but it directly damaged the careers of scores of individuals working in the film industry.

The first systematic Hollywood blacklist was instituted on November 25, 1947, the day after ten writers and directors were cited for [[contempt of Congress]] for refusing to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. A group of studio executives, acting under the aegis of the [[Association of Motion Picture Producers]], fired the artists – the so-called [[Hollywood Ten]] – and made what has become known as the [[Waldorf Statement]].

On June 22, 1950, a pamphlet entitled ''[[Red Channels]]'' was published. Focused on the field of broadcasting, it identified 151 entertainment industry professionals in the context of "Red Fascists and their sympathizers". Soon, most of those named, along with a host of other artists, were barred from employment in most of the entertainment field.

The blacklist lasted until 1960, when [[Dalton Trumbo]], a Communist Party member from 1943 to 1948&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Navasky]], ''Naming Names'', New York: Viking, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 
and member of the Hollywood Ten, was credited as the screenwriter of the highly successful film ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'', and later publicly acknowledged by actor [[Kirk Douglas]] for writing the screenplay for the movie ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-life/9515653/Kirk-Douglas-My-Spartacus-broke-all-the-rules.html Kirk Douglas, "My Spartacus Broke All the Rules"], ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; A number of those blacklisted, however, were still barred from work in their professions for years afterward.

==History==

===Background===
The Hollywood blacklist was rooted in events of the 1930s and the early 1940s, encompassing the height of the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. Two major [[Cinema of the United States|film industry]] strikes during the 1930s increased tensions between the [[AMPP|Hollywood producers]] and the unions, particularly the [[Screen Writers Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2003), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Communist Party lost substantial support after the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trials]] of 1936–1938 and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact]] of 1939. The U.S. government began turning its attention to the possible links between Hollywood and the party during this period. Under then-chairman [[Martin Dies, Jr.]], the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) released a report in 1938 claiming that [[communism]] was pervasive in Hollywood. Two years later, Dies privately took testimony from a former Communist Party member, John L. Leech, who named forty-two movie industry professionals as Communists. After Leech repeated his charges in supposed confidence to a Los Angeles grand jury, many of the names were reported in the press, including those of stars [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Fredric March]], among other well-known Hollywood figures. Dies said he would "clear" all those who co-operated by meeting with him in what he called "executive session". Within two weeks of the grand jury leak, all those on the list except for actress [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] had met with the HUAC chairman. Dies "cleared" everyone except actor [[Lionel Stander]], who was fired by the movie studio, [[Republic Pictures]], where he was contracted.&lt;ref&gt;Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, producer [[Walt Disney]] took out an ad in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the industry trade magazine, declaring his conviction that "Communist agitation" was behind a [[Disney animators' strike|cartoonists and animators' strike]]. According to historians Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund, "In actuality, the strike had resulted from Disney's overbearing paternalism, high-handedness, and insensitivity."&lt;ref name=CE1&gt;Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Disney, California State Senator [[Jack Tenney (politician)|Jack Tenney]], chairman of the state legislature's [[California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities|Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities]], launched an investigation of "Reds in movies". The probe fell flat, and was mocked in several ''Variety'' headlines.&lt;ref name=CE1 /&gt;

The subsequent wartime alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the American Communist Party newfound credibility. During the war, membership in the party reached a peak of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;Johnpoll (1994), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; As World War II drew to a close, perceptions changed again, with communism increasingly becoming a focus of American fears and hatred. In 1945, [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], founder of the [[neofascist]] [[America First Party (1944)|America First Party]], began giving speeches in Los Angeles assailing the "alien minded Russian Jews in Hollywood".&lt;ref&gt;Horne (2006), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Mississippi congressman [[John E. Rankin]], a member of HUAC, held a press conference to declare that "one of the most dangerous plots ever instigated for the overthrow of this Government has its headquarters in Hollywood ... the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States". Rankin promised, "We're on the trail of the tarantula now".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of Soviet repression in Eastern and Central Europe in the war's aftermath added more fuel to what became known as the "[[Second Red Scare]]". The growth of conservative political influence and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] triumph in the 1946 Congressional elections, which saw the party take control of both the [[United States House election, 1946|House]] and [[United States Senate election, 1946|Senate]], led to a major revival of institutional anticommunist activity, publicly spearheaded by HUAC. The following year, the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]] (MPA), a political action group cofounded by Walt Disney, issued a pamphlet advising producers on the avoidance of "subtle communistic touches" in their films. Its counsel revolved around a list of ideological prohibitions, such as "Don't smear the free-enterprise system ... Don't smear industrialists ... Don't smear wealth ... Don't smear the profit motive ... Don't deify the 'common man' ... Don't glorify the collective".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2004), pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The blacklist begins (1946–1947)===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[McCarthyism]] --&gt;
On July 29, 1946, [[William Wilkerson|William R. Wilkerson]], publisher and founder of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', published a "TradeView" column entitled "A Vote For [[Joseph Stalin|Joe Stalin]]". It named as Communist sympathizers [[Dalton Trumbo]], [[Maurice Rapf]], [[Lester Cole]], [[Howard E. Koch|Howard Koch]], [[Harold Buchman]], John Wexley, [[Ring Lardner Jr.]], Harold Salemson, Henry Meyers, Theodore Strauss, and [[John Howard Lawson]]. In August and September 1946, Wilkerson published other columns containing names of numerous purported Communists and sympathizers. They became known as "Billy's List" and "Billy's Blacklist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wilkerson |first=William |author-link=William Wilkerson |publication-date=1946-07-29 |title=A Vote For Joe Stalin |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter |page=1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baum |first1=Gary |last2= Miller |first2=Daniel |title=Blacklist: THR Addresses Role After 65 Years |date=November 19, 2012 |work=Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 65th-anniversary article in 2012, Wilkerson's son apologized for the newspaper's role in the blacklist, saying that his father was motivated by revenge for his own thwarted ambition to own a studio.&lt;ref name="Wilerson III"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-billy-wilkersons-son-apologizes-391977|title=Blacklist: Billy Wilkerson's Son Apologizes for Publication's Dark Past|last=Wilerson III|first=W. R.|date=November 19, 2012|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1947, drawing upon the list named in ''The Hollywood Reporter'', the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed a number of persons working in the Hollywood film industry to testify at hearings. The committee had declared its intention to investigate whether Communist agents and sympathizers had been planting propaganda in U.S. films.&lt;ref name="Baum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e. g., {{cite web|author=Schwartz, Richard A.|url=http://comptalk.fiu.edu/blacklist.htm|title=How the Film and Television Blacklists Worked|year=1999|accessdate=2010-03-03|publisher=Florida International University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings opened with appearances by [[Walt Disney]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], then president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. Disney testified that the threat of Communists in the film industry was a serious one, and named specific people who had worked for him as probable Communists.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan testified that a small clique within his union was using "communist-like tactics" in attempting to steer union policy, but that he did not know if those (unnamed) members were communists or not, and that in any case he thought the union had them under control.&lt;ref&gt;"testimony of Ronald Reagan and Walt Disney" http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6458/&lt;/ref&gt; (Later his first wife, actress [[Jane Wyman]] stated in her biography with Joe Morella [1985] that Reagan's allegations against friends and colleagues led to tension in their marriage, eventually resulting in their divorce). Actor [[Adolphe Menjou]] declared, "I am a witch hunter if the witches are Communists. I am a [[Red-baiting|Red-baiter]]. I would like to see them all back in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;Scott and Rutkoff (1999), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, several leading Hollywood figures, including director [[John Huston]] and actors Humphrey Bogart, [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Judy Garland]] and [[Danny Kaye]], organized the [[Committee for the First Amendment]] to protest the government's targeting of the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 275–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the committee, such as Sterling Hayden, assured Bogart that they were not Communists. During the hearings, a local Washington paper reported that Hayden was a Communist. After returning to Hollywood, Bogart shouted at Danny Kaye, "You fuckers sold me out."&lt;ref&gt;''Kenneth Billingsley, Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Roseville, CA, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7615-1376-0}}, pp. 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The group came under attack as being naive or foolish. Under pressure from his studio, [[Warner Brothers]], to distance himself from the Hollywood Ten, Bogart negotiated a statement that did not denounce the committee, but said that his trip was "ill-advised, even foolish".&lt;ref&gt;Sean Griffin (ed). ''What Dreams Were Made Of: Movie Stars of the 1940s''. Rutgers University Press, 2011, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billy Wilder]] told the group that "we oughta fold".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald and Allis Radosh. ''Red Star over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left''. San Francisco: Encounter Books, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huston later changed his opinion of the Hollywood Ten. In a 1952 letter, he told a colleague: "It was a long time afterward that I discovered the real reasons behind the behavior of the 'Ten' in Washington, and when I did I was shocked beyond words. It seems that some of them had already testified in California, and that their testimony had been false. They had said they were not Communists and now, to have admitted it to the press would have been to lay themselves open to charges of perjury ... And so, when I believed them to have engaged to defend the freedom of the individual, they were really looking after their own skins. Had I so much as suspected such a thing, you may be sure I would have washed my hands of them instantly. But, as I said before, the revelation was a long time coming."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Billingsley, ''Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s''. Roseville, CA, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7615-1376-0}}, pp. 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the film industry professionals in whom HUAC had expressed interest – primarily screenwriters, but also actors, directors, producers, and others – were either known or alleged to have been members of the American Communist Party. Of the 43 people put on the witness list, 19 declared that they would not give evidence. Eleven of these 19 were called before the committee. Members of the Committee for the First Amendment flew to Washington ahead of this climactic phase of the hearing, which commenced on Monday, October 27.&lt;ref&gt;Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eleven "unfriendly witnesses", one, émigré playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], ultimately chose to answer the committee's questions.&lt;ref name=Dick7&gt;Dick (1989), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schuetze-Coburn, Marje |url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/exhibits/Brecht/HUAC.html|title=Bertolt Brecht's Appearance Before the HUAC|date=February 1998|accessdate=2010-03-03|publisher=USC-Feuchtwanger Memorial Library|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719134730/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/exhibits/Brecht/HUAC.html|archivedate=2009-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other ten refused, citing their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to [[freedom of speech]] and assembly. The crucial question they refused to answer is now generally rendered as "Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the [[Communist Party]]?". Each had at one time or another been a member, as many intellectuals during the Great Depression felt that the Party offered an alternative to capitalism. Some still were members, others had been active in the past, and only briefly. The Committee formally accused these ten of [[contempt of Congress]], and began criminal proceedings against them in the full [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

In light of the "Hollywood Ten"'s defiance of HUAC – in addition to refusing to testify, many had tried to read statements decrying the committee's investigation as unconstitutional – political pressure mounted on the film industry to demonstrate its "anti-subversive" bona fides. Late in the hearings, [[Eric Johnston]], president of the [[Association of Motion Picture Producers]] (AMPP) (and [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA)), declared to the committee that he would never "employ any proven or admitted Communist because they are just a disruptive force, and I don't want them around".&lt;ref name=Dick7 /&gt; On November 17, the Screen Actors Guild voted to make its officers swear a pledge asserting each was not a Communist.

The following week, on November 24, the House of Representatives voted 346 to 17 to approve citations against the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress. The next day, following a meeting of [[studio system|film industry executives]] at New York's Waldorf-Astoria hotel, AMPP President Johnston issued a [[press release]] that is today referred to as the [[Waldorf Statement]].{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Their statement said that the ten would be fired or suspended without pay and not re-employed until they were cleared of contempt charges and had sworn that they were not Communists. The first Hollywood blacklist was in effect.

===The list grows (1948–1950)===
The HUAC hearings had failed to turn up any evidence that Hollywood was secretly disseminating Communist propaganda, but the industry was nonetheless transformed. The fallout from the inquiry was a factor in the decision by [[Floyd Odlum]], the primary owner of [[RKO Pictures]], to get out of the business.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the studio would pass into the hands of [[Howard Hughes]]. Within weeks of taking over in May 1948, Hughes fired most of RKO's employees and virtually shut the studio down for six months as he had the political sympathies of the rest investigated. Then, just as RKO swung back into production, [[Studio system#The end of the system and the death of RKO|Hughes made the decision to settle]] a long-standing [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust suit]] against the industry's [[studio system|Big Five studios]]. This would be one of the crucial steps in the collapse of the [[studio system]] that had governed Hollywood, and ruled much of world cinema, for a quarter-century.

In early 1948 all of the Hollywood Ten were convicted of contempt. Following a series of unsuccessful appeals, the cases arrived before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]; among the submissions filed in defense of the ten was an [[amicus curiae]] brief signed by 204 Hollywood professionals. After the court denied review, the Hollywood Ten began serving one-year prison sentences in 1950. One of the Ten, screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]], stated in the 1976 documentary film ''Hollywood On Trial'':

{{quote|As far as I was concerned, it was a completely just verdict. I had contempt for that Congress and have had contempt for several since. And on the basis of guilt or innocence, I could never really complain very much. That this was a crime or misdemeanor was the complaint, my complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=Dalton Trumbo, Blacklisted Hollywood Radical|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SbJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA648&amp;lpg=PA651&amp;focus=viewport#v=onepage|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=2015|page=228|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1950, one of the Ten, director [[Edward Dmytryk]], publicly announced that he had once been a Communist and was prepared to give evidence against others who had been as well. He was released early from jail; following his 1951 HUAC appearance, in which he described his brief membership in the party and named names, his career recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Gevinson (1997), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The others remained silent and most were unable to obtain work in the American film and television industry for many years. [[Adrian Scott]], who had produced four of Dmytryk's films – ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]''; ''[[Cornered (1945 film)|Cornered]]''; ''[[So Well Remembered]]''; and ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' – was one of those named by his former friend. Scott's next screen credit would not come until 1972 and he would never produce another feature film. Some of those blacklisted continued to write for Hollywood or the broadcasting industry surreptitiously, using [[pseudonym]]s or the names of friends who posed as the actual writers (those who allowed their names to be used in this fashion were called "fronts"). Of the 204 who signed the amicus brief, 84 would be blacklisted themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Stone (2004), p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a more general chilling effect: Humphrey Bogart, who had been one of the most prominent members of the Committee for the First Amendment, felt compelled to write an article for ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine denying he was a Communist sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;Bogart (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tenney Committee]], which had continued its state-level investigations, summoned songwriter [[Ira Gershwin]] to testify about his participation in the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonski (1998), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CounterattackMasthead.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The May 7, 1948, issue of the ''Counterattack'' newsletter warned readers about a radio talk show that had recently expanded its audience by moving from the [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] network to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]: "''Communist Party members and fellow-travelers'' have often been guests on [Arthur] Gaeth's program."]]

A number of non-governmental organizations participated in enforcing and expanding the blacklist; in particular, the [[American Legion]], the conservative war veterans' group, was instrumental in pressuring the entertainment industry to exclude those of political sympathies it disagreed with. In 1949, the Americanism Division of the Legion issued its own blacklist – a roster of 128 people whom it claimed were participants in the "Communist Conspiracy". Among the names on the Legion's list was that of well-known playwright [[Lillian Hellman]].&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1989), 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Hellman had written or contributed to the screenplays of approximately ten motion pictures up to that point; she would not be employed again by a Hollywood studio until 1966.

Another influential group was American Business Consultants Inc., founded in 1947. In the subscription information for its weekly publication ''Counterattack'', "The Newsletter of Facts to Combat Communism", it declared that it was run by "a group of ''former'' FBI men. It has no affiliation whatsoever with any government agency." Notwithstanding that claim, it seems the editors of ''Counterattack'' had direct access to the files of both the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and HUAC; the results of that access became widely apparent with the June 1950 publication of ''[[Red Channels]]''. This ''Counterattack'' spinoff listed 151 people in entertainment and broadcast journalism, along with records of their involvement in what the pamphlet meant to be taken as Communist or pro-Communist activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Channels'' (1950), pp. 6, 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of those named, such as Hellman, were already being denied employment in the motion picture, TV, and radio fields; the publication of ''Red Channels'' meant that scores more would be placed on the blacklist. That year, [[CBS]] instituted a loyalty oath which it required of all its employees.&lt;ref&gt;Buhle and Wagner (2003a), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] was the first performer to lose employment because of a listing in ''Red Channels''. In 1950, Muir was named as a [[Communist]] sympathizer in the pamphlet, and was immediately removed from the cast of the television sitcom ''[[The Aldrich Family]]'', in which she had been cast as Mrs. Aldrich. NBC had received between 20 and 30 phone calls protesting her being in the show. [[General Foods]], the sponsor, said that it would not sponsor programs in which "controversial persons" were featured. Though the company later received thousands of calls protesting the decision, it was not reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

===HUAC returns (1951–1952)===
In 1951, with the U.S. Congress now under Democratic control, HUAC launched a second investigation of Hollywood and Communism. As actor [[Larry Parks]] said when called before the panel,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't present me with the choice of either being in contempt of this committee and going to jail or forcing me to really crawl through the mud to be an informer. For what purpose? I don't think it is a choice at all. I don't think this is really sportsmanlike. I don't think this is American. I don't think this is American justice.&lt;ref&gt;Parish (2004), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Parks ultimately testified, becoming, however reluctantly, a "friendly witness", and found himself blacklisted, nonetheless.

In fact, the legal tactics of those refusing to testify had changed by this time; instead of relying on the First Amendment, they invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s shield against self-incrimination (though, as before, Communist Party membership was not illegal). While this usually allowed a witness to avoid "naming names" without being indicted for contempt of Congress, "taking the Fifth" before HUAC guaranteed that one would be added to the industry blacklist.&lt;ref&gt;Ceplair and Englund (2003), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians at times distinguish between the relatively official blacklist – the names of those who (a) were called by HUAC and, in whatever manner, refused to co-operate and/or (b) were identified as Communists in the hearings – and the so-called graylist – those others who were denied work because of their political or personal affiliations, real or imagined; the consequences, however, were largely the same. The graylist also refers more specifically to those who were denied work by the major studios, but could still find jobs on [[Poverty Row]]: Composer [[Elmer Bernstein]], for instance, was called by HUAC when it was discovered that he had written some music reviews for a Communist newspaper. After he refused to name names, pointing out that he had never attended a Communist Party meeting, he found himself composing music for movies such as ''[[Cat Women of the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susman, Gary|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,684811,00.html|title=Goodbye|date=August 19, 2004|accessdate=2009-02-27|publisher=EntertainmentWeekly.com}} {{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5753311/|title=Composer Elmer Bernstein Dead at 82|date=August 19, 2004|accessdate=2009-02-27|publisher=MSNBC.com (Associated Press)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anticommunist Literature 1950s.tiff|thumb|right|Anticommunist tract from the 1950s, decrying the "REDS of Hollywood and Broadway"]]
Like Parks and Dmytryk, others also co-operated with the committee. Some friendly witnesses gave broadly damaging testimony with less apparent reluctance, most prominently director [[Elia Kazan]] and screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]]. Their co-operation in describing the political leanings of their friends and professional associates effectively brought a halt to dozens of careers and compelled a number of artists to depart for Mexico or Europe. Others were also forced abroad in order to work. Director [[Jules Dassin]] was among the best known of these. Briefly a Communist, Dassin had left the party in 1939. He was immediately blacklisted after Edward Dmytryk and fellow filmmaker [[Frank Tuttle]] named him to HUAC in 1952. Dassin left for France, and spent much of his remaining career in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman (1987), pp. 190, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Thomas Doherty describes how the HUAC hearings swept onto the blacklist those who had never even been particularly active politically, let alone suspected of being Communists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[O]n March 21, 1951, the name of the actor [[Lionel Stander]] was uttered by the actor Larry Parks during testimony before HUAC. "Do you know Lionel Stander?" committee counsel [[Frank S. Tavenner, Jr.|Frank S. Tavenner]] inquired. Parks replied he knew the man, but had no knowledge of his political affiliations. No more was said about Stander either by Parks or the committee – no accusation, no insinuation. Yet Stander's phone stopped ringing. Prior to Parks's testimony, Stander had worked on ten television shows in the previous 100 days. Afterwards, nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty (2003), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Stander was himself called before HUAC, he began by pledging his full support in the fight against "subversive" activities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of a group of fanatics who are desperately trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States by depriving artists and others of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness without due process of law ... I can tell names and cite instances and I am one of the first victims of it ... [This is] a group of ex-Fascists and America-Firsters and anti-Semites, people who hate everybody, including Negroes, minority groups, and most likely themselves ... [T]hese people are engaged in a conspiracy outside all the legal processes to undermine the very fundamental American concepts upon which our entire system of democracy exists.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Belton (1994), pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stander was clearly speaking of the committee itself.&lt;ref name=B203&gt;Belton (1994), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hunt for subversives extended into every branch of the entertainment industry. In the field of animation, two studios in particularly were affected: [[United Productions of America]] (UPA) was purged of a large portion of its staff, while New York-based Tempo was entirely crushed.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2004), pp. 173–179.&lt;/ref&gt; The HUAC investigation also effectively destroyed families. Screenwriter [[Richard J. Collins|Richard Collins]], after a brief period on the blacklist, became a friendly witness and dumped his wife, actress [[Dorothy Comingore]], who refused to name names. Divorcing Comingore, Collins took the couple's young son, as well. The family's story was later dramatized in the film ''[[Guilty by Suspicion]]'' (1991), in which the character based on Comingore "commits suicide rather than endure a long mental collapse".&lt;ref name="Buhle and Wagner 2003b, p. 21"&gt;Buhle and Wagner (2003b), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In real life, Comingore succumbed to alcoholism and died of a pulmonary disease at the age of fifty-eight. In the description of historians [[Paul Buhle]] and David Wagner, "premature strokes and heart attacks were fairly common [among blacklistees], along with heavy drinking as a form of suicide on the installment plan".&lt;ref name="BWa250" /&gt;

For all that, evidence that Communists were actually using Hollywood films as vehicles for subversion remained hard to come by. Schulberg reported that the manuscript of his novel ''[[What Makes Sammy Run?]]'' (later a screenplay, as well) had been subject to an ideological critique by Hollywood Ten writer [[John Howard Lawson]], whose comments he had solicited. The significance of such interactions was questionable. As historian [[Gerald Horne]] describes, many Hollywood screenwriters had joined or associated with the local Communist Party chapter because it "offered a collective to a profession that was enmeshed in tremendous isolation at the typewriter. Their 'Writers' Clinic' had 'an informal "board" of respected screenwriters' – including Lawson and [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] – 'who read and commented upon any screenplay submitted to them. Although their criticism could be plentiful, stinging, and (sometimes) politically dogmatic, the author was entirely free to accept it or reject it as he or she pleased without incurring the slightest "consequence" or sanction.'"&lt;ref&gt;Horne (2006), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the onscreen evidence of Communist influence uncovered by HUAC was feeble at best. One witness remembered Stander, while performing in a film, whistling the left-wing "[[The Internationale|Internationale]]" as his character waited for an elevator. "Another noted that screenwriter [[Lester Cole]] had inserted lines from a famous pro-[[Spanish Civil War|Loyalist]] speech by [[Dolores Ibárruri|La Pasionaria]] about it being 'better to die on your feet than to live on your knees' into a pep talk delivered by a football coach."&lt;ref name=B203 /&gt;

Others disagree about how Communists affected the film industry. The author Kenneth Billingsley, writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, said that Trumbo wrote in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' about films which he said communist influence in Hollywood had prevented from being made: among them were proposed adaptations of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s anti-[[totalitarian]] works ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and ''[[The Yogi and the Commissar]]'', which described the rise of communism in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/27732.html Kenneth Billingsley, "Hollywood's Missing Movies: Why American films have ignored life under communism"], ''Reason Magazine'', June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Ronald and Allis Radosh, writing in ''Red Star over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left'', said that Trumbo bragged about how he and other party members stopped anti-communist films from being produced.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald and Allis Radosh, ''Red Star over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left''. San Francisco: Encounter Books (2005). {{ISBN|978-1893554962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height (1952–1956)===
In 1952, the [[Screen Writers Guild]] – which had been founded two decades before by three future members of the Hollywood Ten – authorized the movie studios to "omit from the screen" the names of any individuals who had failed to clear themselves before Congress. Writer [[Dalton Trumbo]], for instance, one of the Hollywood Ten and still very much on the blacklist, had received [[screen credit]] in 1950 for writing, years earlier, the story on which the screenplay of [[Columbia Pictures]]' ''[[Emergency Wedding]]'' was based. There would be no more of that until the 1960s. The name of [[Albert Maltz]], who had written the original screenplay for ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' in the mid-1940s, was nowhere to be seen when the movie was released in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Dick (1989), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

As William O'Neill describes, pressure was maintained even on those who had ostensibly "cleared" themselves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On December 27, 1952, the American Legion announced that it disapproved of a new film, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'', starring [[José Ferrer]], who used to be no more progressive than hundreds of other actors and had already been grilled by HUAC. The picture itself was based on the life of [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and was totally apolitical. Nine members of the Legion had picketed it anyway, giving rise to the controversy. By this time, people were not taking any chances. Ferrer immediately wired the Legion's national commander that he would be glad to join the veterans in their "fight against communism".&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill (1990), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group's efforts dragged many others onto the blacklist: In 1954, "[s]creenwriter Louis Pollock, a man without any known political views or associations, suddenly had his career yanked out from under him because the American Legion confused him with Louis Pollack, a California clothier, who had refused to co-operate with HUAC."&lt;ref name="Englund 2003 p. 388"&gt;Ceplair and Englund (2003), p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this same period, a number of influential newspaper columnists covering the entertainment industry, including [[Walter Winchell]], [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Victor Riesel]], [[Jack O'Brian]], and [[George Sokolsky]], regularly offered up names with the suggestion that they should be added to the blacklist.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] received an out-of-court settlement to end a 1954 lawsuit against the [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] advertising agency, which had ordered him dropped from the lead role in a television series it sponsored. ''Variety'' described it as "the first industry admission of what has for some time been an open secret – that the threat of being labeled a political non-conformist, or worse, has been used against show business personalities, and that a screening system is at work determining these [actors'] availabilities for roles".&lt;ref name="Doherty 2003, p. 236"&gt;Doherty (2003), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StormCenterPoster.jpg|thumb|right|The first Hollywood movie to overtly take on [[McCarthyism]], ''[[Storm Center]]'' appeared in 1956. [[Bette Davis]] "plays a small-town librarian who refuses, on principle, to remove a book called 'The Communist Dream' from the shelves when the local council deems it subversive".&lt;ref&gt;Charity (2005), p. 1266.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Hollywood blacklist had long gone hand in hand with the Red-baiting activities of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s FBI. Adversaries of HUAC such as lawyer [[Bartley Crum]], who defended some of the Hollywood Ten in front of the committee in 1947, were labeled as Communist sympathizers or subversives and targeted for investigation themselves. Throughout the 1950s, the FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and placed him under continuous surveillance. As a result, he lost most of his clients and, unable to cope with the stress of ceaseless harassment, committed suicide in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1997), passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Intimidating and dividing the left is now seen as a central purpose of the HUAC hearings. Fund-raising for once-popular humanitarian efforts became difficult, and despite the sympathies of many in the industry there was little open support in Hollywood for causes such as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and opposition to [[nuclear weapons testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2004), pp. 187–188; Ceplair and Englund (2003), p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggles attending the blacklist were played out metaphorically on the big screen in various ways. As described by film historian James Chapman, "[[Carl Foreman]], who had refused to testify before the committee, wrote the western ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), in which a town marshal (played, ironically, by friendly witness [[Gary Cooper]]) finds himself deserted by the good citizens of Hadleyville (read: Hollywood) when a gang of outlaws who had terrorized the town several years earlier (read: HUAC) returns."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper's lawman cleaned up Hadleyville, but Foreman was forced to leave for Europe to find work. Even more famously, Kazan and Schulberg collaborated on a movie widely seen as justifying their decision to name names. ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954) became one of the most honored films in Hollywood history, winning eight [[Academy Awards]], including Oscars for Best Film, Kazan's direction, and Schulberg's screenplay. The film featured [[Lee J. Cobb]], one of the best known actors to name names. ''Time Out Film Guide'' argues that the film is "undermined" by its "embarrassing special pleading on behalf of informers".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2005), p. 981.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release from prison, [[Herbert Biberman]] of the Hollywood Ten directed ''[[Salt of the Earth (1954 film)|Salt of the Earth]]'', working independently in New Mexico with fellow blacklisted Hollywood professionals – producer [[Paul Jarrico]], writer [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], and actors [[Rosaura Revueltas]] and [[Will Geer]]. The film, concerning a strike by Mexican-American mine workers, was denounced as Communist propaganda when it was completed in 1953. Distributors boycotted it, newspapers and radio stations rejected advertisements for it, and the projectionists' union refused to run it. Nationwide in 1954, only around a dozen theaters exhibited it.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen and Haas (2005), pp. 116–117 ("screened in only eleven theaters"); Weigand (2002), p. 133 ("arranged showings of the film in only fourteen theaters").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breaking the blacklist (1957–present)===
A key figure in bringing an end to blacklisting was [[John Henry Faulk]]. Host of an afternoon comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]]. He was scrutinized by AWARE, one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of Communist sympathies and "disloyalty". Marked by the group as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost alone among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Faulk (1963), passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the case would drag through the courts for years, the suit itself was an important symbol of the building resistance to the blacklist.

The initial cracks in the entertainment industry blacklist were evident on television, specifically at CBS. In 1957, blacklisted actor [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]] was hired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] as an associate producer for his anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', then entering its third season on the network.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2007); Lumenick (2007b).&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 1958, a live CBS production of ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', based on short stories written by then-Communist [[Ruth McKenney]], appeared with the proper writing credit of blacklisted Edward Chodorov, along with his literary partner, Joseph Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Buhle and Wagner (2003a), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, actress [[Betty Hutton]] insisted that blacklisted composer [[Jerry Fielding]] be hired as musical director for her new series, also on CBS.&lt;ref name="Burlingame 2000 74"&gt;Burlingame (2000), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The first main break in the Hollywood blacklist followed soon after. On January 20, 1960, director [[Otto Preminger]] publicly announced that Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was the screenwriter of his forthcoming film ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]''. Six-and-a-half months later, with ''Exodus'' still to debut, the ''New York Times'' announced that [[Universal Pictures]] would give Trumbo screen credit for his role as writer on ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', a decision star [[Kirk Douglas]] is now recognized as largely responsible for.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1999), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, ''Spartacus'' premiered – the first movie to bear Trumbo's name since he had received story credit on ''Emergency Wedding'' in 1950. Since 1947, he had written or co-written approximately seventeen motion pictures without credit. ''Exodus'' followed in December, also bearing Trumbo's name. The blacklist was now clearly coming to an end, but its effects continue to reverberate even until the present.&lt;ref&gt;"... the anti-communist frenzy of the 1950s ... crippled artistic and intellectual life in the US for decades. The film industry still suffers from the purge of left-wing and critical spirits." [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/apr2008/dass-a03.shtml wsws.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Henry Faulk won his lawsuit in 1962. With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put on notice that they were [[Legal liability|legally liable]] for the professional and financial damage they caused. This helped to bring an end to publications such as ''Counterattack.''&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Adrian Scott and Lillian Hellman, however, a number of those on the blacklist remained there for an extended period – Lionel Stander, for instance, could not find work in Hollywood until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Belton (1994), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those who named names, like Kazan and Schulberg, argued for years after that they had made an ethically proper decision. Others, like actor [[Lee J. Cobb]] and director [[Michael Gordon (film director)|Michael Gordon]], who gave friendly testimony to HUAC after suffering on the blacklist for a time, "concede[d] with remorse that their plan was to name their way back to work".&lt;ref&gt;Navasky (1980), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; And there were those more gravely haunted by the choice they had made. In 1963, actor [[Sterling Hayden]] declared,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was a rat, a stoolie, and the names I named of those close friends were blacklisted and deprived of their livelihood.&lt;ref name=BW251&gt;Buhle and Wagner (2003a), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars Paul Buhle and Dave Wagner state that Hayden "was widely believed to have drunk himself into a near-suicidal depression decades before his 1986 death".&lt;ref name=BW251 /&gt;

Into the 21st century, the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild]] pursued the correction of screen credits from movies of the 1950s and early 1960s to properly reflect the work of blacklisted writers such as Carl Foreman and [[Hugo Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinraub (2000); {{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=1958|title=Corrected Blacklist Credits|date=July 17, 2000|accessdate=2010-03-03|publisher=Writers Guild of America, West|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Ycuqy8Og?url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=1958|archivedate=June 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 2011, the guild, acting on a request for an investigation made by his dying son [[Christopher Trumbo]], announced that Dalton Trumbo would get full credit for his work on the screenplay for the 1953 romantic comedy ''[[Roman Holiday]]'', almost sixty years after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Verrier (2011); {{cite web|author1=Devall, Cheryl |author2=Osburn, Paige|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Blacklisted Writer Gets credit Restored after 60 years for Oscar-Winning Film|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/12/19/30417/blacklisted-writer-gets-credit-restored-oscar-winn/|accessdate= 2011-12-20|publisher=89.3 KPCC|date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hollywood Ten and other 1947 blacklistees==

===The Hollywood Ten===

The following ten individuals were cited for contempt of Congress and blacklisted after refusing to answer questions about their alleged involvement with the Communist Party:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood Ten|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269472/Hollywood-Ten|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 1947, HUAC subpoenaed 79 individuals on a claim that they were subversive and the supposition that they injected Communist propaganda into their films. Although never substantiating this claim, the investigators charged them with contempt of Congress when they refused to answer the questions about their membership in the Screen Writers Guild and Communist Party. The Committee demanded they admit their political beliefs and name names of other Communists. Nineteen of those refused to co-operate, and due to illnesses, scheduling conflicts, and exhaustion from the chaotic hearings, only 10 appeared before the Committee. These men became known as the Hollywood Ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ceplair |first=Larry |date=2011 |title=''Anti-Communism in Twentieth Century America: A Critical History'' |url= |location=Santa Barbara, CA | publisher=Praeger |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belonging to the Communist Party did not constitute a crime, and the Committee's right to investigate these men was questionable in the first place. These men relied on the First Amendment's right to privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom of thought, but the Committee charged them with contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions. Later defendants – except Pete Seeger – tried different strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn |first=Gordon |date=1948 |title=''Hollywood on Trial: The Story of the 10 Who Were Indicted'' |url= |location=New York | publisher=Boni &amp; Gaer | pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the potential for punishment, the Ten still took bold stands, resisting the authority of HUAC. They yelled at the Chairman and treated the Committee with open indignation, emanating negativity and discouraging outside public favor and help. Upon receiving their contempt citations, they believed the Supreme Court would overturn the rulings, which did not turn out to be the case, and as a result, they were convicted of contempt and fined $1,000 each (or, over $10,700 USD in 2016 dollars, when adjusted for inflation), and sentenced to six-months to one-year prison terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hollywood blacklist#ref Anone]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}

HUAC did not treat the Ten with respect either, refusing to allow most of them to speak for more than just a few words at a time. Meanwhile, witnesses who had arranged to co-operate with the Committee (such as the anti-Communist screenwriter [[Ayn Rand]]) were allowed to speak at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/texts/huac.html|title=Ayn Rand's HUAC Testimony|website=www.noblesoul.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Redish]] suggests that at this time, the First Amendment's right of free expression in these cases was used to protect the powers of the government accuser(s), instead of the rights of the citizen-victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Redish |first=Martin |date=2005 |title=The Logic of Persecution: Free Expression and the McCarthy Era|url= |location=Stanford |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After witnessing the well-publicized ineffectiveness of the Ten's defense strategy, later defendants chose to plead the Fifth Amendment (against self-incrimination), instead.

Public support for the Hollywood Ten wavered, as everyday citizen-observers were never really sure what to make of them. Some of these men later wrote about their experiences as part of the Ten. John Howard Lawson, the Ten's unofficial leader, wrote a book attacking Hollywood for appeasing HUAC. While mostly criticizing the studios for their weakness, Lawson also defends himself/the Ten and criticizes Edward Dmytryk for being the only one to recant and eventually co-operate with HUAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson |first=John Howard |date=1953 |title=Film in the Battle of Ideas |url= |location=New York |publisher=Masses &amp; Mainstream |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1981 autobiography, ''Hollywood Red'', screenwriter Lester Cole stated that all of the Hollywood Ten had been Communist Party USA members at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Lester |date=1981 |title=Hollywood Red: The Autobiography of Lester Cole |url= |location=Palo Alto, CA |publisher=Ramparts Press |page= |isbn=978-0878670857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Hollywood Ten, such as [[Dalton Trumbo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanevents.com/2008/07/31/hollywood-still-loves-very-red-dalton-trumbo/|title=Hollywood Still Loves Very Red Dalton Trumbo – Human Events|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Dmytryk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269472/Hollywood-Ten|title=Hollywood Ten – American history|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; publicly admitted to being Communists while testifying before the Committee.

When Dmytryk wrote his memoir about this period, he denounced the Ten, and defended his decision to work with HUAC. He claimed to have left the Communist Party before having been subpoenaed, defining himself as the "odd man out". He condemns the Ten's legal tactic of defiance, and regrets staying with the group for as long as he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dmytryk |first=Edward |date=1953 |title=Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten |url= |location=Carbondale, IL |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |pages=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explanatory notes'''
{{refbegin}}
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|A|a|none}} The following transcript of an excerpt from the interrogation of screenwriter [[John Howard Lawson]] by HUAC chairman [[J. Parnell Thomas]] gives an example of the tenor of some of the exchanges:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thomas: Are you a member of the Communist Party or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?&lt;br&gt;
Lawson: It's unfortunate and tragic that I have to teach this committee the basic principles of Americanism.&lt;br&gt;
Thomas: That's not the question. That's not the question. The question is – have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?&lt;br&gt;
Lawson: I am framing my answer in the only way in which any American citizen can frame his answer to ... &lt;br&gt;
Thomas: Then you deny it?&lt;br&gt;
Lawson: ... a question that invades his ... absolutely invades his privacy.&lt;br&gt;
Thomas: Then you deny ... You refuse to answer that question, is that correct?&lt;br&gt;
Lawson: I have told you that I will offer my beliefs, my affiliations and everything else to the American public and they will know where I stand as they do from what I have written.&lt;br&gt;
Thomas: Stand away from the stand ... &lt;br&gt;
Lawson: I have written for Americanism for many years ... &lt;br&gt;
Thomas: Stand away from the stand ... &lt;br&gt;
Lawson: And I shall continue to fight for the Bill of Rights, which you are trying to destroy.&lt;br&gt;
Thomas: Officer, take this man away from the stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|B|b|none}} At least a couple of recent histories incorrectly give December 3 as the date of the Waldorf Statement: Ross (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;217; Stone (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;365. Among the many 1947 sources that establish the correct date, there is the ''New York Times'' article "Movies to Oust Ten Cited For Contempt of Congress; Major Companies Also Vote to Refuse Jobs to Communists – 'Hysteria, Surrender of Freedom' Charged by Defense Counsel; Movies Will Oust Ten Men Cited for Contempt of Congress After Voting to Refuse Employment to Communists", which appeared on the front page of the newspaper November 26.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|C|c|none}} Blankfort gave co-operative, if uninformative, testimony to HUAC and was not blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;Navasky (1980), pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|D|d|none}} Madeline Lee – who was married to actor Jack Gilford, also listed by ''Red Channels'' – was frequently confused with another actress of the era named [[Madaline Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook (1971), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|E|e|none}} Four months after refusing to co-operate with HUAC, Dagget appeared again before the committee and named names.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|F|f|none}} In 1951, Dare appeared before HUAC, lied about having never been a Communist, and continued to work in the entertainment industry. He was blacklisted two years later for his involvement in ''Meet the People'', a 1939 theatrical production. Soon afterward, he recanted his earlier testimony and named names.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer (1996); Navasky (1980), p. 74; Cogley (1956), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">'''Hamza ibn Asad abu Ya'la ibn al-Qalanisi''' ({{lang-ar|ابن القلانسي}}) (c. 1071 – March 18, 1160) was an [[Arab]] politician and chronicler in [[Damascus]] in the 12th century.

He descended from the [[Banu Tamim]] tribe, and was among the well-educated nobility of the city of Damascus. He studied [[literature]], [[theology]], and [[Sharia|law]], and served as firstly a secretary in, and later the head of, the [[chancellor|chancery]] of Damascus (the ''Diwan al-Rasa'il''). He served twice as ''ra'is'' of the city, an office equivalent to [[mayor]].

His chronicle, the ''Dhail'' or ''Mudhayyal Ta'rikh Dimashq'' (Continuation of the Chronicle of Damascus) was an extension of the chronicle of [[Hilal bin al-Muhassin al-Sabi']], covering the years 1056 to al-Qalanisi's death in 1160. This Chronicle is one of the few contemporary accounts of the [[First Crusade]] and its immediate aftermath from the [[Islam|Muslim]] perspective, making it not only a valuable source for modern historians, but also for later 12th-century chronicles, including [[Ibn al-Athir]].

'''Indigenous archaeology''' is a sub-discipline of western archaeological theory that seeks to engage and empower indigenous people in the preservation of their heritage and to correct perceived inequalities in [[modern archaeology]]. It also attempts to incorporate non-material elements of cultures, like oral traditions, into the wider historical narrative. This methodology came out of the global anti-colonial movements of the 1970s and 1980s led by aboriginal and indigenous people in settler-colonial nations, like the United States, Canada, and Australia.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearsall|first1=Deborah M.|title=Encyclopedia of Archaeology|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier Inc|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major issues the sub-discipline attempts to address include the repatriation of indigenous remains to their respective peoples, the perceived biases that western archaeology's imperialistic roots have imparted into its modern practices, and the stewardship and preservation of indigenous people’s cultures and heritage sites. This has encouraged the development of more collaborative relationships between archaeologists and indigenous people and has increased the involvement of indigenous people in archaeology and its related policies.&lt;ref name=Jstor1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Tim|title=Archaeologists and Indigenous People: A Maturing Relationship?|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2011|volume=40|pages=363, 378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLEGE STUDENTS WORK WITH ARCHAEOLOGISTS AT "KOSTER DIG" AN ANCIENT INDIAN BURIAL SITE - NARA - 552495.jpg|thumb|College students work with indigenous peoples in archaeological dig]]

As a relatively recently formed variety of archaeology, the "tenets and practices of Indigenous archaeology are currently being defined",&lt;ref&gt;Atalay 2006: 292&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a sub-discipline, it is "unavoidably pluralistic, contingent, and emergent".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2007: 7&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in practices under what is called indigenous archeology may range from Indigenous peoples being consulted about archaeological research and the terms of non-Native researchers, to instances of Native-designed and directed exploration of their "own" heritage.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Million 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion of development-related [[cultural resources management]] (CRM) archaeology has prompted many Aboriginal organizations to get involved. They have worked to translate their cultural and archaeological values into heritage management plans that supplant the colonial status quo. Beyond field-based applications, Indigenous archaeology can empower Indigenous peoples as they work toward [[decolonization]] of society in general and of archaeology in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2008, Nicholas and Andrews 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It has generated considerable controversy among scholars, some of whom support the concept in principle, but believe that incorporation of certain indigenous viewpoints has led to "major constraints on the research" of historical indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger 2007: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential Biases in Western Archaeology ==
The modern science of archaeology involves the collection and study of material objects like human remains and culturally or historically significant items.&lt;ref name=Race&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gidtri|first1=A.|title=Imperialism and Archaeology|journal=Race|date=April 1, 1974|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has its origins in European colonial policies. Many historical items obtained throughout the 18th and 19th centuries were acquired from colonized third world nations by European or American scientists and explorers. Some items were paid for, but many were excavated from indigenous lands without the consultation or permission of the people the items were culturally significant to.&lt;ref name="Race" /&gt; In the case of human remains, there are many documented instances of indigenous bodies being removed from battlefields or from burial sites by researchers during this time period.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Many of these bodies were used to assemble collections for the purpose of biological and cultural studies. At the time, many bodies were also used by European and American scientists as evidence in the creation of racial classification systems.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

Modern archaeological practices ensure the items obtained from excavations are through legal means.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; The knowledge obtained from the study of these artifacts can offer many historical insights in a wide variety of fields. For instance, human remains can give information on topics from the migration patterns of ancient humans to the evolution and spread of modern diseases.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Robyn J.|last2=Jones|first2=Gareth|title=Archeological Human Remains Scientific, Cultural, and Ethical Considerations|journal=Current Anthropology|date=1998|volume=39|issue=2|pages=253, 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring this information requires historical artifacts or remains to study. Indigenous communities are often not included or consulted in this process, and the desires of local communities can be marginalized. Findings are often not shared with the communities artifacts are obtained from, and many old artifacts are stored in museum collections for extended periods of time without being used.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

== Development ==
Much of the tension between archeologists and [[First Nations]] in [[the Americas]] has arisen because the latter believe that "current heritage ethics and values almost exclusively reflect the values and beliefs of Euro-Americans."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moh94|Mohs 1994]]. p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream archaeology has been complicit in variously objectifying, denigrating, and ignoring native people as it pursues the study of their past. Some scholars think that Native people have become estranged from their archaeological heritage because European-American scholars made an artificial distinction between prehistory and history that denies connection between contemporary cultures and archaeological ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wat05|Watkins 2005]] p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The social disruptions of Native American cultures due to losses from disease, warfare and encroachment of colonization resulted in many cases in the severing of their traditions of history keeping. By the time formal studies in archeology began, several centuries of Indigenous history had been dismissed and/or distorted by the new settlers, who became the colonial custodians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lip97|Lippert 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of discarded indigenous narratives, colonialist perspectives dominated the academic discourse and evaluated the indigenous history as a separate and less significant extension of the contemporary culture. The viewpoints of colonialist empires impressed predispositions and assumptions regarding indigenous culture and history, whether by destroying indigenous property, seizing land, or using state-sponsored propaganda and education to reinterpret the legacy of indigenous groups. Furthermore, access to archaeological findings and the means to correct biased or misleading portrayals of indigenous culture were limited by the relative lack of indigenous scholars participating directly in archaeology. The means of correcting and recovering the indigenous narrative are thus further damaged, and the imperialist-aligned interpretation of history is codified in the academics and archaeological practice. Colonialist views on indigenous culture are subsequently ingrained in the education system and the populace itself (Sonya 2006).

The legacy of anthropologists and archaeologists "behaving badly" with respect to native people has affected 21st century relations. For instance, indigenous peoples pushed for passage by the US Congress of the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), due to their strong dissatisfaction with the conduct of archaeologists. In their pursuit of science, they overrode strong cultural traditions associated with grave sites and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lip97|Lippert 1997]]. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Canada the legislature passed the [[Heritage Conservation Act]] (1994). Provincial governments have recognised that local First Nations had an interest in being consulted in the archaeological permit application process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtleisland.org/news/news-lyackson1.htm "[[Lyackson First Nation]] and Heritage Preservation"], Turtle Island News Network, June 2000, accessed 16 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, consultation has arranged for additional roles for them and sometimes become vehicles for community and economic development.

Debate about indigenous concerns about archeology have been related to criticism of 20th-century post-[[structuralism|structuralist]] and post-[[modernist]] approaches in the writing of history. Rossiter and Wood, and Windschuttle are among those who do not believe that Western enlightenment thought and "[[neoliberalism|neo-liberal capitalist frameworks]]" can be applied in a blanket manner to Indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ros05|Rossiter and Wood 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Win97|Windschuttle 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, scholars such as Cooper, Yellowhorn and Wylie have re-ignited fundamental debates that contrast the role and status of science against the role and status of Indigenous knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[#Coo06|Cooper 2006]], [[#Yel96|Yellowhorn 1996]] and [[#Wyl02|Wylie 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such scholars increasingly find fault with science's "universalizing myth" and its allegedly objective "[[view from nowhere]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nag86|Nagel 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt; its appeal to pan-human values and reliance on empirical modes of understanding. {{Who|date=March 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Many{{Who|date=March 2012}} agree with philosopher [[Alison Wylie]] in accepting empiricism as one route to productive knowledge, while finding "no reason to conclude that this insulates the scientific enterprise or its products from political, moral, or social scrutiny, much less establishes that scientific interests have a transcendent value that takes precedence over all other interests".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wyl05|Wylie 2005]]. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also Forsman 1997 and White Deer 1997).

Since the activism associated with the late twentieth century, Indigenous peoples have worked to develop strategies to use, protect, research and manage their cultural heritage. Indigenous archaeology is just one among the tools they are using to reclaim their heritage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Internalist archaeology ==
[[Eldon Yellowhorn]] has written about what is called internalist archaeology (2006). Primarily but not exclusively for the benefit of Native people, the internalist perspective has overturned the late 19th century, Eurocentric theory that the Native peoples were disappearing for good, or that they were unrelated to the ancient archaeological remains, or both (Yellowhorn 2006: 197). Internalism practitioners reconsider basic archaeological conventions that can carry connotations distasteful to First Nations and others. An example is what Yellowhorn calls "chronological oppression", that is, the European-American emphasis on a dichotomy between prehistory and history (the latter first documented by evidence in writing.(2006: 198).

Internalism encourages reclaiming by indigenous peoples of the archaeological record, and thus their connections to land, spirit and power. It treats oral narrative as a kind of middle-range theory (Yellowhorn 2006: 205), drawing on [[mythology]]’s established [[mnemonic]] role of "connecting higher with lower levels of abstraction" (Yellowhorn 2006: 202). Because internalism focuses on specific cultural traditions, for instance, using established archaeological methods to "search for the signatures" of oral narratives in the local archaeological record (Yellowhorn 2006: 137), it has appealed to Native practitioners and publics. Such an approach values a local understanding of history and is also grounded firmly in a global anthropological context. Yellowhorn says that it is best achieved through the "development of applicable theoretical frameworks borne of rigorous professionalism" (Yellowhorn 2006: 195).

== Archaeology and national politics==
The importance of archaeological sites and materials to Indigenous peoples’ case for their uninterrupted occupation of colonized lands cannot be overestimated: "control of cultural property is central to the struggle of decolonization, aboriginal self-government, and in some areas, First Nations cultural survival" (Walker and Ostrove 1995: 14). As archeology provides incontrovertible material related to past events, First Nations peoples are beginning to consider archeology as a practice they can use, rather than as a colonialist project or bureaucratic obstacle course. Archaeological sites and objects may serve the philosophy and process of decolonization; for instance, being used to negotiate land claims or to promote cultural cohesion. Indigenous groups have begun to insist on control of such resources in their transition toward self-determination (Walker and Ostrove 1995). A relationship is seen between archaeology and nationalism. According to Kohl and Fawcett, as well as Trigger, such a relationship is "not necessarily corrupt or intrinsically suspect", any more than it was when European-Americans were making all the decisions about archeological sites and materials.(Kohl and Fawcett 1995: 3; also Trigger 1983).

Scholars generally support the rights of Indigenous peoples to the sites and materials created and used by their ancestors. Canadian First Nations, and others in like circumstances, "hold better jurisdictional title", thus legislative authority, to heritage resources than either Canada or the provinces (Asch 1997: 66). Yet the disposition of these areas continues to challenge governments: “given the intellectual and political traditions of historically and colonially established behaviour still influential in nominally post-colonial societies, any change becomes an issue of national and inherently contested politics” (Boyd et al. 2005: 92). So while the care and management of heritage materials and sites is often among those areas first offered up by colonial governments at modern negotiating tables, few accommodations are made for the attendant financial demands and regulative license required for these transfers of responsibility (Mohs 1994).

== Self-determination ==
In once-colonial nations, the efforts of current governments to reconcile with First Nations people is having direct effects on the practical and legal aspects of stewardship of archaeological resources. Waves of globally and federally endorsed recognition of Aboriginal rights in general, and of heritage stewardship in particular, are pounding the shores of nominally post-colonial governments (see, for example, Ritchie [1994] on Australia, Watkins [2003] and Wylie [1999] on Canada and the United States, and Whitelaw [2005] on South Africa). Domestic commitments to honourable negotiation (e.g., Canada’s [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] [1996] and British Columbia’s New Relationship with Aboriginal Peoples [2005]) and a flush of heritage-specific pledges to more fully accommodate Native interests (e.g., [[World Archaeological Congress]] 1990, Canadian Archaeological Association 1997, [[Society for American Archaeology]] 1990) are reinvigorating the debate about the values, roles and responsibilities related to heritage stewardship.

The contributions of the indigenous viewpoint to archaeology also aid in addressing the problems of race that are integrated into the practice. The archaeological discourse can take a patronizing and judgmental interpretation of indigenous practices and artifacts without proper context, often portraying indigenous culture as comparatively flawed or inferior in technique and technology. These construe the notion of indigenous culture as particularly alien and foreign, building a racist image to the [[Indigenous_peoples#Non-indigenous_viewpoints|non-indigenous viewpoint]]. The incorporation of the indigenous viewpoint in the academics can normalize their culture in the overall historical narrative, and shift away from portraying indigenous peoples as "savage", and instead evaluate them equally with other world cultures (Echo-Hawk 2006).

The indigenous narrative is significantly influenced by the colonialist tendency to homogenize indigenous culture into one single entity. The contemporary historical sequence focuses on the fall of indigenous cultures as a result of the advent of empires, and portrays the end segment of their history as the only significant contribution. For example, the [[European_colonization_of_the_Americas|colonization of the Americas]] in Central and South America neglect the long history of the [[Aztec_Empire|Aztec]] and [[Inca_Empire|Incan]] empires, and only associates those cultures with defeat in the context of colonization. The complex political and economic infrastructure and achievements of those indigenous societies, and their legacy leading up to that point, is discarded in the narrow scope of the colonial achievement. Additionally, characterizing the indigenous history as an era of collective defeat fails to distinguish between individual indigenous cultures, cutting off their own histories and obscuring the features unique to each society (Oland 2012).

== Indigenous and mainstream archaeologies ==

=== Applications ===
As Indigenous archaeology unfolds, two things are becoming clear that serve to highlight some of the principle similarities and differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives. First, most Indigenous archaeologies hold the view that archaeology makes up only one part of the cultural resources spectrum (Anyon 1991). The inclusion of spiritual, traditional use, linguistic and historical studies are influencing the direction of heritage research and management, just as anthropology’s standard [[Anthropology#Approaches to anthropology|four-field approach]] has done for archaeology. In both traditions, "intellectual and material aspects of these cultural practices are nearly impossible to separate and an attempt to do so threatens or undermines the practices themselves" (Smith and Jackson 2006: 312). Second, where archaeology and Indigenous archaeology diverge, is on the issue of human remains. These, according to most Indigenous practitioners and publics, are not the same as other kinds of cultural resources, their use and disposition should not be subject to the regulations or negotiations. However, archaeologists need them for their research and to advance society’s knowledge. This divide stems from how many people in both groups see the world. Scientists are trained in western schools of thought, which portrays time as linear. People beyond a couple generations into the past are seen as long gone, and it is less taboo to study their remains. In contrast, many indigenous cultures see time as circular and deceased ancestors as a current members of their society.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; In recent years the political climate has favored indigenous people. Many major European and American universities and museums have returned stored remains to indigenous communities around the world.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt;

Despite, or perhaps because of, these differences, Indigenous archaeology should not be seen as exclusive to Indigenous peoples. It has wide relevance outside Indigenous communities (Atalay 2006), where post-colonial methodology is wanting in quantity and quality. The practice of Indigenous archaeology provides non-Native people with a tool by which they may aid in the larger project of decolonization and reclamation of minority rights and identities. It actively recognizes the special rights, interests and responsibilities that Native people have in the realm of cultural heritage (e.g., Anyon 1991, [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith|L.T. Smith]] 2005, Wilson 2007; Yellowhorn 1996). Indigenous archaeology has become part of the greater transformative project of Indigenous research "that is active in pursuit of social and institutional change, that makes space for Indigenous knowledge, and that has a critical view of power relations and inequality" ([[Linda Tuhiwai Smith|L.T. Smith]] 2005: 89).

=== Managing differences ===
Negotiating the difference in Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspective, of course, entails an "increasingly holistic engagement…with modern native peoples who are direct heirs to the traditions they are studying" (Trigger 1990: 781-782), which is changing the whole thrust of archaeological practice and stewardship. Conservative factions in archaeology (e.g. McGhee 2008) are finding the risk of infidelity to the archaeological record too great to sanction an Indigenous archaeology, believing the endeavour to be too subjective to be considered archaeology. Abdicating the use of archaeology's unique set of methods for interpreting the past in favour of alternative lines of evidence (e.g. oral history, genealogical studies) is, critics argue, setting up competing, even incompatible, versions of history.

The disparity between the indigenous and non-indigenous interpretations of archaeological conduct may be addressed by the integration of indigenous perspective in explaining artifacts and observations initially made by non-indigenous archaeologists. The intent and historical background of particular historical remnants offered by the indigenous perspective can assist in the contemporary archaeological approach. For example, the rationale behind choice of material and method used in constructing historical artifacts would allow a fairer evaluation of indigenous technology to be seen in the historical narrative. In the same way, an archaeological approach headed by indigenous researchers could benefit from the input of non-indigenous research. A responsible and equitable account of indigenous history requires that the narratives of different cultures is taken into consideration by the parties involved (Croes 2010).

The late, eminent Canadian theoretician [[Bruce Trigger]] suggested archaeologists continue to rigorously evaluate each history based on "evidence of greater or lesser completeness and accuracy and on more or less sound reasoning" (1997: ix). Advocating a continued use of careful, objective assessment of such qualities can help integrate different aspects of the past into a more complete, holistic picture of history (ibid). The anthropological-Indigenous collaborative model inevitably raises hackles because at some point, somebody’s truth is going to have to be truer than someone else’s to move forward (or it will be presented as such; Cooper 2006). Where archaeologists' version of events contradicts First Nations' beliefs about their history, is each obliged to challenge others' myth-building? "If archaeologists knowingly treat the beliefs of Indian differently from those of Euro-Canadians," writes Trigger, "there is a danger that the discipline will descend into mythography, political opportunism, and bad science" (x). While he asserts that "the only morally defensible option" (x) in such cases is to report the truth (as far as it can be known), the real, social implications this could have on relationships predicated on goodwill and respect may be severe. Trigger acknowledges the influence that both [[cultural relativism]] and the great [[white guilt]] have on archaeologists looking to do the right thing, but maintains that above all, archaeology must retain the scientific method if it can hope to "refute claims being made by fascists, sexists, racists, and Indian-haters" (x). He insists that archaeologists have a responsibility not only to educate people, but to do so "honestly and frankly" (x) and to credit individuals with the ability to form their own opinions.

== Indigenous archaeology in practice ==
As the values and goals of descendent communities are incorporated into the structure of heritage management, a different picture of heritage stewardship should emerge. Where the Western mode is predicated on ideas of the public trust, the Indigenous stewardship paradigm is more often concerned with the care of living history (Smith and Burke 2003: 183-185; also Lawson 1997, Watkins 2003). Assigning custody of heritage on the basis of cultural patrimony respects the "traditionally, or historically, legitimate cultural or spiritual responsibility for the cultural property at hand" (Meskell 2002: 291), and infuses stewardship with a duty of familial care. The differences between the "public trust" school of archaeological thought, and the "cultural legacy" perspective of Indigenous thought have cognitive implications: the former isolates history, failing to link it with other people, places or times, while the latter binds the studied past with the present and future. The distinction can be as simple a matter as considering an archaeological skeletal specimen as object or ancestor (Smith and Burke 2003: 184-185). Or, it can be as complex as demonstrating continuity by drawing one’s past on the landscape for a world that relies on discontinuities to order time and space.

Controlling and preserving culturally significant archaeological materials and shaping the discourse around their history are the other primary issues of indigenous archaeology. The fact based nature of archaeology as a science leads it to value sources that do not have hard evidence, like material information or data, less than those that do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braun|first1=M.J.|title=Bridging the gap: A critical analysis of implementing an indigenous archaeology approach in the management of cultural resources|date=2012|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous archaeology sees this approach as biasing the historical narrative because excludes cultures with non-material methods of preserving history, like oral traditions, from contribution as much to the historical narrative. It advocates for methods similar to the [[Four field approach]] in anthropology to negate this perceived bias.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

Legislation around the stewardship and preservation of archaeological and cultural sites is perceived to be similarly biased as well.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; It is seen as favoring sites that have physical objects there, and often requires them to be relatively untouched by the modernization. This excludes many sites of cultural or religious value to many indigenous communities. Many of these communities are either unwilling or unable to pay for the upkeep of sites that legislation does protect, so archaeologists are brought in to do so.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; This may cause conflict between the two groups, since archaeologists may use invasive methods of preservation that conflict with the desires or traditions of the local community. In response to this, programs for the training of indigenous people in archaeological practices in order to allow them to consult on ongoing dig sites and the consultation of local communities before archaeological experiments begin have become more widespread.&lt;ref name="Jstor1" /&gt; [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM) programs, along with expanded collegiate resources and museum programs in this area are helping to engage local communities and work to address these perceived biases.&lt;ref name="Jstor1" /&gt;

== Global Impact ==
Watkins (2005) presents an overview of the gradual progress of the Indigenizing of archaeology worldwide, lauding the few accomplishments and trying to "interpret the relative quiet of the Indigenous voice" (40). In Australia and New Zealand, Aboriginal peoples are using archeology as part of their reclamation of heritage and assertion of indigenous rights, where it is increasingly used in support of land claims and repatriation issues (39). The Canadian experience follows a similar trajectory, albeit at a slower pace. Specific examples of unambiguously successful Canadian collaborative projects include the partnership in [[British Columbia]] between [[SCES]] and [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU). Another was the [[DNA]] and other studies associated with ''Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi,'' the 500-year-old remains called "Long Ago Man Found", "discovered by sheep hunters in 1999 at the foot of a melting glacier in [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park]] in the [[Yukon]]". There was also cooperation on his reburial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sealaskaheritage.org/news/articles/article_dna_test.htm CATHY BROWN, Associated Press, "Giving blood in a search for history"], 13 June 2001, at Sealaska Heritage Institute, accessed 16 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;(Watkins 2005: 35).

[[File:UNDER THE DIRECTION OF PAUL FRISH, SKILLED NAVAJO WORKMEN PERFORM DELICATE ARCHAEOLOGICAL OPERATIONS. THE DIG IS A... - NARA - 544162.tif|thumb|Navajo workers excavate and archaeological dig.]]

The value of indigenous communities is taking becoming greater in archaeological projects that work with sensitive artifacts and cultural remnants, though conflict between contemporary and indigenous approaches still exist. For example, the integration of indigenous permissions in studying sites, such as Massachusetts's 1983 Unmarked Burial Law, assists in providing indigenous communities a measure of control over archaeological studies. However, indigenous communities dispute on whether or not their cultural practices should be subject to academic and legalistic judgement by external scholars. The demands on indigenous peoples concerning archaeological collaboration involve more burdens on the indigenous community to answer to archaeological probing, while traditional archaeological approaches do not change and fail to accommodate to indigenous needs (Matthews 2009).

The regions of Mesoamerica and South America are beginning the dialogue of indigenous interests in archaeology, which there as elsewhere takes a backseat to more pressing efforts to secure basic rights for First Peoples. The nations of [[Scandinavia]] have made minimal progress in considering the archaeology of the [[Sami people]] as a field of study, let alone involving the descendent populations in projects (Watkins 2005:38). In Africa, attention is focused on fundamental economic and human rights issues, which has forced the issue of indigenous participation in archaeology to the back compared to the status in developed nations (Watkins 2005:39).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">'''John''', called '''Anagnostes''' (i.e. ''lector'', ''reader;'' {{lang-el|Ἰωάννης Ἀναγνώστης}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] historian of the fifteenth century. He was an eyewitness to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|sack]] of [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]] on March 29, 1430; an event he described in detail in his ''Account of the Last Capture of Thessalonica'' ({{lang|grc|Διήγησις περί τῆς τελευταίας άλώσεως τῆς Θεσσαλονίχης}}), which he wrote with an accompanying [[monody]] lamenting the city's fall.

== Background ==

Thessalonica had been captured by the Ottomans in 1387; though they were unable to hold the city in the wake of the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 when it reverted to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Byzantines, when they were unable to hold the city, sold it to the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1423; though not in time to mount a defense against [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|another Ottoman siege]] that year. The Ottomans were again unable to hold the city permanently, and the Venetians and Ottomans were soon in a full state of war.

== Siege of Thessalonica ==

[[File:Murat II.jpg|thumb|right|Ottoman sultan [[Murad II]]]]
Beginning on March 29, 1430, the Ottoman sultan [[Murad II]] began a three-day siege of Thessalonica, resulting in the conquest of the city by the Ottoman army, and the taking of 7,000 inhabitants as slaves. The Venetians agreed to a peace treaty and withdrew from the region in 1432, leaving the Ottoman's with permanent dominion over the region.

'''Kuntowijoyo''' ([[Bantul]], [[Yogyakarta]], 18 September 1943 – 22 February 2005) was an Indonesian writer and academic.

==Biography==
Kuntowijoyo was born in Bantul, Yogyakarta, on 18 September 1943. His father was a [[dhalang]] and [[macapat]] reader, and his great-grandfather was a mushaf writer. When he attended elementary school at Ibtidaiyah [[Madrasah]], he practiced declamation, storytelling, and reading the Koran. He was also mentored by literary figures M. Saribi Arifin and Yusmanan. A voracious reader, in middle school he read works by Indonesian authors such as [[Hamka]], [[HB Jassin]], and [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]]; he graduated in 1959.&lt;ref name=lc&gt;{{harvnb|Language Centre, Kuntowijoyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; while attending high school in [[Surakarta]], he read works of world literature by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Anton Chekov]].&lt;ref name=anwar3&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kompas/&gt; While in high school, he wrote short stories, plays, essays, and novels.&lt;ref name=hwia128&gt;{{harvnb|Hwia|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school in 1962.&lt;ref name=lc/&gt;

During his college days at [[Gadjah Mada University]], he founded the Lembaga Kebudayaan Seniman Islam (Islamic Artists Cultural Institution) and Studi Grup Mantika (together with Ikranagara, [[Arifin C. Noer]], Dawam Rahardjo, Chaerul Umam, Amri Yahya, Sju'bah Asa and Abdul Hadi W. M.).&lt;ref name=anwar4&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he published his first novel, ''Kereta Api yang Berangkat di Pagi Hari'' (''The Train that Leaves Early in the Morning''); it was picked up as a serial by the newspaper ''Djihad'' in 1966. The following year, in 1967, he published his first short story in the literary magazine ''Horison''.&lt;ref name=lc/&gt; In 1969, he graduated from UGM with a degree in history.&lt;ref name=kompas/&gt;

Kuntowijoyo then continued his education in the United States. He obtained his Master of Arts in American History from [[Connecticut University]] (1974) and Ph.D in history from [[Columbia University]] (1980);&lt;ref name=kompas/&gt;&lt;ref name=rampan&gt;{{harvnb|Rampan|2000|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; his doctoral dissertation was titled "Social Change in an Agrarian Society: Madura 1850–1940".&lt;ref name=anwar2&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time in the United States that Kuntowijoyo began writing poetry, publishing two anthologies during this time: ''Suluk Awang-Uwung'' (1975) and ''Isyarat'' (''Signs''; 1976). Both dealt with his experiences while in the United States.&lt;ref name=hwia128/&gt; On his return to Indonesia in 1980, he founded the Centre for Policy Research and Study with [[Amien Rais]] and Chairil Anwar.&lt;ref name=hwia132/&gt; He was also active in various aspects of the Islamic organization [[Muhammadiyah]], although he was critical of them; he wrote that they were a "cultural institution without culture".&lt;ref name=kompas/&gt;

After suffering from [[meningoencephalitis]] in 1991, Kuntowijoyo lost some motor control and found difficulty speaking.&lt;ref name=anwar6&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to write at an increased pace.&lt;ref name=anwar5&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years in a row, from 1995 to 1997, his short stories were chosen as the best stories published by the newspaper ''[[Kompas]]''; stories selected were "Lelaki yang Kawin dengan Peri" ("The Man who Married a Fairy"; 1995), "Pistol Perdamaian" ("Pistol of Peace"; 1996), and "Anjing-anjing Menyerbu Kuburan" ("Dogs Attack a Graveyard"; 1997).&lt;ref name=anwar1&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Kuntowijoyo published a third collection of poetry, entitled ''Makrifat Daun, Daun Makrifat'' (''Faith in Leaves, Leaves of Faith''&lt;!--check translation--&gt;), which dealt with his religious experiences.&lt;ref name=hwia128/&gt; In 2001, ''Kompas'' published his novel ''Mantra Penjinak Ular'' (''Mantra of the Snake Charmer'') as a serial.&lt;ref name=kompas/&gt;

On 21 February 2005, Kuntowijoyo was taken to Sardjito Hospital complaining of diarrhea and difficulty breathing.&lt;ref name=anwar6/&gt;&lt;ref name=hwia134/&gt; He died the next day.&lt;ref name=hwia134&gt;{{harvnb|Hwia|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left behind two works after his death, ''Historical Experience'' (a handbook for students of history) and ''Sejarah Eropa Barat'' (''History of West Europe''); ''Sejarah Eropa Berat'' was published posthumously under the title ''Peran Bourjuasi dalam Transformasi Eropa'' (''Role of the Bourgeois in the Transformation of Europe''; 2005).&lt;ref name=anwar1/&gt; That same year, another of his short stories was selected as the best published in ''Kompas''.&lt;ref name="anwar3"/&gt;

==Style and creative process==
Kuntowijoyo's works, which include many aspects of Islam and [[Javanese culture]], were influenced in part by his childhood. He said that many were based on his own experiences.&lt;ref name=anwar3/&gt;

According to the foreword of his 1999 short story collection ''Hampir Sebuah Subversi'' (''Almost a Subversion''), Kuntowijoyo wrote without previous planning.&lt;ref name=anwar4/&gt; In 2005, towards his death, he wrote that his creative process involved "writing from the inside" (writing about a fictional world as its characters see it) and "writing from the bottom" (writing without using a particular [[literary theory]], but focusing on consistent portrayals of the characters).&lt;ref name=anwar6/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kuntowijoyo married Susilaningish in 1969.&lt;ref name=lc/&gt;&lt;ref name=hwia132&gt;{{harvnb|Hwia|2006|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had two children, Punang Amaripuja (in 2005 a lecturer at the [[Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta]]) and Alun Paradipta.&lt;ref name=kompas&gt;{{harvnb|Mulkhan 2005, Kuntowijoyo sang Begawan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
When he was a student of literature faculty of UGM, he was awarded by Badan Pembina Teater Nasional Indonesia for ''Rumput-Rumput Danau Bento'' (1968) and by Sastra magazine for ''Dilarang Mencintai Bunga-Bunga'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hwia|2006|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anwar|2007|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kōbun period'''  is a [[chronology|chronological]] timeframe during the [[Asuka period]] of Japanese history. The Kōbun period describes a span of years which were considered to have begun in the 1332nd year of the Yamato dynasty.&lt;ref name="murray402"&gt;Murray, {{Google books|ez0qAAAAYAAJ|p. 402|page=402}}, citing William Bramsen. (1880). {{Google books|9jKgVty_XFoC|''Japanese Chronological Tables,'' pp. 54-55|page=54}}; compare, the Japanese [[National Diet Library]] website explains that [http://www.ndl.go.jp/koyomi/e/ "Japan organized its first calendar in the 12th year of Suiko (604)"], which was a pre-''nengō'' time frame.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[periodization]] is consistent with the short reign of [[Emperor Kōbun]],&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du Japon'', pp. 30-56|page=30}}; Varley, H. Paul, (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', pp. 135-136; Brown, Delmer M. ''et al.'' (1979). {{Google books|w4f5FrmIJKIC|''Gukanshō,'' p. 268 n39.|page=268}}; pre-Meiji historians did not count Emperor Tenji's eldest son, Prince Ōtomo in the traditional order of succession.  The ''Nihongi'', the ''Renchū shō'', the ''Gukanshō'', and the ''Jinnō Shōtōki'' do not list Kōbun as sovereign between the reigns of Emperor Tenji and Emperor Temmu. This sovereign was posthumously identified as Emperor Kōbun after 1870.&lt;/ref&gt; which is traditionally considered to have been from 672 through 673.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, David. (1894). {{Google books|ez0qAAAAYAAJ|''The Story of Japan,'' p. 402|page=402}}; the system of counting from year-periods (nengō) do not ordinarily overlap with the reigns of the early monarchs; and generally, a new one was chosen whenever it was deemed necessary to commemorate an auspicious or ward off a malign event.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periodization==
The  adoption of the [[Sexagenary cycle]] calendar (''Jikkan Jūnishi'') in Japan is attributed to [[Empress Suiko]] in 604;&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Jikkan Jūnishi''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 420|page=420}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this Chinese calendar continued in use throughout the Kōbun period.

In 645, the system of {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]s|年号,|''nengō'',|lit. "year name"}} was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|p. 30.|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after the reign of [[Emperor Kotoku]], this method of segmenting [[time]] was temporarily abandoned or allowed to lapse. This interval continued during the Kōbun period.

Neither Emperor Kōbun's reign nor the Kōbun periodization are included in the list of ''nengō'' for this explicit  duration of [[time]]. The {{nihongo|[[Sujaku period|''Sujaku'' period]]|朱雀|Sujaku|}} was an unofficial ''nengō'' during the reign of Emperor Kōbun&lt;ref name="murray402"/&gt; after ''[[Hakuchi (era)|Hakuchi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "''Hakuchi''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 280.|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before ''[[Suchō]].''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "''Shuchō''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 889.|page=889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The duration of this discrete non-''nengō'' timespan lasted for about two years.

In the post-Taika or pre-Taihō chronology, the first year of Emperor Kōbun's reign (弘文天皇元年 or 弘文天皇1年) is also construed as the first year of the Kōbun period (弘文1年).&lt;ref name="tsuchihashi16"&gt;Tsuchihashi, Paul. (1952). [https://books.google.com/books?ei=7QY6TbbKOYT58AaIpuTaCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=0HfrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Tsuchihashi+paul&amp;q=saimei#search_anchor  ''Japanese Chronological Tables from 601 to 1872,'' p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-nengō period==
Non-nengō periods in the pre-Taihō calendar were published in 1880 by [[William Bramsen]].&lt;ref name="murray402"/&gt; These were refined in 1952 by [[Paul Tsuchihashi]] in ''Japanese Chronological Tables from 601 to 1872''.&lt;ref name="tsuchihashi16"/&gt;

The pre-Tahiō calendar included two non-nengō gaps or [[Interval (time)|intervals]] in the chronological series:
:*[[Taika (era)|Taika]], August 645&amp;ndash;February 650.&lt;ref name="nussbaum9241"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Taika''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 924|page=924}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Hakuchi (era)|Hakuchi]], February 650&amp;ndash;December 654.&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Hakuchi''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 280|page=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:**Non-nengō dating systems
:*[[Shuchō]], July&amp;ndash;September 686.&lt;ref name="nussbaum889"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Shuchō''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC| p. 889|page=889}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:**Non-nengō dating systems
:*[[Taihō (era)|Taihō]], March 701&amp;ndash;May 704.&lt;ref name="nussbaum924"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Taihō''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 924|page=924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nengō were not promulgated (or were allowed to lapse) during the gap years between Hakuchi and Shuchō, and in another gap between Shuchō and Taihō.

==Events of the Kōbun period==
* '''672''' (''Kōbun 1''):  Emperor Tenji dies; and his son, Prince Ō-ama (later to become Emperor Tenmu), declines to receive the succession (''senso'').  Shortly thereafter, his older brother, Ō-tomo (posthumously known as Emperor Kōbun after 1870), formally accedes to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''672''' (''Kōbun 1''): A new period is marked by the beginning of the reign of Emperor Kōbun; but this posthoumus name was created retroactively in 1870, and Meiji scholars did not determine retroactively that a new nengō should have commenced with the beginning of Kōbun's accession.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, {{Google books|w4f5FrmIJKIC|p. 268 n39.|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(This article lists some of the '''states''', '''empires''', or '''dynasties''' that were ruled by a Muslim elite, or which were in some way central to or a part of a Muslim empire.)   

All the disparate Islamic Empires can all be traced back to Muhammad, as the founder not only of the Islamic faith but also the first leader of the Muslim people.   

Scholars debate what exactly constitutes an [[empire]]. One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  

== History of Muslim states==
The [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].

While the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into "Islamic empires", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.

== Caliphates ==

University of California, San Diego, 2008. 130 pages, 3320357&lt;/ref&gt; A military brat's childhood or adolescent life may be immersed in [[military]] culture to the point where the mainstream culture of their home country may seem foreign or [[peripheral]].&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suarez"/&gt; In a number of countries (but not all) where there are military brat subcultures, the child's family moves great distances from one non-combat assignment to another for much of their youth.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suarez"/&gt;  For highly mobile military brats, a mixed cultural identity often results, due to exposure to numerous national or regional cultures.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suarez"/&gt;

Within military culture, the term "military brat" is not considered to be a [[pejorative]] (as in describing a [[spoiled child]]), but rather connotes affection and respect.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chatterjee/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eprints.utas.edu.au"&gt;Cranston, CA. [http://eprints.utas.edu.au/9597/1/Military_Brats%5B1%5D.pdf "Challenging Contemporary Ecocritical Place Discourses: Military Brats, Shadow Places, and Homeplace Consumerism"]. ''Indian Journal of Ecocriticism'', V. 2, 2009. pp. 73-89. ISSN 0974-2840&lt;/ref&gt; 

War-related family stresses, including long-term war-related absence of a parent, as well as war aftermath issues, are common features of military brat life in some countries, although the degree of war-involvement of individual countries with military brat subcultures may vary.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suarez"/&gt;

==Life and culture==

A common pattern in these subcultures is a heavy childhood and adolescent immersion in military culture to the point of [[marginalizing]] (or having significant feelings of difference in relation to) one's national civilian culture.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ender/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suarez/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enloe, Cynthia H. p. 186"&gt;Enloe, Cynthia H. ''Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives'', p. 186. University of California Press; 1st edition, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-520-22071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is characterized by a strong identification with military culture rather than civilian culture.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ender/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suarez/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enloe, Cynthia H. p. 186"/&gt; Another term for this is the "militarization of childhood".&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ender/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suarez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enloe, Cynthia H. p. 186"/&gt;

In a number of countries where military brat subcultures occur (but with some exceptions and to varying degrees), there may also be an [[Nomadism|itinerant]] or modern [[nomad]]ic lifestyle involved as the child follows their military parent(s) from base to base, in many cases never having a hometown (or at least going through very long periods of being away from one's home town).&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chatterjee/&gt;&lt;ref name="eprints.utas.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/8346411.stm|work=BBC News|title=Forces children face time bomb|date=&lt;!-- Friday, --&gt; 6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also can involve living outside of one's home country at or near overseas military bases in foreign cultures, or in regions within one's home country far from one's home region, along with experiences of significant cultural difference in either case.&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eprints.utas.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John P. ''Army of Hope, Army of Alienation: Culture and Contradiction in the American Army Communities of Cold War Germany''.

The term "military brat" occurs within military cultures in [[Australia]],&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ender/&gt; [[India]] (also called "Cantonment Kids" or "Fauji brats"),&lt;ref name=Chatterjee/&gt; [[Canada]] (also called "Base Brats"),&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ender/&gt; [[Pakistan]] (Military Brat, Army Brat, Fauji Brat) the [[Philippines]],{{Citation needed|date= December 2010}} [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name=Ender/&gt; the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="eprints.utas.edu.au"/&gt; and the [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|United States]].&lt;ref name="Military Brats"/&gt; Military-dependent subcultures, also known as [[camp followers]],{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}} have existed (under various other names) in many parts of the world for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;
Holmes, Richard; ed (2001). ''The Oxford Companion to Military History''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-866209-2}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the expression "military brat" is not normally used. The equivalent is "service brat", but more normally children refer to themselves as "army brats" or as "air force brats". This reflects the usage of the word "military" in British English, where it is still often used (especially officially) in its original sense of referring to the army only; hence, the ''Manual of Military Law'', the ''Manual of Naval Law'' and ''Manual of Air Force Law'' were replaced by the ''Manual of Service Law''. The expression "service" or "forces" is normally used as the adjective to cover all three services.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Feelings of difference, military brat identity versus civilian identity==

Many military brats report difficulty in identifying where they belong&lt;ref name=Pollack/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eidse&gt;Eidse, Faith; Sichel,  Nina.

Washington, D.C.: American Forces Press Service (US Department of Defense Publication), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; These military-dependent [[subculture]]s are generations old.&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;

However, some ex-military dependents have found that their mobile upbringing has actually been massively influential in determining their eventual career in adulthood. One example of this is British actress/comedian Dawn French who discussed her childhood as an RAF dependent in an interview with Radio 4. She stated that she felt that the need to make new friends every few years was one of the reasons she discovered her talent for comedy. She also discusses this aspect of her life in her autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Dear Fatty by Dawn French&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cliff was born in 1925 in [[Yantai]] (formerly, Chefoo) to Howard and Mary Cliff, both pharmacists who were working as missionaries with the [[China Inland Mission]] (CIM). As part of the [[Chefoo School]], a boarding school of the CIM, Cliff was interned by the Japanese at the [[Weixian Internment Camp]] from 1943 until 1945, when the camp was freed by American [[paratroopers]].&lt;ref name="weihsien"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weihsien-paintings.org/NormanCliff/indexFrame.htm|title=The Life and Testimony of Norman Howard Cliff, 1925-2007|last=Horne|first=Estelle Cliffe|date=|website=Weihsien|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff later went on to pursue a B.A. from the [[University of South Africa]] and a [[B.Com.]] from [[Rhodes University]]. He worked as a minister and an accountant for the [[United Reformed Church]] in South Africa, before returning to Britain due to poor health.&lt;ref name="weihsien"/&gt; Back in the UK, Cliff earned an [[MPhil]] at the [[Open University]] in 1983, writing a thesis on the theology of [[Watchman Nee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Cliff|first=Norman Howard|title=The Life and Theology of Watchman Nee, Including a Study of the Little Flock Movement Which he Founded|date=1983|degree=MPhil|publisher=Open University|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/230634259/|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[PhD]] at [[Buckingham University]] in  1995, writing a thesis on the history of Protestant missions in [[Shandong]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Cliff|first=Norman Howard|title=A history of the Protestant movement in Shandong Province, China, 1859-1951|date=1995|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Buckingham|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304301557|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omar ibn Said''' (1770–1864) was a writer and Islamic scholar and a convert to Christianity, born and educated in what is now Senegal, who was enslaved and transported to the United States in 1807.  There, while enslaved for the remainder of his life, he wrote a series of works of history and theology, including a posthumously famous autobiography.

== Biography ==
Omar ibn Said was born in present-day [[Senegal]] in [[Futa Tooro]],&lt;ref name="autobiography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/omarsaid/omarsaid.html |title=Autobiography of Omar ibn Said, Slave in North Carolina, 1831 |author=Omar ibn Said |year=1831 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a region along the Middle [[Senegal River]] in [[West Africa]], to a wealthy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/omarsaid/bio.html |title=Omar ibn Said, b. 1770? |work=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography |first=William S. |last=Powell |year=1979 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an [[Islamic]] scholar and a [[Fula people|Fula]] who spent 25 years of his life studying with prominent Muslim scholars, learning subjects ranging from arithmetic to theology in [[Africa]]. In 1807, he was captured during a military conflict, enslaved and taken across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[United States]]. He escaped from a cruel master in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], and journeyed to [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], [[North Carolina]]. There he was recaptured and later sold to [[James Owen (American statesman)|James Owen]]. Said lived into his mid-nineties and was still a slave at the time of his death in 1864. He was buried in [[Bladen County]], North Carolina. Omar ibn Said was also known as Uncle Moreau and Prince Omeroh.&lt;ref name="autobiography"/&gt;

Although Omar converted to [[Christianity]] on December 3, 1820, many modern scholars believe he continued to be a practicing Muslim, based on dedications to Muhammad written in his [[Bible]], and a card dated 1857 on which he wrote Surat [[An-Nasr]], a short sura which refers to the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam 'in multitudes.' The back of this card contains another person's handwriting in English misidentifying the sura as the [[Lord's Prayer]] and attesting to Omar's status as a good Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/highlights/omarsaid.html |title=Omar ibn Said, African Muslim Enslaved in the Carolinas |first=Patrick E. |last=Horn |publisher=University Library, [[University of North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while others writing on Omar's behalf identified him as a Christian, his own autobiography and other writings offer more of an ambiguous position. In the autobiography, he still offers praise to Muhammad when describing his life in his own country; his references to "Jesus the Messiah" in fact parallel Quranic descriptions of Jesus (who is called المسيح 'the Messiah' a total of 11 times in the Quran), and descriptions of Jesus as 'our lord/master' (سيدنا) employ the typical Islamic honorific for prophets and is not to be confused with Lord (ربّ); and description of Jesus as 'bringing grace and truth' (a reference to John 1:14) is equally appropriate to the conception of [[Jesus in Islam]]. Given Omar's circumstances of enslavement "among the Christians" and the possibilities of lobbying for his freedom that only came with confessing Christianity, his conversion can be argued to have been made under duress. In 1991, a [[masjid]] in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]] renamed itself Masjid Omar Ibn Said in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.davidson.edu/archives/ency/omars.asp Omar ibn Said] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516133242/http://library.davidson.edu/archives/ency/omars.asp |date=2008-05-16 }} Davidson Encyclopedia Tammy Ivins, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Surat al Mulk bu Omar bin Said (1770-1864).jpg|left|thumb|[[Sura]]t [[Al-Mulk]] from the [[Qur'an]] copied by Omar ibn Said]]
Omar ibn Said is widely known for fourteen manuscripts that he wrote in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Out of all of his Arabic manuscripts, he is best known for his [[autobiographical]] essay written  in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Curiel. ''Al'America''. pp.30-32.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes some of the events of his life and includes reflections on his steadfast adherence to Islam and his openness towards other 'God fearing' people. On the surface the document may appear to be tolerant towards slavery, however Said begins it with [[Al-Mulk|Surat Al-Mulk]], a chapter from the [[Qur'an]], which states that only God has sovereignty over human beings.

Most of Said's other work consisted of Islamic manuscripts in Arabic, including a handwritten copy of some short chapters ([[sura]]t) from the [[Qur'an]] that are now part of the [[North Carolina Collection]] in the [[Wilson Library]] at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  Transcribing from memory, ibn Said made some mistakes in his work, notably at the start of [[Sura]]t [[An-Nasr]]. His Bible, a translation into Arabic published by a missionary society, which has notations in Arabic by Omar, is part of the rare books collection at [[Davidson College]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.davidson.edu/archives/encyclopedia/omar-ibn-sayyid&lt;/ref&gt; Said was also the author of a letter dated 1819 and addressed to James Owen's brother, Major John Owen, written in Arabic and containing numerous Quranic references (including from the above-mentioned Surat Al-Mulk), which also includes several geometric symbols and shapes which point to its possible esoteric intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/jais/volume/docs/vol5/5_hunwick.pdf |first=John O. |last=Hunwick |authorlink= John Hunwick|title=I Wish to be Seen in Our Land Called Afrika: Umar b.

'''Robert Jacobus Forbes''' or '''Robert James Forbes''' (21 April 1900, [[Breda]] – 13 January 1973, [[Haarlem]]) was a Dutch [[chemist]] and [[historian of science]] and professor in the history of applied science and technology at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. 

In his days Forbes was internationally one of the best known and respected historian of technology,&lt;ref name ='Homburg_2013'/&gt; and recipient of the first [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]], the highest award by the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT).&lt;ref name='Snelders_1973'/&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Family, youth and education ===
Forbes was born in Breda as son of William Forbes, a military engineer and later administrator at the [[Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij]],&lt;ref name ='Homburg_2013'/&gt; and Maria Sara Johanna (van Houten) Forbes. The Forbes family was of Scottish origin and a descendant of the Scottish theologian [[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes of Corse]]. He spent much of his childhood in China,&lt;ref name="LB 1973"/&gt; where he attended the Public School of the International Settlement in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name='Snelders_1973'/&gt; 

Back in the Netherlands from 1912 to 1917 he attended the [[Hogere Burgerschool]] (HBS) in Leiden. From 1917 to 1923 he studied chemical technology at the [[Delft University of Technology]], where he obtained his engineering degree.&lt;ref name='Snelders_1973'/&gt;  

=== Career ===
From 1923 to 1958 Forbes worked for [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. The first two years he worked as chemist at the [[Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam]]. From 1925 to 1931 he worked in the [[Dutch East Indies]] as engineer at oil-refinery at Balikpapan, [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name="LB 1973"/&gt; After his return to the Netherlands in 1931 he did research about the application of [[asphalt]] in the construction of roads. In the later years he moved into the development of analytic methods, and participated in the Standardization Committee of the [[Institute of Petroleum]] in London.&lt;ref name="LB 1973"/&gt; In his last three years from 1952 to 1955 he managed the scientific publication department, and wrote about the history of the Royal Dutch Shell.&lt;ref name='Snelders_1973'/&gt; 

In 1947 Forbes had also been appointed professor in the history of applied science and technology at the [[University of Amsterdam]].  After his retirement from Shell in 1958 he was secretary of the [[Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen]] in Haarlem as successor of the late [[Johannes Abraham Bierens de Haan]]. In 1960 he was appointed professor in the history of physics and chemistry at the University of Amsterdam.&lt;ref name='Snelders_1973'/&gt;  

Forbes retired from the University of Amsterdam on September 1, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;"Prof. dr. ir. RJ Forbes, 1900 - 1973," at ''albumacademicum.uva.nl.'' Accessed 2017-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; He passed away at his home at [[Haarlem]] January 13, 1971 at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="LB 1973"/&gt;   

=== Recognition ===
In 1953 Forbes was awarded an [[Honorary degree]] by the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]]. He was appointed member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1959. The [[Newcomen Society]] awarded him the Dickinson Memorial Medal in 1960, and elected him Honorary President. In 1962 Forbes was awarded the first [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]] by the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT).&lt;ref name="LB 1973"/&gt;

== Work ==
As science historian Forbes wrote about the history of technology, particularly oil technology in the [[ancient world]]. In the 1930s he had studied the use of [[bitumen]], [[asphalt]], [[petroleum]] and building of roads in the Ancient world. Subsequently he had studied metals and mining from 1935 to 1950, and in between also ancient [[irrigation]] and [[water resource management]] in the years 1938 to 1941.&lt;ref name='Snelders_1973'/&gt;  

Forbes also wrote a book about [[Simon Stevin]], describing Stevin's [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] building and [[hydraulic engineering]] work. His work ''A history of science and technology'', written with [[Eduard Dijksterhuis]], proposed a synthesis of the [[history of science]]. In total Forbes published over thirty books and about two hundred articles.&lt;ref name="LB 1973"/&gt;  

=== History of ancient roads and their construction ===
In his youth Forbes had developed an interest in [[archaeology]], which became of interest when he started to study the application of asphalt in the construction of roads at Shell in 1931. Under guidance of the Dutch archaeologist and orientalist [[Henri Frankfort]], Forbes went to Iraq to collect samples of ancient [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], which he analyzed in the Shell laboratory. This research first let to the 1934 publication of ''Notes on the history of ancient roads and their construction.''&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, R.J. ''Notes on the History of Ancient Roads and Their Construction.'' Amsterdam: Uitgeversmij, 1934. Print, {{OCLC|406562923}}; 2nd ed., Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1964. {{OCLC|484066898}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was reviewed in multiple publications.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by Jotham Johnson in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''39''', #3 (July–September 1935), pp. 427-428, {{JSTOR|498643}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by C. E. Stevens in ''The Classical Review'' '''49''', #2 (May 1935), p. 87, {{JSTOR|699882}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by I. A. Richmond in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''25''' (1935), pp. 113-114, {{JSTOR|296571}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Forbes also published ''Bitumen and petroleum in antiquity.''&lt;ref name ='Homburg_2013'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Forbes, Robert James. Bitumen and petroleum in antiquity. Reviewed by K. C. Bailey," in: ''The Classical Review'', '''50''', #6 (December 1936), p. 243, {{JSTOR|705523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work Forbes summarize the use of [[bitumen]] and [[petroleum]] in antiquity, as Hassan (2013) described, that: 
{{Quote|...five thousand years ago [[Sumer|Sumerians]], [[Mesopotamians]] and [[Egyptians]] made use of petroleum for several purposes. During this period, the inhabitants of Sumeria made use of asphalt to fix pictures and designs on walls and floors, while in Mesopotamia people used bitumen to help construct water canals. They also used it as sealant in the joints of wooden boats to enable hitch free water transportation...&lt;ref name="AH 2013"&gt;Hassan, Aminu. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aminu_Hassan/publication/259583043_Review_of_the_Global_Oil_And_Gas_Industry_A_Concise_Journey_From_Ancient_Time_to_Modern_World/links/0deec52cc4c86e9993000000/Review-of-the-Global-Oil-And-Gas-Industry-A-Concise-Journey-From-Ancient-Time-to-Modern-World.pdf Review of the global oil and gas industry: a concise journey from ancient time to modern world]." ''Petroleum Technology Development Journal'' 3 (2) (2013). p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Hassan (2013) Forbes had also pointed out, that "by 347 AD the Chinese local oil and gas industry had developed considerably, because oil wells up to 800 feet were being drilled using bits connected to bamboo poles."&lt;ref name="AH 2013"/&gt; 

=== Cooperation at the University of Amsterdam ===  

At the University of Amsterdam he became befriended with David Cohen (1882–1967), professor of Ancient History, who became his mentor. He became supporter of the Allard Pierson Stichting with its [[Allard Pierson Museum]], the archaeological museum of the University of Amsterdam, and joined the Vooraziatisch-Egyptisch Gezelschap Ex Oriente Lux. Their annual publication gave Forbes a forum to publish his work.&lt;ref name ='Homburg_2013'/&gt;  

In Shell his historical work became known to its chairman [[Henri Deterding]], who supported the publication of his work. With Deterding Shell supported the Allard Pierson Stichting, which initiated the chair for the history of applied science and technology at the University of Amsterdam in 1946 for Forbes.&lt;ref name ='Homburg_2013'/&gt;

=== ''Bibliographia Antiqua: Philosophia Naturalis'' 1940–1963 ===

[[Dom (title)|Dom]] '''Serenus Cressy, [[Order of St. Benedict|O.S.B.]]''', (ca. 1605 –10 August 1674) was an [[English people|English]] [[religious conversion|convert]] and [[Benedictine monk]], who became a noted scholar in [[Church history]].

==Life==

===Anglican chaplain===
He was born '''Hugh Paulinus de Cressy''' at [[Thorpe Salvin]], Yorkshire, about 1605, the son of Hugh de Cressy and Margery d'Oylie of London. Educated first at Wakefield Grammar school, when fourteen years old he went to Oxford, where he took the degree of B.A. in 1623 and that of M.A. in 1627. He attended became a fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], earning his [[Masters degree]] in [[theology]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Hind&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04486b.htm Hind, George. "Hugh Paulinus Serenus Cressy."] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Having taken [[Anglican]] [[Holy Orders|orders]], after leaving Oxford he served as [[chaplain]] to Lord [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and then to Lord [[Lucius Cary, 3rd Viscount Falkland]], whom Cressy accompanied to [[Ireland]] in 1638. During his stay in Ireland, Cressy was appointed as [[Dean of Leighlin]], but returned to England in 1639.  He received the post of [[canon (priest)|canon]] in the [[collegiate chapter]] of [[Windsor, Berkshire]], in 1642, but was not able to occupy the position due to the troubled times England was experiencing then.&lt;ref name=Hind/&gt;

===Roman Catholic Benedictine===
After his patron, Lord Falkland, was killed in battle in 1643, Cressy went into the service of Lord [[Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth|Charles Berkeley]], who later was to become the 1st Earl of Falmouth. For some time he traveled abroad as tutor to Lord Falmouth, through the countries of Roman Catholic Europe, where he was exposed to the life and thought of that faith. Upon arriving in [[Rome]] in 1646, Cressy made the decision to enter the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. George Henry Tavard believes this decision was hastened by events of the [[English Civil War]] which brought Cressy to exile in France, where a number of Anglican High-Church adherents found French Catholicism not far from their own sympathies. Cressy took exception to the Protestant emphasis on scripture alone without authoritative interpretation.&lt;ref name=Tavard/&gt; At this point he traveled to [[Paris]] to take instruction from [[the Reverend]] [[Henry Holden]], an English [[theologian]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He then published his most noted work, the ''Exomologesis'', wherein he explained the motives which led him to change his religion.&lt;ref name=Hind/&gt; In some ways Cressy's views on Tradition prefigure [[John Henry Newman]]'s observations in his 1845 ''Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine''.&lt;ref name=Tavard/&gt;

When he had become a Roman Catholic, Cressy considered entering the [[Carthusians]], but eventually opted to join the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine Order]], which he did in 1648. He was so poor, however, that Queen [[Henrietta Maria]] had to give him money for the journey. He then entered the [[novitiate]] of the English Congregation of Benedictines, which was based in [[Douai, France]] and was given the name of '''Serenus''', by which he is now known. He [[professed]] monastic vows on 22 August 1649.

He was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1651. That same year he was sent to serve as chaplain to the monastery of [[English people|English]] Benedictine nuns, then still in Paris. While there he began his work on the text of Julian of Norwich.&lt;ref name=McAvoy&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RK9m-yLqPdgC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=Serenus+de+Cressy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IUiHVIGWDIieggT1h4DwBQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Serenus%20de%20Cressy&amp;f=false McAvoy, Liz Herbert. ''Authority and the Female Body in the Writings of Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe''], p.225, Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2004, {{ISBN|9781843840084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to his own monastery in Douai, he undertook an extensive study of the history of monasticism in England. He also translated several works by various English [[mysticism|mystical]] writers across a span of centuries.

Cressy was assigned to return to England in 1660 to serve as one of the chaplains to Queen [[Catherine of Braganza]], wife of King [[Charles II of England]] and a Roman Catholic. For four years he resided at [[Somerset House]], which served as her official residence.&lt;ref name=Juliana&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zukDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;dq=Serenus+de+Cressy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUPSxbT-F0&amp;sig=bHtkz-wEmuF0irjOAppSaQ4Pd88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hTyHVPH7JYOZNrHqgYgP&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Serenus%20de%20Cressy&amp;f=false Juliana of Norwich. ''XVI revelations of divine love, publ. by S. Cressy''], Preface, S. Clarke, London, 1843&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in theological controversies with Bishop George Worley of Worcester and [[Edward Stillingfleet]].&lt;ref name=Tavard&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tr8eAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Serenus+de+Cressy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jk2HVOakC8qfgwTcjoGgAw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Serenus%20de%20Cressy&amp;f=false Tavard, George Henry. ''The Seventeenth-Century Tradition: A Study in Recusant Thought''], Brill, 1978, {{ISBN|9789004054561}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to provide spiritual care to the Catholic [[John Caryll (senior)|Caryll family]] and died at [[East Grinstead]], Sussex on 10 August 1674.&lt;ref name=Juliana/&gt;

He is described as a quick and accurate disputant, a man of good nature and manners, and no inconsiderable preacher. He is also said to have been particularly temperate in controversy.&lt;ref name=Juliana/&gt;

==Works==
He published his ''Exomologesis'' (Paris, 1647), or account of his conversion; it was valued by Roman Catholics as an answer to [[William Chillingworth]]'s attacks.
 
Cressy's major work, ''The Church History of Brittanny or England, from the beginning of Christianity to the Norman Conquest'' (1st vol. only published, Rouen, 1668), gives an exhaustive account of the foundation of monasteries during the [[Saxon heptarchy]], and asserts that they followed the [[Benedictine Rule]], differing in this respect from many historians. The work was criticized by [[Lord Clarendon]], but defended by [[Anthony à Wood]] in his ''Athenae Oxoniensis'', who supports Cressy's statement that it was compiled from original manuscripts and from the ''Annales Ecclesiae'' of [[Michael Alford]], [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Monasticon'', and the ''Decem Scriptores Historiae Anglicanae''.

The second part of the history, which has never been printed, was discovered at [[Douai]] in 1856. Cressy also edited [[Walter Hilton]]'s ''Scale of Perfection'' (London, 1659); Dom [[Augustine Baker]]'s ''Sancta Sophia'' (2 vols, Douai, 1657);&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm5R0S-pYB8C&amp;pg=PT25&amp;dq=Serenus+de+Cressy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AlWHVPj_K8arNufVgvAP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Serenus%20de%20Cressy&amp;f=false Baker, Augustine. ''Holy Wisdom: or, Directions for the Prayer of Contemplation''], CCEL, {{ISBN|9781610252256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juliana of Norwich]]'s ''Sixteen Revelations on the Love of God'' (1670). These books might have been lost but for Cressy's zeal.

For a complete list of Cressy's works see [[Joseph Gillow]]'s ''Bibliographical Dictionary of the English Catholics'', vol. I.

There is a lengthy speech attributed to Cressy in [[Joseph Henry Shorthouse]]'s novel, ''John Inglesant''.

'''Sir Thomas Braddell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CMG|FRGS|FESL}} (30 January 1823 – 19 September 1891)&lt;ref name=irish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igas.org.sg/irish-people-in-singapore.php|title=Irish people in Singapore|publisher=Irish Graduates Association of Singapore|year=2007|accessdate=16 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215125312/http://www.igas.org.sg/irish-people-in-singapore.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Irish lawyer, the first [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]] of the British Colony of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1212_2008-01-30.html|title=Thomas Braddell|website=SingaporeInfopedia|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/reF&gt;

He was born in Rahingrany, [[County Wicklow]]&lt;ref name=irish/&gt; and [[called to the bar]] at [[Gray's Inn]] in 1859.&lt;ref name=agc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agc.gov.sg/about-us|work=The Attorney-General's Chambers|title=History|publisher=Singapore Government|accessdate=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the role of [[Attorney-General]] of Singapore from 1 April 1867 to 1 January 1883. In 1883, his son Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell was himself attorney-general and, with his brother Robert Wallace, Lee Braddell founded the Singapore legal firm of Braddell Brothers.&lt;ref name=agc/&gt;

In the 1850s, he published historical works on the early settlement of Singapore in the ''Journal of the Indian Archipelago''.&lt;ref name=slb&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_226_2005-01-20.html|title=Braddell Road|author=Cornelius, V.|year=2004|work=SingaporeInfopedia|accessdate=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Thomas Braddell, C.M.G., F.R.G.S., F.E.S.L.,was born on 30 January 1823 at Raheengraney, Co. Wicklow, the property of his grandfather, the Rev. Henry Braddell, M.A., Rector of Carnew, Co. Wicklow.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 423&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sugar planter===
At the age of nearly seventeen he went to [[Demerara]] with his brother, George William, to learn sugar planting. The brother died there in 1840, and in 1844 Thomas Braddell arrived at [[Penang]] from Demerara to manage the sugar estate called Otaheite, in the [[Air Itam|Ayer Hitam]] Valley, which belonged to Messrs. Brown and Co. About this time a great impetus had been given to the sugar industry in the Straits by the new sugar duties, with the result that Brown and Co. opened in 1846 the [[Batu Kawan]] Estate, in [[Province Wellesley]], of which Mr. Braddell became the manager and owner of one quarter ; but the estate got inundated in a very high tide, the crop was lost, and the venture ended.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Public service in Penang===
On 1 January 1849 Mr. Braddell joined the service of the [[East India Company]] as Deputy Superintendent of Police at Penang. After holding various offices in Penang, the Province, and [[Malacca]], he was promoted to the highest position which any uncovenanted servant of the Company had ever held, that of Assistant Resident Councillor, Penang, a post which had previously been held by a [[covenanted civilian]] or high military officer. He earned this promotion for an act which made him famous at the time, and gained him the quickest promotion in Government service then known. In 1854 the most serious clan riots ever known broke out in Singapore, and the feud spread to Malacca, where the Chinese broke out, took possession of the country parts, and built a stockade in one of the main roads, where they defied the police. Mr. Braddell, who was at that time stationed in Malacca, without the slightest assistance and without calling on the military, went out with all the police he could get together, attacked the Chinese, killed and wounded several of them, took the stockade, and summarily ended the riots, for which act he was publicly thanked by the Governor.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 424&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barrister of Gray's Inn===
He was not satisfied with his prospects in the Company as an uncovenanted servant, and commenced to study for the Bar, a natural bent, seeing that from 1801 relatives of his had been at the [[Irish Bar]]. On 10 June 1859 he was called at [[Gray's Inn]] ; in 1862 he resigned the Company's service and went to Singapore, where he commenced practice in partnership with Mr. [[Abraham Logan]], as Logan and Braddell.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;

===Attorney-general, Singapore===
In 1864 he was appointed as [[Crown Counsel]],&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; and when the Transfer took place was appointed [[Attorney-General]], an office which he held until the end of 1882. In February 1858 Mr. Braddell had written a pamphlet entitled " Singapore and the [[Straits Settlements]] Described," because of the agitation then going on about the Transfer. In this pamphlet (which proved very useful and most opportune) he discussed the best way of governing and administering the Straits, and several of his suggestions were adopted. He wanted the Government of the Straits to be quite distinct from that of India, and that the sources from which the officials were derived should also be distinct. The pamphlet was a remarkable piece of constructive statesmanship, and showed his fitness for the high office to which he was appointed when his suggestions came to be put into practice. He was a most indefatigable worker, and used to sit up very late at night at his work.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 424–425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Many hats: public servant, private practitioner, Malay scholar, historian===
In addition to his multifarious duties, he found or made time to become a fine Malay scholar, to write innumerable articles in [[Singapore Free Press|Logan's Journal]], and to collect material for a history of Singapore, which, however, he never actually wrote, but which was the foundation of Mr. Charles Burton Buckley's "An Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore", and indeed prompted Mr. Buckley to undertake that most valuable work. Mr. Braddell was certainly one of the busiest men of his day, his court practice (for the Attorney-General was allowed private practice at that time) was very large and lucrative, his duties as Attorney-General were very heavy, but he always found time for public work. As Mr. Buckley put it in his history, " there are some who wonder why Mr. Braddell, who was a very busy man, should have spent so much time and taken so much trouble about the stories of this place ; but he was one of those, like Mr. [[John Crawfurd]], [[John Turnbull Thomson]], [[George Windsor Earl]], John Cameron (author of Our tropical possessions in Malayan India), and others, who were very willing to use their spare time in endeavouring to record the history of the place, the growing importance of which they foresaw and appreciated."&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andrew Clarke and the Pangkor Treaty===
When [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Sir Andrew Clarke]] was sent out with orders to solve the problem of the Native States, he relied very strongly on Mr. Braddell, and appointed him [[Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements|Colonial Secretary]] and Secretary for Affairs relating to the Native States in 1875. To Mr. Braddell was due much of the success of the conference which concluded the [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|Treaty of Pangkor]] in 1874, which Sir Andrew described as "the very best stroke of policy that has occurred since the British flag was seen in the Archipelago."&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 425–426&lt;/ref&gt;

He was exceedingly popular with all the Malay chiefs and principal men, who used to come from all parts to consult him. Being a very fine Malay scholar and having a most courteous manner, he was able to exert great influence with them, the following instance of which is given in Sir Andrew Clarke's diary.&lt;ref name=ReferenceB&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 426&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1874 Sir Andrew Clarke, with Admiral Sir [[Charles Shadwell (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Shadwell]], went up to Selangor, and arrived at Langat, the residence of the [[Sultan of Selangor]] and the pirates' headquarters. The place was strongly fortified with big guns, and as Sir Andrew wrote in his diary, " the fort itself, both inside and outside, was covered with some hundreds of very villainous-looking Malays armed to the teeth." Major [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]], with a party, was sent ashore to ask the Sultan to come off and see His Excellency, but the Sultan refused, and Major McNair, after waiting three hours, returned, having effected nothing. Sir Andrew's diary then proceeds:

"Braddell, my Attorney-General, then landed alone, smoking a cigar, as if for a stroll, lounged through the bazaar and town, passed the sentries, and stepped quietly into the Sultan's palace. Braddell speaks Malay better than a Malay, and knows their customs. It ended in his getting at the Sultan, who at last con- sented to come on board."&lt;ref name=ReferenceB/&gt;

==Braddell, the man==
Of Mr. Braddell's personal qualities Mr. Buckley, who was his lifelong friend, speaks highly:

"He was a man of great quickness of perception, great energy of purpose, and unwearied industry. He was, in his comparatively younger days, when he first came to Singapore, one of the most popular men of the place. He was a capital billiard player, and was to be seen in the theatre when any travelling company gave performances there, which were poor enough ; but he used to say that it passed an evening occasionally, however bad the players were, and made a little diversion from work.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 426–427&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was always pleasant to the jury to hear him conducting the cases at the Assizes, for he was most essentially a kind-hearted, straightforward man, with a very pleasant, perfectly audible voice, and a fluent but very simple speaker. He had a very pleasant face and manner, and it was said of him after the Transfer that he was the only official who could carry off the civil service uniform which came into use then among some, but not all, the officials, for he had a fine figure, and was over six feet in height."&lt;ref name=ReferenceC&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 427&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
===Mishap and retirement===
Towards the end of 1882, Braddell had a nasty carriage accident, and as a consequence had to retire; he was entertained before his departure at a farewell dinner given by the Bar and the Civil Service, at which the chief justice, Sir Thomas Sidgreaves, took the chair, and the governor was present as a guest. All the members of council, heads of department, most of the civil service and all the bar were present, so the papers said. In proposing the toast of the evening, the chief justice said that the news of Braddell's retirement had been received with incredulity:

"One could hardly understand that Mr. Braddell, who had become a sort of institution here, whom everyone of us had known so long, who had become a part and parcel of the Colonial regime under which we all live, was going to leave us, that we were to lose the benefit of his assistance. It seemed as if a Colonial calamity was impending. Because I do not think there is anyone in the whole Colony who from his long residence and unselfish devotion to the public weal is so universally respected and whose absence will be more regretted."&lt;ref name=ReferenceC/&gt;

===Death and testimony===
He died in London on 19 September 1891, at the age of sixty-eight.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; The Supreme Court assembled in Singapore to do honour to his memory, and speeches were made by the attorney-general, Mr. [[Jonas Daniel Vaughan]], his old friend and colleague, and by the chief justice, Sir [[Edward L. O'Malley]].  The ''Singapore Free Press'', in an obituary notice, remarked that there were very few institutions in this place which did not in some way, to those who were acquainted with their history, recall him, and that that was especially the case among the Masonic fraternity. It went on to refer to the fine work done by many of the old officials of the East India Company, and concluded : "Foremost amongst them stands the name of Mr. Braddell, who for thorough honesty of purpose and uprightness of character in somewhat trying official duties has left an honoured name in the history of the earlier days of Singapore." Mr. Braddell had filled all the offices connected with Freemasonry in his day, save that of District Grand Master, which was held by his friend, the late Mr. [[William Henry Macleod Read]], whose deputy he was.&lt;ref name=p428&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 428&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1852 he married Miss Anne Lee,&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; the daughter of William Lee, of Longeaton, Notts., in his day a well-known amateur cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire. By her he had two sons and two daughters; one of the latter married Sir [[Edward Marsh Merewether]], K.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., then a cadet in the Straits Civil Service, and at present Governor of the Leeward Isles. They were on the Appam when she was captured by the ''Moewe'', the German raider. She played a large part in theatricals and music while she was in Singapore.&lt;ref name=p428/&gt;

===Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell===
Of his sons the elder, Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell, went out to Singapore in 1879, having been married a month or two before he sailed. He joined his father in practice. J. P. Joaquim and Sir John Bromhead Matthews were also partners of his, the former in the 'Eighties and the latter in the 'Nineties.  Sir Thomas, while he was at the Bar, did not take any part in public affairs save when he acted as Attorney-General in 1898, and for a year or two prior to that as a Municipal Commissioner. In 1907 he was appointed a Puisne Judge, and in 1911 he became Attorney-General, holding that appointment until 1913, when he went to the Federated Malay States as Chief Judicial Com- missioner. In the New Year's honours of 1914 he received a knighthood, and in 1917 he retired, and thereafter lived in England. Sir Thomas, like his father, was an enthusiastic Freemason, and in his time was Master of Lodge St. George and first Master of Read Lodge, Kuala Lumpur, holding the two offices by special dispensation in the same year; he was also District Grand Senior Warden.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 428–429&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Thomas was a very good actor in his younger days, and was particularly successful as General Baltic in ''Turned up'', by Mark Melford, and as Digby Grant in ''Two Roses'', by James Albery. These were played at the old Town Hall in 1887 with great success.  He also stage-managed Iolanthe, which started an era of musical plays in October 1889, and the Crimson Scarf, a comic opera by H. B. Farnie and J. E. Legouix, in 1888 ; nor was he above giving an evening a week to coach the elder pupils of Raffles Girls' School in their Shakespeare. Although not very robust, he played a fair game at tennis, a good game of billiards, and was a staunch supporter of the Swimming Club, which has a fine portrait of their former President in the club-house.  All who knew him had the highest esteem for his fine character and sterling work. In Council and Court he was courteous in demean- our and quiet in speech, yet withal firm and decisive.  Privately, no one ever appealed to him in vain for advice or help, which he gave with great sincerity and kindness, in his quiet way, well meriting the verdict of one troubled lady whom he aided in a troublesome piece of public work that " he was such a helpful man."&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 429&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell was born in Province Wellesley in 1856, and after leaving Oxford was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 25 June 1879. On the 1 6 September 1879 he married [[Violet Ida Nassau]], daughter of John Roberts Kirby by his wife Elizabeth, who was the daughter of [[William Frederick Nassau]], of St. Osyth's Priory, Essex. He was admitted to the local Bar on 5 January 1880.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 429–430&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Wallace Braddell===
The younger son of Thomas Braddell, Robert Wallace, also came out to the Straits after his father's retirement and practised at the Singapore Bar in partnership with his brother. Sir Thomas, until December 1906, when he retired. He was the finest criminal lawyer and cross-examiner who has practised at the local Bar. He was a very fine billiard and lawn-tennis player, gaining the championship many times at both games. In no less than three separate tournaments R. W. Braddell secured the championship, the singles handicap, the doubles handicap, and the Profession Pairs, i.e. every event. He and the Hon. F. M. Elliot carried off the Profession Pairs on many occasions. Also " Bob " was an admirable caricaturist, much of his work being shown in illustrations herein, and under the nom de plume of "K.Y.D" had cartoons of [[Sir Cecil Smith]], the Maharaja of Johore, and others published in the Vanity Fair series.  Straits Produce contains much of his hterary and artistic work. He shared the family taste for theatricals, and appeared in comic parts on many occasions, and could sing a good comic song.  [[Robert Wallace Glen Lee Braddell]] was born in 1859, won his tennis half-blue at Oxford, and was amateur lawn tennis champion of the North of England.  He married Minnie, daughter of the [[Rev. Thomas Smith]], vicar of Brailes, near Banbury.&lt;ref&gt;One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 430–431&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| 1953 || Medical development || American [[medical researcher]] [[Jonas Salk]] and his associates develop a potentially safe, inactivated (killed), injected [[polio vaccine]]. By 1955, the Salk vaccine is recognized as safe, effective and potent.

Initially overlooked due to Salk vaccine success, in 1957 the [[World Health Organization]] authorizes mass vaccination of children living in areas suffering from poliomyelitis epidemics. By 1959, about 4.5 million people in Russia have received the oral vaccine, making the incidence of polio in that country decrease markedly by 1959. Due to these results, the Sabin vaccine is licensed for use in the United States &lt;ref name="The Battle Against Polio" /&gt; ||

| 1980 || Program launch || Brazil implements National Immunization Days against infantile paralysis as part of the strategy to eliminate poliomyelitis. The initial objective is to achieve high coverage to interrupt transmission of poliovirus, with an established target of vaccinating 95% of children younger than five years with oral poliovirus vaccine.

'''William Kingsford''' (23 December 1819 – 29 September 1898) was an English-born Canadian historian. Born in London, England, served in the army, and went to Canada, where he was engaged in surveying work. He was a self-taught historian, and one of the first to use the archives being gathered in Ottawa. He is best known for his ''History of Canada'' in 10&amp;nbsp;volumes (1887–1898), which was widely read by the upper middle class, as well as Anglophone teachers, despite its poor organisation and pedestrian writing style. Kingsford believed that the Conquest of New France guaranteed victory for British constitutional liberty and that it ensured material progress. He assumed the assimilation of French Canadians into a superior British culture was inevitable and desirable, for he envisioned Canada as one nation with one anglophone population.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brook Taylor, [http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/kingsford_william_12E.html "KINGSFORD, WILLIAM," ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 12, (2003), accessed December 15, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born on 23 December 1819 in the parish of [[St. Lawrence Jewry]], London, he was the son of William and Elizabeth Kingsford of Lad Lane. Educated at [[Nicholas Wanostrocht]]'s school in [[Camberwell]], he was articled at an early age to an architect. He then enlisted in the [[1st Dragoon Guards]], aged 16. He went with his regiment to Canada in 1837, became sergeant, and in 1840, through the influence of his friends at home, obtained his discharge, despite an offer by [[Sir George Cathcart]], colonel of the regiment, to procure a commission for him.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Kingsford, William|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil engineer==
Entering the office of the city surveyor of Montreal in 1841, Kingford qualified in due course as civil engineer, and obtained the position of deputy city surveyor, a post which he held for three years. He resigned to begin the publication of the ''Montreal Times'', in company with Murdo McIver. Two years later he entered the public works department, and among other undertakings made a new survey of the [[Lachine Canal]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1849 Kingsford was engaged in the construction of the [[Hudson River Railroad]] in the state of New York, and in 1851 went to [[Panama]] as assistant engineer to J. J. Campbell, who was then building the [[Panama Canal Railway]]. Returning to Canada in 1853, he surveyed for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] the tracks from Montreal to [[Vaudreuil-Dorion|Vaudreuil]], from Montreal to [[Cornwall, Ontario]], from [[Brockville]] to Rideau, and, under A. M. Ross, who had the construction of the work in charge, laid down the lines of the [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Kingsford was chief engineer of the city of Toronto for a few months during 1855, but resigned to re-enter the service of the Grand Trunk, in whose employment he remained till 1864. He acted at first as superintendent of the line east from Toronto, and afterwards as contractor to maintain the section that runs from that city westward to Stratford. He came to England in 1865, made one or two general surveys on the continent for English firms, and reported to [[Thomas Brassey]] on the railway possibilities of the island of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1867, the building of the [[Intercolonial Railway]] took Kingsford to Canada once more to Canada, where he remained for the rest of his life. He worked on the enlargement of the [[Grenville Canal]] and the draining of [[Russell, Ontario]], moving to Ottawa. When the Mackenzie government came into power in 1872 Kingsford was appointed dominion engineer in charge of the harbours of the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]. He continued in this post till 31 December 1879, when he was dismisded by [[Sir Hector Langevin]], [[Minister of Public Works (Canada)|minister of public works]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Later life==
At the age of 60, Kingsford then turned to [[Canadian history]]. [[Queen's University]] and [[Dalhousie University]] recognised Kingsford's historical works by conferring on him the degree of LL.D.; and [[McGill University]] gave his name to a recently endowed chair of history. He survived the completion of his ''History'' by a few months only, and died on 28 September 1898.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Kingsford began writing for the press, and published some pamphlets:

* ''The History, Structure, and Statistics of Plank-roads'', 1852; 
* ''Impressions of the West and South'', 1858; 
* ''The Canadian Canals: their History and Cost'', 1865;

and a monograph on Canadian history entitled ''A Political Coin''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Kingsford studied of the archives of Canada, collected at Ottawa, from 1880. He published ''Canadian Archæology'' in 1886, soon followed by the ''Early Bibliography of Ontario''. He published the first volume of the ''History of Canada'' in 1887. The tenth and last volume went up to the [[union of Upper and Lower Canada]] (1841), and was printed in 1898, with a preface dated 24 May.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Kingsford was a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], to which he contributed several papers, and a member of the [[Canadian Society of Civil Engineers]]. He published correspondence and proceedings related to his sacking in a pamphlet ''Mr. Kingsford and Sir Hector Langevin'' (1882).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
In 1848 Kingsford married Maria Margaret, daughter of William Burns Lindsay, clerk of the legislative assembly of the province of Canada. Queen Victoria gave her his widow's [[civil list pension]] after his death.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Yoshimi is a founding member of the Center for Research and Documentation on Japan's War Responsibility.

He was born in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], and he studied at the [[University of Tokyo]].

==Notable research==
Yoshimi has done major work on the study of war crimes perpetrated by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during the first part of the [[Shōwa period]].  He has published his research on the use of [[chemical weapons]] by the Army, ordered by [[Emperor Shōwa]] himself.

Yoshimi is mostly noted for his work regarding the [[comfort women]].  He found the first documentary evidence in the Defense Agency Library of Tokyo that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] established and ran "comfort stations". One of these was a notice written on 4 March 1938 by the adjutants to the Chiefs of Staff of the [[Japanese Northern China Area Army|North China Army]] and [[Central China Expeditionary Army]] titled "Concerning the Recruitment of Women for Military Comfort Stations".  The gist of the document is as below:

"Many agents should have required special attention. Some of them accentuated the name of the armies as much as they might hurt the credibility of the armies and cause misunderstanding among the public, others recruited women without control through war correspondents or entertainers, and others selected the wrong agents who took a kidnapping approach to recruit women so that the police arrested them.
In the future, the armies in the field should control recruiting and select the agencies circumspectly and properly, and should build up a closer connection with the local police and the local military police in the implementation of recruiting.
Take special care not to have problems which have the potential to damage the armies' credibility or are not acceptable to social standards."&lt;ref&gt;The original document can be found under reference code "C04120263400" on [http://www.jacar.go.jp/english/index.html Japan Center for Asian Historical Records] - [[National Archives of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of these documents led to admission statements by the Chiefs of the Cabinet: Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Koichi Kato]] on 12 January 1993 and [[Yōhei Kōno]] on 4 August 1993. The [[Kono Statement of 1993|Kono statement]] in particular has been important in the comfort women issue.

In July 2004, Yoshimi and historian Yuki Tanaka announced the discovery of the documents in [[National Archives of Australia]] that demonstrated that [[cyanide]] gas was tested on Australian and Dutch prisoners in November 1944 on the [[Kai Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2004/07/27/national/japan-tested-chemical-weapon-on-aussie-pow-new-evidence/#.VKwHfnv_QZw Japan tested chemical weapons on Aussie POW], ''[[Japan Times]]'', 27-07-2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2007, Yoshimi and fellow historian [[Hirofumi Hayashi]] held a press conference and announced the discovery of documents in the archives of the [[Tokyo Tribunal]] that demonstrate that ''[[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]]'' members coerced or otherwise forced women from Indonesia, Indochina, and China into sexual slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/17/AR2007041701380.html Historians find new proofs on sex slaves], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 17-04-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Yoshimi has previously made statements&lt;ref name="1997-01-03_asanama"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/asanama/ |title=1997-01-03 朝まで生テレビ(Asamade Nama Terebi) |accessdate=2012-08-09 |date=1997-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yoshiaki Yoshimi |year=1995 |title=従軍慰安婦(Comfort Women) |publisher=[[Iwanami Shoten]] |isbn=978-4004303848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he conceded "there is no physical evidence to support the forced draft of comfort women by the military in the colonies (Taiwan &amp; Korea)", he has unequivocally stated that what documentation he has unearthed makes it clear that "there was coercion of those women into sexual slavery and it is the Japanese authorities who decided to set up wartime brothels".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/12/content_824829.htm |title='Comfort women' historian alarmed |accessdate=2013-11-28 |date=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
