'''Bioceramics''' and [[bioglass]]es are [[ceramic]] materials that are [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Ducheyne, G. W. Hastings (editors) (1984) ''CRC metal and ceramic biomaterials'' vol 1 {{ISBN|0-8493-6261-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioceramics are an important subset of [[biomaterials]].&lt;ref name=Shackelford&gt;J. F. Shackelford (editor)(1999) ''MSF bioceramics applications of ceramic and glass materials in medicine'' {{ISBN|0-87849-822-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Oonishi, H. Aoki, K. Sawai (editors) (1988) ''Bioceramics'' vol. 1 {{ISBN|0-912791-82-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioceramics range in biocompatibility from the ceramic [[oxides]], which are inert in the body, to the other extreme of resorbable materials, which are eventually replaced by the body after they have assisted repair. Bioceramics are used in many types of medical procedures. Bioceramics are typically used as rigid materials in [[Implant (medicine)|surgical implants]], though some bioceramics are flexible. The ceramic materials used are not the same as [[porcelain]] type ceramic materials. Rather, bioceramics are closely related to either the body's own materials or are extremely durable [[Mixed metal oxide|metal oxides]].

==History==
Prior to 1925, the materials used in implant surgery were primarily relatively pure metals. The success of these materials was surprising considering the relatively primitive surgical techniques. The 1930s marked the beginning of the era of better surgical techniques as well as the first use of alloys such as [[vitallium]].

In 1969, L. L. Hench and others discovered that various kinds of glasses and ceramics could bond to living bone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~hanifi/Bioceramics%20-%20Hench.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1991.tb07132.x|title=Bioceramics: From Concept to Clinic|year=1991|last1=Hench|first1=Larry L.|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Yamamuro, L. L. Hench, J. Wilson (editors) (1990) ''CRC Handbook of bioactive ceramics'' vol II {{ISBN|0-8493-3242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hench was inspired by the idea on his way to a conference on materials. He was seated next to a colonel who had just returned from the Vietnam War. The colonel shared that after an injury the bodies of soldiers would often reject the implant. Hench was intrigued and began to investigate materials that would be biocompatible. The final product was a new material which he called [[bioglass]]. This work inspired a new field called bioceramics.&lt;ref name=Kassinger&gt;Kassinger, Ruth. ''Ceramics: From Magic Pots to Man-Made Bones''. Brookfield, CT: Twenty-First Century Books, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0761325857}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discovery of bioglass, interest in bioceramics grew rapidly.

On April 26, 1988, the first international symposium on bioceramics was held in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;ref name="OonishiBio89"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bioceramics.html?id=mivfMQEACAAJ |title=Bioceramics: Proceedings of 1st International Bioceramic Symposium |author1=Oonishi, H. |author2=Aoki, H. |editor=Sawai, K. |publisher=Ishiyaku Euroamerica |pages=443 |year=1989 |isbn=978-0912791821 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Ceramics are now commonly used in the medical fields as [[Dental implant|dental]] and [[bone]] [[Implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Muster (editor) (1992) ''Biomaterials hard tissue repair and replacement'' {{ISBN|0-444-88350-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jbm.a.31943|title=Bacterial adherence to SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based multifunctional bioceramics|year=2008|last1=Kinnari|first1=Teemu J.|last2=Esteban|first2=Jaime|last3=Gomez-Barrena|first3=Enrique|last4=Zamora|first4=Nieves|last5=Fernandez-Roblas|first5=Ricardo|last6=Nieto|first6=Alejandra|last7=Doadrio|first7=Juan C.|last8=López-Noriega|first8=Adolfo|last9=Ruiz-Hernández|first9=Eduardo|last10=Arcos|first10=Daniel|last11=Vallet-Regí|first11=María|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgical [[Cermet#Bioceramics|cermets]] are used regularly. Joint replacements are commonly coated with bioceramic materials to reduce wear and inflammatory response. Other examples of medical uses for bioceramics are in [[pacemaker]]s, kidney dialysis machines, and respirators.&lt;ref name=Kassinger/&gt; The global demand on medical ceramics and ceramic components was about U.S. $9.8 billion in 2010. It was forecast to have an annual growth of 6 to 7 percent in the following years, with world market value predicted to increase to U.S. $15.3 billion by 2015 and reach U.S. $18.5 billion by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2011 | title = Market Report: World Medical Ceramics Market | publisher = Acmite Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/materials/world-medical-ceramics-market.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical properties and composition===
Bioceramics are meant to be used in extracorporeal circulation systems ([[dialysis]] for example) or engineered bioreactors; however, they're most common as [[Implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref name=" Boch "&gt;Boch, Philippe, Niepce, Jean-Claude. (2010) Ceramic Materials: Processes, Properties and Applications. {{doi| 10.1002/9780470612415.ch12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics show numerous applications as biomaterials due to their physico-chemical properties. They have the advantage of being inert in the human body, and their hardness and resistance to abrasion makes them useful for bones and teeth replacement. Some ceramics also have excellent resistance to friction, making them useful as replacement materials for malfunctioning [[joints]]. Properties such as appearance and electrical insulation are also a concern for specific biomedical applications.

Some bioceramics incorporate [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as their lifespan is longer than that of the patient's. The material can be used in inner [[ear ossicles]], ocular prostheses, electrical insulation for pacemakers, catheter orifices and in numerous prototypes of implantable systems such as cardiac pumps.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi"&gt;Thamaraiselvi, T. V., and S. Rajeswari. “Biological evaluation of bioceramic materials-a review.” Carbon 24.31 (2004): 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminosilicate]]s are commonly used in dental prostheses, pure or in ceramic-polymer [[dental composite|composite]]s. The ceramic-polymer composites are a potential way to filling of cavities replacing amalgams suspected to have toxic effects. The aluminosilicates also have a glassy structure. Contrary to artificial teeth in resin, the colour of tooth ceramic remains stable&lt;ref name=" Boch " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Hench " &gt;Hench LL. Bioceramics: From concept to clinic. J Amer CeramSoc 1991;74(7):1487–510.&lt;/ref&gt; Zirconia doped with yttrium oxide has been proposed as a substitute for alumina for osteoarticular prostheses. The main advantages are a greater failure strength, and a good resistance to fatigue.

[[Vitreous carbon]] is also used as it is light, resistant to wear, and compatible with blood. It is mostly used in cardiac valve replacement. Diamond can be used for the same application, but in coating form.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi" /&gt;

[[Calcium phosphate]]-based ceramics constitute, at present, the preferred bone substitute in orthopaedic and maxillofacial surgery.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt; They are similar to the mineral phase of the bone in structure and/or chemical composition. The material is typically porous, which provide a good bone-implant interface due to the increase of surface area that encourages cell colonisation and revascularisation. Additionally, it has lower mechanical strength compared to bone, making highly porous implants very delicate. Since [[Young's modulus]] of ceramics is generally much higher than that of the bone tissue, the implant can cause mechanical stresses at the bone interface.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt; Calcium phosphates usually found in bioceramics include hydroxyapatite (HAP) Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; tricalcium phosphate β (β TCP): Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and mixtures of HAP and β TCP.

=== Multipurpose ===
A number of implanted ceramics have not actually been designed for specific biomedical applications. However, they manage to find their way into different implantable systems because of their properties and their good biocompatibility. Among these ceramics, we can cite [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium nitrides]] and [[carbides]], and [[boron nitride]]. TiN has been suggested as the friction surface in hip prostheses. While cell culture tests show a good biocompatibility, the analysis of implants shows significant [[wear]], related to a delaminating of the TiN layer. Silicon carbide is another modern-day ceramic which seems to provide good biocompatibility and can be used in bone implants.&lt;ref name=" Boch " /&gt;

===Specific use===
In addition to being used for their traditional properties, bioactive ceramics have seen specific use for due to their biological activity. Calcium phosphates, [[oxides]], and [[hydroxides]] are common examples. Other natural materials — generally of animal origin — such as bioglass and other composites feature a combination of mineral-organic composite materials such as HAP, alumina, or titanium dioxide with the biocompatible polymers (polymethylmethacrylate): PMMA, poly(L-lactic) acid: PLLA, poly(ethylene). Composites can be differentiated as bioresorbable or non-bioresorbable, with the latter being the result of the combination of a non-bioresorbable calcium phosphate (HAP) with a non-bioresorbable [[polymer]] (PMMA, PE). These materials may become more widespread in the future, on account of the many combination possibilities and their aptitude at combining a biological activity with mechanical properties similar to those of the bone.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi" /&gt;

==Biocompatibility==
Bioceramics' properties of being anticorrosive, biocompatible, and aesthetic make them quite suitable for medical usage. [[Zirconia]] ceramic has bioinertness and noncytotoxicity. Carbon is another alternative with similar mechanical properties to bone, and it also features blood compatibility, no tissue reaction, and non-toxicity to cells. None of the three bioinert ceramics exhibit bonding with the bone. However, bioactivity of bioinert ceramics can be achieved by forming composites with bioactive ceramics. Bioglass and glass ceramics are nontoxic and chemically bond to bone. Glass ceramics elicit osteoinductive properties, while calcium phosphate ceramics also exhibit non-toxicity to tissues and bioresorption. The ceramic particulate reinforcement has led to the choice of more materials for implant applications that include ceramic/ceramic, ceramic/polymer, and ceramic/metal composites. Among these composites ceramic/polymer composites have been found to release toxic elements into the surrounding tissues. [[Metals]] face corrosion related problems, and ceramic coatings on metallic implants degrade over time during lengthy applications. Ceramic/ceramic composites enjoy superiority due to similarity to bone minerals, exhibiting biocompatibility and a readiness to be shaped. The biological activity of bioceramics has to be considered under various ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' studies. Performance needs must be considered in accordance with the particular site of implantation.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi" /&gt;

== Processing ==
Technically, ceramics are composed of raw materials such as powders and natural or synthetic [[chemical additives]], favoring either compaction (hot, cold or isostatic), setting (hydraulic or chemical), or accelerating [[sintering]] processes. According to the formulation and shaping process used, bioceramics can vary in density and porosity as [[cements]], ceramic depositions, or ceramic composites.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt;

A developing material processing technique based on the biomimetic processes aims to imitate natural and biological processes and offer the possibility of making bioceramics at ambient temperature rather than through conventional or hydrothermal processes [GRO 96]. The prospect of using these relatively low processing temperatures opens up possibilities for mineral organic combinations with improved biological properties through the addition of proteins and biologically active molecules (growth factors, antibiotics, anti-tumor agents, etc.). However, these materials have poor mechanical properties which can be improved, partially, by combining them with bonding proteins.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt;

== Commercial Usage ==
Common bioactive materials available commercially for clinical use include 45S5 bioactive glass, A/W bioactive glass ceramic, dense synthetic HA, and bioactive composites such as a [[polyethylene]]–HA mixture. All these materials form an interfacial bond with adjacent tissue.&lt;ref name=" Hench " /&gt;

High-purity alumina bioceramics are currently commercially available from various producers. U.K. manufacturer Morgan Advanced Ceramics (MAC) began manufacturing orthopaedic devices in 1985 and quickly became a recognised supplier of ceramic femoral heads for hip replacements. MAC Bioceramics has the longest clinical history for alumina ceramic materials, manufacturing HIP Vitox® alumina since 1985.&lt;ref name="Kokubo"&gt;Kokubo, T. Bioceramics and Their Clinical Applications, Woodhead Publishing Limited, Cambridge, England, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84569-204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some calcium-deficient phosphates with an apatite structure were thus commercialised as "tricalcium phosphate" even though they did not exhibit the expected crystalline structure of tricalcium phosphate.&lt;ref name="Kokubo" /&gt;

Currently, numerous commercial products described as HA are available in various physical forms (e.g. granules, specially designed blocks for specific applications). HA/polymer composite (HA/polyethyelene, HAPEXTM) is also commercially available for ear implants, abrasives, and plasma-sprayed coating for orthopedic and dental implants.&lt;ref name="Kokubo" /&gt;

==Future trends==
Bioceramics have been proposed as a possible treatment for [[cancer]]. Two methods of treatment have been proposed: [[hyperthermia]] and [[radiotherapy]]. [[Hyperthermia treatment]] involves implanting a bioceramic material that contains a ferrite or other magnetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Łukasz|last2=Janeta|first2=Mateusz|last3=Szafert|first3=Sławomir|title=Designing of macroporous magnetic bioscaffold based on functionalized methacrylate network covered by hydroxyapatites and doped with nano-MgFe 2 O 4  for potential cancer hyperthermia therapy|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2017.04.133|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: C|volume=78|pages=901–911|doi=10.1016/j.msec.2017.04.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is then exposed to an alternating magnetic field, which causes the implant and surrounding area to heat up. Alternatively, the bioceramic materials can be doped with β-emitting materials and implanted into the cancerous area.&lt;ref name=Shackelford/&gt;

Other trends include engineering bioceramics for specific tasks. Ongoing research involves the chemistry, composition, and micro- and nanostructures of the materials to improve their biocompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.mt.6300084 |title=Biomaterials Approach to Expand and Direct Differentiation of Stem Cells |year=2007 |last1=Chai |first1=Chou |last2=Leong |first2=Kam W |journal=Molecular Therapy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=467–80 |pmid=17264853 |pmc=2365728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000081089 |title=Cellular Reactions of Osteoblasts to Micron- and Submicron-Scale Porous Structures of Titanium Surfaces |year=2004 |last1=Zhu |first1=Xiaolong |last2=Chen |first2=Jun |last3=Scheideler |first3=Lutz |last4=Altebaeumer |first4=Thomas |last5=Geis-Gerstorfer |first5=Juergen |last6=Kern |first6=Dieter |journal=Cells Tissues Organs |volume=178 |pages=13–22 |pmid=15550756 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15965741 |year=2005 |last1=Hao |first1=L |last2=Lawrence |first2=J |last3=Chian |first3=KS |title=Osteoblast cell adhesion on a laser modified zirconia based bioceramic |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=719–26 |doi=10.1007/s10856-005-2608-3 |journal=Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- British English --&gt;
'''[https://www.premiumcarpfishing.com/product-category/premium-carp-fishing-bolies/ Boilies]''' are boiled paste [[fishing bait]]s, usually combinations of [[fishmeal]]s, [[milk protein]]s, bird foods, [[semolina]] and [[soya flour]], which are mixed with eggs as a binding agent and then boiled to form hardish round baits which will last in the water. Additional flavourings and attractors are also usually included in the mix. The round shape allows the baits to be catapulted accurately when fishing at range.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=The Fishing Companion: Amazing Angling, Curious Catches &amp; Pescetarian Passions|author= Lesley Crawford|year= 2005|publisher=Robson|isbn=1-86105-919-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to provide a bait of a fairly large size with a hard outer skin, meant that the other species such as [[tench]] and [[bream]] were less able to consume the bait. Boiled baits also meant that they could be left longer in the water without fear that they had fallen off the hook, in the same way as bread or other traditional baits might.

Though boilies are typically made and sold by large suppliers, many people choose to make their own unique homemade boilies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccmoore.com/bait-blog/making-your-own-boilies-by-gary-moore/ ''How to make your own boilies''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126052750/http://www.ccmoore.com/bait-blog/making-your-own-boilies-by-gary-moore/ |date=January 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boilies are now one of the most established [[carp]] baits, available in a huge range of colours and flavours. Boilies come in all different shapes and sizes, from tiny micro boilies (some even as small as eight millimetres) up to as large as 40&amp;nbsp;mm which are more suited to waters where 'nuisance fish' are present.

There are buoyant boilies, commonly known as pop-ups, that are used to make the bait sit just off the bed of the lake making them easier for the fish to find and take. Pop-ups can be used in various situations, where there is weed or [[silt]] present on a lake bed, or with a normal boilie to create a 'snowman' rig, the pop-up is generally smaller than the normal boilie, this creates what is known as a critically balanced bait, or [[neutral buoyancy]], and makes it easier for the fish to take in the bait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carp-passion.com/Rigs/pop-upCarpbaits.htm Pop-up baits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607121146/http://www.carp-passion.com/Rigs/pop-upCarpbaits.htm |date=June 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carp angler has many types of boiled bait to choose from, some of which have added preservatives in them so that they can be kept at room temperature on shop shelves for a long time (shelf-life bait). Boilies that lack these added preservatives need to be refrigerated or frozen to stop them from going off; these are known as freezer baits. There have been many arguments discussing the pros and cons of both freezer and shelf-life boilies but the common opinion of many carp anglers is that due to the artificial preservatives in shelf-life baits they are not as nutritionally beneficial to the carp and therefore lack some attraction. Also, since in order to keep freezer baits fresh they need to be frozen soon after being rolled, not only will the ingredients used be of a much higher quality than in shelf lives but the ingredients used to make them will not lose much of their nutrients and attraction before being used in a fishing situation (much like frozen vegetables). Due to these facts freezer baits are often much more expensive than their shelf life counterparts.

The most commonly used set-up anglers use to present a boilie is a [[hair rig]] (the bait is not attached directly to the hook) which allows the boilie to sit off the back of the hook. This not only means that the bait will behave more naturally in the water (for example when disturbed by feeding fish) it also will often make the difference between a good hook hold and a bad one. Due to the nature in which a carp feeds the bait is blown out of the mouth soon after it has been picked up and the fact that the bait can move independently from the hook it allows the hook to stay back inside the mouth and find its way preferably into the bottom lip.

A '''cannula''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|nj|ᵿ|l|ə}}; from Latin ''"little reed"''; plural ''cannulae'' or ''cannulas'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cannula?q=cannulae cannula] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved: 2014-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tube that can be inserted into the body, often for the delivery or removal of fluid or for the gathering of data. In simple terms, a cannula can surround the inner or outer surfaces of a [[trocar]] needle thus extending the effective needle length by at least half the length of the original needle. It is also called an intravenous (IV) cannula. Its size mainly ranges from 14 to 24 [[Needle gauge comparison chart|gauge]]. Different-sized cannula have different colours as coded.

Decannulation is the permanent removal of a cannula ([[intubation|extubation]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Children with Tracheotomies Resource Guide'', by Marilyn K. Kertoy, page 15 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FDHoDc5Qyr0C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=decannulation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=s28wy5VvPP&amp;sig=_KYJAy3mtArkgf2PxFBLEnlCeCM#PPA15,M1 Google book search])&lt;/ref&gt; especially of a [[tracheostomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_d_03zPzhtm |title= MerckEngage® - Healthy Living Tips and Health Information |website= www.mercksource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannula, once a [[physician]] determines it is no longer needed for breathing.

== Medicine ==

Cannulae normally come with a [[trocar]] inside.  The trocar is a needle, which punctures the body in order to get into the intended space.  Many types of cannulae exist:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vitaneedle.com/cannula.htm|title=Cannula Point Styles - Needle Cannulas - Cannulae - Vita Needle Company |first= Vita Needle |last= Company |website= www.vitaneedle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intravenous]] cannulae are the most common in hospital use.  A variety of cannulae are used to establish [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] in [[cardiac surgery]]. A [[nasal cannula]] is a piece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose and is used to administer oxygen.

=== Intravenous (IV) cannulation ===
{{see also|Peripheral venous catheter}}
[[File:Venflon intravenous cannula 2.jpeg|thumb|Intravenous cannula]]

A [[Intravenous therapy|venous]] cannula is inserted into a vein, primarily for the administration of intravenous fluids, for obtaining blood samples and for administering medicines. An [[Arterial catheter|arterial cannula]] is inserted into an artery, commonly the radial artery, and is used during major operations and in critical care areas to measure beat-to-beat blood pressure and to draw repeated blood samples. Insertion of the venous cannula is a painful procedure that can lead to anxiety and stress. Use of a [[vapocoolant]] (cold spray) immediately before cannulation reduces pain during the procedure, without increasing the difficulty of cannulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=Rebecca J|last2=Jordan|first2=Vanessa|last3=Herd|first3=David|last4=Reed|first4=Peter W|last5=Dalziel|first5=Stuart R|title=Vapocoolants (cold spray) for pain treatment during intravenous cannulation|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=26 April 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009484.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009484.pub2/full|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|pmid=27113639|volume=4|pages=CD009484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications may arise in the vein as a result of the cannulation procedure, the four main groups of complication are:

* [[hematoma]]: a collection of blood, which can result from failure to puncture the vein when the cannula is inserted or when the cannula is removed. Selection of an appropriate vein and gently applying pressure slightly above the insertion point on removal of the cannula may prevent this.
* [[infiltration (medical)|infiltration]]:  when infusate enters  the subcutaneous tissue  instead of the vein. To prevent this, a cannula with accurate trim distances may be used. It is essential to fix the cannula in place firmly.
* [[embolism]]: this can be caused by air, a [[thrombus]], or fragment of a catheter breaking off and entering the venous system. It can cause a [[Pulmonary Embolism]].  Air emboli can be avoided by making sure that there is no air in the system. A thromboembolism can be avoided by using a smaller cannula.
* [[phlebitis]]: an inflammation of the vein resulting from mechanical or chemical irritation or from an infection. Phlebitis can be avoided by carefully choosing the site for cannulation and by checking the type of infusate used.

=== Nasal cannulation and oral-nasal cannulation ===
[[File:Nasal cannula.png|thumb|Drawing of a [[nasal cannula]]]]

A [[nasal cannula]] or an oral–nasal cannula consists of a flexible tube, usually with multiple short, open-ended branches for comfortable insertion into the [[nostril]]s and/or [[Human mouth|mouth]], and may be used for the delivery of a gas (such as pure [[oxygen]]), a gas mixture (as, for example, during [[anesthesia]]), or to measure airflow into and out of the nose and/or mouth.

=== Tracheotomy tube ===
The removal of a tracheotomy tube is referred to as decannulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Publishing Company| isbn = 978-0-8261-0517-2| last = Morris| first = Linda|author2=Sherif Afifi |author3=M. Sherif Afifi | title = Tracheostomies: The Complete Guide| page = 311| date = 2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veterinary use==
A cannula is used in an emergency procedure to relieve pressure and bloating in cattle and sheep with [[ruminal tympany]], due most commonly to their accidentally grazing wilted [[legume]] or legume-dominant pastures, particularly [[alfalfa]], [[Trifolium repens|ladino]], and [[clover|red and white clover]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/21705.htm Diseases of the Ruminant Forestomach : Bloat], Merck Veterinary Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannulas are a component used in the insertion of the [[Verichip]].

Much larger cannulas are used to research about the digestive system of [[Cannulated cow|cows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-standard.org/life/campus_life/holey-cow/article_dc6aba08-a0b7-11e2-a2db-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Holey cow!|first=Kelsie Nalley, The|last=Standard|date=|website=the-standard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Blunt-tip}}Aesthetic medicine and anti-ageing==

In [[aesthetic medicine]], a blunt-tip cannula or microcannula (also called smooth tip microcannula, blunt tipped cannula, or simply microcannula) is a small tube with an edge that is not sharp and an extrusion port or pore near the tip which is designed for atraumatic subdermal injections of fluids or gels.

Depending on the size of the internal diameter, it can be used either for the injection of cosmetic wrinkle fillers like hyaluronic acid, collagen, poly-L-lactic acid, CaHA, etc., or for fat transfer ([[Liposuction]]).  The advantage of using these is that they are less painful, have less risk of bruising, have less swelling, and a better safety profile.  Accidental intravascular injections are more difficult with blunt-tip microcannulas, reducing the risk of skin necrosis, ulcers, and embolization to the retinal artery which can result in blindness.&lt;ref&gt;http://aiam.us/definitions/blunt-tip-microcannula/&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in May 2015, the USA issued a warning of these risks as an FDA Safety Communication on the "Unintentional Injection of Soft Tissue Filler Into Blood Vessels In the Face".

In January 2012, the "Dermasculpt" microcannula was approved by the FDA for use in the United States for use with soft tissue fillers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zeichner | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = J. L. | title = Use of blunt tipped cannulas for soft tissue fillers | journal = Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–72 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22206080}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the "Magic Needle", "Softfil", "TSK by Air-Tite", and "Sculpt-face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sculpt-face.com|title=Sculptface|website=www.sculpt-face.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary structural differences between microcannulas is the distance of the extrusion port or pore from the tip (closer is more precise), the bluntness of the tip (tapered blunt tip is easier for entry), and the flexibility of the shaft (enough flexibility to move around sensitive structures but enough rigidity for precise placement.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garry R. Lee| title = Advanced Anti-Bruising Cosmetic Filler Techniques| journal = PRiME:  International Journal of Aesthetic and Anti-Ageing Medicine|date=January–February 2015 | pages = 25–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since microcannula tips are blunt, a Pilot or Introducer needle is required for entry through the skin and the technique is to thread the microcannula through this tiny opening.  Microcannula cosmetic injection techniques have been developed on how to best place cosmetic wrinkle fillers such as the Long MicroCannula Double Cross-Hatched Fan and the Wiggle Progression techniques.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In April 2016, the concept of the use of microcannula to inject more than cosmetic fillers was first published.  The technique of Microcannula Injected Local Anesthesia (MILA) was described on the use of microcannula to inject local anesthesia with less pain, bruising, and swelling.  Also introduced were Accelerated Healing After Platelet-Rich Plasma (AHA-PRP), Accelerated Healing After Platelet-Rich Fibrin Matrix (AHA-PRFM), and the use of microcannula to dissolve Sculptra nodules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Garry R. Lee, |chapter= Other Microcannula Applications |title= First Book of Aesthetic Microcannula for Cosmetic Fillers and Local Anesthesia (MILA) |date= April 2016 |pages= 98–117  |ISBN= 978-1530871094 }} {{ISBN|1530871093}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body piercing==
Cannulae are used in [[body piercing]] when using a standard IV needle (usually between 18GA and 12GA, although may be as large as 0GA, in which case the procedure is known as [[dermal punching]] and uses a [[biopsy punch]] without a cannula), and for inserting hooks for [[Suspension (body modification)|suspensions]].

During piercing, the [[fistula]] is created by inserting the needle. The needle is then removed, leaving the cannula in place, which is sometimes trimmed down. The cannula is then removed and sterile jewelry is inserted into the fistula simultaneously, in order to minimise trauma to the fresh fistula caused by insertion of blunt-ended jewelry.

==Non-medical use==
[[File:Air sensitive cannula - syringe valve 1.png|thumb|Air sensitive cannula used in [[synthetic chemistry]].]]In biological research, a push-pull cannula, which both withdraws and injects fluid, can be used to determine the effect of a certain chemical on a specific [[cell (biology)|cell]]. The push part of the cannula is filled with a physiological solution plus the chemical of interest and is then injected slowly into the local cellular environment of a cell. The pull cannula then draws liquid from the extracellular medium, thus measuring the cellular response to the chemical of interest. This technique is especially used for [[neuroscience]].

In general aviation, a cannula refers to a piece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose and is used to administer oxygen in non-pressurized aircraft flying above 10,000 feet sea level.

In synthetic chemistry, a cannula refers to a piece of stainless steel or plastic tubing used to transfer liquids or gases from one vessel to another without exposure to air. See more at [[Cannula transfer]].

After the tests, extensive computational and analytical studies of the behaviour of steel-framed composite structures in fire conditions were carried out by, among others, The University of Edinburgh, Sheffield University and Imperial College London.

[[File:Bottle Opener.jpg||thumb|A "churchkey" bottle opener]]
A '''churchkey''' or '''church key''' is any of various kinds of [[bottle opener]]s and [[can opener]]s.

== History ==
A churchkey initially referred to a simple hand-operated device for prying the cap (called a "[[crown cork]]") off a glass bottle; this kind of closure was invented in 1892, although there is no evidence that the opener was called a "church key" at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-chu2.htm Churchkey]&lt;/ref&gt; The shape and design of some of these openers did resemble a large simple [[key (lock)|key]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just-for-openers.org/Church-Key.html January 1980 JFO Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Churchkey01.jpg|thumb|A churchkey with a can piercer|300px]]
In 1935, beer cans with flat tops were marketed, and a device to puncture the lids was needed. The same term, "church key", came to be used for this new invention: made from a single piece of pressed metal, with a pointed end used for piercing cans — devised by D.F. Sampson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartenderschoolofsantarosa.com/usbgnewsletter/usbg_news_date_p8.shtml United States Bartenders Guild~Newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511222412/http://www.bartenderschoolofsantarosa.com/usbgnewsletter/usbg_news_date_p8.shtml |date=May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streeter.org/community/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=468 Short History of the Beer Can (part 2) :: Streeter's Electronics :: Home of The Treasure Hunter's Gazette, BONE, and PTHHS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171523/http://www.streeter.org/community/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=468 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[American Can Company]], who depicted [[owner's manual|operating instructions]] on the cans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebeercans.com/flat-top-beer-cans.php Flat Top Beer Cans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704141656/http://www.ebeercans.com/flat-top-beer-cans.php |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically gave away free "quick and easy" openers with their beer cans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rustycans.com/HISTORY/OIs.html Opening Instruction Cans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ancient warded lock key transparent.png|thumb|A church key in the literal sense]]
[[File:Clé ouvre-bouteille.JPG|thumb|A church key in the figurative sense]]
The term in the beverage-opening [[word sense|sense]] is apparently not an old one; Merriam-Webster finds written attestation only since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |author = Merriam-Webster |authorlink = Merriam-Webster |title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[etymology|etymological]] themes exist.

A '''coiled tubing truck''' is used to deploy continuous tubing into an [[Oil well|oil]] or [[gas]] well. They are normally used for well cleanouts (both over balanced or jetvac underbalanced, plug pulling or [[drill]] outs, [[fishing]], spotting of [[acid]] or [[cement]], installation of umbilicals such as flatak, or instrument and [[camera]] runs in vertical or horizontal oil and gas wells.

There are 4 types of coiled tubing trucks:
* Shallow coiled tubing trucks, sometimes called bobtail units or [[body load]] units. These units are used on wells that are less than 5,000 feet deep and usually are mounted on traditional single steering [[axle]] and tandom rear axle semi trucks. Some larger shallow units are mounted on tandem steering and tridem rear axle trucks. These units traditionally use 1" to 1.50" tubing and have 660 CFM air compressors mounted on the truck for self-contained air to keep the well service as [[economic]] as possible. An example of a service provider of this would be Titan Oil and Gas Services.
* Intermediate Units are used on wells from 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet deep and mounted on semi truck and trailer units. These units usually use 1.75" or 2" for intermediate well depths and if they are going deeper they will use 1.25".
* Large Coil units are used on wells 10,000 feet and deeper or used on intermediate well depths when the work calls high flows of nitrogen for large size tubing such as 2", 2 3/8" or 2 7/8".
* Portable Drilling Units. [[Drilling]] with coil tubing is a relatively new technology. The advantage of drilling with coil is the speed at which one can drill. There are no pipe connections to be made and as such the drilling can be accomplished very rapidly. The deepest coil drilling on land record currently is held by Nordic Calista at 17,515 feet deep.

[[File:Solid state bonding a wire to a metallized surface.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 2. Solid-state/[[wire bonding]] bonding a gold wire with a hard faced bonding tool.]]

'''Compliant bonding''' is used to connect gold wires to electrical components such as [[integrated circuit]] "chips". It was invented by [[Alexander Coucoulas]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Alexander Coucoulas [http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/patents/3533155.htm "Bonding With A Compliant Medium"]. {{US Patent|3533155}}. October 13, 1970. Filed July 6, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bond is formed well below the melting point of the mating gold surfaces and is therefore referred to as a solid-state type bond. The compliant bond is formed by transmitting heat and pressure to the bond region through a relatively thick indentable or ''compliant medium'', generally an aluminum tape (Figure 1).&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Coucoulas, A. (1970) “Compliant Bonding” Proceedings 1970 IEEE 20th Electronic Components Conference, pp. 380–89. [[:File:CompliantBondingPublic_1-10.pdf|PDF]], [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225284187_Compliant_Bonding_Alexander_Coucoulas_1970_Proceeding_Electronic_Components_Conference_Awarded_Best_Paper PDF2]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other solid state bond methods ==

Solid-state or pressure bonds form permanent bonds between a gold wire and a gold metal surface by bringing their mating surfaces in intimate contact at about 300&amp;nbsp;°C which is well below their respective melting points of 1064&amp;nbsp;°C, hence the term solid-state bonds.

Two commonly used methods of forming this type of bond are [[thermocompression bonding]]&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=O. L.|last2=Christensen|first2=H.|last3=Andreatch|first3=P.|title=Technique for Connecting Electrical Leads to Semiconductors|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=28|pages=923|year=1957|doi=10.1063/1.1722893|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thermosonic bonding]]. Both of these processes form the bonds with a hard faced bonding tool that makes direct contact to deform the gold wires against the gold mating surfaces (Figure 2).

[[File:Compliant Bonding Gold wires0001.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3. Stages of compliant bonding gold wires to a gold metallized surface.]]
[[File:Compliant bonding wires simultaneously of varying sizes0001.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 4. Compliant bonding wires of varying sizes simultaneously.]]

&lt;!--IMPORTANT: the terms "deformation", "yielding", and "substrate" may confuse readers new to this subject. An explanation of these should be added before the point of their first occurrence. --&gt;

Since gold is the only metal that does not form an oxide coating which can interfere with making a reliable metal to metal contact, gold wires are widely used to make these important wire connections in the field of microelectronic packaging. During the compliant bonding cycle the bond pressure is uniquely
controlled by the inherent flow properties of the aluminum compliant tape (Figure 3). Therefore, if higher bond pressures are needed to increase the final deformation (flatness) of a compliant bonded gold wire, a higher yielding alloy of aluminum could be employed. The use of a compliant medium also overcomes the thickness variations when attempting to bond a multiple number of conductor wires simultaneously to a gold metalized substrate (Figure 4). It also prevents the leads from being excessively deformed since the compliant member deforms around the leads during the bonding cycle thus eliminating mechanical failure of a bonded wire due to excessive deformation from a hard faced tool (Figure 3) which is employed by thermocompression, and thermosonic bonding.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== History ==
An important application for compliant bonding arose in the early 1960s, when techniques were developed&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/PROC.1965.3772| title = Beam-lead devices and integrated circuits| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE| volume = 53| issue = 4| pages = 405| year = 1965| last1 = Lepselter | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Waggener | first2 = H. A. | last3 = MacDonald | first3 = R. W. | last4 = Davis | first4 = R. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for fabricating a [[Beam lead technology|beam leaded]] silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard faced tool thermocompression bonding all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.
The invention of compliant bonding eliminated the problems associated with a hard faced bonding tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard faced bonding tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate "costly" failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the "brains" of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the "beam leaded silicon chip" to the bonding site thus facilitating production.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Ludwig; David P., Zwickel; Friedich, {{US Patent|4,029,536}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Silicon integrated circuit ==

The two forms of integrated circuits discussed above were the beam leaded integrated circuit composed of attached electroformed gold leads or beams (Figure 5) and the silicon integrated circuit chip (Figure 6).  With respect to the beam leaded silicon chip, both compliant and thermocompression bonding can be employed since each have their advantages.  At this time,{{when?|date=October 2018}} the most widely used form is the silicon integrated circuit chip, without the beam leads, which therefore requires electrical connections directly to the metallized silicon Chip (Figure 6).  If wire connections is the method of choice to form these connections, thermosonic bonding gold wires directly to the silicon chip has been the process most widely used because of its proven reliability as a result of the low bonding parameters of force, temperature, and time needed to form the bond.

'''Customer intelligence''' ('''CI''') is the process of gathering and analyzing information regarding customers, and their details and activities, to build deeper and more effective [[customer relationship management|customer relationships]] and improve decision-making by vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Robert, Measuring and Valuing Customer Relationships (2000) Business Intelligence {{ISBN|978-1-898085-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CRM==

Customer intelligence is a key component of effective [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), and when effectively implemented it is a rich source of insight into the behaviour and experience of a company's customer base. 

As an example, some customers walk into a store and walk out without buying anything. Information about these customers/prospects (or their visits) may not exist in a traditional CRM system, as no sales are entered on the store cash register. Although no commercial transaction took place, knowing ''why'' customers leave the store (perhaps by asking them, or a store employee, to complete a survey) and using this data to make inferences about customer behaviour, is an example of CI.

==Process==
Customer Intelligence begins with [[reference data]] – basic key facts about the customer, such as their geographic location.

This data is then supplemented&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/05-may/p25feature.html] Capturing Customer Intelligence – Oracle&lt;/ref&gt; with [[transaction data]] – reports of customer activity. This can be commercial information (for example purchase history from sales and order processing), interactions from service contacts over the phone and via e-mail.

A further subjective dimension can be added, in the form of customer satisfaction surveys or agent data. 

Finally, a company can use competitor insight and [[mystery shopping]] to get a better view of how their service benchmarks in the market.

By mining this data, and placing it in context with wider information about competitors, conditions in the industry, and general trends, information can be obtained about customers' existing and future needs, how they reach decisions, and predictions made about their future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm2day.com/customer-intelligence/] Customer Intelligence by CRM Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g2i.org/article/2005/09/customer-intelligence |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090424045459/http://www.g2i.org/article/2005/09/customer-intelligence |archivedate=24 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example sources of data==

[[Speech analytics]] – used to monitor telephone conversations taking place between companies and customers, using [[phonetic analysis]] or [[speech recognition|speech to text]] to find keywords and phrases, classify call types and identify trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexidia.com/solutions/contact_center|title=404|first=|last=Nexidia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mouse tracking|Click tracking]] – used to monitor the popularity and usage of corporate web sites, this data can provide clues to product interest and buying intention. For example, a company may infer a customer is interested in purchasing a particular service if they are spending time browsing specific product pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webtrends.com/Products/WebTrendsVisitorIntelligence.aspx|title=Digital Marketing Solutions - Webtrends|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Customer relationship management]] – software solutions used for [[Salesforce.com]], [[adeptcrmsales]] and to manage customer relationships which can store data on the quantity, type and category of customer and prospect contacts. 

Frontline data capture which may (or may not) form part of a CRM software solution, but which is used by front line agents to record more subjective data regarding customer contacts, such as the [[root cause]] of the customer picking up the phone (e.g. they received their bill) or their emotional state.

[[Customer satisfaction]] and [[market research]] surveys, often mined via [[text analytics]], which can additionally be applied, for customer intelligence purposes, to contact center notes, e-mail, and other textual sources.

==Benefits==

Customer intelligence provides a detailed understanding of the experience customers have in interacting with a company, and allows predictions to be made regarding reasons behind customer behaviors.

This knowledge can then be applied to support more effective and strategic decision making – for example, understanding why customers call makes it easier to predict (and plan to reduce) call volumes in a [[contact centre (business)|contact centre]].

The '''Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics''' (Český institut informatiky, robotiky a kybernetiky, CIIRC)] was established as a part of CTU on July 1, 2013. Its mission is to become an internationally respected research institute, which participates in education of students and is a place responsible for a technology transfer into the field of industry. In the premises of the CTU in [[Dejvice]] there has been two new buildings for CIIRC built since November 2013. The construction works should be finished and the buildings prepared for its inhabitants - employees of CIIRC at the end of summer 2016. CIIRC will reside in a new building, which used to serve as a Technical University canteen and one of the biggest Billa [[hypermarket]]s.

CIIRC consists of eight research departments,  CYPHY: Cyber-physical systems, INTSYS: Intelligent systems, IIG: Industrial informatics, RMP: Robotics and machine perception, IPA: Industrial production and automation, COGSYS: Cognitive systems and neurosciences, BEAT: Biomedical engineering and Assistive technologies, PLAT: Research Management of Platforms. Research departments are further divided into groups. The head of CIIRC is [[Vladimír Mařík]].

[[File:RO B Dimitrie Leonida Tech Museum 3.jpg|thumb|Museum entrance.]] 
The Romanian Technical Museum was founded in 1909 by [[Dimitrie Leonida]], inspired by the [[Deutsches Museum|München Technical Museum]], he had visited during his studies in Charlottenburg Politechnic institute.
In 1908, with the help of the first promotions of [[mechanic]]s and [[electrician]]s from his school, the first in [[Romania]], Leonida collected the first pieces for the museum.
What is different in Leonida museum was the educational orientation of the museum and also the [[interactivity]].

The thin red circular contour line in the middle of the map indicates the top of the oil reservoir. Because gas floats above oil, the thin red contour line marks the gas/oil contact zone.  Directional drilling would be used to target the gas and [[oil reservoir]].]]

'''Directional drilling''' (or '''slant drilling''') is the practice of drilling non-vertical [[oil well|well]]s. It can be broken down into four main groups: [[oilfield]] directional drilling, utility installation directional drilling (horizontal directional drilling), [[directional boring]],  and surface in seam (SIS), which horizontally intersects a vertical well target to extract [[coal bed methane]].

==History==
Many prerequisites enabled this suite of technologies to become productive. Probably, the first requirement was the realization that [[oil well]]s, or [[water well]]s, are not necessarily vertical.{{OR|date=February 2016}} This realization was quite slow, and did not really grasp the attention of the oil industry until the late 1920s when there were several lawsuits alleging that wells drilled from a rig on one property had crossed the boundary and were penetrating a reservoir on an adjacent property.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Initially, proxy evidence such as production changes in other wells was accepted, but such cases fueled the development of small diameter tools capable of surveying wells during drilling. Horizontal directional [[drill rigs]] are developing towards large-scale, micro-miniaturization, mechanical automation, hard stratum working, exceeding length and depth oriented monitored drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dccleaningsystem.com/?p=606 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130708205630/http://dccleaningsystem.com/?p=606 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2013 |title=Development tendency of horizontal directional drilling |publisher=[[DC Solid control]] |date=6 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the inclination of a [[wellbore]] (its deviation from the vertical) is comparatively simple, requiring only a pendulum. Measuring the [[azimuth]] (direction with respect to the geographic grid in which the wellbore was running from the vertical), however, was more difficult.  In certain circumstances, magnetic fields could be used, but would be influenced by metalwork used inside wellbores, as well as the metalwork used in drilling equipment. The next advance was in the modification of small gyroscopic compasses by the [[Sperry Corporation]], which was making similar compasses for aeronautical navigation. Sperry did this under contract to [[Sun Oil]] (which was involved in a lawsuit as described above), and a spin-off company "[[Sperry Sun]]" was formed, which brand continues to this day,{{when|date=March 2014}}{{clarify|date=March 2014}} absorbed into [[Halliburton]].  Three components are measured at any given point in a wellbore in order to determine its position: the depth of the point along the course of the borehole (measured depth), the inclination at the point, and the magnetic azimuth at the point.  These three components combined are referred to as a "survey".  A series of consecutive surveys are needed to track the progress and location of a wellbore.

Prior experience with rotary drilling had established several principles for the configuration of drilling equipment down hole ("bottom hole assembly" or "BHA") that would be prone to "drilling crooked hole" (i.e., initial accidental deviations from the vertical would be increased). Counter-experience had also given early directional drillers ("DD's") principles of BHA design and drilling practice that would help bring a crooked hole nearer the vertical.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1934, H. John Eastman &amp; Roman W. Hines of [[Long Beach, California]], became pioneers in directional drilling when they and George Failing of [[Enid, Oklahoma]], saved the [[Conroe, Texas]], [[oil field]]. Failing had recently patented a portable drilling truck. He had started his company in 1931 when he mated a drilling rig to a truck and a power take-off assembly. The innovation allowed rapid drilling of a series of slanted wells. This capacity to quickly drill multiple relief wells and relieve the enormous gas pressure was critical to extinguishing the Conroe fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Technology and the "Conroe Crater" | url = http://aoghs.org/technology/directional-drilling/ | publisher = American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society | accessdate = 2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May, 1934, ''[[Popular Science Monthly]]'' article, it was stated that "Only a handful of men in the world have the strange power to make a bit, rotating a mile below ground at the end of a steel drill pipe, snake its way in a curve or around a dog-leg angle, to reach a desired objective." Eastman Whipstock, Inc., would become the world's largest directional company in 1973.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Combined, these survey tools and BHA designs made directional drilling possible, but it was perceived as arcane. The next major advance was in the 1970s, when [[downhole]] drilling motors (aka [[mud motor]]s, driven by the hydraulic power of drilling mud circulated down the drill string) became common. These allowed the drill bit to continue rotating at the cutting face at the bottom of the hole, while most of the drill pipe was held stationary. A piece of bent pipe (a "bent sub") between the stationary drill pipe and the top of the motor allowed the direction of the wellbore to be changed without needing to pull all the drill pipe out and place another whipstock. Coupled with the development of [[measurement while drilling]] tools (using [[mud pulse telemetry]], [[IntelliServ#Technology|networked or wired pipe]] or [[electromagnetism]] (EM) telemetry, which allows tools down hole to send directional data back to the surface without disturbing drilling operations), directional drilling became easier.

Certain profiles cannot be drilled while the drill pipe is rotating. Drilling directionally with a downhole motor requires occasionally stopping rotation of the drill pipe and "sliding" the pipe through the channel as the motor cuts a curved path. "Sliding" can be difficult in some formations, and it is almost always slower and therefore more expensive than drilling while the pipe is rotating, so the ability to steer the bit while the drill pipe is rotating is desirable. Several companies have developed tools which allow directional control while rotating. These tools are referred to as [[rotary steerable system]]s (RSS). RSS technology has made access and directional control possible in previously inaccessible or uncontrollable formations.  &lt;!--The author used to work for Sperry Sun - it is plausible that people with a different history have heard different corporate histories. --&gt;

==Benefits==
Wells are drilled directionally for several purposes:

*Increasing the exposed section length through the reservoir by drilling through the reservoir at an angle
*Drilling into the reservoir where vertical access is difficult or not possible. For instance an oilfield under a town, under a lake, or underneath a difficult-to-drill formation
*Allowing more [[wellhead]]s to be grouped together on one surface location can allow fewer rig moves, less surface area disturbance, and make it easier and cheaper to complete and produce the wells.  For instance, on an [[oil platform]] or jacket offshore, 40 or more wells can be grouped together. The wells will fan out from the platform into the reservoir(s) below.  This concept is being applied to land wells, allowing multiple subsurface locations to be reached from one pad, reducing costs.
*Drilling along the underside of a reservoir-constraining fault allows multiple productive sands to be completed at the highest stratigraphic points.
*Drilling a "[[relief well]]" to relieve the pressure of a well producing without restraint (a "[[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]").  In this scenario, another well could be drilled starting at a safe distance away from the blowout, but intersecting the troubled wellbore.  Then, heavy fluid (kill fluid) is pumped into the relief wellbore to suppress the high pressure in the original wellbore causing the blowout.

Most directional drillers are given a blue well path to follow that is predetermined by engineers and geologists before the drilling commences. When the directional driller starts the drilling process, periodic surveys are taken with a downhole instrument to provide survey data (inclination and azimuth) of the well bore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinookconsulting.ca/News/Directional-drilling-glossary.html|title=Glossary of geo-steering terms|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pictures are typically taken at intervals between 10–150 meters (30–500 feet), with 30 meters (90 feet) common during active changes of angle or direction, and distances of 60–100 meters (200–300 feet) being typical while "drilling ahead" (not making active changes to angle and direction). During critical angle and direction changes, especially while using a downhole motor, a [[measurement while drilling]]) (MWD) tool will be added to the [[drill string]] to provide continuously updated measurements that may be used for (near) real-time adjustments.

This data indicates if the well is following the planned path and whether the orientation of the drilling assembly is causing the well to deviate as planned.  Corrections are regularly made by techniques as simple as adjusting rotation speed or the drill string weight (weight on bottom) and stiffness, as well as more complicated and time-consuming methods, such as introducing a downhole motor. Such pictures, or surveys, are plotted and maintained as an engineering and legal record describing the path of the well bore. The survey pictures taken while drilling are typically confirmed by a later survey in full of the borehole, typically using a "multi-shot camera" device.

The multi-shot camera advances the film at time intervals so that by dropping the camera instrument in a sealed tubular housing inside the drilling string (down to just above the drilling bit) and then withdrawing the drill string at time intervals, the well may be fully surveyed at regular depth intervals (approximately every 30 meters (90 feet) being common, the typical length of 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe, known as a stand, since most drilling rigs "stand back" the pipe withdrawn from the hole at such increments, known as "stands").

Drilling to targets far laterally from the surface location requires careful planning and design. The current record holders manage wells over {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the surface location at a true vertical depth (TVD) of only 1,600&amp;ndash;2,600&amp;nbsp;m (5,200&amp;ndash;8,500&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=219715&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=48&amp;parent_id=28 |title=Maersk drills longest well at Al Shadeen |publisher=The [[Gulf Times]] |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214025536/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=219715&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=48&amp;parent_id=28 |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of drilling can also reduce the environmental cost and scarring of the landscape. Previously, long lengths of landscape had to be removed from the surface. This is no longer required with directional drilling.

==Disadvantages==
[[File:Figure 4- Example of a Horizontal Wellbore Traversing Mineral Parcels with Different Owners (13985529998) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Government Accountability Office]] depiction of horizontal drilling being used to cross tracts of land with differing owners]]
Until the arrival of modern downhole motors and better tools to measure inclination and azimuth of the hole, directional drilling and horizontal drilling was much slower than vertical drilling due to the need to stop regularly and take time-consuming surveys, and due to slower progress in drilling itself (lower rate of penetration). These disadvantages have shrunk over time as downhole motors became more efficient and semi-continuous surveying became possible.

What remains is a difference in operating costs: for wells with an inclination of less than 40 degrees, tools to carry out adjustments or repair work can be lowered by gravity on cable into the hole. For higher inclinations, more expensive equipment has to be mobilized to push tools down the hole.

Another disadvantage of wells with a high inclination was that prevention of sand influx into the well was less reliable and needed higher effort. Again, this disadvantage has diminished such that, provided sand control is adequately planned, it is possible to carry it out reliably.

===Stealing oil===
In 1990, [[Iraq]] accused [[Kuwait]] of stealing Iraq's oil through slant drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Gulf Crisis Began and Ended (The Gulf Crisis and Japan's Foreign Policy)|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/1991/1991-2-1.htm|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] redrew the border after the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf war]], which ended the seven-month [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi occupation]] of Kuwait. As part of the reconstruction, 11 new oil wells were placed among the existing 600. Some farms and an old naval base that used to be in the Iraqi side became part of Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=3413018 | title=Iraq to Reopen Embassy in Kuwait | publisher=[[ABC Inc.]] | date=4 September 2005 | accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-twentieth century, a slant-drilling scandal occurred in the huge [[East Texas Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Julia Cauble Smith | title = East Texas Oilfield | url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/doe01 | accessdate = 2014-09-23 | work = Handbook of Texas Online | publisher = Texas State Historical Association | date = 2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New technologies===
Between 1985 and 1993, the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL) (now the [[Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center]] (NFESC)) of Point Hueneme, California developed controllable horizontal drilling technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a274219.pdf Horizontal Drilling System (HDS) Field Test Report - FY 91]&lt;/ref&gt; 
These technologies are capable of reaching {{nowrap|10&amp;thinsp;000–15&amp;thinsp;000 ft}} (3000–4500&amp;nbsp;m) and may reach {{nowrap|25&amp;thinsp;000 ft}} (7500&amp;nbsp;m) when used under favorable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormingmedia.us/21/2119/A211962.html Horizontal Drilling System (HDS) Operations Theory Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Note: The foot measurements are original; the m are converted and rounded--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">A '''drum heater''' – also called band heater, barrel heater, container heater or canister heater- is used to reduce viscosity of liquids and gels by heating in order to fill, pump or bottle the respective liquid or to prevent liquids from freezing inside the drum. Typical liquids for the bottling application are [[tar]], [[varnish]], [[resin]], [[petroleum|grease]], [[chocolate]] or [[galantine]]. 
Drum heaters are available for drums between 20 and 220 litres.

== Drum heating ovens ==
Drum ovens are designed to store and heat typically from four to 24 drums, usually stored in groups of four on pallets, for ease of insertion and removal by fork-lift. Heated by steam or radiant electric elements, with a single zone thermostat, they are commonly used where long-term storage at a fixed temperature is required to reduce liquid viscosity or keep solids above their melt temperature. Mobile single-drum electric ovens are also available.

=== Glass fibre mats ===
industrially heaters of this type have an isolated [[heating element]] embedded in a glass fibre mat.  Silicone coated drum heaters are suitable for steel drums, whereas polyester coatings at lower temperatures can be used for [[plastic container]]s. As these heaters are flexible and wrap around the container they also called band heaters. Up to three band heaters can be applied to a standard 200 litre barrel. 
There is no additional insulation so heat is lost by radiation into the surrounding air and the surface temperatures can be hot enough to burn unprotected hands.

=== Insulated heating jackets ===
These electrical drum heaters have an outer layer of insulation to protect the user and to increase energy efficiency as significantly less heat is lost to the atmosphere, and thus their power consumption is considerably less than band heaters. Typically they are designed to cover the entire surface of the drum or container.

=== Drum base heater ===
Many viscous liquids and solids stored in steel drums require considerable energy input prior to removing from the container for processing. It is sometimes beneficial to add heat directly to the underside of the drum, using a bast heater. These are available in various constructions, using induction heating, steam or silicone heater mats inside a body with sufficient mechanical strength to support the weight of a full drum.

=== Induction Drum Heater ===
Individual steel drums can be heated by mains frequency [[induction heating]]. The magnetic field generated by the induction heater produces eddy currents in the drum wall, causing the steel to directly heat the contents.

      <comment>per [[WP:HYPHEN]], sub-subsection 3, points 3,4,5, replaced: narrowly- → narrowly using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5935">{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
A '''dual modulus [[prescaler]]''' is an [[electronic circuit]] used in high-[[frequency]] [[frequency synthesizer|synthesizer]] designs to overcome the problem of generating narrowly spaced frequencies that are nevertheless too high to be passed directly through the feedback loop of the system.  The modulus of a prescaler is its frequency divisor. A dual-modulus prescaler has two separate frequency divisors, usually M and M+1.

==The problem==
A frequency synthesizer produces an output frequency, f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, which divided by the modulus is the reference frequency, f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f_o}{N} = f_r \Rightarrow f = Nf_r&lt;/math&gt;

The modulus, N, is generally restricted to integer values, as the comparator will match when the waveform is in phase. Typically, the possible frequency multiples will be the channels for which the radio equipment is designed for, so f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; will usually be equal to the [[channel spacing]]. For example, on narrow-band [[radiotelephone]]s, a channel spacing of 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz is typical.

Suppose that the programmable divider, using N, is only able to operate at a maximum clock frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, but the output f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is in the hundreds of MHz range; . Interposing a fixed prescaler, which can operate at this frequency range, with a value M of say, 40, drops the output frequency into the operating range of the programmable divider. However, a factor of 40 has been introduced into the equation, so the output frequency is now:

&lt;math&gt;f_o = 40Nf_r&lt;/math&gt;

If f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; remains at 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz, only every 40th channel can be obtained. Alternatively, if f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced by a factor of 40 to compensate, it becomes 312.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, which is much too low to give good filtering and lock performance characteristics. It also means that programming the divider becomes more complex, as the modulus needs to be verified so that only those that give true channels are used, not every 1/40th of a channel that is available.

==The solution==
The solution is the dual modulus prescaler. The main divider is split into two parts, the main part N and an additional divider A which is strictly lesser than N. Both dividers are clocked from the output of the dual-modulus prescaler, but only the output of the N divider is fed back to the comparator. Initially, the prescaler is set to divide by M&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Both N and A count down until A reaches zero, at which point the prescaler is switched to a division ratio of M. At this point, the divider N has completed A counts. Counting continues until N reaches zero, which is an additional N&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;A counts. At this point the cycle repeats.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
            &amp;f_o = f_r\left[{M(N-A) + (M+1)A}\right]\\
\Rightarrow &amp;f_o = f_r\left(MN+A\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So while we still have a factor of M being multiplied by N, we can add an additional count, A, which effectively gives us a divider with a fractional part. Only the prescaler needs to be constructed from high-speed parts, and the reference frequency can remain equal to the desired output frequency spacing.

The diagram below shows the elements and arrangement of a [[frequency synthesizer]] with dual-modulus prescaler. (Compare with diagram on main synthesizer page).

[[Image:Dual_modulus_prescaler_frequency_synthesiser.svg]]

One can compute A and N from the formulae:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 N &amp;= \left\lfloor\frac{V}{M}\right\rfloor\\
 A &amp;= V - MN
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where V is the combined division ratio V = MN+A.  For this to work properly, A must be strictly less than M, as well as less than or equal to N. These restrictions on values of A imply that you can't get every division ratio V. If V falls below M(M&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1), some channels will be missing.

==Example==

Today, most dual-modulus prescalers exist inside of PLL chips, making it impossible to probe actual signals during operation.  The first dual-modulus prescalers were discrete ECL devices, separate from the PLL chips.  Here is an example of a dual-modulus prescaler in use.  This circuit happens to use a [[Motorola]] MC145158 with a [[Fujitsu]] MB-501 dual-modulus prescaler operating in the 128/129 mode.  The PLL is locked at 917.94&amp;nbsp;MHz (f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) with a channel spacing frequency of 30&amp;nbsp;kHz (f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;).  The total integer count therefore is 30,598.  Dividing this by 128 (M) yields a quotient of 239 with a remainder of 6, N and A respectively.  The result of this frequency choice is that the prescaler spends most of its time counting at 128, and just a brief period at 129.

This is shown by the upper purple trace, the modulus control, A, counter output.  These two screen captures differ only in the horizontal scale.  The lower, yellow trace is the N counter output whose frequency corresponds to the channel spacing frequency of 30&amp;nbsp;kHz.  The green trace is the output from the dual-modulus prescaler, which happens to correspond to 7.1714&amp;nbsp;MHz in the case that the prescaler is at 128 and 7.1158 when it is at 129.  It is plainly obvious that the modulus control is low for precisely 6 cycles of the prescaler output.  What is not obvious is the fact that the frequency changes by less than one percent between the two states of the modulus control.  There will be cases where A = 0, resulting in the dual-modulus prescaler counting only by 128.  This would happen at 906.24, 910.08, 913.92, 917.76, 921.60&amp;nbsp;MHz and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1130">A '''dual headphone adapter''', also known as a "headphone splitter" or "audio jack splitter", is a device that allows two [[headphones]] to be connected through to one [[audio jack]]. They can be used to listen to audio through multiple audio input devices, such as headphones on devices such as an [[MP3 player]], [[CD player]], modern [[Computer]] with audio-out compatibility (such as a [[headphone]] socket) or [[boombox]]. Although [[Earbud headphones|earbuds]], a type of headphone design, can be shared with a friend (with one "bud" in another's ear), a dual headphone adapter can be more practical. Dual headphone adapters can be purchased at various audio and electronic stores. Headphone adapters can be used by inserting a 3.5mm [[phone connector (audio)|Audio jack plug]] into the headphone jack.

==Types of headphone adapters==
Many designs of headphone adapters have been created by various individuals and/or manufacturers. The most common types are the "Y" design, adapters with up to six headphone sockets, and wired headphone adapters.

'''ET3 Global Alliance''' is an American open [[consortium]] of licensees dedicated to global implementation of [[Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.et3.net|title=Welcome {{!}} The Evacuated Tube Transport Technology Network|website=et3.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ET3). It was founded by Daryl Oster in 1997 with the goal of establishing a global transportation system utilizing car-sized cargo and passenger  capsules traveling in 1.5m diameter tubes via frictionless superconductive [[maglev]].

Oster claims that the ET3 system will be able to provide 50 times the amount of transportation per kilowatt-hour compared with electric cars and electric trains, costing only 20 cents' worth of electrical energy to get up to {{Convert|350|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sci-fi Hyperloop-type technology under development at ET3|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100955989|newspaper=https://www.cnbc.com/|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ET3 claims that initial systems would travel at the speed of {{Convert|600|km/h|abbr=on}} for in state trips, and later will be developed to 6,500&amp;nbsp;km/h (4,000&amp;nbsp;mph, [[hypersonic speed]]) for international travel that will allow passenger or cargo travel from New York to Beijing in 2 hours. The initial proof of concept system could be built in as little 3 years for operational transport.

== 1997–2007 ==
The first patent issued in the field of evacuated tube transport was credited to Daryl Oster as inventor while the original assigner was issued to Et3.com Inc on Sept 14, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5950543A/en|title=Evacuated tube transport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.ET3.com ET3] has been active since 1999. But it was two years prior, on Oct 10 1997, when Daryl Oster  filed the 1999 patent relating to evacuated tube transport. In 2001, [[Southwest Jiaotong University]] (SWJTU) invited Daryl to China to advance the field of Evacuated Tube Transport (ETT) and to discuss adopting High Temperature Superconducting Maglev (HTSM) as the levitation system for ETT.

In 2004, Daryl Oster had published "A New Industrial Era Coming Initial Dialogue on Evacuated Tube Transport".&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/e.awslibrary31/a%20new%20industrial%20era%20coming%20initial%20dialogue%20on%20evacuated%20tube%20transportation%20ett.pdf A New Industrial Era Coming Initial Dialogue on Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaoping Zhang]] of SWJTU and Daryl Oster shared year long communications during the early 2000s via email which can be read in his 2004 published book. SWJTU became the first university institution to become licensees of the ET3 GA consortium. The most ET3 licensees held outside of the USA are held in China. SWJTU and individuals from China have contributed significant IP to the ET3 consortia. By 2007, Yaoping Zhang, a former professor of  SWJTU, began promoting ETT as "evolutionary transportation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2010/08/china-working-towards-600-mph-maglev.html|title=China Working towards 600 Mph Maglev Trains Through Very Low Pressure Underground Tubes for 2020 to 2030 - NextBigFuture.com|date=8 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yaoping Zhang currently operates ET3 GA's subsidiary [http://www.ET3.com.cn ET3 China Inc].

An '''EcoDisc''' is a patented type of [[DVD]] which is thinner than a conventional [[DVD]] because it is made from a single layer of [[polycarbonate]] instead of two layers glued together. Because it contains less material, its manufacture produces only around half of the carbon dioxide of a conventional DVD,&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecodisc.org/faqs.php|title=EcoDisc faqs|work=EcoDisc Technology AG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcformat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcformat.techradar.com/blog-entry/here-cometh-ecodisc-17-06-09|title=PC Format: Here cometh' the EcoDisc|first=Jeremy |last=Ford |date= 17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of a
non-biodegradable toxic glue layer makes it easier to recycle.&lt;ref name="doublevision"/&gt; Ecodiscs are prone to breakage (accidental or otherwise) since they are, as of May 2011, much less stiff than regular discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inai.de/2012/07/31|title=The Ecodisc oblate|first=Jan|last=Engelhardt|date=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EcoDisc Technology AG licences manufacturers of the discs, and also holds the rights to the EcoDisc logo.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

The discs are used for [[covermount]]s by magazine publishers because their flexibility makes them less prone to damage during handling and transportation than rigid conventional DVDs and shipping costs are reduced because of their lower weight.&lt;ref name="doublevision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublevisiongroup.com/articles/ecodisc-481.html|title=EcoDisc|date=1 March 2010 | work=Double Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum capacity of the discs is 4.7 GB, as of February 2011 double layer 8.5 GB capacity is not available.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

Although earlier versions of the EcoDisc occasionally showed problems with [[Slot-loading|Slot-In drives]] (especially with those of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[MacBook]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/Eco-Disks-to-Get-Stuck-Into-Hundred-of-Macs-039-Slot-Loading-Drives-76658.shtml | title =Eco-Disks to Get Stuck Into Hundred of Macs' Slot-Loading Drives | work=Softpedia | date = 18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apcmag.com/mac_repair_shops_popping_champagne_after_ecofriendly_dvd_gets_stuck_in_hundreds_of_macs.htm | title =Mac repair shops popping champagne after 'eco-friendly' DVD gets stuck in hundreds of Macs | work =APC Magazine | date =17 January 2008 | first = Dan | last =Warne }}&lt;/ref&gt; these problems have since been remedied.

In 2009 and 2010, Testronic Laboratories, a quality assurance and testing company, performed tests to assess compatibility on around 600 different models of player and drive, representing 80-90% of the installed product base, and found the disc compatible with all but one of the drives (the failing drive was a 1998 Sony DVP-S315).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecodisc.org/download/EcoDisc_Compatibility.pdf|title=EcoDisc Compatibility|work=EcoDisc Technology AG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprint scanner in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|A stand-alone fingerprint scanner, such as one used at the [[wikt:Entrance|entrance]] to a [[building]]|206x206px]]
'''Fingerprint scanners''' are security systems of [[biometrics]]. They are now used in police stations, security industries and most recently, on [[computer]]s.

Everyone has marks on their fingers. They can not be removed or changed. These marks have a pattern and this pattern is called the [[fingerprint]]. Every fingerprint is special, and different from any other in the world. Because there are countless combinations, fingerprints have become an ideal means of identification.

==Types of fingerprint scanners==
There are four types of fingerprint scanner: the optical scanner, the capacitance scanner, the ultrasonic scanner, and the thermal scanner. The basic function of these three types of scanners is to get an image of a person’s fingerprint and find a match for this print in the [[database]].
The capacitance scanner is better, because the images are more exact and precise. Scanners are used for scanning.
# '''Optical scanners''' take a visual image of the fingerprint using a digital camera.
# '''Capacitive or CMOS scanners''' use capacitors and thus electrical current to form an image of the fingerprint.
# '''Ultrasound fingerprint scanners''' use high frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal (outer) layer of the skin.
# '''Thermal scanners''' sense the temperature differences on the contact surface, in between fingerprint ridges and valleys.

== Construction forms ==
[[File:Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 fingerprint scanner.jpg|thumb|Many [[Smartphone|smartphones]] have fingerprint scanners as a way of unlocking the screen.|180x180px]]
There are two construction forms: the stagnant and the moving fingerprint scanner.

* Stagnant: The finger must be dragged over the small scanning area. This is cheaper and less reliable than the moving form.  The image is not very good when the finger is not regularly dragged over the scanning area.
* Moving: The finger lies on the scanning area, while the scanner runs underneath. Because the scanner runs regularly over the fingerprint, the images are better.

[[Image:Electrostatic voltmeter Rawson Electrical 6KV.jpg|thumb|Electrostatic voltmeter]]
'''Electrostatic voltmeter''' can refer to an [[electrostatic]] charge meter, known also as '''surface DC voltmeter''', or to a [[voltmeter]] to measure large [[electrical potential]]s, traditionally called electrostatic voltmeter.

==Charge meter==
A surface DC voltmeter is an instrument that measures voltage with no [[electric charge]] transfer. 

It can accurately measure surface potential ([[voltage]]) on materials without making physical contact and so there is no [[electrostatic]] charge transfer or loading of the [[voltage source]].

===Explanation===
Many voltage measurements cannot be made using conventional contacting [[voltmeter]]s because they require charge transfer to the voltmeter, thus causing loading and modification of the source voltage. For example, when measuring voltage distribution on a [[dielectric]] surface, any measurement technique that requires charge transfer, no matter how small, will modify or destroy the actual [[data]].

===Principle of operation===
In practice, an electrostatic charge monitoring [[Test probe|probe]] is placed close (1&amp;nbsp;mm to 5&amp;nbsp;mm) to the surface to be measured and the probe body is driven to the same [[potential]] as the measured unknown by an [[electronic circuit]]. This achieves a high accuracy measurement that is virtually insensitive to variations in probe-to-surface distances. The technique also prevents [[Electrical breakdown|arc-over]] between the probe and measured surface when measuring high voltages.

==Voltmeter==
[[Image:Electrostatic Voltmeter operating principle.jpg|thumb|200px|Electrostatic voltmeter operation]]
[[Image:Electrostatic voltmeter movement closeup.jpg|thumb|400px|Electrostatic voltmeter mechanism]]

The operating principle of an electrostatic voltmeter is similar to that of an [[electrometer]], it is, however, designed to measure high potential differences; typically from a few hundred to many thousands [[volts]].

===Principle of operation===
Electrostatic voltmeter utilizes the attraction force between two charged surfaces to create a deflection of a pointer directly calibrated in [[volts]]. Since the attraction force is the same regardless of the polarity of the charged surfaces (as long as the charge is opposite), the electrostatic voltmeter can measure both direct  current]] and [[alternating current]]. 

Typical construction is shown in the engraving. The pivoted sector NN is attracted to the fixed sector QQ. The moving sector indicating the voltage by the pointer P and is counterbalanced by the small weight w. In newer instruments the weight is replaced by a spring, thus allowing the meter to be used both in horizontal and vertical positions. This form of design is shown in the photograph of the mechanism. The fixed sector is insulated from the rest of the meter. The butterfly shaped moving sector, made out of a thin aluminum foil, is pivoted below. Both the fixed and the moving sectors are highly polished and without any sharp corners to minimize high electrical stress areas. The movement of the sector is damped by the air vane attached by a curved piece of wire.

'''Elnec''' is a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] manufacturer of [[Programmer (hardware)|device programming]] systems for [[Programmable logic device|programmable integrated circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronics-manufacturers.com/Electronic_components/Device_programmers/ Device programmers manufacturers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Since its founding in 1991, the company has been oriented towards developing and manufacturing developer tools like [[device programmer]]s, [[emulators]], simulators and [[logic analyzer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnec.com/en/about-elnec/company-info/ About Elnec]&lt;/ref&gt;

Core business of the company today is only the development and manufacture of equipment that transfers data into various non-volatile semiconductor devices. These devices can be sorted into three categories: [[Microcontroller]], [[Flash Memory]], [[Programmable logic device|Programmable Logic Devices]].

Most of Elnec device programmers can be referred as universal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elektronika.rs.ba/data/prodaja/ELNEC/UK200906%20ELNEC%20BeeProg+%20article.pdf Elektor BeeProg+ review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/newproducts/180/elnec.htm Circuit Cellar SmartProg2 review]&lt;/ref&gt; due to support of many programmable devices from different semiconductor companies as [[Microchip Technology|Microchip]], [[STMicroelectronics]], EM microelectronics, etc.
 
Elnec’s products are sold also under ODM names as B&amp;K Precision, Dataman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dataman.com/webpages/AboutUs/Partners.aspx Dataman's partners]&lt;/ref&gt; or Minato.

One of company's competitors is [[Data I/O]].

== Current products ==

[[Image:Beeprog plus.jpg|thumb|Elnec BeeProg+ programmer]]

*'''Universal programmers''' - Designed for individual users (new electronics products development, [[chip tuning]]) and small manufacturers of electronics.
*'''Specialised programmers''' - Products specialised for programming specific programmable devices groups (families): [[EPROM]], [[EEPROM]], [[Microcontroller|MCU]], [[Flash memory|Flash]], etc.
*'''Programming adapters''' - Programmable devices could be bought in different package types:[[Shrink Small-Outline Package|SSOP]], [[Small-outline integrated circuit|SOIC]], [[Plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]], [[Quad Flat No leads package|QFN]], [[Ball grid array|BGA]], etc. Programming Adapters are used to convert a pinout of selected programmable device package into interface used by programmer. Elnec’s programmers use [[DIL package|DIL]] interface as a standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6002">'''Fruit waxing''' is the process of covering [[Fruit|fruits]] (and, in some cases, [[Vegetable|vegetables]]) with artificial waxing material. Natural [[wax]] is removed first, usually by washing. Waxing materials may be either natural or [[petroleum]]-based.

The primary reasons for waxing are to prevent water loss (making up for the removal in washing of the natural waxes in fruits that have them, particularly citrus but also, for example, apples&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;P. E. Kolattukudy, [http://postharvest.tfrec.wsu.edu/REP2003A.pdf "Natural Waxes on Fruits"], ''Post Harvest Pomology Newsletter'' 2.2 (1984), repr. Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center, [[Washington State University]], March 2003 (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;) and thus retard shrinkage and spoilage, and to improve appearance.&lt;ref name=ANR&gt;Leo J.

Aesthetics—consumer preference for shiny fruit—has since become the main reason.&lt;ref name=Washington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipid/&gt; In addition to fruit, some vegetables can usefully be waxed, such as [[cassava]];&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5tijQBNi-xoC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=Fruit+waxing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xvycULfyCLHAiwLxxoGQCg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Coating%20roots%20with%20paraffin%20wax&amp;f=false p. 188].&lt;/ref&gt; vegetables commonly waxed include [[Cucumber|cucumbers]], [[Rutabaga|swedes or rutabagas]], and green tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;John M.

The '''iControlPad''' is a [[wireless]] [[game controller]] compatible with a variety of [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], and [[personal computer]]s. It is designed for use as either a standalone [[gamepad]] or attached to appropriately sized devices, such as the [[iPhone]], using a clamp system.&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetoid.com/2011/07/09/icontrolpad-review/|title=iControlPad Review|publisher=Gadgetoid|date=July 9, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the iControlPad is able to add traditional physical gaming controls to devices which otherwise rely on inputs such as [[touchscreen]]s and [[accelerometer]]s.&lt;ref name="MobileMagReal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobilemag.com/2008/12/23/game-for-real-with-iphone-icontrolpad/ | title = Game for Real with iPhone iControlPad | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Kwan | first = Michael | date = 2008-12-23 | work = [[Mobile Magazine]] | publisher = Pilato Private Consulting | quote = Naturally, you’ll still be able to take advantage of anything on the touchscreen [...] using the accelerometer, but having “real” gaming controls is a great option as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The iControlPad's input controls include an eight-directional [[D-pad]], dual [[analog stick|analog nubs]], six digital face buttons, and two digital trigger buttons on the gamepad's reverse. The sides of the iControlPad are detachable, with two different attachment types: rubber grips, for using the controller as a standard wireless gamepad; or plastic clamps, for connecting with a suitable handheld, such as a smartphone or [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt; A [[mini USB]] port on the bottom of the iControlPad can be used to charge the internal 1500mAh battery, update the device's [[firmware]], and charge attached devices using a [[USB On-The-Go]] connection and an appropriate adapter.&lt;ref name="iCPManual" /&gt;

The iControlPad, a [[Bluetooth]] device, can be run in a wide variety of modes, including as a [[Human interface device|HID]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[joystick]], and gamepad, among others, allowing compatibility with equipment which is limited to only certain types of input.&lt;ref name="iCPManual" /&gt; One of the iControlPad's modes mimics the protocol used by the [[iCade]], an [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade cabinet]] released for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]], facilitating compatibility between apps designed for the iCade and the iControlPad hardware.&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt;

Due to the iControlPad's ability to operate as a Bluetooth keyboard&amp;mdash;by mapping the D-pad and buttons to standard keyboard keys&amp;mdash;it is able to communicate with devices such as those running Apple's [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], including the iPhone and iPad, which do not support Bluetooth gamepads.&lt;ref name="148Physical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/news/gaming-ios-physical-variety-external-joystick-gamepad-solutions/|title=Gaming on iOS is About to Get Physical With a Variety of External Joystick and Gamepad Solutions.|publisher=148Apps|first=Carter|last=Dotson|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since iOS natively supports keyboards, apps can be developed with iControlPad compatibility using either its own protocol or that of the iCade. Thus, the iControlPad is able to control [[video games]] and [[video game console emulator]]s across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name="DroidReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droidgamers.com/index.php/game-news/hardware-a-devices/1493-icontrolpad-for-android-review-its-as-easy-as-a-b-x-y-|title=iControlPad for Android Review: It's as easy as A, B, X, Y...|publisher=DroidGamers|first=Tom|last=Grace|date=April 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the iControlPad began in 2007,{{Specify|date=July 2011}} with testing using a hacked [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] gamepad to connect to an iPhone over the [[Dock Connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|dock connection]].&lt;ref name="iCPArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icontrolpad.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316081844/http://www.icontrolpad.com/|archivedate=March 16, 2009|title=iControlPad - Add real gaming controls to your iPhone!|publisher=iControlPad Ltd|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the serial connection was working, the first prototype iControlPad was produced, using a design styled after the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]. This earliest concept was a one-piece case enveloping the iPhone, with a [[D-pad]] on the left side, and four face buttons on the right in a landscape orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/23/icontrolpad-gamepad-heads-to-production-warms-hearts/ | title = iControlPad gamepad heads to production, warms hearts | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Stevens | first = Tim | date = December 12, 2008 | work = [[Engadget]] | publisher = [[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first revealed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/icontrolpad-unofficial-iphone-gamepad-coming-soon-50000514/ | title = iControlPad unofficial iPhone gamepad coming soon | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Wattanajantra | first = Asavin | date = 2010-08-27 | publisher = [[CNET]] | quote = The device has been in development for some time.

Well, almost. You can order today for a delivery next week [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2009, a completely redesigned iControlPad prototype was under development. This much larger version moved the controls below the screen and added two analog nubs and two trigger buttons to the controller.&lt;ref name="EngadgetProto09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/08/latest-icontrolpad-prototype-bulks-up-gets-handled-on-video/|title=Latest iControlPad prototype bulks up, gets handled on video|publisher=[[Engadget]]|first=Nilay|last=Patel|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design, which featured clamps to attach it to the iPhone, was much closer to the version that was ultimately released, and would soon go into production.&lt;ref name="SlashProduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-for-iphone-production-parts-now-shipping-2398553/|title=iControlPad for iPhone production parts now shipping|publisher=[[SlashGear]]|first=Chris|last=Davies|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one large change was made very late in development. The team had secretly added Bluetooth support to the iControlPad, in order to increase compatibility beyond the iPhone and its proprietary connection.&lt;ref name="TwitterSecret"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Craigix/statuses/25788017664|title=Something we kept secret ...|publisher=[[Twitter]]|first=Craig|last=Rothwell|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved fortunate when Apple began exercising its rights over the dock connector, suing an unlicensed accessory maker. Thus, the iControlPad team were forced to adapt to use the Bluetooth connection for the iPhone,&lt;ref name="SlashDock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-dumps-dock-connector-for-bluetooth-over-apple-legal-fears-android-bt-confirmed-28104830/|title=iControlPad dumps Dock Connector for Bluetooth over Apple legal fears; Android BT confirmed|publisher=[[SlashGear]]|first=Chris|last=Davies|date=September 28, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was this version which finally became available for order in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-with-bluetooth-shipping-this-month-08131711/ | title = iControlPad with Bluetooth Shipping This Month | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Perkins | first = Samia | date = February 8, 2011 | work = [[SlashGear]] | publisher = R3 Media LLC | quote = The new iControlPad with Bluetooth is scheduled to ship February 16th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reception for the iControlPad has been mostly positive. [[The Register|Register Hardware]] noted that while "patience and geekery" were required to get the controller working, the iControlPad "almost perfectly solves the touchscreen game control conundrum".&lt;ref name="RegisterReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.com/2011/05/18/review_igamer_icontrolpad/|title=iControlPad Bluetooth controller for mobile devices|publisher=[[The Register|Register Hardware]]|first=Andrew|last=Bailey|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadgetoid homed in on the device's usefulness for classic gaming, remarking that it was "awesome [...] for emulation on the go".&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt; TouchArcade's reviewer said while playing games with the iControlPad that "the experience feels great", but that "[he couldn't] recommend that the typical gamer run out right now and grab one," due to its limited support on the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref name="TouchReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/07/13/a-close-look-at-the-icontrolpad-bluetooth-control-accessory/|title=A Close Look at the 'iControlPad' Bluetooth Control Accessory|publisher=TouchArcade|first=Blake|last=Patterson|date=July 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reviews were mixed on the quality of the controls, with DroidGamers describing them as "very loose",&lt;ref name="DroidReview" /&gt; while, conversely, Register Hardware said "the analogue nubs and face buttons work extremely well".&lt;ref name="RegisterReview" /&gt; The controller's responsiveness was later improved by replacing the original rubber keymat with a larger one. In their review, Gadgetoid lauded the inputs as having "a great tactile feel and a liberal amount of travel with a good response."&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt;

==iControlPad 2==

A successor, the '''iControlPad 2''', was successfully funded via [[Kickstarter]] in October 2012. As of November 2013, it has been cancelled,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with little to no refunds.

'''Innovation in Malaysia''' describes trends and developments in innovation in Malaysia.

The Najib Razak coalition government estimates that 6% annual growth is necessary to reach high-income status by 2020. This is a somewhat higher rate than both the average for the previous decade and the [[World Bank Group|World Bank’s]] projection for 2016 and 2017 of about 4.2% growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Policy debate on innovation for inclusive, sustainable development ==
{{relevance|date=September 2017}}
Innovation for inclusive and [[sustainable development]] has recently become a widely discussed area of public policy in Malaysia. Discussion in policy circles has centred on the need to address factors such as low farm productivity, increasing health-related problems, natural disasters, environmental problems and monetary inflation. In 2014, the government launched transdisciplinary research grants with the objective of including societal benefits among the performance criteria at Malaysia’s research universities and providing incentives to promote science in support of poverty alleviation and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Malaysia. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Rasiah|first=Rajah|last2=Chandran|first2=V.G.R.|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=676-691|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 16 November 2016, Malaysia ratified the [[Paris Agreement]]. According to the [[World Resources Institute]], Malaysia contributed about 0.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012, taking into account land-use changes and forestry. 'Although Malaysia remains committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 40% by 2020 over 2012 levels, as pledged by the Malaysian prime minister at the climate summit in Warsaw in 2013, it faces growing sustainability challenges’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In January 2014, Selangor, the most developed of Malaysia’s federated states, experienced water shortages. These were caused by high pollution levels and the drying of reservoirs as a consequence of overuse. Land clearing and deforestation are still major concerns, due to landslides and population displacements. Malaysia is the world’s second-biggest producer of [[Palm oil production in Malaysia|palm oil]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

[[Palm oil production in Malaysia|Palm oil]] exports represent the third-largest category of Malaysian exports after fossil fuels (petroleum and gas) and electronics. Approximately 58% of Malaysia was forested in 2010. With the government having committed to preserving at least half of all land as primary forest, Malaysia has little latitude to expand the extent of land already under cultivation. Rather, it will need to focus on improving productivity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Malaysia has little room for palm oïl expansion, minister says. 18 November|last=Morales|first=Alex|date=2010|work=Bloomberg News Online (restricted access)|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, oil and gas contributed nearly 32% of government revenue. Although natural gas represented about 40% of Malaysia’s energy consumption in 2008, there have been gas shortages since 2009, owing to the combination of a declining domestic gas supply and rising demand. To compound matters, the sharp drop in global oil prices between July and December 2014 forced the government to cut expenditure in January 2015 to maintain its budget deficit at 3%. A recent [[UNESCO]] budget review indicates that Malaysia will not be able to rely on its natural resources to propel itself towards high-income status by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is rising inequality in Malaysia, with the disparity between the top 20% income-earners and the bottom 40% widening. The government’s Subsidy Rationalization Programme, which had first been rolled out in 2010, moved into high gear in 2014 with three consecutive increases in natural gas prices in a single year. The removal of energy subsidies, coupled with the introduction of a general sales tax on consumer goods in April 2015, is expected to increase the cost of living.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The four out of ten Malaysians in the lowest income bracket are also increasingly exposed to social and environmental risks. The incidence of dengue increased by 90% in 2013 over the previous year, for instance, with 39,222 recorded cases, in a trend which may be linked to deforestation and/or climate change. The rising crime rate is another concern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Contribution of research to development ==
Between 2008 and 2012, research spending rose from 0.79% to 1.13% of GDP. GDP grew steadily over the same period. Malaysia plans to raise this ratio to 2% of GDP by 2020. Whether or not it reaches this target will depend largely upon the dynamism of the business enterprise sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:GDP_per_capita_and_GERD_GDP_ratio_in_the_Black_Sea_countries,_2010–2013_(average).svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GDP_per_capita_and_GERD_GDP_ratio_in_the_Black_Sea_countries,_2010%E2%80%932013_(average).svg|thumb|GDP per capita and research expenditure as a share of GDP in Malaysia and other countries, 2010–2013 (average). Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 12.4]]
Research and development (R&amp;D) are conducted predominantly in large-scale enterprises in the electronics, automotive and chemical industries. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 97% of all private firms, contribute little. This is because most of the small and medium-sized enterprises that work as subcontractors for multinational firms have remained confined to the role of original equipment manufacturers. In order to help these small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs) access the requisite knowledge, skills and finance that will enable them to participate in original design and original brand manufacturing, the government has adopted a strategy of connecting SMEs to the incubation facilities in the country’s numerous science and technology parks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Provincializing Economic Development: Technological Upgrading in the Integrated Circuits Industry in Malaysia.|last=Rasiah|first=R.|last2=Yap|first2=X.Y.|last3=Salih|first3=K.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasiah|first=R.|last2=Yap|first2=X.Y. and S. Yap|year=2015|title=Sticky spots on slippery slopes: the development of the integrated circuits industry in emerging East Asia|url=|journal=Institutions and Economies|volume=7|pages=52-79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign multinational firms are generally engaged in more sophisticated R&amp;D than national firms.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, even the R&amp;D conducted by foreign firms tends to be confined to process and product improvements, rather than pushing back the international technology frontier. Moreover, foreign multinationals are heavily dependent on their parent and subsidiary firms based outside Malaysia for personnel, owing to the lack of qualified human capital and research universities within Malaysia to call upon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A group of ten multinationals have decided to address these shortcomings. In order to satisfy the research needs of the electrical and electronics industries, which employ nearly 5 000 research scientists and engineers in Malaysia, [[Agilent Technologies]], [[Intel]], [[Motorola Solutions]], [[Silterra Malaysia|Silterra]] and six other multinationals established a platform in 2012 to promote Collaborative Research in Engineering, Science and Technology (CREST&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crest.my|title=Collaborative Research in Engineering, Science and Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) among industry, academia and the government. These multinational firms generate close to MYR 25 billion (circa US$ 6.9 billion) in annual revenue and spend nearly MYR 1.4 billion on research and development. They have utilized government research grants extensively since the government decided in 2005 to extend these grants beyond domestic firms to multinational beneficiaries. Besides research, the focus is on talent development, the ultimate aim being to help the industry add greater value to its products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges for high-tech industries ==
Since the launch of export-oriented industrialization in 1971, multinational corporations have relocated to Malaysia, fuelling a rapid expansion in manufactured exports that has helped turn the country into one of the world’s leading exporters of electrical and electronic goods. Today, Malaysia is highly integrated in global trade, with manufacturing contributing over 60% of its exports. Half of these exports (49%) were destined for the East Asian market in 2010, compared to just 29% in 1980. The main destinations in East Asia are China, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. In 2013, Malaysia accounted for 6.6% of world exports of integrated circuits and other electronic components, according to the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Trade Statistics|last=World Trade Organization|first=|publisher=World Trade Organization|year=2014|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 15 years or so, the share of manufacturing in GDP has gradually declined as a natural consequence of the concomitant growth in services as a corollary of greater development. Modern manufacturing and services are deeply intertwined, as high-tech industries often have a massive services component. The development of the services sector is thus not, in itself, a cause for concern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

High-tech manufacturing has stagnated in absolute terms in recent years and its share of global added value has slipped from 0.8% in 2007 to 0.6% in 2013. Over the same period, Malaysia’s global share of high-tech exports (goods and services) contracted from 4.6% to 3.5%, according to the [[World Trade Organization]]. The contribution of high-tech industries to national GDP has likewise dropped.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;This suggests that the shift towards services has neglected the development of high-tech services. Moreover, although the volume of manufacturing has not declined, less value is being added to manufactured goods than before. As a consequence, Malaysia’s trade surplus declined from 144 529 ringgits (MYR) in 2009 to MYR 91 539 in 2013 and Malaysia has been losing ground in high-tech exports. This means that Malaysian high-tech industries are contributing much less to manufactured exports than they did a decade ago. Even though patent applications with the Malaysian patent office have increased steadily over the years, there still seems to be little return on investment in R&amp;D. Domestic applications also seem to be of lower quality than those of foreign applicants, with a cumulative grants-to-application ratio of 18% between 1989 and 2014, against 53% for foreign applicants over the same period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, academic or public research organizations in Malaysia appear to have a limited ability to translate research into intellectual property rights. The Malaysian Institute of Micro-electronic Systems, Malaysia’s forefront public R&amp;D institute, which was corporatized in 1992, contributed 45–50% of Malaysia’s patents filed in 2010 but the low citations that have emerged from those patents suggest that the commercialization rate is low.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Rate of return on research ==
While discovery and patenting are crucial for Malaysia's export-oriented competitiveness and growth strategy, there still seems to be little return on investment in research and development. The low commercialization rate can largely be attributed to a lack of university–industry collaboration, rigidities in research organizations and problems with co-ordinating policies. Universities seem to confine the commercialization of their research results to specific areas, such as health and information and communication technologies. In 2010, the government established the Malaysian Innovation Agency to spur the commercialization of research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran|first=V.G.R.|last2=Wong|first2=C.V.|year=2011|title=Patenting activities by developing countries: the case of Malaysia.|url=|journal=World Patent Information|volume=33|pages=51-57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An overview of Malaysia's national innovation system: policies, institutions and performance. In: National Innovation System in Selected Asian Countries.|last=Thiruchelvam|first=K.|last2=Ng|first2=B.K.|last3=Wong|first3=C.Y.|publisher=Chulalongkorn University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Bangkok|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Five years after its inception, the Malaysian Innovation Agency had made a limited impact on commercialization thus far, owing to the unclear delineation of its role in relation to the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Malaysia)|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] and the agency’s limited resources. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that the agency is beginning to play a catalytic role in driving commercialization and an innovative culture, especially as regards innovation beyond the hardware industry, which is where firms offering services, such as airline services, are active.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

One public–private funding model involves the [[Malaysian Palm Oil Board]], a public body born of the merger of the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia and the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority in 2000, by act of parliament. Through a tax levied on every tonne of palm oil and palm kernel oil produced in the country, the oil palm industry funds many of the research grants provided by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. These grants amounted to MYR 2.04 billion (circa US$ 565 million) between 2000 and 2010. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board supports innovation in areas such as biodiesel and alternate uses for palm biomass and organic waste. Its research into biomass has led to the development of wood and paper products, fertilizers, bio-energy sources, polyethylene sheeting for use in vehicles and other products made of palm biomass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Development of endogenous research ==
The government is keen to develop endogenous research, in order to reduce the country’s reliance on industrial research undertaken by foreign multinational companies. By financing graduate study, the government helped to double enrolment in PhD programmes between 2007 and 2010 to 22,000. It has also introduced incentives to encourage expatriates to return to Malaysia through the Returning Expert Programme and plans to become the sixth-largest destination for international university students by 2020. It is hoped that the creation of the [[ASEAN Economic Community]] in 2015 will encourage scientific co-operation among member countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/higher-education-asia-graduate-university-research-2014-en.pdf|title=Higher Education in Asia: Expanding Up, Expanding Out|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2014|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of these research universities resulted from the government’s higher education strategy of 2006. A parallel goal of the strategy was to raise government spending on higher education.  By financing graduate students, for instance, the government doubled enrolment in doctoral programmes between 2007 and 2010. According to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], the number of full-time equivalent researchers in Malaysia tripled between 2008 and 2012 (from 16,345 to 52,052), carrying the researcher density to 1 780 per million inhabitants in 2012, which is well above the global average (1,083).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Carnot cycle p-V diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram describing the ideal combustion cycle by Carnot]]

An '''internal combustion engine''' ('''ICE''') is a [[heat engine]] where the [[combustion]] of a [[fuel]] occurs with an [[oxidizer]] (usually air) in a [[combustion chamber]] that is an integral part of the [[working fluid]] flow circuit. In an internal combustion engine, the expansion of the high-[[temperature]] and high-[[pressure]] gases produced by combustion applies direct [[force]] to some component of the engine. The force is applied typically to [[piston]]s, [[turbine blade]]s, [[wikt:rotor|rotor]] or a [[propulsive nozzle|nozzle]]. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming [[chemical energy]] into useful [[mechanical energy]].

The first commercially successful internal combustion engine was created by [[Étienne Lenoir]] around 1859&lt;ref name="EB1"&gt;{{cite web|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1350805/history-of-technology/10451/Internal-combustion-engine |title=History of Technology: Internal Combustion engines |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first modern internal combustion engine was created in 1876 by [[Nikolaus Otto]] (see ''[[Otto engine]]'').

The term ''[[wikt:internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine]]'' usually refers to an engine in which combustion is [[Intermittency|intermittent]], such as the more familiar [[four-stroke]] and [[two-stroke]] piston engines, along with variants, such as the [[Six-stroke engine|six-stroke]] piston engine and the [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]]. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: [[gas turbine]]s, [[jet engine]]s and most [[rocket engine]]s, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described.&lt;ref name="EB1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pulkrabek&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering Fundamentals of the Internal Combustion Engine|last=Pulkrabek|first=Willard W.|year=1997|page=2|isbn=9780135708545|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gun|Firearms]] are also a form of internal combustion engine.&lt;ref name=pulkrabek /&gt;

In contrast, in [[external combustion engine]]s, such as [[steam engine|steam]] or [[Stirling engine]]s, energy is delivered to a working fluid not consisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by combustion products. Working fluids can be air, hot water, [[pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] or even liquid sodium, heated in a [[boiler]]. ICEs are usually powered by energy-dense fuels such as gasoline or diesel fuel, liquids derived from [[fossil fuel]]s. While there are many stationary applications, most ICEs are used in mobile applications and are the dominant power supply for [[vehicle]]s such as cars, aircraft, and boats.

Typically an ICE is fed with fossil fuels like [[natural gas]] or [[petroleum]] products such as [[gasoline]], [[diesel fuel]] or [[fuel oil]]. There is a growing usage of [[renewable fuels]] like [[biodiesel]] for CI (compression ignition) engines and [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] or [[Methanol fuel|methanol]] for SI (spark ignition) engines. [[Hydrogen]] is sometimes used, and can be obtained from either fossil fuels or renewable energy.

== History ==
{{Main article|History of the internal combustion engine}}
Various [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s contributed to the development of internal combustion engines. In 1791, [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]] developed the [[gas turbine]]. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a [[gas engine]]. Also in 1794, Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use [[liquid fuel]], and built an engine around that time. In 1798, [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] built the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, [[France|French]] engineers [[Nicéphore Niépce|Nicéphore]] (who went on to invent [[photography]]) and [[Claude Niépce]] ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the [[Pyréolophore]]. This engine powered a boat on the [[Saône]] river, France.  The same year,  the [[Swiss]] engineer [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built an internal combustion engine ignited by an electric spark. In 1823, [[Samuel Brown (engineer)|Samuel Brown]] patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially.

In 1854 in the UK, the Italian inventors [[Eugenio Barsanti]] and [[Felice Matteucci]] tried to patent "Obtaining motive power by the explosion of gases", although the application did not progress to the granted stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=185401072 |title=Obtaining motive power by the explosion of gases |invent1=Barsanti, Eugenio |invent2=Matteucci, Felice  |pridate=1854-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, [[Belgian]] [[Etienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]] produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, [[Nikolaus Otto]] patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American [[George Brayton]] invented the first commercial liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine. In 1876, [[Nikolaus Otto]], working with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]], patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, [[Karl Benz]] patented a reliable [[two-stroke]] gasoline engine. Later, in 1886, [[Karl Benz]] began the first commercial production of motor vehicles with the internal combustion engine. In 1892, [[Rudolf Diesel]] developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1926, [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the [[Heinkel He 178]] became the world's first [[jet aircraft]].

== Etymology ==
At one time, the word ''engine'' (via [[Old French]], from [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', "ability") meant any piece of [[machinery]] — a sense that persists in expressions such as ''[[siege engine]]''. A "motor" (from Latin ''motor'', "mover") is any machine that produces mechanical [[Power (physics)|power]]. Traditionally, [[electric motor]]s are not referred to as "engines"; however, combustion engines are often referred to as "motors". (An ''[[electric locomotive|electric engine]]'' refers to a [[locomotive]] operated by electricity.)

In boating an internal combustion engine that is installed in the hull is referred to as an engine, but the engines that sit on the transom are referred to as motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/engine.htm |title=World Wide Words: Engine and Motor |website=World Wide Words |date=1998-12-27 |access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:1970 AMX BBG-2part3.JPG|thumb|Reciprocating engine as found inside a car]]

Reciprocating piston engines are by far the most common power source for land and water [[vehicle]]s, including [[automobile]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[ship]]s and to a lesser extent, [[locomotive]]s (some are electrical but most use Diesel engines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technology Today and Tomorrow|last=James|first=Fales|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extreme Machines on Land|last=Armentrout|first=Patricia|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Rotary engines of the Wankel design are used in some automobiles, aircraft and motorcycles.

Where  high power-to-weight ratios are required, internal combustion engines appear in the form of [[combustion turbine]]s or Wankel engines. [[Powered aircraft]] typically uses an ICE which may be a reciprocating engine. Airplanes can instead use [[jet engine]]s and [[helicopter]]s can instead employ [[turboshaft]]s; both of which are types of turbines. In addition to providing propulsion, [[airliner]]s may employ a separate ICE as an [[auxiliary power unit]]. Wankel engines are fitted to many [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.

[[File:Montreal power backup.jpg|thumb|left|Big Diesel generator used for backup power]]

ICEs drive some of the large electric generators that power electrical grids. They are found in the form of [[combustion turbine]]s in [[combined cycle power plant]]s with a typical electrical output in the range of 100&amp;nbsp;MW to 1&amp;nbsp;GW. The high temperature exhaust is used to boil and superheat water to run a [[steam turbine]]. Thus, the efficiency is higher because more energy is extracted from the fuel than what could be extracted by the combustion turbine alone. In combined cycle power plants efficiencies in the range of 50% to 60% are typical. In a smaller scale [[Diesel generator]]s are used for backup power and for providing electrical power to areas not connected to an [[electric grid]].

[[Small engine]]s (usually 2‐stroke gasoline engines) are a common power source for [[lawnmower]]s, [[string trimmer]]s, [[chain saw]]s, [[leafblower]]s, [[pressure washer]]s, [[snowmobile]]s, [[jet ski]]s, [[outboard motor]]s, [[moped]]s, and [[motorcycle]]s.

=== Structure ===
[[File:Clevelandblock.jpg|thumb|Bare cylinder block of a V8 engine]]
[[File:Piston and connecting rod.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Piston, piston ring, gudgeon pin and connecting rod]]

The base of a reciprocating internal combustion engine is the [[engine block]], which is typically made of [[cast iron]] or [[aluminium]]. The engine block contains the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]]. In engines with more than one cylinder they are usually arranged either in 1 row ([[straight engine]]) or 2 rows ([[boxer engine]] or [[V engine]]); 3 rows are occasionally used ([[W engine]]) in contemporary engines, and other [[engine configuration]]s are possible and have been used. [[Single cylinder engine]]s are common for motorcycles and in small engines of machinery. Water-cooled engines contain passages in the engine block where cooling fluid circulates (the [[water jacket]]). Some small engines are air-cooled, and instead of having a water jacket the cylinder block has fins protruding away from it to cool by directly transferring heat to the air. The cylinder walls are usually finished by [[honing (metalworking)#Cross-hatch finish|honing to obtain a cross hatch]], which is better able to retain the oil. A too rough surface would quickly harm the engine by excessive wear on the piston.

The [[piston]]s are short cylindrical parts which seal one end of the cylinder from the high pressure of the compressed air and combustion products and slide continuously within it while the engine is in operation. The top wall of the piston is termed its ''crown'' and is typically flat or concave. Some two-stroke engines use pistons with a [[deflector piston|deflector head]]. Pistons are open at the bottom and hollow except for an integral reinforcement structure (the piston web). When an engine is working the gas pressure in the combustion chamber exerts a force on the piston crown which is transferred through its web to a [[gudgeon pin]]. Each piston has [[piston ring|rings]] fitted around its circumference that mostly prevent the gases from leaking into the crankcase or the oil into the combustion chamber. A [[crankcase ventilation system|ventilation system]] drives the small amount of gas that escape past the pistons during normal operation (the blow-by gases) out of the crankcase so that it does not accumulate contaminating the oil and creating corrosion. In two-stroke gasoline engines the crankcase is part of the air–fuel path and due to the continuous flow of it they do not need a separate crankcase ventilation system.

[[File:Diesel engine valve train.JPG|thumb|Valve train above a Diesel engine cylinder head. This engine uses rocker arms but no pushrods.]]

The [[cylinder head]] is attached to the engine block by numerous [[bolt (fastener)|bolts]] or [[stud (fastener)|studs]]. It has several functions. The cylinder head seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons; it contains short ducts (the ''ports'') for intake and exhaust and the associated intake [[poppet valves|valves]] that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape. However, 2-stroke crankcase scavenged engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves; the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead. The cylinder head also holds the [[spark plug]] in the case of spark ignition engines and the [[injector]] for engines that use direct injection. All CI engines use fuel injection, usually direct injection but some engines instead use [[indirect injection]]. SI engines can use a [[carburetor]] or fuel injection as port injection or [[gasoline direct injection|direct injection]]. Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but [[dual ignition|some have 2]]. A [[head gasket]] prevents the gas from leaking between the cylinder head and the engine block. The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several [[camshaft]]s and springs—or in some engines—a [[desmodromic valve|desmodromic mechanism]] that uses no springs. The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a [[rocker arm]], again, either directly or through a [[pushrod]].

[[File:18XER engine block.jpg|thumb|Engine block seen from below. The cylinders, oil spray nozzle and half of the main bearings are clearly visible.]]

The crankcase is sealed at the bottom with a [[sump]] that collects the falling oil during normal operation to be cycled again. The cavity created between the cylinder block and the sump houses a [[crankshaft]] that converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons to rotational motion. The crankshaft is held in place relative to the engine block by [[main bearing]]s, which allow it to rotate. Bulkheads in the crankcase form a half of every main bearing; the other half is a detachable cap. In some cases a single ''main bearing deck'' is used rather than several smaller caps. A [[connecting rod]] is connected to offset sections of the crankshaft (the [[crankpin]]s) in one end and to the piston in the other end through the gudgeon pin and thus transfers the force and translates the reciprocating motion of the pistons to the circular motion of the crankshaft. The end of the connecting rod attached to the gudgeon pin is called its small end, and the other end, where it is connected to the crankshaft, the big end. The big end has a detachable half to allow assembly around the crankshaft. It is kept together to the connecting rod by removable bolts.

The cylinder head has an [[intake manifold]] and an [[exhaust manifold]] attached to the corresponding ports. The intake manifold connects to the [[air filter]] directly, or to a [[carburetor]] when one is present, which is then connected to the [[air filter]]. It distributes the air incoming from these devices to the individual cylinders. The exhaust manifold is the first component in the [[exhaust system]]. It collects the exhaust gases from the cylinders and drives it to the following component in the path. The [[exhaust system]] of an ICE may also include a [[catalytic converter]] and [[muffler]]. The final section in the path of the exhaust gases is the [[tailpipe]].

=== 4-stroke engines ===
{{Main article|4-stroke engine}}
[[File:4StrokeEngine Ortho 3D Small.gif|thumb|Diagram showing the operation of a 4-stroke SI engine. Labels:&lt;br /&gt;'''1''' ‐ Induction&lt;br /&gt;'''2''' ‐ Compression&lt;br /&gt;'''3''' ‐ Power&lt;br /&gt;'''4''' ‐ Exhaust]]

The ''top dead center'' (TDC) of a piston is the position where it is nearest to the valves; ''bottom dead center'' (BDC) is the opposite position where it is furthest from them. A ''stroke'' is the movement of a piston from TDC to BDC or vice versa, together with the associated process. While an engine is in operation, the crankshaft rotates continuously at a nearly constant [[angular speed|speed]]. In a 4-stroke ICE, each piston experiences 2 strokes per crankshaft revolution in the following order. Starting the description at TDC, these are:{{sfn|Stone|1992|pp=1-2}}{{sfn|Nunney|2007|p=5}}

# '''Intake''', '''induction''' or '''suction''': The intake valves are open as a result of the cam lobe pressing down on the valve stem. The piston moves downward increasing the volume of the combustion chamber and allowing air to enter in the case of a CI engine or an air fuel mix in the case of SI engines that do not use [[gasoline direct injection|direct injection]]. The air or air-fuel mixture is called the ''charge'' in any case.
# '''Compression''': In this stroke, both valves are closed and the piston moves upward reducing the combustion chamber volume which reaches its minimum when the piston is at TDC. The piston performs [[work (physics)|work]] on the charge as it is being compressed; as a result its pressure, temperature and density increase; an approximation to this behavior is provided by the [[ideal gas law]]. Just before the piston reaches TDC, ignition begins. In the case of a SI engine, the spark plug receives a high voltage pulse that generates the spark which gives it its name and ignites the charge. In the case of a CI engine the fuel injector quickly injects fuel into the combustion chamber as a spray; the fuel ignites due to the high temperature.
# '''Power''' or '''working stroke''': The pressure of the combustion gases pushes the piston downward, generating more [[work (physics)|work]] than it required to compress the charge. Complementary to the compression stroke, the combustion gases expand and as a result their temperature, pressure and density decreases. When the piston is near to BDC the exhaust valve opens. The combustion gases expand [[irreversible process|irreversibly]] due to the leftover pressure—in excess of [[back pressure]], the gauge pressure on the exhaust port—; this is called the ''blowdown''.
# '''Exhaust''': The exhaust valve remains open while the piston moves upward expelling the combustion gases. For naturally aspirated engines a small part of the combustion gases may remain in the cylinder during normal operation because the piston does not close the combustion chamber completely; these gases dissolve in the next charge. At the end of this stroke, the exhaust valve closes, the intake valve opens, and the sequence repeats in the next cycle. The intake valve may open before the exhaust valve closes to allow better scavenging.

=== 2-stroke engines ===
{{Main article|2-stroke engine}}
The defining characteristic of this kind of engine is that each piston completes a cycle every crankshaft revolution. The 4 processes of intake, compression, power and exhaust take place in only 2 strokes so that it is not possible to dedicate a stroke exclusively for each of them. Starting at TDC the cycle consist of:
# '''Power''': While the piston is descending the combustion gases perform work on it, as in a 4-stroke engine. The same [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations about the expansion apply.
# '''Scavenging''': Around 75° of crankshaft rotation before BDC the exhaust valve or port opens, and blowdown occurs. Shortly thereafter the intake valve or transfer port opens.  The incoming charge displaces the remaining combustion gases to the exhaust system and a part of the charge may enter the exhaust system as well. The piston reaches BDC and reverses direction. After the piston has traveled a short distance upwards into the cylinder the exhaust valve or port closes; shortly the intake valve or transfer port closes as well.
# '''Compression''': With both intake and exhaust closed the piston continues moving upwards compressing the charge and performing a work on it. As in the case of a 4-stroke engine, ignition starts just before the piston reaches TDC and the same consideration on the thermodynamics of the compression on the charge.

While a 4-stroke engine uses the piston as a [[positive displacement pump]] to accomplish scavenging taking 2 of the 4 strokes, a 2-stroke engine uses the last part of the power stroke and the first part of the compression stroke for combined intake and exhaust. The work required to displace the charge and exhaust gases comes from either the crankcase or a separate blower. For scavenging, expulsion of burned gas and entry of fresh mix, two main approaches are described: Loop scavenging, and Uniflow scavenging, SAE news published in the 2010s that 'Loop Scavenging' is better under any circumstance than Uniflow Scavenging.&lt;ref name="first-hand.info_2_stroke_diesel"/&gt;

==== Crankcase scavenged ====
[[File:Two-Stroke Engine.gif|thumb|Diagram of a crankcase scavenged 2-stroke engine in operation]]

Some SI engines are crankcase scavenged and do not use poppet valves. Instead the crankcase and the part of the cylinder below the piston is used as a pump. The intake port is connected to the crankcase through a [[reed valve]] or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine. For each cylinder a transfer port connects in one end to the crankcase and in the other end to the cylinder wall. The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall. The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston. The reed valve opens when the crankcase pressure is slightly below intake pressure, to let it be filled with a new charge; this happens when the piston is moving upwards. When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in the crankcase increases and the reed valve closes promptly, then the charge in the crankcase is compressed. When the piston is moving upwards, it uncovers the exhaust port and the transfer port and the higher pressure of the charge in the crankcase makes it enter the cylinder through the transfer port, blowing the exhaust gases. Lubrication is accomplished by adding ''[[2-stroke oil]]'' to the fuel in small ratios. ''[[Petroil]]'' refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil. This kind of 2-stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4-strokes engines and release a more polluting [[exhaust gases]] for the following conditions:
* They use a ''[[total-loss oiling system|total-loss lubrication system]]'': all the lubricating oil is eventually burned along with the fuel.
* There are conflicting requirements for scavenging: On one side, enough fresh charge needs to be introduced in each cycle to displace almost all the combustion gases but introducing too much of it means that a part of it gets in the exhaust.
* They must use the transfer port(s) as a carefully designed and placed nozzle so that a gas current is created in a way that it sweeps the whole cylinder before reaching the exhaust port so as to expel the combustion gases, but minimize the amount of charge exhausted. 4-stroke engines have the benefit of forcibly expelling almost all of the combustion gases because during exhaust the combustion chamber is reduced to its minimum volume. In crankcase scavenged 2-stroke engines, exhaust and intake are performed mostly simultaneously and with the combustion chamber at its maximum volume.

The main advantage of 2-stroke engines of this type is mechanical simplicity and a higher [[power-to-weight ratio]] than their 4-stroke counterparts. Despite having twice as many power strokes per cycle, less than twice the power of a comparable 4-stroke engine is attainable in practice.

In the USA, 2-stroke engines were banned for road vehicles due to the pollution. Off-road only motorcycles are still often 2-stroke but are rarely road legal. However, many thousands of 2-stroke lawn maintenance engines are in use.{{citation need|date=July 2016}}

==== Blower scavenged ====
[[File:Diesel engine Uniflow.PNG|thumb|upright|Diagram of uniflow scavenging]]

Using a separate blower avoids many of the shortcomings of crankcase scavenging, at the expense of increased complexity which means a higher cost and an increase in maintenance requirement. An engine of this type uses ports or valves for intake and valves for exhaust, except [[opposed piston engine]]s, which may also use ports for exhaust. The blower is usually of the [[Roots blower|Roots-type]] but other types have been used too. This design is commonplace in CI engines, and has been occasionally used in SI engines.

CI engines that use a blower typically use ''[[uniflow scavenging]]''. In this design the cylinder wall contains several intake ports placed uniformly spaced along the circumference just above the position that the piston crown reaches when at BDC. An exhaust valve or several like that of 4-stroke engines is used. The final part of the intake manifold is an air sleeve which feeds the intake ports. The intake ports are placed at an horizontal angle to the cylinder wall (I.e: they are in plane of the piston crown) to give a swirl to the incoming charge to improve combustion. The largest reciprocating IC are low speed CI engines of this type; they are used for marine propulsion (see [[marine diesel engine]]) or [[electric power generation]] and achieve the highest thermal efficiencies among internal combustion engines of any kind. Some Diesel-electric [[locomotive engine]]s operate on the 2-stroke cycle. The most powerful of them have a brake power of around 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[watt|MW]] or 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower|HP]]. The [[EMD SD90MAC]] class of locomotives use a 2-stroke engine. The comparable class [[GE AC6000CW]] whose prime mover has almost the same brake power uses a 4-stroke engine.

An example of this type of engine is the [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C]] turbocharged 2-stroke Diesel, used in large container ships. It is the most efficient and powerful reciprocating internal combustion engine in the world with a [[thermal efficiency]] over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansys.com/assets/testimonials/siemens.pdf |title=CFX aids design of world’s most efficient steam turbine |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uL1CfKfv?url=http://www.ansys.com/assets/testimonials/siemens.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pepei.pennnet.com/display_article/152601/6/ARTCL/none/none/1/New-Benchmarks-for-Steam-Turbine-Efficiency/ |title=New Benchmarks for Steam Turbine Efficiency - Power Engineering |publisher=Pepei.pennnet.com |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf |first=Tatsuo |last=Takaishi |first2=Akira |last2=Numata |first3=Ryouji |last3=Nakano |first4=Katsuhiko |last4=Sakaguchi |title=Approach to High Efficiency Diesel and Gas Engines |journal=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Technical Review |volume=45 |issue=1 |date=March 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the most efficient small four-stroke engines are around 43% thermally-efficient (SAE 900648);{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} size is an advantage for efficiency due to the increase in the ratio of volume to surface area.

====Historical design====
[[Dugald Clerk]] developed the first two cycle engine in 1879. It used a separate cylinder which functioned as a pump in order to transfer the fuel mixture to the cylinder.&lt;ref name="first-hand.info_2_stroke_diesel"/&gt;

In 1899 [[Joseph Day (inventor)|John Day]] simplified Clerk's design into the type of 2 cycle engine that is very widely used today.&lt;ref name="first-hand.info_2_spark_ignition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.first-hand.info/TwoStrokeSparkIgnitionEngine.html |title=Two Stroke Spark Ignition (S.I) Engine |website=First Hand Info |access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Day cycle engines are crankcase scavenged and port timed. The crankcase and the part of the cylinder below the exhaust port is used as a pump. The operation of the Day cycle engine begins when the crankshaft is turned so that the piston moves from BDC upward (toward the head) creating a vacuum in the crankcase/cylinder area. The carburetor then feeds the fuel mixture into the crankcase through a [[reed valve]] or a rotary disk valve (driven by the engine). There are cast in ducts from the crankcase to the port in the cylinder to provide for intake and another from the exhaust port to the exhaust pipe.  The height of the port in relationship to the length of the cylinder is called the "port timing".

On the first upstroke of the engine there would be no fuel inducted into the cylinder as the crankcase was empty. On the downstroke, the piston now compresses the fuel mix, which has lubricated the piston in the cylinder and the bearings due to the fuel mix having oil added to it. As the piston moves downward is first uncovers the exhaust, but on the first stroke there is no burnt fuel to exhaust. As the piston moves downward further, it uncovers the intake port which has a duct that runs to the crankcase. Since the fuel mix in the crankcase is under pressure, the mix moves through the duct and into the cylinder.

Because there is no obstruction in the cylinder of the fuel to move directly out of the exhaust port prior to the piston rising far enough to close the port, early engines used a high domed piston to slow down the flow of fuel. Later the fuel was "resonated" back into the cylinder using an expansion chamber design. When the piston rose close to TDC, a spark ignites the fuel. As the piston is driven downward with power, it first uncovers the exhaust port where the burned fuel is expelled under high pressure and then the intake port where the process has been completed and will keep repeating.

Later engines used a type of porting devised by the Deutz company to improve performance. It was called the [[Schnuerle porting|Schnurle Reverse Flow]] system. DKW licensed this design for all their motorcycles. Their [[DKW RT 125]] was one of the first motor vehicles to achieve over 100&amp;nbsp;mpg as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audi.com/corporate/en/company/history/models/dkw-rt-1252h-1954.html |title=DKW RT 125/2H, 1954 &gt; Models &gt; History &gt; AUDI AG |publisher=Audi |access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ignition ===
Internal combustion engines require ignition of the mixture, either by [[Spark-ignition engine|spark ignition (SI)]] or [[diesel engine|compression ignition (CI)]]. Before the invention of reliable electrical methods, hot tube and flame methods were used. Experimental engines with [[laser ignition]] have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-04-laser-revolution-internal-combustion.html |title=Laser sparks revolution in internal combustion engines |work=Physorg.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spark ignition process ====
[[File:Bosch magneto (Army Service Corps Training, Mechanical Transport, 1911).jpg|thumb|Bosch Magneto]]{{Main|Spark-ignition engine}}[[File:Point Ignition.JPG|thumb|Points and Coil Ignition]]

The spark ignition engine was a refinement of the early engines which used Hot Tube ignition. When Bosch developed the [[ignition magneto|magneto]] it became the primary system for producing electricity to energize a spark plug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theoldmotor.com/?p=135204 |title=The Early History of the Bosch Magneto Company in America |website=The Old Motor |date=2014-12-19 |access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small engines still use magneto ignition. Small engines are started by hand cranking using a [[recoil start]]er or hand crank. Prior to [[Charles F. Kettering]] of Delco's development of the automotive starter all gasoline engined automobiles used a hand crank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Gender/Walsh/1911Auto_Comfort.htm |title=Hand Cranking the Engine |website=Automobile in American Life and Society |publisher=University of Michigan-Dearborn |access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger engines typically power their [[Starter (engine)|starting motors]] and [[ignition system]]s using the electrical energy stored in a [[lead–acid battery]].  The battery's charged state is maintained by an [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|automotive alternator]] or (previously) a generator which uses engine power to create electrical energy storage.

The battery supplies electrical power for starting when the engine has a [[Starter (engine)|starting motor]] system, and supplies electrical power when the engine is off. The battery also supplies electrical power during rare run conditions where the alternator cannot maintain more than 13.8 volts (for a common 12V automotive electrical system). As alternator voltage falls below 13.8 volts, the lead-acid storage battery increasingly picks up electrical load. During virtually all running conditions, including normal idle conditions, the alternator supplies primary electrical power.

Some systems disable alternator field (rotor) power during wide open throttle conditions. Disabling the field reduces alternator pulley mechanical loading to nearly zero, maximizing crankshaft power. In this case, the battery supplies all primary electrical power.

Gasoline engines take in a mixture of air and gasoline and compress it by the movement of the piston from bottom dead center to top dead center when the fuel is at maximum compression. The reduction in the size of the swept area of the cylinder and taking into account the volume of the combustion chamber is described by a ratio. Early engines had [[compression ratio]]s of 6 to 1. As compression ratios were increased, the efficiency of the engine increased as well.

With early induction and ignition systems the compression ratios had to be kept low. With advances in fuel technology and combustion management, high performance engines can run reliably at 12:1 ratio. With low octane fuel, a problem would occur as the compression ratio increased as the fuel was igniting due to the rise in temperature that resulted. [[Charles Kettering]] developed a [[Tetraethyllead|lead additive]] which allowed higher compression ratios, which was progressively [[Gasoline#Additives|abandoned for automotive use]] from the 1970s onward, partly due to [[lead poisoning]] concerns.

The fuel mixture is ignited at difference progressions of the piston in the cylinder. At low rpm, the spark is timed to occur close to the piston achieving top dead center. In order to produce more power, as rpm rises the spark is advanced sooner during piston movement. The spark occurs while the fuel is still being compressed progressively more as rpm rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innovatemotorsports.com/resources/myths.php |title=Spark Timing Myths Debunked - Spark Timing Myths Explained:: Application Notes |publisher=Innovate Motorsports |access-date=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necessary high voltage, typically 10,000 volts, is supplied by an [[induction coil]] or transformer. The induction coil is a fly-back system, using interruption of electrical primary system current through some type of synchronized interrupter. The interrupter can be either contact points or a power transistor. The problem with this type of ignition is that as RPM increases the availability of electrical energy decreases. This is especially a problem, since the amount of energy needed to ignite a more dense fuel mixture is higher. The result was often a high RPM misfire.

[[Capacitor discharge ignition]] was developed. It produces a rising voltage that is sent to the spark plug. CD system voltages can reach 60,000 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jetav8r.com/Vision/Ignition/CDI.html |title=Electronic Ignition Overview |website=Jetav8r |access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; CD ignitions use step-up [[transformer]]s. The step-up transformer uses energy stored in a capacitance to generate [[electric spark]]. With either system, a mechanical or electrical control system provides a carefully timed high-voltage to the proper cylinder. This spark, via the spark plug, ignites the air-fuel mixture in the engine's cylinders.

While gasoline internal combustion engines are much easier to start in cold weather than diesel engines, they can still have cold weather starting problems under extreme conditions. For years, the solution was to park the car in heated areas. In some parts of the world, the oil was actually drained and heated over night and returned to the engine for cold starts. In the early 1950s, the gasoline Gasifier unit was developed, where, on cold weather starts, raw gasoline was diverted to the unit where part of the fuel was burned causing the other part to become a hot vapor sent directly to the intake valve manifold.  This unit was quite popular until electric [[engine block heater]]s became standard on gasoline engines sold in cold climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA149 |title=Gasifier Aids Motor Starting Under Arctic Conditions |magazine=Popular Mechanics |date=January 1953 |page=149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compression ignition process ====
{{Main|Diesel engine}}
Diesel, [[Partially premixed combustion|PPC]] and [[Homogeneous charge compression ignition|HCCI]] engines, rely solely on heat and pressure created by the engine in its compression process for ignition. The compression level that occurs is usually twice or more than a gasoline engine. Diesel engines take in air only, and shortly before peak compression, spray a small quantity of diesel fuel into the cylinder via a fuel injector that allows the fuel to instantly ignite. HCCI type engines take in both air and fuel, but continue to rely on an unaided auto-combustion process, due to higher pressures and heat. This is also why diesel and HCCI engines are more susceptible to cold-starting issues, although they run just as well in cold weather once started. Light duty diesel engines with [[indirect injection]] in automobiles and light trucks employ [[glowplug]]s (or other pre-heating: see [[Cummins B Series engine|Cummins ISB#6BT]]) that pre-heat the [[combustion chamber]] just before starting to reduce no-start conditions in cold weather. Most diesels also have a battery and charging system; nevertheless, this system is secondary and is added by manufacturers as a luxury for the ease of starting, turning fuel on and off (which can also be done via a switch or mechanical apparatus), and for running auxiliary electrical components and accessories. Most new engines rely on electrical and electronic [[engine control unit]]s (ECU) that also adjust the combustion process to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.

=== Lubrication ===
[[File:Overhead cam engine with forced oil lubrication (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Diagram of an engine using pressurized lubrication]]
{{Commons category|Internal combustion piston engine lubrication systems}}

Surfaces in contact and relative motion to other surfaces require [[lubrication]] to reduce wear, noise and increase efficiency by reducing the power wasting in overcoming [[friction]], or to make the mechanism work at all. Also, the lubricant used can reduce excess heat and provide additional cooling to components. At the very least, an engine requires lubrication in the following parts:
* Between pistons and cylinders
* Small bearings
* Big end bearings
* Main bearings
* Valve gear (The following elements may not be present):
** Tappets
** Rocker arms
** Pushrods
** Timing chain or gears. Toothed belts do not require lubrication.

In 2-stroke crankcase scavenged engines, the interior of the crankcase, and therefore the crankshaft, connecting rod and bottom of the pistons are sprayed by the [[2-stroke oil]] in the air-fuel-oil mixture which is then burned along with the fuel. The valve train may be contained in a compartment flooded with lubricant so that no oil pump is required.

In a ''splash lubrication system'' no oil pump is used. Instead the crankshaft dips into the oil in the sump and due to its high speed, it splashes the crankshaft, connecting rods and bottom of the pistons. The connecting rod big end caps may have an attached scoop to enhance this effect. The valve train may also be sealed in a flooded compartment, or open to the crankshaft in a way that it receives splashed oil and allows it to drain back to the sump. Splash lubrication is common for small 4-stroke engines.

In a ''forced'' (also called ''pressurized'') ''lubrication system'', lubrication is accomplished in a closed loop which carries [[motor oil]] to the surfaces serviced by the system and then returns the oil to a reservoir. The auxiliary equipment of an engine is typically not serviced by this loop; for instance, an [[alternator (automotive)|alternator]] may use [[ball bearings]] sealed with their own lubricant. The reservoir for the oil is usually the sump, and when this is the case, it is called a ''[[wet sump]]'' system. When there is a different oil reservoir the crankcase still catches it, but it is continuously drained by a dedicated pump; this is called a ''[[dry sump]]'' system.

On its bottom, the sump contains an oil intake covered by a mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an [[oil filter]] outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one ''oil gallery'' (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver it to the big end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big end bearings. A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod big end has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there to the bottom of the piston and from then to the cylinder.

Other systems are also used to lubricate the cylinder and piston. The connecting rod may have a nozzle to throw an oil jet to the cylinder and bottom of the piston. That nozzle is in movement relative to the cylinder it lubricates, but always pointed towards it or the corresponding piston.

Typically a forced lubrication systems have a lubricant flow higher than what is required to lubricate satisfactorily, in order to assist with cooling. Specifically, the lubricant system helps to move heat from the hot engine parts to the cooling liquid (in water-cooled engines) or fins (in air-cooled engines) which then transfer it to the environment. The lubricant must be designed to be chemically stable and maintain suitable viscosities within the temperature range it encounters in the engine.

=== Cylinder configuration ===
Common cylinder configurations include the [[straight engine|straight or inline configuration]], the more compact [[V engine|V configuration]], and the wider but smoother [[flat engine|flat or boxer configuration]]. [[Aircraft engine]]s can also adopt a [[radial engine|radial configuration]], which allows more effective cooling. More unusual configurations such as the [[H engine|H]], [[U engine|U]], [[X engine|X]], and [[W engine|W]] have also been used.

Multiple cylinder engines have their valve train and crankshaft configured so that pistons are at different parts of their cycle. It is desirable to have the piston's cycles uniformly spaced (this is called ''even firing'') especially in forced induction engines; this reduces torque pulsations{{sfn|Nunney|2007|p=15}} and makes [[Straight engine|inline engines]] with more than 3 cylinders statically [[engine balance|balanced]] in its primary forces. However, some [[engine configuration]]s require odd firing to achieve better balance than what is possible with even firing. For instance, a 4-stroke [[Straight-twin engine|I2 engine]] has better balance when the angle between the crankpins is 180° because the pistons move in opposite directions and inertial forces partially cancel, but this gives an odd firing pattern where one cylinder fires 180° of crankshaft rotation after the other, then no cylinder fires for 540°. With an even firing pattern, the pistons would move in unison and the associated forces would add.

Multiple crankshaft configurations do not necessarily need a [[cylinder head]] at all because they can instead have a piston at each end of the cylinder called an [[opposed piston]] design. Because fuel inlets and outlets are positioned at opposed ends of the cylinder, one can achieve uniflow scavenging, which, as in the four-stroke engine is efficient over a wide range of engine speeds. Thermal efficiency is improved because of a lack of cylinder heads. This design was used in the [[Junkers Jumo 205]] diesel aircraft engine, using two crankshafts at either end of a single bank of cylinders, and most remarkably in the [[Napier Deltic]] diesel engines. These used three crankshafts to serve three banks of [[opposed-piston engine|double-ended cylinders]] arranged in an equilateral triangle with the crankshafts at the corners. It was also used in single-bank [[locomotive engine]]s, and is still used in [[marine propulsion]] engines and marine auxiliary generators.

=== Diesel cycle ===
{{Main article|Diesel cycle}}
[[File:DieselCycle PV.svg|thumb|[[P-v Diagram]] for the Ideal Diesel cycle. The cycle follows the numbers 1–4 in clockwise direction.]]

Most truck and automotive diesel engines use a cycle reminiscent of a four-stroke cycle, but with compression heating causing ignition, rather than needing a separate ignition system. This variation is called the diesel cycle. In the diesel cycle, [[diesel fuel]] is injected directly into the cylinder so that combustion occurs at constant pressure, as the piston moves.

=== Otto cycle ===
[[Otto cycle]] is the typical cycle for most of the cars internal combustion engines, that work using gasoline as a fuel. Otto cycle is exactly the same one that was described for the four-stroke engine. It consists of the same major steps: Intake, compression, ignition, expansion and exhaust.

=== Five-stroke engine ===
In 1879, [[Nikolaus Otto]] manufactured and sold a double expansion engine (the double and triple expansion principles had ample usage in steam engines), with two small cylinders at both sides of a low-pressure larger cylinder, where a second expansion of exhaust stroke gas took place; the owner returned it, alleging poor performance. In 1906, the concept was incorporated in a car built by EHV ([[Eisenhuth Horseless Vehicle Company]]) CT, USA;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Romance of Engines |first=Takashi |last=Suzuki |pages=87–94 |publisher=SAE |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 21st century [[Ilmor]] designed and successfully tested a 5-stroke double expansion internal combustion engine, with high power output and low SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilmor.co.uk/capabilities/5-stroke-engine |title=5-Stroke Concept Engine Design and Development |publisher=Ilmor Engineering |accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six-stroke engine ===
The [[six-stroke engine]] was invented in 1883. Four kinds of six-stroke use a regular piston in a regular cylinder (Griffin six-stroke, Bajulaz six-stroke, Velozeta six-stroke and Crower six-stroke), firing every three crankshaft revolutions. These systems capture the wasted heat of the [[four-stroke]] Otto cycle with an injection of air or water.

The [[Beare Head]] and "piston charger" engines operate as [[opposed-piston engine]]s, two pistons in a single cylinder, firing every two revolutions rather more like a regular four-stroke.

=== Other cycles ===
The very first internal combustion engines did not compress the mixture. The first part of the piston downstroke drew in a fuel-air mixture, then the inlet valve closed and, in the remainder of the down-stroke, the fuel-air mixture fired. The exhaust valve opened for the piston upstroke. These attempts at imitating the principle of a [[steam engine]] were very inefficient.
There are a number of variations of these cycles, most notably the [[Atkinson cycle|Atkinson]] and [[Miller cycle]]s. The diesel cycle is somewhat different.

[[Split cycle engine|Split-cycle]] engines separate the four strokes of intake, compression, combustion and exhaust into two separate but paired cylinders. The first cylinder is used for intake and compression. The compressed air is then transferred through a crossover passage from the compression cylinder into the second cylinder, where combustion and exhaust occur. A split-cycle engine is really an air compressor on one side with a combustion chamber on the other.

Previous split-cycle engines have had two major problems—poor breathing (volumetric efficiency) and low thermal efficiency. However, new designs are being introduced that seek to address these problems.

The [[Scuderi Engine]] addresses the breathing problem by reducing the clearance between the piston and the cylinder head through various turbo charging techniques. The Scuderi design requires the use of outwardly opening valves that enable the piston to move very close to the cylinder head without the interference of the valves. Scuderi addresses the low thermal efficiency via firing '''after top dead centre''' ('''ATDC''').

Firing ATDC can be accomplished by using high-pressure air in the transfer passage to create sonic flow and high turbulence in the power cylinder.

== Combustion turbines ==

=== Jet engine ===
{{Main article|Jet engine}}
[[File:Turbofan operation.png|thumb|Turbofan Jet Engine]]

Jet engines use a number of rows of fan blades to compress air which then enters a [[combustor]] where it is mixed with fuel (typically JP fuel) and then ignited. The burning of the fuel raises the temperature of the air which is then exhausted out of the engine creating thrust. A modern [[turbofan]] engine can operate at as high as 48% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation and the Global Atmosphere|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=97|website=Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six sections to a turbofan engine:
* Fan
* Compressor
* Combustor
* Turbine
* Mixer
* Nozzle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/engines.html |title=Engines |publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center |location=US |date=2014-06-12 |access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gas turbines ===
{{Main article|Gas turbine}}
[[File:Gas Turbine Power Plant.JPG|thumb|Turbine Power Plant]]

A gas turbine compresses air and uses it to turn a [[turbine]]. It is essentially a jet engine which directs its output to a shaft.  There are three stages to a turbine: 1) air is drawn through a compressor where the temperature rises due to compression, 2) fuel is added in the [[combuster]], and 3) hot air is exhausted through turbine blades which rotate a shaft connected to the compressor.

A gas turbine is a rotary machine similar in principle to a [[steam turbine]] and it consists of three main components: a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine. The air, after being compressed in the compressor, is heated by burning fuel in it. The heated air and the products of combustion expand in a turbine, producing work output. About {{frac|2|3}} of the work drives the compressor: the rest (about {{frac|1|3}}) is available as useful work output.&lt;ref name="GePowerGen"&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Gas Turbine Works|url=https://powergen.gepower.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-a-gas-turbine.html|website=General Electric Power Generation|publisher=General Electric|accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas Turbines are among the most efficient internal combustion engines. The General Electric 7HA and 9HA turbine [[combined cycle]] electrical plants are rated at over 61% efficiency.&lt;ref name="GasTurbineWorld"&gt;{{cite web|title=Air-cooled 7HA and 9HA designs  rated at over '''61%''' CC efficiency|url=http://www.gasturbineworld.com/ge-7ha.html|website=Gasturbineworld|accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brayton cycle ===
{{Main article|Brayton cycle}}
[[File:Brayton cycle.svg|thumb|300px|Brayton cycle]]

A gas turbine is a rotary machine somewhat similar in principle to a steam turbine. It consists of three main components: compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine. The air is compressed by the compressor where a temperature rise occurs. The compressed air is further heated by combustion of injected fuel in the combustion chamber which expands the air. This energy rotates the turbine which powers the compressor via a mechanical coupling. The hot gases are then exhausted to provide thrust.

Gas turbine cycle engines employ a continuous combustion system where compression, combustion, and expansion occur simultaneously at different places in the engine—giving continuous power. Notably, the combustion takes place at constant pressure, rather than with the Otto cycle, constant volume.

== Wankel engines ==
[[File:Wankel Cycle anim en.gif|thumb|upright|The Wankel rotary cycle. The shaft turns three times for each rotation of the rotor around the lobe and once for each [[orbital revolution]] around the eccentric shaft.]]
{{Main article|Wankel engine}}

The Wankel engine (rotary engine) does not have piston strokes. It operates with the same separation of phases as the four-stroke engine with the phases taking place in separate locations in the engine. In [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] terms it follows the [[Otto engine]] cycle, so may be thought of as a "four-phase" engine. While it is true that three power strokes typically occur per rotor revolution, due to the 3:1 revolution ratio of the rotor to the eccentric shaft, only one power stroke per shaft revolution actually occurs. The drive (eccentric) shaft rotates once during every power stroke instead of twice (crankshaft), as in the Otto cycle, giving it a greater power-to-weight ratio than piston engines. This type of engine was most notably used in the [[Mazda RX-8]], the earlier [[Mazda RX-7|RX-7]], and other vehicle models. The engine is also used in unmanned aerial vehicles, where the small size and weight and the high power-to-weight ratio are advantageous.

== Forced induction ==
{{main article|Forced induction}}
Forced induction is the process of delivering compressed air to the intake of an internal combustion engine. A forced induction engine uses a [[gas compressor]] to increase the pressure, temperature and [[density of air|density of the air]]. An engine without forced induction is considered a [[naturally aspirated engine]].

Forced induction is used in the automotive and aviation industry to increase engine power and efficiency. It particularly helps aviation engines, as they need to operate at high altitude.

Forced induction is achieved by a [[supercharger]], where the compressor is directly powered from the engine shaft or, in the [[turbocharger]], from a turbine powered by the engine exhaust.

== Fuels and oxidizers ==
All '''internal combustion engines''' depend on [[combustion]] of a [[Fuel#Chemical|chemical fuel]], typically with oxygen from the air (though it is possible to inject [[nitrous oxide]] to do more of the same thing and gain a power boost). The combustion process typically results in the production of a great quantity of heat, as well as the production of steam and carbon dioxide and other chemicals at very high temperature; the temperature reached is determined by the chemical make up of the fuel and oxidisers (see [[stoichiometry]]), as well as by the compression and other factors.

=== Fuels ===
The most common modern fuels are made up of [[hydrocarbon]]s and are derived mostly from [[fossil fuel]]s ([[petroleum]]). Fossil fuels include [[diesel fuel]], [[gasoline]] and [[liquefied petroleum gas|petroleum gas]], and the rarer use of [[propane]]. Except for the fuel delivery components, most internal combustion engines that are designed for gasoline use can run on [[natural gas]] or liquefied petroleum gases without major modifications. Large diesels can run with air mixed with gases  and a pilot diesel fuel ignition injection. Liquid and gaseous [[biofuel]]s, such as [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] (a form of diesel fuel that is produced from crops that yield [[triglyceride]]s such as [[soybean]] oil), can also be used. Engines with appropriate modifications can also run on [[hydrogen]] gas, [[wood gas]], or [[wood gas|charcoal gas]], as well as from so-called [[wood gas|producer gas]] made from other convenient biomass. Experiments have also been conducted using powdered solid fuels, such as the [[magnesium injection cycle]].

Presently, fuels used include:
* [[Petroleum]]:
** Petroleum spirit ([[North American English|North American]] term: [[gasoline]], [[British English|British]] term: petrol)
** [[Diesel fuel|Petroleum diesel]].
** [[Autogas]] ([[liquified petroleum gas]]).
** [[Compressed natural gas]].
** [[Jet fuel]] ([[aviation fuel]])
** [[Residual fuel]]
* [[Coal]]:
** Gasoline can be made from carbon (coal) using  the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]
** Diesel fuel can be made from carbon using  the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]
* Biofuels and vegetable oils:
** [[Peanut oil]] and other [[vegetable oil fuel|vegetable oils]].
** [[Woodgas]], from an onboard [[wood gasifier]] using solid wood as a fuel
** Biofuels:
*** [[Biobutanol]] (replaces gasoline).
*** [[Biodiesel]] (replaces petrodiesel).
*** [[Dimethyl Ether]] (replaces petrodiesel).
*** [[Bioethanol]] and [[Biomethanol]] ([[wood alcohol]]) and other [[biofuel]]s  (see [[Flexible-fuel vehicle]]).
*** [[Biogas]]
* [[Hydrogen]] (mainly [[spacecraft]] [[rocket engine]]s)

Even fluidized metal powders and explosives have seen some use. Engines that use gases for fuel are called gas engines and those that use liquid hydrocarbons are called oil engines; however, gasoline engines are also often colloquially referred to as, "gas engines" ("[[petrol engine]]s" outside North America).

The main limitations on fuels are that it must be easily transportable through the [[fuel injection|fuel system]] to the [[combustion chamber]], and that the fuel releases sufficient [[energy]] in the form of [[heat]] upon [[combustion]] to make practical use of the engine.

[[Diesel engine]]s are generally heavier, noisier, and more powerful at lower speeds than [[gasoline engine]]s. They are also more fuel-efficient in most circumstances and are used in heavy road vehicles, some automobiles (increasingly so for their increased [[fuel efficiency]] over gasoline engines), ships, [[railway]] [[locomotive]]s, and light [[aircraft]]. Gasoline engines are used in most other road vehicles including most cars, [[motorcycle]]s, and [[moped]]s. Note that in [[Europe]], sophisticated diesel-engined cars have taken over about 45% of the market since the 1990s. There are also engines that run on [[hydrogen car|hydrogen]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[biodiesel]], [[wood|paraffin]] and [[tractor vaporizing oil]] (TVO).

==== Hydrogen ====
{{Main article|Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle}}

Hydrogen could eventually [[Hydrogen economy|replace conventional fossil fuels]] in traditional internal combustion engines. Alternatively [[fuel cell]] technology may come to deliver its promise and the use of the internal combustion engines could even be phased out.

Although there are multiple ways of producing free hydrogen, those methods require converting combustible molecules into hydrogen or consuming electric energy. Unless that electricity is produced from a renewable source—and is not required for other purposes— hydrogen does not solve any [[energy crisis]]. In many situations the disadvantage of hydrogen, relative to carbon fuels, is [[Hydrogen economy#Storage|its storage]]. [[Liquid hydrogen]] has extremely low density (14 times lower than water) and requires extensive insulation—whilst gaseous hydrogen requires heavy tankage. Even when liquefied, hydrogen has a higher specific energy but the volumetric energetic storage is still roughly five times lower than gasoline. However, the energy density of hydrogen is considerably higher than that of electric batteries, making it a serious contender as an energy carrier to replace fossil fuels. The 'Hydrogen on Demand' process (see [[direct borohydride fuel cell]]) creates hydrogen as needed, but has other issues, such as the high price of the [[sodium borohydride]] that is the raw material.

=== Oxidizers ===
[[File:Moore-single-cylinder-gasoline-engine.jpg|thumb|upright|One-cylinder gasoline engine, {{circa|lk=no|1910}}]]

Since air is plentiful at the surface of the earth, the oxidizer is typically atmospheric oxygen, which has the advantage of not being stored within the vehicle. This increases the power-to-weight and power-to-volume ratios. Other materials are used for special purposes, often to increase power output or to allow operation under water or in space.
* Compressed air has been commonly used in [[torpedo]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://maritime.org/doc/whitehead3/pg06.htm |title=The Whitehead Torpedo, notes on handling etc. |publisher=Bureau of Ordnance |location=US |year=1890 |access-date=2017-05-15 |via=San Francisco Maritime National Park Association |quote=After assembling, the air-flask shall be charged to 450 lbs. pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compressed [[oxygen]], as well as some compressed air, was used in the Japanese [[Type 93 torpedo]]. Some submarines carry pure oxygen. Rockets very often use [[liquid oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/news/2003/news-goddard.asp |title=Re-Creating History |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201210444/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/news/2003/news-goddard.asp |archivedate=2007-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nitromethane]] is added to some racing and [[Model engine|model]] fuels to increase power and control combustion.
* [[Nitrous oxide]] has been used—with extra gasoline—in tactical aircraft, and in specially equipped cars to allow short bursts of added power from engines that otherwise run on gasoline and air. It is also used in the Burt Rutan rocket spacecraft.
* [[Hydrogen peroxide]] power was under development for German World War II submarines. It may have been used in some non-nuclear submarines, and was used on some rocket engines (notably the [[Black Arrow]] and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] rocket fighter).
* Other chemicals such as chlorine or fluorine have been used experimentally, but have not been found practical.

== Cooling ==
{{main article|Internal combustion engine cooling}}
Cooling is required to remove excessive heat — over heating can cause engine failure, usually from wear (due to heat-induced failure of lubrication), cracking or warping. Two most common forms of engine cooling are [[air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] and [[Water-cooled#Automotive usage|water-cooled]]. Most modern automotive engines are both water and air-cooled, as the water/liquid-coolant is carried to air-cooled fins and/or fans, whereas larger engines may be singularly water-cooled as they are stationary and have a constant supply of water through water-mains or fresh-water, while most power tool engines and other small engines are air-cooled. Some engines (air or water-cooled) also have an [[oil cooling|oil cooler]]. In some engines, especially for [[Turbine blade#Cooling|turbine engine blade cooling]] and [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|liquid rocket engine cooling]], fuel is used as a coolant, as it is simultaneously preheated before injecting it into a combustion chamber.

== Starting ==
{{main article|Starter motor}}
[[File:Automobile starter.JPG|thumb|Electric starter as used in automobiles]]

Internal combustion engines must have their cycles started. In reciprocating engines this is accomplished by turning the crankshaft (Wankel Rotor Shaft) which induces the cycles of intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust.  The first engines were started with a turn of their flywheels, while the first vehicle (the Daimler Reitwagen) was started with a hand crank.  All ICE engined automobiles were started with hand cranks until [[Charles Kettering]] developed the electric starter for automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Feb/0215_cad_starter.html |title=Cadillac’s Electric Self Starter Turns 100 |publisher=General Motors |location=US |access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is now the most widely used, even among non-automobiles.

As diesel engines have become larger and their mechanisms heavier, [[Air-start system|air starters]] have come into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingersollrandproducts.com/am-en/products/air-starters |title=Ingersoll Rand Engine Starting - Turbine, Vane and Gas Air Starters |publisher=Ingersoll Rand |access-date=2016-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913233007/http://www.ingersollrandproducts.com/am-en/products/air-starters# |archive-date=2016-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the lack of torque in electric starters. Air starters work by pumping compressed air into the cylinders of an engine to start it turning.

Two-wheeled vehicles may have their engines started in one of four ways:

* By pedaling, as on a bicycle

* By pushing the vehicle and then engaging the clutch, known as "run-and-bump starting"
* By kicking downward on a single pedal, known as "kick starting"
* By an electric starter, as in cars

There are also starters where a spring is compressed by a crank motion and then used to start an engine.

Some small engines use a pull-rope mechanism called "recoil starting," as the rope rewinds itself after it has been pulled out to start the engine. This method is commonly used in  pushed lawn mowers and other settings where only a small amount of torque is needed to turn an engine over.

Turbine engines are frequently started by an electric motor or by compressed air.

== Measures of engine performance ==
Engine types vary greatly in a number of different ways:
* [[Fuel efficiency|energy efficiency]]
* fuel/propellant consumption ([[brake specific fuel consumption]] for shaft engines, [[thrust specific fuel consumption]] for jet engines)
* [[power-to-weight ratio]]
* [[thrust to weight ratio]]
* [[Torque#Machine torque|Torque curves]] (for shaft engines) [[thrust lapse]] (jet engines)
* [[Compression ratio]] for piston engines, [[overall pressure ratio]] for jet engines and gas turbines

=== Energy efficiency ===
Once ignited and burnt, the [[combustion]] products—hot gases—have more available [[thermal energy]] than the original compressed fuel-air mixture (which had higher [[chemical energy]]). The available energy is manifested as high [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] that can be translated into [[Mechanical work|work]] by the engine. In a reciprocating engine, the high-pressure gases inside the cylinders drive the engine's pistons.

Once the available energy has been removed, the remaining hot gases are [[exhaust gas|vented]] (often by opening a [[poppet valve|valve]] or exposing the exhaust outlet) and this allows the piston to return to its previous position (top dead center, or TDC). The piston can then proceed to the next phase of its cycle, which varies between engines. Any [[heat]] that is not translated into work is normally considered a waste product and is removed from the engine either by an air or liquid cooling system.

Internal combustion engines are [[heat engine]]s, and as such their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized [[thermodynamic cycle]]s. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the [[Carnot cycle]], whose efficiency is determined by the difference between the lower and upper [[operating temperature]]s of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All [[metal]]s and [[alloy]]s have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into [[ceramic]] materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the cylinder temperature rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the cylinder temperature nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto-ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance ([[octane rating]]), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak cylinder temperature.

The [[thermodynamic limit]]s assume that the engine is operating under ideal conditions: a frictionless world, ideal gases, perfect insulators, and operation for infinite time. Real world applications introduce complexities that reduce efficiency. For example, a real engine runs best at a specific load, termed its [[power band]]. The engine in a car cruising on a highway is usually operating significantly below its ideal load, because it is designed for the higher loads required for rapid acceleration.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In addition, factors such as [[wind resistance]] reduce overall system efficiency.  Engine [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is measured in [[miles per gallon]] or in liters per 100 kilometres. The volume of hydrocarbon assumes a standard energy content.

Most iron engines have a [[thermodynamic limit]] of 37%. Even when aided with turbochargers and stock efficiency aids, most engines retain an ''average'' efficiency of about 18%-20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/me341/oct22v2.htm |title=Improving IC Engine Efficiency |publisher=Courses.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest technologies in [[Formula One engines]] have seen a boost in thermal efficiency to almost 47%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/turbulent-times-for-formula-1-engines-result-in-unprecedented-efficiency-gains/|title=Turbulent times for Formula 1 engines result in unprecedented efficiency gains|website=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocket engine efficiencies are much better, up to 70%, because they operate at very high temperatures and pressures and can have very high expansion ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Rocket propulsion elements 7th edition-George Sutton, Oscar Biblarz pg 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many inventions aimed at increasing the efficiency of IC engines. In general, practical engines are always compromised by trade-offs between different properties such as efficiency, weight, power, heat, response, exhaust emissions, or noise. Sometimes economy also plays a role in not only the cost of manufacturing the engine itself, but also manufacturing and distributing the fuel. Increasing the engine's efficiency brings better fuel economy but only if the fuel cost per energy content is the same.

=== Measures of fuel efficiency and propellant efficiency ===
For stationary and shaft engines including propeller engines, fuel consumption is measured by calculating the [[brake specific fuel consumption]], which measures the mass flow rate of fuel consumption divided by the power produced.

For internal combustion engines in the form of jet engines, the power output varies drastically with airspeed and a less variable measure is used: [[thrust specific fuel consumption]] (TSFC), which is the mass of propellant needed to generate [[Impulse (physics)|impulses]] that is measured in either pound force-hour or the grams of propellant needed to generate an impulse that measures one kilonewton-second.

For rockets, TSFC can be used, but typically other equivalent measures are traditionally used, such as [[specific impulse]] and [[effective exhaust velocity]].

== Air and noise pollution ==

=== Air pollution ===
Internal combustion engines such as reciprocating internal combustion engines produce [[air pollution]] emissions, due to incomplete combustion of [[carbon]]aceous fuel. The main derivatives of the process are [[carbon dioxide]] {{chem|CO|2}}, water and some [[soot]] — also called [[atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (PM). The effects of inhaling particulate matter have been studied in humans and animals and include asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular issues, and premature death. There are, however, some additional products of the combustion process that include [[nitrogen oxide]]s and [[sulfur]] and some uncombusted hydrocarbons, depending on the operating conditions and the fuel-air ratio.

Not all of the fuel is completely consumed by the combustion process. A small amount of fuel is present after combustion, and some of it reacts to form oxygenates, such as [[formaldehyde]] or [[acetaldehyde]], or hydrocarbons not originally present in the input fuel mixture. Incomplete combustion usually results from insufficient [[oxygen]] to achieve the perfect [[stoichiometric]] ratio. The flame is "quenched" by the relatively cool cylinder walls, leaving behind unreacted fuel that is expelled with the exhaust. When running at lower speeds, quenching is commonly observed in diesel (compression ignition) engines that run on natural gas. Quenching reduces efficiency and increases knocking, sometimes causing the engine to stall. Incomplete combustion also leads to the production of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). Further chemicals released are [[benzene]] and [[1,3-butadiene]] that are also [[hazardous air pollutant]]s.

Increasing the amount of air in the engine reduces emissions of incomplete combustion products, but also promotes reaction between oxygen and [[nitrogen]] in the air to produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s ({{NOx}}). {{NOx}} is hazardous to both plant and animal health, and leads to the production of [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Ozone is not emitted directly; rather, it is a secondary air pollutant, produced in the atmosphere by the reaction of {{NOx}} and [[volatile organic compound]]s in the presence of sunlight. Ground-level ozone is harmful to human health and the environment. Though the same chemical substance, ground-level ozone should not be confused with [[stratospheric ozone]], or the [[ozone layer]], which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays.

Carbon fuels contain sulfur and impurities that eventually produce [[sulfur monoxide]]s (SO) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the exhaust, which promotes [[acid rain]].

In the United States, nitrogen oxides, PM, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone, are regulated as [[criteria air pollutant]]s under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] to levels where human health and welfare are protected. Other pollutants, such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene, are regulated as [[hazardous air pollutant]]s whose emissions must be lowered as much as possible depending on technological and practical considerations.

{{NOx}}, carbon monoxide and other pollutants are frequently controlled via [[exhaust gas recirculation]] which returns some of the exhaust back into the engine intake, and [[catalytic converter]]s, which convert exhaust chemicals to harmless chemicals.

==== Non-road engines ====
{{Main article|Non-road engine#Emission standards}}
The emission standards used by many countries have special requirements for [[non-road engine]]s which are used by equipment and vehicles that are not operated on the public roadways. The standards are separated from the road vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Global Sourcing Guide|url=http://www.gsgnet.net/gsgpdfs/EmissionsStandards.pdf|publisher=Diesel &amp; Gas Turbine Publications|accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noise pollution ===
Significant contributions to [[noise pollution]] are made by internal combustion engines. Automobile and truck traffic operating on highways and street systems produce noise, as do aircraft flights due to jet noise, particularly supersonic-capable aircraft. Rocket engines create the most intense noise.

=== Idling ===
{{main article|Idle reduction}}
Internal combustion engines continue to consume fuel and emit pollutants when idling so it is desirable to keep periods of idling to a minimum. Many bus companies now instruct drivers to switch off the engine when the bus is waiting at a terminal.

In England, the Road Traffic [[Vehicle Emissions]] Fixed Penalty Regulations 2002 ([[List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 2002|Statutory Instrument 2002]] No. 1808) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://195.99.1.70/si/si2002/20021808.htm#13 |title=The Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) (England) Regulations 2002 |publisher=195.99.1.70 |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2010-08-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of a "''stationary idling offence''". This means that a driver can be ordered "''by an authorised person ... upon production of evidence of his authorisation, require him to stop the running of the engine of that vehicle''" and a "''person who fails to comply ... shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale''". Only a few local authorities have implemented the regulations, one of them being [[Oxford]] City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxford.gov.uk/Direct/2_Item%205.6.pdf |title=CITY DEVELOPMENT  - Fees &amp; Charges 2010-11 |publisher=[[Oxford City Council]] |date=November 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322224814/http://www.oxford.gov.uk/Direct/2_Item%205.6.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for Food Protection''' (IAFP), founded in 1911, is a [[non-profit]] association of [[food safety]] professionals based in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. The organization claims a membership of over 3,000 members from 50 nations. The mission of the IAFP is to provide food safety professionals worldwide with a forum to exchange information on [[food security|protecting]] the [[food supply]].

The Association provides its members with an information network on scientific, technical, and practical developments in food safety and [[sanitation]] through its two [[scientific journal]]s, ''[[Food Protection Trends]]'' and ''[[Journal of Food Protection]]'', its educational Annual Meeting, and interaction with other food safety professionals.

Before 2000, it was known as the '''International Association of Dairy and Milk Inspectors''' (1911-1936), '''International Association of Milk Sanitarians''' (1936-1947), and '''International Association of Milk and Food Sanitarians, Inc'''. The name was changed in 1966 to the '''International Association of Milk, Food and Environmental Sanitarians'''. In 1999, it received the current name.

==History==
In the early 20th century, an increasing number of cities and states in the US passed policies to ensure safety of milk. The laws were a response to the food industry's deception at that time. There were types of alteration in milk products on the market, such as water-dilution or adding butter or cheaper substitutes. In addition, spoiled milk is danger to health: infant mortality rate was lower in cities that had monitored milk production and sale. The Association was established in 1911 based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there were 35 members. One of the members was from Canada, and one from Australia; the rest were from the US. According to the Association's constitution, an object is to develop “uniform and efficient inspection of dairy farms, milk establishments, milk and milk products” by “men who have a thorough knowledge of dairy work.” The object reflects the historical context when the Association was born.

In 1923, the Association deemed pasteurization as necessary for processing milk products, and endorsed pasteurization as the only adequate safeguard for milk supplies. US Public Health Service's annual report on milk-borne outbreaks has been decreased from 40-60 per year in the 1920s to about 20 per year after World War II.

In the 1960s, the Association had expanded its vision on food protection from milk safety. As the President of the Association pointed out in 1960: “Today, we sanitarians must be equipped to deal with problems extending throughout the entire range of environmental health. We must solve problems of waste disposal, insect and rodent control, air pollution, housing, radiological poisoning and many others. Additionally, with more Americans eating out more often than ever before, the food service industry has become an area of responsibility such as would have been impossible for our founding Members to imagine. Recently the packaging of prepared foods of the ‘heat and eat’ variety has developed as a rapidly expanding industry that poses new sanitation problems for you to solve.” The name of the association was changed after a mail ballot in members at large in response to the expanded scope of the Association, the International Association of Milk, Food and Environmental Sanitarians (IAMFES).

==Annual Meeting==
The IAFP annual meeting is held in late July or early August each year, and boasts an attendance of over 2,200 people from U.S. and foreign local and federal governments, academia, food safety consultants and the food industry.  Recent and future meeting locations are as follows:

*2011—Milwaukee, WI
*2012—Providence, RI
*2013—Charlotte, NC

[[File:Krzywik.jpg|thumb|right|A [[flexible curve]]: the modern counterpart of a lesbian rule]]
A '''lesbian rule''' was historically a flexible [[masonry|mason]]'s [[Ruler|rule]] made of [[lead]] that could be bent to the curves of a [[Molding (decorative)|molding]], and used to measure or reproduce irregular curves.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{OED|lesbian, adj. and n. }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loughlin |first=Gerard |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tR6D1nhzwAC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=lesbian+rule+lead+curve&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YJknkqGxSs&amp;sig=gJyuDl8ld5Ou6Adg7JubGIjrxrk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MakzT5mHGc-xrAfv4syaDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lesbian%20rule%20lead%20curve&amp;f=false |title=Queer Theology: Rethinking the Western Body |publisher=Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Magee |first1=Maggie |last2=Miller |first2=Diana C. |title=Lesbian Lives: Psyschoanalytic Narratives Old and New |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=1997 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesbian rules were originally constructed of a pliable kind of lead found on the island of [[Lesbos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian |title=The Online Etymological Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule is alluded to by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (bk V, ch. 10) as a metaphor for the importance of flexibility in [[Equity (law)|equitable justice]]: "For what is itself indefinite can only be measured by an indefinite standard, like the leaden rule used by [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] builders; just as that rule is not rigid but can be bent to the shape of the stone, so a special ordinance is made to fit the circumstances of the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aristotle |title=Nicomachean Ethics, Book 5 Chapter 10 |editor-first=H.

In the [[early modern period]] the term was often used figuratively (as Aristotle had used it) to mean a pliant, flexible and accommodating principle of judgment.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; In his famous letter to the Louvain theologian [[:nl:Martinus Dorpius|Martin Dorp]], [[Thomas More]] referenced it when reproving Dorp for his attack on [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]' ''[[In Praise of Folly]]'': "You praise Adriaan for being unbiased, yet you seem to suggest he is no more unbiased than a Lesbian rule, a rule made out of lead which, as Aristotle reminds us, is not always unbiased, since it bends to fit uneven shapes."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas More to Martin Dorp, in {{cite book |title=The Complete Works of Sir Thomas More |volume=15 |editor-first=Daniel |editor-last=Kinney |place=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-300-03161-4 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Daniel]] in 1603 described equity as "that Lesbian square, that building fit, Plies to the worke, not forc'th the worke to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Samuel |last=Daniel |chapter=To Sir Tho: Egerton Knight |title=A Panegyrike Congratulatorie delivered to the Kings Most Excellent Maiestie at Burleigh Harrington in Rutlandshire&amp;nbsp;...

He accused [[Inigo Jones]], who had interpreted [[Stonehenge]] as a [[Roman monument]], of having "made a Lesbians rule, which is conformed to the stone: that is, he framed the Monument to his own Hypothesis, which is much differing from the Thing it self".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Angus |last=Vine |title=In Defiance of Time: antiquarian writing in early modern England |year=2010 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-956619-8 |page=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberty Reserve''' was a [[Costa Rica]]-based centralized [[digital currency]] service that billed itself as the "oldest, safest and most popular payment processor, serving millions all around a world".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberty Reserve digital money service forced offline|date=May 27, 2013|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22680297|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had over one million users when it was shut down by the United States government. Prosecutors argued that due to lax security, alleged criminal activity largely went undetected, which ultimately led to them seizing the service.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

In May 2013, Liberty Reserve was shut down by United States federal prosecutors under the [[Patriot Act]] after an investigation by authorities across 17 countries. The United States charged founder Arthur Budovsky and six others with [[money laundering]] and operating an unlicensed financial transaction company. Liberty Reserve is alleged to have been used to launder more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds during its history.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

==Background==
Based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] [[Costa Rica]], Liberty Reserve was a centralized [[digital currency]] service that allowed users to register and transfer money to other users with only a name, e-mail address, and birth date.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; No efforts were made by the site to verify identities of its users, making it an attractive payment processor to scam artists.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; Deposits could be made through third parties using a credit card or bankwire, among other deposit options.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; Liberty Reserve did not directly process deposits or withdrawals.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; Deposited funds were then "converted" into Liberty Reserve Dollars or Liberty Reserve Euros, which were tied to the value of the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] and the [[euro]], respectively, or to ounces of gold.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tico /&gt; No limits were placed on transaction sizes.&lt;ref name=DMW /&gt; The service made money by charging a small fee, about 1%, on each transfer.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Transactions were "100% irrevocable".&lt;ref name=DMW&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberty Reserve - Interview with Mr. Joul Lee pt.1|work=Digital Money World|date=July 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Reserve also offered shopping cart functionality and other merchant services.&lt;ref name=DMW /&gt;

Service was popular among currency brokers and [[multilevel marketing]] companies.&lt;ref name=Tico /&gt; According to Forex Magnates, a specialized [[forex]] news service, Liberty Reserve was "the leading payment channel for traders in emerging and frontier markets."&lt;ref name=Tico /&gt; Richard Weber, head of the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] criminal investigation unit, declared, "If [[Al Capone]] were alive today, this is how he would be hiding his money".&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Currency Exchange Accused of Laundering $6 Billion|author=Marc Santora|author2=William K.

Liberty employees were required to sign a confidentiality agreement to "maintain in strict confidentiality all information" about the company, including "administrative affairs, operations and financial details" for 15 years after leaving the company.&lt;ref name=Tico2 /&gt; Additionally they were required to notify management if issued a warrant to reveal such information.&lt;ref name=Tico /&gt;

==History==
From 2002 to 2006, United States businessmen Arthur Budovsky and Vladimir Kats ran a digital currency exchange service known as [[Gold Age]].&lt;ref name=Tico /&gt; In July 2006, the duo were indicted{{by whom|date=June 2013}} on charges of operating an illegal financial business, a [[felony]]. They were sentenced to five years in prison in 2007, but the sentence was reduced to five years of probation.&lt;ref name=Tico /&gt; Budovsky fled the country, settling in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=GlobalPost&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberty Reserve digital money service shut down, founder arrested|author=Jill Langlois|date=May 27, 2013|work=GlobalPost|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/business/technology/130527/liberty-reserve-digital-money-service-shut-down-founder-arrested|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a naturalized citizen of Costa Rica when he married a Costa Rican woman in 2010, and renounced his American citizenship in 2012.&lt;ref name=Nacion&gt;{{cite news|title=España captura a costarricense por lavado de dinero a pedido de Estados Unidos|trans-title=Spain captures Costa Rican money launderer upon U.S. request|author=Carlos Arguedas C.|date=May 25, 2013|work=La Nacion|url=http://www.nacion.com/2013-05-25/Sucesos/espana-captura-a-costarricense-por-lavado-de-dinero-a-pedido-de-estados-unidos.aspx|language=Spanish|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marriage /&gt;

===Criminal investigation and charges===
Costa Rican authorities became aware of Liberty Reserve in 2009 and informed the business it needed a license to operate as a money transmitting business.&lt;ref name=Tico2&gt;{{cite news|title=Costa Rican President Chinchilla denies link to Liberty Reserve attorney|date=May 31, 2013|work=Tico Times|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/More-news/News-Briefs/Costa-Rican-President-Chinchilla-denies-link-to-Liberty-Reserve-attorney-_Friday-May-31-2013|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Liberty Reserve was denied a business license in Costa Rica, according to state prosecutor José Pablo González, due to lack of transparency about how the business was funded. The business formally disbanded at that time, but company founder Arthur Budovsky continued to operate the business by funneling it through five other Costa Rican businesses, according to authorities.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; A criminal investigation was launched March 7, 2011 following "suspicious" bank activity.&lt;ref name=Tico2 /&gt; Later in 2011, the United States authorities asked Costa Rica to begin investigating Budovsky's business dealings.&lt;ref name=Tico&gt;{{cite news|title=Millions of dollars in limbo after shuttering of digital currency site Liberty Reserve|author=David Boddiger|author2=L.

The indictment, unsealed on May 28, charges the seven principal employees, as well as Liberty Reserve itself, with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and seeks $25 million in damages.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; The charges were leveled using a provision of the [[Patriot Act]], since Liberty Reserve was not an American company.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; The accused could face up to 30 years in prison.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

[[Preet Bharara]], a United States prosecutor working on the case called Liberty Reserve a "black market bank", created and structured to "facilitate criminal activity".&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|title='Black Market Bank' Accused of Laundering $6B in Criminal Proceeds|author=Jack Cloherty|date=May 28, 2013|work=[[ABC News]]|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/black-market-bank-accused-laundering-6b-criminal-proceeds/story?id=19275887|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Liberty Reserve "processed an estimated 55 million separate financial transactions and is believed to have laundered more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds". It has been linked to crimes including [[credit card fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[Securities fraud|investment fraud]], [[Hacker|computer hacking]], [[child pornography]] and [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics trafficking]].&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

Liberty Reserve itself was accused by U.S. prosecutors of moving tens of millions of dollars through shell accounts.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; Forty-five bank accounts were seized or restricted by United States federal prosecutors under the Patriot Act as a result of the investigation.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, stated the case "may be the largest international money laundering case ever brought by the United States."&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; "The global enforcement action we announce today is an important step towards reining in the 'Wild West' of illicit Internet banking," Bharara said; "As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth."&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

One specific allegation of the prosecutors is that the site played a role in [[money laundering|laundering]] the $45 million stolen from the [[BankMuscat|Bank of Muscat]] and the [[RAKBANK|National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah]] in May 2013.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name="45 million"&gt;The sum of $45 million was reported stolen from the [[BankMuscat]] and the [[RAKBANK|National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah]] earlier in the month - {{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100727531|title=Germany Arrests Two for $45 Million Cyber Bank Heist|date=2013-05-10|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
According to Internet security analyst [[Brian Krebs]], the closure of Liberty Reserve had the potential to "cause a major upheaval in the cybercrime economy".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; The closure of the site led to many individuals using the service for legitimate reasons losing access to their money.&lt;ref name="BBC-1"/&gt; The head of EPay Tarjeta, a service which used Liberty Reserve, remarked "We seem to be acceptable collateral damage&amp;nbsp;... we have committed no crime."&lt;ref name="BBC-1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22686777 | title=US prosecutes '$6bn money-laundering hub' | publisher=BBC | accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States attorney [[Preet Bharara]] stated users of Liberty Reserve could contact his office to inquire about getting their funds returned.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

On May 29, Budovsky's wife came forward with an accusation that she had been paid $800 to marry him in 2010 so that he could become a Costa Rican citizen. According to her, the plan was to divorce two years later, although the couple were still married at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite news|title=Costa Rica probes Liberty Reserve founder marriage|agency=Associated Press|date=May 30, 2013|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/30/budovsky-liberty-reserve/2371445/|accessdate=Feb 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Xbox 360]]''' video game console has appeared in various '''retail configurations''' during its life-cycle. At its launch, the Xbox 360 was available in two retail configurations: the morning  "Xbox 360" package (unofficially known as the 20&amp;nbsp;GB Pro or Premium), priced at [[United States dollar|US$]]399.99 or [[Pound sterling|£]]279.99, and the "Xbox 360 Core," priced at US$299.99 and £209.99. The original shipment of Xbox 360s included a cut-down version of the Media Remote as a promotion. The Elite package was launched later at a retail price of US$479.99. The "Xbox 360 Core" was replaced by the "Xbox 360 Arcade" in October 2007&lt;ref name=ArcadeConsolePR&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-22ArcadeConsolePR.mspx|title=  Microsoft Launches New Xbox 360 Console for Families|accessdate= 2008-07-26|date= 2007-10-22|publisher= Microsoft Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 60&amp;nbsp;GB version of the Xbox 360 Pro was released on August 1, 2008. The Pro package was discontinued and marked down to US$249.99 on August 28, 2009 to be sold until stock ran out, while the Elite was also marked down in price to US$299.99.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2009/08/microsoft-drops-price-of-120gb-xbox-360-system-/1 |title=Microsoft drops price of 120 GB Xbox 360 system&amp;nbsp;— Game Hunters: In search of video games and interactive awesomeness |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Microsoft announced a new, redesigned, model and the discontinuation of the Elite and Arcade models.&lt;ref name="360 Arcade replacement" /&gt;

It was speculated that a complete redesign of the Xbox 360 hardware was being produced after pictures of a possible new motherboard design surfaced on March 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox 360 Slim in the Works?|url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/xbox-360-slim-in-the-works/|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323100913/http://www.industrygamers.com/news/xbox-360-slim-in-the-works/|archivedate=March 23, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ads later surfaced on June 13, 2010 showing a slimmer Xbox 360 design, which was expected to include a 250&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive and integrated Wi-Fi functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5562412/so-whats-inside-the-new-xbox-360 |title=So What's Inside The New Xbox 360? |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=2010-06-13 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The console's casing is revised in comparison to the previous models, with a glossy black finish and capacitive power and eject buttons.&lt;ref name="insidenewxbox"/&gt; The internal hardware was redesigned using a new motherboard codenamed "Valhalla", which integrates the CPU, GPU, and eDRAM into a single package using a 45&amp;nbsp;nm fabrication process. As the CPU and GPU are integrated into the same die, they may also share the same [[heatsink]] and fan, which reduces the console's noise output, and its power consumption by roughly half in comparison to the original Xenon motherboard.&lt;ref name="insidenewxbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/3774/welcome-to-valhalla-inside-the-new-250gb-xbox-360-slim|title=Inside the New Xbox 360 |author=Anand Lal Shimpi|authorlink=anandtech|date=2010-06-18|work=[[AnandTech]]|doi=|accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insidenewxbox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="engadgetnewxbox"/&gt; The S has two additional rear USB ports, as well as a proprietary port used to connect the [[Kinect]] sensor.&lt;ref name="engadgetnewxbox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="insidenewxbox"/&gt;

Unlike previous generations of the console which had names to distinguish different [[Stock-keeping unit|SKUs]], the new models' retail units were branded by their internal storage capacity&lt;ref name="360 Arcade replacement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265465/new-200-xbox-360-planned-elite-and-arcade-getting-50-price-cut |title=New $200 Xbox 360 planned, Elite &amp; Arcade getting $50 price cut |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |date=14 June 2010 |work=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2010-06-17 |quote=Moore said that Microsoft is currently working on a second new Xbox 360, which will be offered at the arcade's price point of $200.

In June 2011, Microsoft announced a "Jon Jones Edition" Xbox 360 S console to coincide with the launch of [[Gears of War 3]], which featuring custom finish,&lt;ref name="Gears3Console"/&gt; a 320&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive&lt;ref name="Gears3Console"/&gt; and sounds from the Gears of War 3 game which are played when the console is switched on or the disc tray is opened.

Other 320&amp;nbsp;GB Xbox 360 S limited editions soon followed. Like the 250&amp;nbsp;GB "[[#Xbox 360 Super Elite|Super Elite]]" consoles, 320&amp;nbsp;GB Xbox 360 S consoles were only available as part of limited/special edition console bundles ({{as of|2011|09|df=US|lc=y}}), with stand-alone 320&amp;nbsp;GB hard drives also being available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-11-ms-announces-320gb-xbox-360-hard-drive|title=MS announces 320GB Xbox 360 hard-drive News&amp;nbsp;— Xbox 360 - Page 1 {{!}} Eurogamer.net|date={{Date|2011-10-11|mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-10-11|mdy}}|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|work=eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Microsoft's E3 press conference on June 10, 2013, another hardware revision of the Xbox 360 known as '''E''' was unveiled for immediate availability. It is a revision of the S model with a new [[Xbox One]]-inspired casing, carrying a more rectangular appearance and a two-tone color scheme. It has one fewer USB port and no S/PDIF, YPbPr component or S-video connections.. Its internal hardware is otherwise similar to the S model.&lt;ref name=geekcom-xboxe&gt;{{cite web|title=Redesigned Xbox 360 E teardown reveals it’s a cost saver for Microsoft|url=http://www.geek.com/games/redesigned-xbox-360-e-teardown-reveals-its-a-cost-saver-for-microsoft-1558846/|work=Geek.com|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SKUs and pricing for the new model are identical to those of the previous model.&lt;ref name=xbwire-2013model&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the New Xbox 360: With Spectacular New Titles and Free Games for Xbox Gold Members|url=http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/x360-xbox-360-e3-2013-reveal|work=Xbox Wire|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=polygon-2013-360&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft announced updated Xbox 360 console, available today|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/10/4414972/microsoft-unleashes-updated-xbox-360-console-available-today|work=Polygon|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xbox 360 Core===
The '''Xbox 360 Core''' was an entry level Xbox 360 which was later replaced with the "Arcade". Although available at launch in other regions, it was not available in Japan until November 2, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/07/microsoft-to-launch-xbox-360-core-in-japan/ |title=Microsoft to launch Xbox 360 Core in Japan |accessdate=2008-07-26 |last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |date=2006-09-07 |publisher=Weblogs, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Core system came bundled with a [[composite video]] cable, capable of only [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolutions. The console was however capable of the same [[High-definition television|HDTV]] resolutions (up to [[1080i]]) as the other models when connected to a separately sold [[YPbPr|component]]/[[d-terminal]] cable. In October 2006, 1080p support was added for all models in a system update,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/community/news/systemupdate.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731071201/http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/community/news/systemupdate.htm|archivedate=2008-07-31 |title=Latest update adds 1080p native support, Live Arcade upgrades and much, much more! |accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the "Core" using either the component/d-terminal cable, or the new VGA cable (although 1080p via component was not widely supported by televisions). It may also utilize a separately sold Xbox 360 hard drive. Unlike all other SKUs, it shipped with a wired version of the Xbox 360 controller, instead of the wireless version found in other SKUs.

===Xbox 360 [Pro/Premium]===
The '''Xbox 360'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Announces Xbox 360 Price for Europe and North America|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2005/aug05/08-17EuropeNA360PricePR.aspx|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (sometimes referred to as '''Pro''' or '''Premium''' and packaged as simply '''Xbox 360''' with the subheading "Go Pro") included all the features of the Xbox 360 Core and included a hybrid [[composite video|composite]]/[[component video|component]] cable with optional [[TOSLINK|optical out]] instead of the composite AV cable included with the Core. This model also included a detachable hard disk drive (initially 20&amp;nbsp;GB, while later models had 60&amp;nbsp;GB) to store downloaded content, provide compatibility with [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] games, and store game data. The included hard drive came with game demos, video clips and a free Live Arcade game, ''[[Hexic]] HD''. In July 2007, this version of the Xbox 360 began appearing with the Zephyr motherboard (the motherboard used in the Elite) which features HDMI 1.2 output and an improved GPU heatsink. Although this model did include an HDMI output,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/08/hdmi-premium-xbox-360-potentially-caught-on-film/ |title=HDMI Premium Xbox 360 caught on camera |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/08/microsoft-officially-adds-hdmi-to-xbox-360-premium/ |title=Microsoft officially adds HDMI to Xbox 360 Premium |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not come with an HDMI cable.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Starting at the end of September 2007, the newest systems were shipped with the new "Falcon" motherboard.

[[File:Xbox-360-Elite-Console-Set.png|thumb|upright|Xbox 360 Elite console with black wireless controller|alt=Xbox 360 Elite console with black wireless controller.]]
The '''Xbox 360 Elite''' included a 120 GB hard drive and a [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] black finish.

These Elites (and other Xbox 360 models using the Falcon) can be identified from earlier versions by a re-designed [[AC power plugs and sockets|power connector]] and a power supply rated to 175 W.  In 2009, Elite models using the Jasper chipset became available. These can also be identified by their power supply, which is rated at 150W and has a 12.1A 12v rail.

==Special editions==
[[File:Xbox 360 Halo 3 Special Edition.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Halo 3]]'' special edition]]
On a few occasions, Microsoft has produced [[special edition]]s of the console, usually to coincide with the release of a major product. These special editions are typically custom-colored Xbox 360 models, and are produced in limited numbers.

*At the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2007 [[News conference|press conference]], Microsoft announced the ''[[Halo 3]]'' Special Edition console, released September 25, 2007. It sports a ''Halo 3'' theme on the console, a wired headset, a wireless controller, and a Play and Charge Kit. Other than the unique "Spartan green-and-gold" [[color scheme]], exclusive dashboard theme and downloads, and an HDMI port,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32007/articles/halo3console.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070713224019/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32007/articles/halo3console.htm|archivedate= 2007-07-13|title=Halo 3 Console Announced|accessdate= 2008-07-26|date= 2007-07-10|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; its features were unusual in that it had the HDMI port present only on the elite, but the 20 GB hard drive of the premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360halo3console/default.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725042904/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360halo3console/default.htm|archivedate=2008-07-25|title=Halo 3 Special Edition Console| publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is priced at US$399.99 and £279.99 (the original price of the Xbox 360).&lt;ref name="consoleprice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0806-consoleprice.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820211136/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0806-consoleprice.htm |archivedate=2007-08-20 |title=Microsoft Lowers Xbox 360 Price |publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To promote ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', Microsoft created a specially designed, yellow Xbox 360 console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/simpsonsmovie/winxbox360.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619023538/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/simpsonsmovie/winxbox360.htm|archivedate= 2008-06-19|title=Win A Limited Edition Xbox 360|publisher=Microsoft| accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The configuration was based on the Xbox 360 package of the time, the only difference being the color scheme of the Xbox 360 console and wireless controller. The consoles were to be given out to winners of drawings taking place between July 18, 2007 and July 27, 2007, in which a name was randomly drawn each day in the "10 Days and 10 Chances to Win" sweepstakes.&lt;ref name="simpsonssweepstakes"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thesimpsons.com/sweepstakes/movie/index.htm|title= Limited Edition Simpsons Movie Xbox 360 Sweepstakes|accessdate= 2008-01-15|publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 consoles were produced in total.&lt;ref name="microsoftsimpsons360"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-10-2007/0004585255&amp;EDATE=|title= Xbox 360 Has Movie Fans Seeing Stars|accessdate= 2009-07-22|publisher=PR Newswire Association LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xbox 360 Launch Team Edition==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:specialeditionlaunchteamconsolexbox360.jpg|thumb|upright|The Launch Team console with controller]]
A white console with green accents was released in 2005 only to the Launch Team as a gift from [[Microsoft]]. The consoles came complete with a 20&amp;nbsp;GB HDD also in green to match the top and bottom sections that are typically grey in color. The HDD plate was also personalized and engraved with the team member's [[gamertag]]. Few examples have been seen with simply the console release date November 22, 2005 engraved on the HDD plate. The consoles came with a limited issue controller to accompany the console. The difference with the controller again is the grey part on the controller is replaced with a green molded plastic, not painted contrary to popular belief, to match the console. Each console came with a plain white faceplate. However, as an additional gift, each team member was given an additional packaged faceplate with one of a kind art with the caption "I Made This" on the USB door of the faceplate. Very few examples have been sold off from original team member's collection. [[Larry Hryb]], better known as "Major Nelson", is known to own one which he displays pictures of on his website having been a member of the Launch Team. The special edition Launch Team console, hard drive, controller and the special faceplate were never sold in stores or meant for the general public. It is unknown yet how many of these very rare consoles exist today.

==Holiday bundles==
As with the original Xbox, Microsoft has continued bundling two video game titles in console retail packaging during the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37136">The following is a list of the top independent pharmaceutical &amp; biotechnology companies ranked by their revenue generated ($10 billion) in the respective financial year, it does not include biotechnology companies that are now owned by, or part of, larger pharmaceutical groups.

The change is the companies relative position in this list, compared to their relative position in the prior year; i.e., an increase would be moving closer to rank 1 and vice versa. Green cells indicate years where revenue increased compared to the previous year, red cells indicate those years where there has been a decrease.

[[File:Moon pool diagrams.PNG|right]]

A '''moon pool''' is a feature of [[oil platforms|marine drilling platforms]], [[drillship]]s and [[diving support vessel]]s, some [[oceanography|marine research]] and [[underwater]] [[exploration]] or research [[watercraft|vessels]], and [[underwater habitats]], in which it is also known as a '''wet porch'''. It is an opening in the floor or base of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], platform, or chamber giving access to the water below, allowing [[technician]]s or [[researcher]]s to lower [[tool]]s and [[measuring instruments|instruments]] into the sea. It provides shelter and protection so that even if the [[ship]] is in high seas or surrounded by ice, researchers can work in comfort rather than on a deck exposed to the elements. A moon pool also allows divers or small [[submersible craft]] to enter or leave the water easily and in a more protected environment.

Moon pools can be used in chambers below sea level, especially for the use of [[scuba diver]]s, and their design requires more complex consideration of air and water [[pressure]] acting on the moon pool surface.

==First use in oil drilling at sea==
Moon pools originated in the [[oil industry|oil drilling industry]], which uses them in drilling at sea or in lakes, to pass drilling equipment into the water from a platform or drillship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=moon%20pool Oilfield Glossary: "Moon Pool'.] Schlumberger website, retrieved 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Drill pipes need to run vertically through the structure or hull and the moon pool provides the means to do this.

==In underwater habitats==
[[File:NEEMO 13 Crew.jpg|thumb|[[NEEMO]] 13 Crew in the wet porch/moon pool of the Aquarius habitat]]
Very deep moon pools are used in [[underwater habitat]]s—submerged chambers used by divers engaged in underwater research, [[exploration]], [[marine salvage]], and [[recreational diving|recreation]]. In this case, shown in part D of the diagram, there is no dry access between the chamber and the sea surface, and the moon pool is the only entry or exit to the chamber. Submerged chambers provide dry areas for work and rest without the need to ascend to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0309/feature4/fulltext.html Gregory Stone: "Deep Science".] National Geographic Online Extra (Sept 2003). Retrieved 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of submerged chamber uses the same principles as the [[diving bell]], except they are fixed to the seafloor, and may be called a '''wet porch''', '''wet room''', or '''wet bell'''. Sometimes the term moon pool is used to mean the complete chamber, not just the opening in the bottom and the air–water interface.

The alternative to a moon pool in an underwater habitat is the [[lock-out chamber]], which is essentially like a fixed [[submarine]], maintaining internal air pressures lower than ambient sea pressure down to [[atmosphere (unit)|1 atmosphere]], with an [[airlock]] to enable entry and exit underwater. Underwater habitats may have connected chambers with moon pools and lock-out chambers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27027">'''Nanofluidic circuitry''' is a [[nanotechnology]] aiming for control of [[fluid]]s in [[nanometer]] scale. Due to the effect of an [[electrical double layer]] within the fluid channel, the behavior of [[Nanofluidics|nanofluid]] is observed to be significantly different compared with its [[Microfluidics|microfluid]]ic counterparts. Its typical characteristic dimensions fall within the range of 1–100&amp;nbsp;nm. At least one dimension of the structure is in [[nanoscopic scale]]. Phenomena of fluids in nano-scale structure are discovered to be of different properties in [[electrochemistry]] and [[fluid dynamics]].

==Background==
With the development of microfabrication and nanotechnology, the study of microfluidics and nanofluidics is drawing more attention.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Research on microfluidic found its advantages in DNA analysis, lab-on-a-chip, and micro-TAS. Devices in a microfluidic system include channels, valves, mixers, and pumps. Integration of these microfluidic devices enables sorting, transporting, and mixing of substances within fluids. However, the failure of moving parts in these systems is usually the critical issue and the main drawback. Mechanisms to control flow without using mechanical parts are always desired for reliability and lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tandon | first1 = V. | last2 = Bhagavatula | first2 = S.

In 1997, Wei and [[Allen J. Bard|Bard]] discovered that ion rectification occurs at the tip of a nano-sized pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1021/ac970551g | author=Wei, C. | author2=Bard, A. J. | author3=Feldberg, S. W. | title=Current Rectification at Quartz Nanopipet Electrodes | journal = Anal. Chem. | date = 1997 | volume = 69 | issue =  22| pages=4627–4633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They observed that the surface charge at the wall of a nano-pipet induced a non-neutral electrical potential within the orifice. The electrical potential then modifies the concentration of ion species, resulting in an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic for the current through the pipet.

Transport of ions in the electrolyte can be adjusted by tuning the pH value in a dilute ionic solution, or by introducing an external electrical potential to change the surface charge density of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuo | first1 = T.

In nanofluidics, the active control of ion transport is realized using nano-scale channels or pores.

Research efforts on micro-scaled fluidic systems started to focus on the rectifying phenomena, which can be seen only in nano-scaled systems. In 2006, Professor Majumdar and Professor Yang in University of California, Berkeley built the first "nanofluidic" transistor. The transistor can be turn on or off by an external electrical signal, allowing the control of ionic fluids in a nano-scaled channel. Their work implies a possibility to create a nanofluidic circuitry with logic functions.

The main researchers in the area of nanofluidic devices include Arun Majumdar and Peidong Yang in University of California - Berkeley, Harold Craighead and Brian Kirbyat Cornell University, Juan Santiago at Stanford University, Albert van den Berg in University of Twente, Zuzanna Siwy in University of California - Irvine, and Mark Shannon in University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign.

==Basic principles==
For electrolyte solution in a channel with a macro- or micro-scaled radius, surface charges at the wall attract counterions and repel co-ions due to electrostatic force. Therefore, an electrical double layer exists between the wall of channel and the solution. The dimension of the electrical double layer is determined by the Debye length in this system, which is typically much smaller than the channel radius. Most of the solution in the channel is electrically neutral due to the shielding effect of the electrical double layer.

In a nanochannel, however, the solution is charged when the dimension of channel radius is smaller than the [[Debye length]]. Therefore, it is possible to manipulate the flow of ions inside the nanochannel by introducing surface charges on the wall or by applying an external electrical potential.

Ionic concentration of solution has an important effect on the ion transport. Because a higher concentration leads to a shorter Debye length for the electrical double layer at the channel wall. Its rectifying effect decreases with increasing ionic concentration. On the other hand, ion rectification can be improved by having a dilute solution.

===Ion transport===
To analyze the transport of ions in the channel, behaviors of system in electrochemistry as well as fluid mechanics need to be considered. The Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) equations are utilized to describe ionic current flowing through a channel, and the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations are used to represent the fluid dynamics in the channel.

The PNP equations consist of the [[Poisson equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Daiguji, H.; Oka, Y.; Shirono, K.; "Nanofluidic Diode and Bipolar Transistor." ''Nano Letters'', 2005, 5 (11), pp. 2274–2280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daiguji, H.; Yang, P.; Majumdar, A.; "Ion Transport in Nanofluidic Channels." ''Nano Letters'', 2004, 4 (1), pp. 137–142&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\phi=-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon}\displaystyle\sum_{a}z_{a}en_{a}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Nernst–Planck equation]]s, which gives the particle flux of ion species &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; due to a concentration gradient and electric potential gradient:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_{a}=-D_{a}(\nabla n_{a}+\frac{z_{a}en_{a}}{kT}\nabla\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the electrostatic potential, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the unit charge of electron, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the permittivity in vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the dielectric constant of solution; &lt;math&gt;D_{a}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_{a}&lt;/math&gt; are the diffusivity, the number density of ions, and the valence of ion species &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution in steady-state satisfies the continuity equation. To describe fluid velocity field in the channel, using [[Navier–Stokes equations]]:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (n_{a}\boldsymbol{u}+\boldsymbol{J}_{a})=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}=0&lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u}=\frac{1}{\rho}[-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}-(\displaystyle\sum_{a}z_{a}en_{a})\nabla\phi]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are pressure, velocity vector, viscosity, and density of fluid, respectively. The equations above are usually solved with numerical algorithm to determine the velocity, pressure, electric potential, and ionic concentration in the fluid, as well as the electric current flow through the channel.

===Ionic selectivity===
Ionic selectivity is defined to evaluate the performance of a nano-channel for ionic flow control.&lt;ref&gt;Vlassiouk, I.; Smirnov, S.; Siwy, Z.; "Ionic Selectivity of Single Nanochannels." ''Nano Letters'', 2008, 8 (7), pp. 1978-85&lt;/ref&gt; Ionic selectivity is the ratio of the difference in currents of majority and minority carriers to the total current carried by both positive and negative ions, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. For a nanochannel with perfect control over cation and anion, the selectivity is unity. For a nanochannel without ionic flow control, the selectivity is zero.

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{I^+ - I^-}{I^+ + I^-}&lt;/math&gt;

==Nanofluidic logic devices==
*Transport is proportional to applied bias (resistor)
*Transport can be made to move in one direction (diode)
*Control of gain is possible by introduction of third pole (transistor)
*Control of the forward/reverse direction by asymmetric gates (Field-effect reconfigurable diode)

===Diodes===
Nanofluidic diodes are utilized for rectification of ionic transport.&lt;ref&gt;Karnik, R.; Duan, C.; Castelino, K.; Daiguji, H.; Majumdar, A.; "Rectification of Ionic Current in a Nanofluidic Diode." ''Nano Letters'', 2007, 7 (3), pp. 547–551&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, F.; "Nanofluidic diodes: One-way feat." ''Nature Nanotechnology'' (2 March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vlassiouk, I.; Siwy, Z. S.; "Nanofluidic Diode." ''Nano Letters'', 2007, 7 (3), pp. 552–556&lt;/ref&gt; A diode in electronic circuits limits the flow of electric current to one direction. A nanofluidic diode has the same function to restrict the ionic flow in one direction. A nanofluidic diode is a channel with its radius dimension of several nanometers. The inner surface of the channel is coated with surface charges. Current rectification can occur when the surface charges at the wall are of the same sign. It is also observed that, when a half of the channel is coated with opposite sign or electrically neutral, the rectification will be enhanced.

When the wall of the channel is coated with positive charges, the negative charged ions in the electrolyte will be attracted and accumulated within the channel. In this case, the flow of positive charges passing through the channel is not favorable, resulting in a decrease in ionic current. Therefore, the ionic current becomes asymmetric if the biasing voltage is reversed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Field-effect transistors===
By applying an additional electrode on a nanochannel as the gate electrode, it is possible to adjust the electrical potential inside the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karnik | first1 = R. | last2 = Castelino | first2 = K. | last3 = Majumdar | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Field-effect control of protein transport in a nanoﬂuidic transistor circuit | url = | journal = Appl.

The gate bias and the source-drain bias are applied to adjust the cation and anion concentration within the nanochannel, therefore tuning the ionic current flowing through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pardon | first1 = G | last2 = van der Wijngaart | first2 = W | date = Nov 2013 | title = Modeling and simulation of electrostatically gated nanochannels | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124238| journal = Advances in Colloid and Interface Science | volume = 199–200| issue = | pages = 78–94 | doi = 10.1016/j.cis.2013.06.006 | pmid=23915526| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept is an analogy to the structure of a metal-oxide semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) in electronic circuits. Similar to a MOSFET, a nanofluidic transistor is the fundamental element for building a nanofluidic circuitry. There is possibility to achieve a nanofluidic circuitry, which is capable of logic operation and manipulation for ionic particles.

Since the conductance of ionic current flow is controlled by the gate voltage, using a material with high dielectric constant as the wall of the channel is desired. In this case, there is a stronger field seen within the channel due to a higher gate capacitance. A channel surface with a low surface charge is also desired in order to strengthen the effect of potential tuning by gate electrode. This increases the ability to spatially and temporally tune the ionic and electrostatic environment in the channel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Field-effect reconfigurable diode===
By introducing an asymmetric field effect along the nanochannel, a field-effect reconfigurable nanofluidic diode is feasible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guan | first1 = W. | last2 = Fan | first2 = R. | last3 = Reed | first3 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Field-effect reconfigurable nanofluidic ionic diodes | url = | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 506 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1514 |bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.506G | pmid=22009038}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features post-fabrication reconfiguration of the diode functions, such as the forward/reverse directions and the rectification degrees. Unlike the nanofluidic field-effect transistor, where only the amount of ions/molecules is regulated by an electrostatic potential, the field-effect reconfigurable diode can be used to control both directions and magnitudes of ion/molecule transport. This device could be deemed as the building blocks for ionic counterpart of the electronic field-programmable gate array.

===Ionic bipolar transistors===
Ionic bipolar transistors can be made from two conical channels with the smallest opening in nano-scaled dimension. By introducing opposite surface charges at each side, it is able to rectify ionic current as an ionic diode. An ionic bipolar transistor is built by combining two ionic diodes and forming a PNP junction along the inner surface of the channel. While the ionic current is from emitter end to collector end, the strength of the current can be modulated by the base electrode. The surface charge at the channel wall can be modified using chemical methods, by changing the electrolyte concentration or pH value.

===Ionic triodes===
Nanofuidic triode is a three-terminal double junction nanofluidic device composed of positive-charged alumina and negative-charged silica nanochannels.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, L.-J.; Guo, L. J.; "Ionic current rectification, breakdown, and switching in heterogeneous oxide nanofluidic devices." ''ACS Nano'', 2009, 3 (3), pp. 575–584&lt;/ref&gt; The device is essentially a three-terminal bipolar junction transistor. By controlling the voltage across emitter and collector terminals, one can regulate the ion current from base terminal to one of the other two terminals, functioning as an ionic single-pole, double-throw switch.

==Size effect of nanostructures==

===Width of nanochannels===
When surface charges present at the wall of a channel of micro-scaled width, counterions are attracted and co-ions are repelled by electrostatic force. The counterions form a shielding area near the wall. This region penetrate into solution to a certain distance called Debye length until the electric potential decays to the bulk value of neutrality. The Debye length is ranging typically from 1&amp;nbsp;nm to 100&amp;nbsp;nm for aqueous solutions.

In nano-channels, the Debye length is usually comparable with the channel width, therefore solution within the channel is charged. Ions inside the fluid is no longer shielded from surface charge. Instead, surface charge affect the dynamics of ions within a nano-channel.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Microchannel.jpg|Microfluidic channel, electrically neutral inside the channel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karnik | first1 = R. | last2 = Fan | first2 = R. | last3 = Yue | first3 = M. | last4 = Li | first4 = D. | last5 = Yang | first5 = P. | last6 = Majumdar | first6 = A. | title = Electrostatic Control of Ions and Molecules in Nanofluidic Transistors | url = | journal = Nano Letters | volume = 5 | issue = 5| year = 2005 | doi=10.1021/nl050493b | pages=943–948|bibcode = 2005NanoL...5..943K | pmid=15884899}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Image:Nanochannel.jpg|Nanofluidic channel, electrically charged inside the channel
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Length of nanochannels===
It requires a channel to be narrow and long for it to have a good selectivity. In other words, a channel with a high aspect ratio has a better selectivity. To further increase its selectivity, it is required to have a highly charged wall.&lt;ref&gt;Vlassiouk, I.; Smirnov, S.; Siwy, Z.; "Ionic Selectivity of Single Nanochannels." ''Nano Letters'', 2008, 8 (7), pp. 1978-1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of ionic selectivity also largely related to the applied bias. With a low bias, a high selectivity is observed. With the increase of the bias voltage, there is an apparent decrease in the selectivity. For a nanochannel with a low aspect ratio, high selectivity is possible when the bias voltage is low.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Long-channel.jpg|Long channel and low bias voltage result in high selectivity
Image:Short-channel.jpg|Short channel and high bias voltage result in low selectivity
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fabrication==
The advantage of nanofluidic devices is from its feasibility to be integrated with electronic circuitry. Because they are built using the same manufacturing technology, it is possible to make a nanofluidic system with digital integrated circuit on a single chip. Therefore, the control and manipulation of particles in the electrolyte can be achieved in a real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Mijatovic, D.; Eijkel, J. C. T.; van den Berg, A.;"Technologies for nanofluidic systems: top-down vs. bottom-up—a review." ''Lab Chip'', 2005, 5, 492–500&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabrication of nano-channels is categorized into top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down methods are the conventional processes utilized in the IC industry and [[Microelectromechanical systems]] research. It begins with photolithography on a bulk silicon wafer. Bottom-up methods, in contrast, starts with atoms or molecules with intrinsic nano-scaled dimension. By organize and combine these building blocks together, it is able to form a nanostructures as small as only a few nanometers.

===Top-down methods===
A typical method of top-down fabrication includes photolithography to define the geometry of channels on a substrate wafer. The geometry is created by several thin-film deposition and etching steps to form trenches. The substrate wafer is then bonded to another wafer to seal the trenches and form channels. Other technologies to fabricate nano-channels include surface micromachining with sacrificial layers, nano-imprinting lithography, and soft-lithography.

===Bottom-up methods===
The most common method utilized for bottom-up fabrication is [[self-assembled monolayers]] (SAM). This method usually use biological materials to form a molecular monolayer on the substrate. Nano-channels can also be fabricated from the growth of [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNT) and quantum wires. The bottom-up methods usually give well-defined shapes with characteristic length about few nanometers. For these structures to be utilized as nanofluidic devices, the interconnection between nano-channels and microfluidic systems becomes an important issue.

There exist several ways to coat the inner surface with specific charges. Diffusion-limited patterning can be utilized because a bulk solution only penetrate the entrance of a nanochannel within a certain distance. Because the diffusion speed is different for each reactant. By introducing several steps of reactants flowing into the nanochannel, it is possible to pattern the surface with different surface charges inside the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = R. | last2 = Liang | first2 = W. | last3 = Fan | first3 = R. | last4 = Yang | first4 = P. | title = Nanoﬂuidic Diodes Based on Nanotube Heterojunctions | url = | journal = Nano Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 11| year = 2009 | doi=10.1021/nl9020123 | pages=3820–3825 | pmid=19603791| bibcode = 2009NanoL...9.3820Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Nanofluidic devices have been built for application in chemistry, molecular biology and medicine. The main purposes to use nanofluidic devices are separation and measurement of solutions containing nanoparticles for drug delivery, gene therapy and nanoparticle toxicology on a micro-total-analysis system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stavis | first1 = S. | last2 = Strychalski | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Gaitan | first3 = M. | title = Nanoﬂuidic structures with complex three-dimensional surfaces | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235732| journal = Nanotechnology | volume = 20 | issue = 16| year = 2009 | doi=10.1088/0957-4484/20/16/165302 | pmid = 19420567 | pages=165302|bibcode = 2009Nanot..20p5302S }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important advantage of micro- and nano-scaled systems is the small amount of sample or reagent used in analysis. This reduces the time required for sample processing. It is also possible to achieve analysis in an array, which further speeds up  processes and increases throughput of analysis.

Nanochannels are utilized to achieve single-molecule sensing and diagnosis, as well as DNA separation. In many cases, nanofluidic devices are integrated within a microfluidic system to facilitate logic operation of fluids. The future of nanofluidic systems will be focused on several areas such as analytical chemistry and biochemistry, liquid transport and metering, and energy conversion.

In nanofluidics, the valence numbers of the ions determines their net [[electrophoretic]] velocities. In other words, the velocity of an ion in the nano-channel is related not only to its ion mobility but also its ion valence. This enables the sorting function of nanofluidics, which cannot be done in a micro-channel. Therefore, it is possible to do sorting and separation for short strand DNA by using a nanochannel. For the single-molecule DNA application, the final goal is to sequence a strand of genomic DNA in a reproducible and precise result. Similar application can also be found in [[chromatography]], or separation of various ingredients in the solution.

Application also can be found in synthesis of fibers. Polymer fibers can be created by electrospinning the monomers at an interface between liquid and vacuum. An organized polymer structure is formed from a flow of monomers aligning on a substrate.

There is also an attempt to bring nanofluidic technology into energy conversion. In this case, the electrical charged wall behaves as the stator, while the flowing solution as the rotor. It is observed that when the pressure-driven solvent flowing through a charged nanochannel, it can generate a streaming current and a streaming potential. This phenomenon can be used in electrical energy harvesting.

Advances in nanofabrication techniques and concerns about energy shortage make people interested in this idea. The main challenge is to increase efficiency, which is now only a few percent, compared with efficiencies of up to about 95 per cent for standard rotational electromagnetic generators.

==Recent advancements==
Recent studies focus on the integration of nanofluidic devices into microsystems. An interface should be created for the connection between two length-scales. A system with solely nanofluidic devices standalone is impractical because it would requires a large driving pressure to make fluids flow into the nano-channel.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhopadhyay, R.; "What Does Nanofluidics Have to Offer?" ''Anal. Chem.'', 2006, 78 (21), pp. 7379–7382&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanofluidic devices are powerful in their high sensitivity and accurate manipulation of sample materials even down to a single molecule. Nevertheless, the drawback of nanofuidic separation systems is the relatively low sample throughput and its result in detection. One possible approach to deal with the problem is to use parallel separation channels with parallel detection in each channel. In addition, a better approach for detection needs to be created in view of the very small quantities of molecules present.

One of the biggest challenges in this research area are due to the peculiar size-effect. Researchers try to solve the problems caused by the extremely high surface-to-volume ratios. Under this condition, adsorption of molecules can lead to large losses and can also change the surface properties.

Another issue arises when the sample for detection is a relatively large molecule, such as DNA or protein. In the application for large molecule, clogging is a concern because the small size of the nanochannel makes it easy to happen. A low friction coating at inner surface of the channel is desired to avoid blocking of fluid channels in this application.

'''Orgalime'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orgalime.org Orgalime]&lt;/ref&gt; (derived originally from the French '''Organisme de Liaison des Industries Métalliques Européennes''') is the European Engineering Industries Association, speaking for 40 [[Trade association|trade federations]] representing companies in the [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], [[electronics]] and [[metalworking]] and metal articles industries of 23 European countries. The industry employs about 11 million people in Europe and represents some 28% of the output of [[Final goods|manufactured products]] and a third of the manufactured [[export]]s of the [[European Union]]. Orgalime was elected Number 1 Manufacturing sector association in Brussels in 2015 and nominated in the top 5 Trade Associations in Brussels the same year. The Orgalime Director General was furthermore awarded the Association Leadership Award in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/infographic/trademarks-2015-what-makes-associations-effective/|title=TradeMarks 2015: What makes associations effective?|website=EURACTIV.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since November 2015, Tomas Hedenborg, CEO of [[Fastems]], is the President of Orgalime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cecimo.eu/site/publications/news/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=286&amp;cHash=29f24966f5363fd0873c0e46c8f3c373&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Orgalime was formally created in late 1954, therefore pre-dating the official [[European Union]] project. Founding associations came from [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], the [[UK]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. Meetings and informal collaboration between industries had begun in 1948, and although initially created as an informal club without any financial demands, the organisation became increasingly structured and eventually developed a secretariat in the early 1950s. Various other engineering groups had been created at the same time as the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] developed, such as MEFTA and [[COLIME]]. Orgalime members decided in 1960 to incorporate the groups into Orgalime as working groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orgalime.org/page/our-history|title=Our history|last=|first=|date=|website=www.orgalime.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Orgalime has since been registered on the [[Transparency Register]] operated jointly by the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=20210641335-88|title=Transparency Register|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Orgalime represents a large distribution of industry in Europe. The engineering industry is the largest industrial branch in the EU, with a turnover of some €2,000 billion in 2016. The industry furthermore accounts for over a quarter of manufacturing output and a third of the manufactured exports of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orgalime.org/resource/resilience-under-pressure-eu-engineering-industry-continues-grow-moderate-pace|title=Resilience under pressure: EU engineering industry continues to grow at a moderate pace|last=|first=|date=|website=www.orgalime.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Orgalime works in a multi-layered manner. 
* It provides information to its members concerning the activities of the European Union and international bodies of direct relevance that impact the operations of the engineering companies operating in the EU. 
* It provides information and opinions to the European institutions on policy and regulatory issues.
* Provision of a wide range of customised services to different sectors of industry, notably for the monitoring, analysis and dissemination of relevant information published by regulators and for the organisation of congresses and events.
* Production of publications to provide the European engineering companies with model general conditions and documents to help draw up business contracts and give practical advice on frequently occurring legal questions, including in the context of European directives and regulations.    

The majority (90%) of the companies represented are small and medium-sized enterprises covering a broad industry cross-section in terms of product, market segment and geographical spread. Whilst a significant part of the output of the engineering industries are either capital goods or destined for [[Business-to-business]] transactions, there is also a large consumer goods output, particularly in the electrical and electronic branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Yg-KwDWij4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=orgalime#v=onepage&amp;q=orgalime&amp;f=false|title=Examination and Notification Duties in Consumer Sales Law|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=9783935808880|location=|pages=|author1=Jeloschek|first1=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Orgalime is part of an extensive network at European level which includes the [[Confederation of European Business]] (BUSINESSEUROPE), other branch federations, a sister organisation [[CEEMET]] representing the employers in the engineering industry, as well as a number of individual European sector committees/associations representing the interests of individual engineering products or product lines.

As part of its service, Orgalime publishes a range of standard conditions of contract for:
* the supply of mechanical, electrical and electronic products (S2012), released in its new format in March 2012;
* the supply and erection of mechanical, electrical and electronic products (SE01); and
* [[turnkey]] projects / [[engineering, procurement and construction|EPC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jVRVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=orgalime#v=onepage&amp;q=orgalime&amp;f=false|title=International Construction Contract Law|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781118717905|location=|pages=|author1=Klee|first1=Lukas|date=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Due to the nature of the companies and sectors that Orgalime represents, its secretariat works on a large number of issues.
There are several departments all working on respective topics, including:

* [[Standardisation]] and the [[EU single market]]
* [[Energy]] and [[Natural environment|environment]]
* [[Trade]]
* [[Research &amp; Development]] &amp; [[Innovation]]
* Legal issues

With the advent of [[Industry 4.0]] (also known as the [[Fourth Industrial Revolution]]), Orgalime has been vocal about the [[digitisation]] of industry in Europe. The association has provided input on the European Union’s current strategy of a [[Digital Single Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8cP3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=digital+single+market+orgalime#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%20single%20market%20orgalime&amp;f=false|title=Out-thinking Organizational Communications|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9783319418452|location=|pages=|author1=Klewes|first1=Joachim|last2=Popp|first2=Dirk|last3=Rost-Hein|first3=Manuela|date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association has furthermore called on the European Institutions to develop an industrial strategy - a call that was coordinated with some 130 European industry associations in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/opinion/europe-needs-an-industrial-strategy/|title=Europe needs an industrial strategy|website=EURACTIV.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the Commission, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] announced in his [[State of the Union (European Union)]] Speech on Wednesday 13 September 2017 that an industrial strategy would be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-3185_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Orgalime has worked closely on the trade issues, notably the recent [[CETA]] agreement as well as [[TTIP]]. Orgalime has strongly supported EU trade strategies with a focus on shaping [[globalisation]] and improving competitiveness of the EU’s industrial base. 

The association has notably worked on proposals for a more resource efficient Europe, encouraging the use of low carbon, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and overall sustainable energy systems. 
Orgalime closely monitors the development of the European [[Horizon 2020]] programme and has already organised debates concerning the Future [[Framework Programme 9]]. Innovation and research have been prioritised by Orgalime in its messages to the European Institutions. 

In 2014, Orgalime launched a Vision Paper ‘Technology for the World – Manufactured in Europe’ to present the European Commission and the European Parliament with Orgalime's vision for the future of the engineering industry. The Vision Paper was updated in 2016 to coincide with the Commission's mid-term review of its framework programme. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gambica.org.uk/news/orgalime-publishes-vision-paper-technology-for-the-world-manufactured-in-europe-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Software Procedural Design (SPD) converts and translates structural elements into procedural explanations. SPD starts straight after [[Data modeling|data design]] and [[Software architecture|architectural design]]. This has now been mostly abandoned mostly due to the rise in preference of [[Object-oriented programming|Object Oriented Programming]] and [[Object-oriented design|design patterns]]

[[File:Quart Stick explosive, next to smaller M-80.JPG|thumb|right|Quart Stick explosive, next to smaller M-80]]
A '''quarter stick''' is a large [[firecracker]] that falls within a certain range of dimensions. Typically, a quarter stick consists of a thick walled cardboard tube containing approximately 1 oz. (28.4 grams) of pyrotechnic [[flash powder]], with a short length of Visco fuse protruding from the side or end of the device. No true standard for dimensions and construction exists, as these devices are products of bootleg manufacturers.

The term ''quarter stick'' is based on a quarter-stick of [[dynamite]], which it somewhat resembles. However, quarter stick firecrackers do not contain [[nitroglycerin]] as dynamite does, and have far less explosive power.

In the United States, quarter sticks and similar large firecrackers are illegal to manufacture or possess without a [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|BATFE]] High Explosives Manufacturing License.

They are sometimes colloquially known as M-1000s or "block busters".

'''SIA S.p.A.''' is an Italian company operating in the area of ICT, providing solutions and technologies to the banking and finance sector in addition to platforms for financial markets and e-payment services.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1977 as Società Interbancaria per l'Automazione by [[Banca d'Italia]], [[Associazione Bancaria Italiana|ABI]] and a pool of Italian banks. During the 1980s, SIA created the Rete Nazionale Interbancaria (RNI – national interbank network) and contributed to developing the interbank payments system in compliance with the White Paper on [[payment systems]] in Italy, published by Banca d’Italia in 1987.

In 1983 SIA launched [[Bancomat (debit card)|Bancomat]] and in 1987 introduced [[Point of sale|POS]] payments.

In 1992, from a branch of SIA’s business, SSB - Società per i Servizi Bancari was born, a firm specializing in services in the field of [[electronic money]]. The new company worked on further developments in [[payment cards]]: Bancomat/Pagobancomat, FASTpay, borsellino elettronico (e-purse with the MINIpay product) and the Microcircuito project for the migration from magnetic stripe cards to microchip cards.

In 1999, SIA merged with Cedborsa, changing name to "Società Interbancaria per l'Automazione - Cedborsa S.p.A.", working on the automation of the Borsa Italiana markets and the launch of the Italian gross payments markets e-MID and MTS.

In 2003, SIA developed the interbank payments system in Romania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnr.ro/ReGIS-3305.aspx|title=Banca Naţională a României - ReGIS|website=www.bnr.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition for the country’s entry into the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/13753/national-bank-of-romania-live-with-sia-rtgs-system|title=National Bank of Romania live with SIA RTGS system|date=1 June 2005|website=Finextra Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, SIA created and managed the technology platform for the [[STEP2]] project, the first continental ACH ([[Automated Clearing House]]) for retail payments in [[Euro]].

In the same period, SIA created the [[Real-time gross settlement|RTGS]] (Real Time Gross Settlement System) platform for the central banks of Sweden, Norway, Egypt and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2009/Sep/15/perago-sia-ssb-group-wins-tender-to-create-the-new-interbank-payments-system-in-palestine/|title=Perago (SIA-SSB Group) Wins Tender to Create the New Interbank Payments System in Palestine|website=bobsguide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the merger between SIA and SSB gave birth to SIA-SSB S.p.A., a name simplified in 2011 to SIA S.p.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shares.telegraph.co.uk/news/article.php?id=1891654&amp;archive=1&amp;epic=ISP|title=Italy merger of SIA, SSB payment systems conditionally cleared by antitrust body - Market News - Shares &amp; Markets - Telegraph|website=shares.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, in partnership with Colt, SIA was awarded the tender announced by the European Central Bank and becomes a licensed Network Service Provider appointed to create the network infrastructure connecting central securities depositaries ([[Central securities depository|CSD]]), [[central banks]] in the [[Eurosystem]] and major bank groups at European level to TARGET2-Securities (T2S).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sispaga-mercati/security-target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1|title=Bank of Italy - TARGET2-Securities (T2S)|first=Banca|last=d'Italia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, together with the same partner, SIA won the tender announced by Deutsche Bundesbank (which was also operating on behalf of Banca d’Italia, Banque de France and Banco de España) to create the network infrastructure linking the four central banks charged with managing the single platform of the Eurosystem to settle large payments and securities transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/News/sia-and-colt-to-deliver-4cbnet-for-eurosystem-platform?&amp;category=Regulation|title=SIA and Colt to deliver 4CBNet for Eurosystem platform - Electronic Payments International|date=8 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of 2013, SIA incorporated its Belgian subsidiary SiNSYS,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sia.eu/en/media-events/news-comunications/sia-incorporates-belgian-company-sinsys-and-consolidates-its&lt;/ref&gt; a company operating in the processing of payment cards, and acquired Emmecom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sia.eu/en/media-events/news-comunications/sia-acquires-emmecom-and-launches-new-network-services-european|title=SIA acquires Emmecom and launches new network services for european banks and merchants|website=SIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian firm in the sector of fixed, mobile and satellite telecommunications networks.

In the area of [[mobile payments]], during 2014 SIA launched a service called Jiffy for sending and receiving cash in real time to and from a user’s contacts by smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfcworld.com/2014/10/27/332285/sia-offers-europeans-instant-p2p-payments-jiffy/|title=SIA offers Europeans instant P2P payments with Jiffy • NFC World|date=27 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, SIA incorporated its subsidiary RA Computer and the payments Gateway business of its TSP subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/58252/sia-to-incorporate-ra-computer-subsidiary|title=SIA to incorporate RA Computer subsidiary|date=14 January 2015|website=Finextra Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the direct control of payment institution PI4PAY (effective from July 2011).

In January 2016, SIA acquired 69% of UBIQ, a startup born in 2012 from a spin-off of Parma University, specialized in designing and developing innovative technological solutions, particularly in the field of promotions, where it operates with the brand Ti Frutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esmmagazine.com/use-of-t-frutta-digital-coupon-app-expands-in-italy/27998|title=Use of T-Frutta Digital Coupon App Expands in Italy - ESM Magazine|first=ESM|last=Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), New Zealand’s central bank, chose SIA to develop the new Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, to create the new domestic interbank payments system, replacing the Exchange Settlement Account System (ESAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankingtech.com/475212/reserve-bank-of-new-zealand-chooses-sia-for-new-rtgs-system/|title=Reserve Bank of New Zealand chooses SIA for new RTGS system » Banking Technology|website=www.bankingtech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2016, SIA and Raphaels Bank, an issuing bank known for enabling innovation in payments, have agreed to a partnership agree for the development and launch of payment solutions in the UK and throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paymentweek.com/2016-6-2-sia-teams-up-with-raphaels-bank-to-launch-innovative-payment-solutions-10664/|title=SIA Teams Up with Raphaels Bank to Launch Innovative Payment Solutions - Payment Week|date=2 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[ČSOB]], one of the largest commercial banks in the Czech Republic and part of the Belgian KBC Group, and SIA launched the first mobile wallet for NFC payments in the Czech Republic that supports both the MasterCard and VISA circuits.&lt;ref&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sob-chooses-sia-launch-first-140000417.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same month, Unicredit Business Integrated Solutions (UBIS), a company in the [[Unicredit Group]], and SIA signed an agreement for the sale to the latter – for the sum of €500 million – of the processing activities of around 13.5 million payment cards and the management of 206,000 POS terminals and 12,000 ATMs in Italy, Germany and Austria. UBIS also signed with SIA a ten-year outsourcing contract for the supply of processing services for transactions made using debit, credit and prepaid cards, and for the management of POS and ATM terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankingtech.com/546822/sia-buys-e-money-processing-unit-of-unicredit/|title=SIA buys e-money processing unit of Unicredit » Banking Technology|website=www.bankingtech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final part of 2016, SIA launched a series of partnerships in the e-payments market: American Express Italia has chosen SIA to launch a completely digital and paperless service to support the request for new credit cards. This project uses authentication and digital signature systems to request a card in [[paperless]] mode. Moreover, Friday 23 December 2016 saw the completion of the acquisition by SIA of the processing activities of around 13.5 million [[payment cards]] and the management of 206,000 POS terminals and 12,000 ATM terminals in Italy, Germany and Austria from Unicredit Business Integrated Solutions (UBIS), a company in the [[Unicredit]] Group, for the sum of €500 million. Following this agreement, SIA S.p.A. on January 1, 2017 established two new companies: P4cards S.r.l., based in Verona, and Pforcards GmbH, based in Vienna, to manage the payment cards processing activities.

In the spring of 2017 the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) has chosen SIA to implement and support the new real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) and the new instant payment platform. These technology infrastructures developed by SIA, planned to go live in 2018, will replace CBI’s current mainframe-based real-time solutions for high and low-value payment systems, which have been operating since 2001. Central Bank of Iceland manages all interbank payments in the country. Despite the small population, it processes a quite significant daily volume of transactions: up to 1 million payments with a peak of 160,000 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sia.eu/en/media-events/news-press-releases/central-bank-of-iceland-chooses-sia-to-implement-the-new-real-time-gross-settlement-system-and-the-new-instant-payment-platform&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Thomson Reuters has launched the “SIABookbuilding” application on its flagship desktop platform Eikon, offering sell-side professionals a new fully integrated application for the IPO syndication and distribution process. SIABookbuilding is available through App Studio, Eikon’s third-party development platform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sia.eu/en/media-events/news-press-releases/thomson-reuters-expands-ipo-execution-strategy-with-siabookbuilding-app-in-eikon&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of weeks later, Poste Italiane and SIA have signed a deal that allows holders of debit cards and Postepay cards to use the Extra Sconti App, which is based on a cash-back mechanism to credit consumers' postal current accounts for supermarket purchases of brands recommended by the Extra Sconti App.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sia.eu/en/media-events/news-press-releases/poste-italiane-releases-the-extra-sconti-app-realised-in-partnership-with-sia|title=Poste Italiane releases the EXTRA SCONTI App realised in partnership with SIA|website=SIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, SIA celebrated its first 40 years of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sia.eu/en/media-events/news-press-releases/sia-celebrates-40-years-of-innovation-in-payments|title=SIA celebrates 40 years of innovation in payments|website=SIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Scottish photography''' is the creation of durable images by recording light, or other electromagnetic radiation, in Scotland, or by Scottish people.

Scotland played a major role in the technical development of photography in the nineteenth century through the efforts of figures including [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]]. Its artistic development was pioneered by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] and artist [[David Octavius Hill]], whose work is considered to be some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Thomas Roger was one of the first commercial photographers. [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] was one of the first architectural photographers. [[George Washington Wilson]] pioneered [[instant photography]] and [[landscape photography]]. [[Clementina Hawarden]] and Mary Jane Matherson were amongst the first female photographers. [[War photography]] was pioneered by [[John McCosh]], [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]], Alexander Graham and [[Mairi Chisholm]].

In the early twentieth century notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] and [[Paul Strand]]. There was also the record of the [[Gorbals]] in Glasgow made by [[Bert Hardy]], Joseph MacKenzie and [[Oscar Marzaroli]]. Having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century. In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough and Murray Johnston. More recent exponents who have received acclaim include Pradip Malde, [[Maud Sulter]] and Owen Logan.

Scotland lacks a national gallery of photography, but there are the dedicated Stills and Portfolio galleries in Edinburgh and space dedicated to photography at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the Street Level Gallery in Glasgow. Photography is taught at degree and further education level in Scotland and the history of photography is usually taught within the context of art history.

==History==
===Technical origins===
[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|right|The world's first [[colour photography|colour photograph]], made by the Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1861, was of a tartan ribbon.]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[David Brewster]] (1781–1868) and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831–79) played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; Brewster was an expert on optics and had refined the microscope and invented the [[kaleidoscope]]. He collaborated with a number of figures, including [[Henry Fox Talbot]] (1800–77), who had developed the [[calotype]] photographic process.&lt;ref&gt;S. Stevenson, A. Morrison-Low, A. Simpson, J. Lawson, R. Mackenzie, R. Gillanders and J. Lawson, ''Light from the Dark Room: A Celebration of Scottish Photography'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1995), {{ISBN|0903598582}}, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell was among the first scientists to investigate colour and produced the first colour photograph in 1861, displayed by using three [[magic lantern]] projectors with different colour filters.&lt;ref&gt;S. Stevenson, A. Morrison-Low, A. Simpson, J. Lawson, R. Mackenzie, R. Gillanders and J. Lawson, ''Light from the Dark Room: A Celebration of Scottish Photography'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1995), {{ISBN|0903598582}}, pp. 20–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic development===
According to photo historian David Burn "there is a good case to be made for the proposition that the greatest contribution that Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography".&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; A circle of scientists and artists gathered around Brewster in Edinburgh with the objective of refining the science and art of photography. In 1839 of the five examples of the [[daguerrotype]] and twenty "Photogenic Drawings" by Talbot were shown at the Exhibition of Arts, Manufacturers and Practical Sciences at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh. In 1841 four more daguerreotypes were displayed at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. By 1843 the Edinburgh Calotype Club had been formed, probably the world's first photographic club. The club dissolved in the mid-1850s as new processes appeared, such as the [[albumen print]] and wet [[collodion process]]. The Glasgow Photographic Society was founded in 1855, The Photographic Society of Scotland formed in 1856 and the Edinburgh Photographic Society in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, pp. 26–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Edinburgh Calotype Club included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–70), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. They originally worked together with the aim of recording the members of the [[Great Disruption|Disruption Assembly]], which saw the division of the [[Church of Scotland]] in 1843, for a large composite painting, but soon the photographs themselves became a major medium. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; They produced images influenced by [[genre art]] included their ''Edinburgh Ale'' (1843–46), where the poses of three drinking companions are based on scenes from Dutch art.&lt;ref name=Hannavy2013p575&gt;J. Hannavy, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography'' (London: Routledge, 2013), {{ISBN|1135873275}}, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill and Adamson also pioneered the recording of rural life as a suitable subject for photography, recording the fisher folk of [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]], near Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson trained Thomas Roger (1833–88) of St. Andrews, who was one of the first commercial photographers and beside commercial portraits, produced many genre style compositions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Simpson, ''The Photography of Victorian Scotland'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|074865464X}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; Annan also pioneered the recording of industrial change, photographing the pumping stations and canals of the new waterways to Glasgow in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=Normand2007p107&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of industrial development was taken up by Evelyn Carey (1858–1932), who recorded step-by-step the building of the [[Forth Railway Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Normand2007p107/&gt; Also interested in urban landscapes was Archibald Burns, who occupied part of the Rock House studio and whose ''The Horse Wynd'' and ''The Cowgate'' (both 1871) emphasised the picturesque aspects of Edinburgh's urban landscape.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; John Thomson (1852–90) undertook a similar documentary study of London street life between 1876 and 1877.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important figures included [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0486267504}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington Wilson]] (1823–93) pioneered [[instant photography]]&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and [[landscape photography]], becoming "photographer to the Queen" and his Aberdeen company was the largest producer of topographical prints by 1880.&lt;ref&gt;O.

Documentary [[war photography]] was pioneered by Scottish surgeon [[John McCosh]] (1805–85), who produced photographs of the [[Second Sikh War]] (1848–49) and the [[Second Burmese War]] (1852–53). Scottish photographer [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]] (1813–88) worked in the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56), producing a record of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Siege of Sevastopol]] in 1853 and then being employed by the British army in India.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The émigré Scot Alexander Graham played a major role in photographing the [[American Civil War]], taking iconic images of ''President Lincoln on the Battlefield of Antietam'' (1862) and ''Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter'' (1863).&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, pp. 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Scots that made there reputation as photographers abroad, often being the  first to exploit the medium there include [[William Carrick]] (1827–78) in Russia, [[William Notman]] (1826–91) and Alexander Henderson (1831–1913) in Canada, James MacDonald In Israel, John Thompson in Asia, [[Robert Turnbull Macpherson (photographer)|Robert MacPherson]] (1811–72) in Italy and [[George Valentine]] (1852–90) in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

Annan's son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic advocate [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Annan and Stieglitz pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Annan also joined the [[Linked Ring]], which broke away from the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in 1892 with a manifesto that saw photography as much as an art as a science and that it should be treated as the equal of conventional visual art. He championed the "artistic" framing and hanging of photographic exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, pp. 27–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century to the Present===
A number of Scots acted as photographers in the First World War (1914–18), including dispatch rider and ambulance driver [[Mairi Chisholm]] (1896–1981) who used a lightweight Vest Pocket Kodak camera, that allowed her to capture an image during a bombardment, in her ''Chishom and Knocker Under Fire at Pervyse'' (1917), which can be seen as the first "action shots" of war.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] (1882–1966), who produced illustrations for the work of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Paul Strand]] (1890–1976), who produced atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the [[Gorbals]] in Glasgow made by figures such as [[Bert Hardy]] (1913–95), [[Joseph MacKenzie]] (1929-2015) and [[Oscar Marzaroli]] (1933–88),&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and by [[Wolfgang Suschitzky]] (b. 1912) in Glasgow and Dundee.&lt;ref&gt;T.

In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85), who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977, and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C. Henry, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19900106&amp;id=ez1AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1767,1402979 "Scots photography loses a champion"], ''Glasgow Herald'', 6 January 1990, retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 ''Constructed Narratives'' exhibition at the Stills Gallery signalled the renaissance, showcasing the work of [[Calum Colvin]] (b. 1961) and Ron O'Donnell (b. 1952), both of whom produced intensely coloured and constructed photographic works.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Important practitioners in Scotland included the American [[Thomas Joshua Cooper]] (b. 1946).&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent exponents who have received acclaim include Pradip Malde (b. 1957), [[Maud Sulter]] (1960–2008) and Owen Logan (b. 1963). The range of contemporary talent was showcased by the 1995 ''Light in the Dark Room'' exhibition.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

==Galleries==
Scotland lacks a national gallery of photography, but there are the dedicated Stills and Portfolio galleries in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; There is also space dedicated to photography at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the Street Level Gallery in Glasgow. Traditional art galleries also increasingly accept exhibitions of photographic art.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

==Education==
Photography is taught at degree level in Scotland at [[Edinburgh College of Art]], [[Napier University]], [[Glasgow School of Art]] and [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]] within the [[University of Dundee]], where there is a particular emphasis on cutting edge technology. The history of photography is usually taught within the context of art history at institutions including [[St Andrews University]]. It is also taught at further education colleges throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;{{clear}}

"'''Seven Sisters'''" was a common term for the seven transnational oil companies of the "[[Consortium for Iran]]" [[oligopoly]] or [[cartel]], which dominated the global [[petroleum industry]] from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. Alluding to the seven mythological [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades sisters]] fathered by the titan [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the business usage was popularized in the 1950s by businessman [[Enrico Mattei]], then-head of the Italian state oil company [[Eni]]. The industry group consisted of:&lt;ref name=sampson&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Anthony Sampson |last=Sampson |first=Anthony |title=The Seven Sisters: The Great Oil Companies and the World They Shaped |location=New York |publisher=Viking Press |year=1975 |isbn=0-553-20449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/471ae1b8-d001-11db-94cb-000b5df10621.html|title= The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals |newspaper= Financial Times| first= Carola|last= Hoyos|date= 11 March 2007|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946053-1,00.html |title=Business: The Seven Sisters Still Rule |accessdate=24 October 2010 |journal=Time |date=11 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (now [[BP]])
#[[Gulf Oil]] (later part of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]])
#[[Royal Dutch Shell]]
#[[Standard Oil Company of California]] (SoCal, now Chevron)

#[[Mobil#History|Standard Oil Company of New York]] (Socony, later [[Mobil]], also now part of ExxonMobil)
#[[Texaco]] (later merged into [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]])

Preceding the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Seven Sisters controlled around 85 percent of [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|the world's petroleum reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article272352.ece |title=Shaky industry that runs the world |first=Ian |last=Mann |accessdate=12 April 2016 |newspaper=The Times (South Africa) |date=24 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127022854/http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article272352.ece |archivedate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, industry dominance has shifted to the [[OPEC]] cartel and state-owned oil and gas companies in emerging-market economies, such as [[Saudi Aramco]], [[Gazprom]] (Russia), [[China National Petroleum Corporation]], [[National Iranian Oil Company]], [[PDVSA]] (Venezuela), [[Petrobras]] (Brazil), and [[Petronas]] (Malaysia). In 2007, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' called these "the new Seven Sisters".&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/30922-the-new-seven-sisters-todays-most-powerful-energy-companies |last=Vardi |first=Nicholas |title=The New Seven Sisters: Today's Most Powerful Energy Companies |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to consulting firm [[PFC Energy]], by 2012 only 7% of the world's known oil reserves were in countries that allowed private international companies free rein. Fully 65% were in the hands of state-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2012/apr/26/why-should-bahamas-be-in-7-oil-minority/ |title=Why Should Bahamas Be In 7% Oil Minority? |first=David |last=Allen |newspaper=The Tribune |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and history==
In 1951, [[The nationalization of the Iran oil industry movement|Iran nationalized its oil industry]] previously controlled by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now [[BP]]), and Iranian oil was subjected to an international [[embargo]]. In an effort to bring Iranian oil production back to international markets, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] suggested the creation of a [[consortium]] of major oil companies, several of which were daughter corporations of [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s original [[Standard Oil]] monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beltrame |first=Stefano |title=Mossadeq: L'Iran, il petrolio, gli Stati Uniti e le radici della Rivoluzione Islamica |publisher=Rubbettino |year=2009 |isbn=978-88-498-2533-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Anglo-Persian Oil Company#Consortium|Consortium for Iran]]" was subsequently formed by the following companies:

#Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (United Kingdom) – This company became [[British Petroleum]]. Following the takeover of [[Amoco]] (which in turn was formerly Standard Oil of Indiana) and [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield]] by British Petroleum, the name was shortened to BP in 2000.
#[[Gulf Oil]] (United States) – In 1984, most of Gulf was acquired by SoCal and the enlarged SoCal entity became Chevron.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chevron.com/about/leadership/|title=Company Profile|publisher=Chevron.com|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller parts of Gulf Oil were acquired by BP and [[Cumberland Farms]]. A network of service stations largely in the northeastern United States still bears the Gulf name.
#Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands/United Kingdom)
#Standard Oil Co. of California (SoCal) (United States) – Became [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in 1984 when SoCal acquired Gulf Oil.
#Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey (Esso) (United States) – Became [[Exxon]], which renamed itself ExxonMobil following the acquisition of [[Mobil]] in 1999.
#Standard Oil Co. of New York (Socony) (United States) – Became [[Mobil]], which was acquired by Exxon in 1999 to form [[ExxonMobil]].
#Texaco (United States) – Acquired by Chevron in 2001.
The head of the Italian state oil company ([[Eni]]), [[Enrico Mattei]], sought membership for his company, but was rejected by what he dubbed the "Seven Sisters", the American and British companies that largely controlled the Middle East's oil production after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874858,00.html |title=Italy: Two-Timing the Seven Sisters |journal=[[Time Magazine|Time]] |date=14 June 1963 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; British writer [[Anthony Sampson]] took over the term when he wrote the book ''The Seven Sisters'' in 1975, to describe the oil [[cartel]] that tried its best to eliminate competitors and keep control of the world's oil resource.&lt;ref name=sampson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Henderson |first=Dean |url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/PrintArticle.php?articleId=24507 |title=The Four Horsemen Behind America's Oil Wars |publisher=Global Research |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the oil cartel was further popularized, along with a fictional logo, in ''[[Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior]]'', a 1981 film about apocalyptic fuel shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printView/6954398 |title=''Mad Max''–Style Rides Reigned at This Post-Apocalyptic Car Show |first=Liz |last=Ohanesian |newspaper=L.A. Weekly|date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being politically influential, [[vertically integrated]], well organized, and able to negotiate cohesively as a cartel, the Seven Sisters were initially able to exert considerable power over [[Third World]] oil producers. However, in recent decades, the dominance of the Seven Sisters and their successor companies has been challenged by the following trends:&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;
* the increasing influence of the [[OPEC]] cartel (formed in 1960 and expanded steadily through 1975),
* the declining share of world oil and [[gas reserves]] held by [[OECD]] countries, and
* the emergence of powerful [[National Oil companies|state-owned oil companies]] in emerging-market economies.

As of 2017, the surviving companies from the Seven Sisters are BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, which form four members of the "[[supermajor]]s" group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-26/big-oil-debt-tops-out-as-cost-cuts-combine-with-rally-in-prices |title=Oil Supermajors' Debt From the Crude Collapse May Have Peaked |first=Rakteem |last=Katakey |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=26 January 2017 |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex swing''' (also known as a '''sling''') is a type of [[:wikt:harness|harness]] designed to allow [[sexual intercourse]] between one partner suspended by the swing and another who moves freely. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/208/sex-sling | title=What does Sex Sling mean | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Though there is considerable variety in the design, the most common sex swings have a support for the back, another for the [[buttocks]], and [[stirrup]]s for each leg, which can be adjusted whilst the user is suspended. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/what-the-pathetic-case-against-rentboy-com-says-about-sex-work/ | title=What the Pathetic Case Against Rentboy.com Says About Sex Work | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following types of sex swing exist: traditional swing, door swing, body swing, and fantasy swing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The body swing is suspended from one partner's body.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The door swing is mounted on a door.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passionshop.com/blog/sex-toys/how-to-use-a-sex-swing |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514085912/http://www.passionshop.com/blog/sex-toys/how-to-use-a-sex-swing/ |archivedate=May 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fantasy swing is suspended from an [[eye bolt]] in the ceiling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In popular culture, sex swing is mostly associated with [[BDSM]] practices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/20/dungeons-and-genital-clamps-inside-a-legendary-bdsm-chateau.html | title=Dungeons and Genital Clamps: Inside a Legendary BDSM Chateau | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

[[File:Sling.jpg|thumb|[[Hammock]]-style sling for sexual activity]]
A sex swing or sling is designed to assist in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] activity.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"/&gt; Materials for constructing these devices include [[nylon]] [[webbing]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} heavy [[canvas]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[leather]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[neoprene]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} heavy [[natural rubber|rubber]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[wood]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}and [[steel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The designs provide access to the passive (receptive) partner's [[Sex organ|genitalia]], [[perineum]], buttocks, and [[Anus|anal]] areas while supporting the individual in a comfortable position, with the hips flexed, to allowing the passive partner to fully relax.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The most common sex swing is similar to a [[hammock]] and holds the receptive partner in a [[supine position]] (back down).{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} A variant of the hammock style is a hanging platform of wood or metal, padded for comfort, on which the receptive partner reclines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The hanging platform differs from the hammock style in that, being rigid, the receptive partner's back is straight rather than bowed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Both the hammock and hanging platform designs are often equipped with loops or stirrups to support the ankles or calves up without the requiring exertion by the receptive partner.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} This allows the receptive partner's hips to be flexed without exertion, improving access to the areas of interest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hammock-style swings vary in the number of suspension points from three (two at the hips and one at the head), to four (two at the hips and two at the shoulders), to five (two each at hips and shoulders, plus one at the head).{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The functional difference between these variants lies in the stability of the sling when in use: the more suspension points, the less movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, many users prefer to have a greater range of movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Another variation is the sit swing, which holds the receptive partner upright in sitting position, rather than supine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Sit swings take most of the body's weight with large padded loops around the thighs, or some similar arrangement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Sit swings are commonly suspended from a single point attached to the ceiling, to a free-standing sex swing stand, or a door.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Door swings offer quicker installation and lower cost, but sacrifice some flexibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Purpose ==

The main purpose of sex swings is to make sexual intercourse more exciting and effortless. A sex swing may enable greater freedom of movement during intercourse or assist with challenging [[sex position]]s.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"/&gt; Swings may be used for [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]] and [[Anal sex|anal]] sex, [[fellatio]], and [[cunnilingus]].

Sex swings can enable individuals with a physical impairment or [[disability]] to enjoy a wide range of sexual activities. Individuals with muscular weakness or [[arthritis]] may use a sex swing to reduce the strain on affected muscles or joints.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Individuals who use a [[wheelchair]] can engage in sexual activity using a sex swing suspended from a [[hoist (device)|hoist]].&lt;ref name="Wheelchair Sex Swing"&gt;{{cite web

== Safety ==

It is important to follow the provided instructions when using a sex swing. Secure mounting is vital to avoid injury to the suspended partner from falling. The use of [[toggle bolt]]s, such as would be used to hang a dreamcatcher, is not appropriate. Installing springs, if supplied, is important to reduce physical [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] to the suspended partner caused by rapid [[deceleration]] when bouncing in a sex swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{About|a vehicle for interstellar travel}}

A '''starship''', '''starcraft''' or '''interstellar spacecraft''' is a theoretical [[spacecraft]] designed for [[interstellar travel|traveling between planetary systems]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yahoo.com|title=What Would a Actually Look Like?|publisher=Popularmechanics|language=English|author=Erik Sofge|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to an [[aerospace]]-vehicle designed for [[orbital spaceflight]] or [[interplanetary travel]].

The term is mostly found in [[science fiction]], because such craft is not known to have ever been constructed. Reference to a "star-ship" appears as early as 1882 in ''[[Oahspe: A New Bible]]'' (1882).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gailallen.com/rel/Oahspe/index.htm|title=Oahspe - Index|author=|date=|website=gailallen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gailallen.com/rel/Oahspe/oah223.htm|title=Oahspe - Book of Divinity: Chapter XVI|author=|date=|website=gailallen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] and [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] probes have travelled into local interstellar space, the purpose of these unmanned craft was specifically interplanetary and they are not predicted to reach another star system (although ''[[Voyager 1]]'' will travel to within 1.7 light years of [[Gliese 445]] in approximately 40,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html|title=Voyager 1 Has Date with a Star in 40,000 Years|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Several preliminary designs for starships have been undertaken through [[exploratory engineering]], using [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] with modern technology or technology thought likely to be available in the near future.

In April 2016, scientists announced [[Breakthrough Starshot]], a [[Breakthrough Initiatives]] program, to develop a [[proof-of-concept]] fleet of small centimeter-sized [[light sail]] [[spacecraft]], named ''[[StarChip (spacecraft)|StarChip]]'',&lt;ref name="CD-20160412"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilster |first=Paul |title=Breakthrough Starshot: Mission to Alpha Centauri |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=35402 |date=12 April 2016 |work=Centauri Dreams |accessdate=14 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; capable of making the journey to [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest [[Extrasolar system|extrasolar]] star system, at speeds of 20%&lt;ref name="NYT-20160412-db"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=A Visionary Project Aims for Alpha Centauri, a Star 4.37 Light-Years Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/alpha-centauri-breakthrough-starshot-yuri-milner-stephen-hawking.html |date=12 April 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GZM-20160412"&gt;{{cite news |last= Stone |first=Maddie |url=https://gizmodo.com/a-russian-billionaire-and-stephen-hawking-want-to-build-1770467186 |title=Stephen Hawking and a Russian Billionaire Want to Build an Interstellar Starship |work=[[Gizmodo]] |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 15%&lt;ref name="BR-20160412"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Breakthrough Starshot  |url=http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3 |date=12 April 2016 |work=[[Breakthrough Initiatives]] |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[speed of light]], taking between 20 and 30 years to reach the star system, respectively, and about 4 years to notify [[Earth]] of a successful arrival.

==Research==
[[Image:Daedalusschip1.png|thumb|right|Artist's conception of British Interplanetary Society's [[Project Daedalus]] (1978), a fusion powered interstellar probe]]
To travel between stars in a reasonable time using [[rocket]]-like technology requires very high [[effective exhaust velocity]] jet, and enormous energy to power this, such as might be provided by [[fusion power]] or [[antimatter]].

There are very few scientific studies that investigate the issues in building a starship. Some examples of this include:

*[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] (1958–1965), mostly manned interplanetary spacecraft
*[[Project Daedalus]] (1973–1978), unmanned interstellar probe
*[[Project Longshot]] (1987–1988), unmanned interstellar probe
*[[Project Icarus (Interstellar Probe Design Study)|Project Icarus]] (2009–2014), unmanned interstellar probe
*[[Hundred-Year Starship]] (2011), manned interstellar craft &lt;!--DARPA study--&gt;
*See [[interstellar probe]]s, [[interstellar travel]]

The [[Bussard ramjet]] is an idea to use nuclear fusion of [[interstellar gas]] to provide propulsion.

Examined in an October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', the [[Enzmann Starship]] proposed using a 12,000 ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power thermonuclear powered pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] and assembled in-orbit, the proposed spacecraft would be part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.

The NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (1996–2002), was a professional scientific study examining advanced spacecraft propulsion systems.

==Theoretical types==
A common literary device is to posit a [[faster-than-light]] [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system (such as [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]]) or travel through [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], although some starships may be outfitted for [[century|centuries]]-long journeys of slower-than-light travel. Other designs posit a way to boost the ship to near-lightspeed, allowing relatively "quick" travel (i.e. decades, not centuries) to nearer stars. This results in a general categorization of the kinds of starships:

* [[Sleeper ship|Sleeper]], which put their passengers into [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] during a long trip. This includes [[Cryonics]]-based systems that freeze passengers for the duration of the journey.
* [[Generation ship|Generation]], where the destination will be reached by descendants of the original passengers.
* [[Theory of relativity|Relativistic]], taking advantage of [[time dilation]] at close-to-light-speeds, so long trips will seem much shorter (but still take the same amount of time for outside observers).
* [[Faster-than-light]], which can move between places very quickly (transcending current understanding of physics or using interdimensional 'shortcuts' or [[wormholes]]).

==Fictional elements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Certain common elements are found in most fiction that discusses starships.

===Slower-than-light===
{{main|Generation ship}}
Fiction that discusses slower-than-light starships is relatively rare, since the time scales are so long. Instead of describing the interaction with the outside world, those fictions tend to focus on setting the whole story within the world of the (often very large) starship during its long travels. Sometimes the starship ''is'' a world, in perception or reality.

===Faster-than-light===
{{main|Faster-than-light}}
Travel at velocities greater than the [[speed of light]] is impossible according to the known [[laws of physics]], although apparent [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] is not excluded by general relativity. The [[Alcubierre drive]] provides a theoretical way of achieving FTL, although it requires [[negative mass]], which has not yet been discovered. Nevertheless, [[Harold G. White]] at NASA has designed the [[White–Juday warp-field interferometer]] to detect a microscopic instance of a warping of space-time according to the [[Alcubierre drive]].

==Fictional examples==
{{main|List of fictional spaceships#Interstellar}}
The following is a listing of some of the most widely known vessels in various science fiction franchises. The most prominent cultural use and one of the earliest common uses of the term ''starship'' was in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''.

[[File:Le plus grand Tajine au monde.jpg|thumb|250px|Tajine statue in [[Safi, Morocco]]]]
A '''tajine''' or '''tagine''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الطاجين, [[Tifinagh]]: ⵜⴰⵊⵉⵏ) is a [[Maghreb]]i dish which is named after the [[earthenware]] pot in which it is cooked. It is also called a Maraq/marqa in [[North Africa]].

== Etymology ==
From [[Moroccan Arabic]] طجين ''ṭajīn'', from [[Arabic]] طاجن ''ṭājin'' "shallow earthen pot",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wordnik|url=https://www.wordnik.com/words/tajine|website=Wordnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-grc|{{linktext|τάγηνον}}}} ''tagēnon'' "frying-pan, saucepan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albala|first1=Ken|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0313376263|page=234|quote=The Arabic word tajin is derived from the Greek teganon, meaning “frying pan".}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dta%2Fghnon τάγηνον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/arabic/middle_east_news/newsid_7429000/7429173.stm |title=الطاجين المغربي يقاوم التشويه |date=31 May 2008|publisher=[[BBC Arabic]]|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The tagine dates back to [[Harun al-Rashid]] who was a ruler of the [[Early Muslim conquests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kouskousrestaurant.com/news/2016/3/17/the-origin-of-ta|title=The Origin of Tagine|work=Kous Kous Moroccan Bistro|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=r723owliVz8C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The New Book of Middle Eastern Food|last=Roden|first=Claudia|date=2008-12-24|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307558565|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/04/22/146374.html|title=Tagine in heartwarming spoonfuls|last=0|website=english.alarabiya.net|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=IYeOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1608&amp;dq=|title=Encyclopedia of Kitchen History|last=Snodgrass|first=Mary Ellen|date=2004-12-29|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135455716|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest writings about the concept of cooking in a tajine appear in the famous ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', an Arabic-language story collection from the ninth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also mentioned during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (which stretched from the Middle East to North Africa and [[al-Andalus]] during the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gadventures.com/blog/origins-food-we-love-moroccan-tagine/|title=Origins of Food We Love: Moroccan Tagine|work=G Adventures Blog|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dish would have been already famous amongst the nomadic [[Bedouin]] people of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], who added dried fruits like dates, apricots and [[Prune|plums]] to give it its unique taste. Tagine is now often eaten with [[french fries]], either on the top or on the side.

Today, the cooking-pot and its traditional broth is primarily prepared in the Middle East and North Africa. In North Africa it is called a Tajine, while in the Middle East it is called a ''maraq'' (broth) or a ''qidra'' (cooking pot). There are different ways to prepare the tajine. In the original qidra style ''saman'' ([[clarified butter]]) is used to lubricate the surface and a puree of chopped onion is added for flavour and aroma. For ''muqawlli''-style cooking, the ingredients are placed in [[olive oil]] to enrich the flavours.

There are many descriptions of how to prepare a tajine from Arab scholars. A famous description is the one from [[ibn al-Adim]]:
{{quotation |text=Boil the meat and fry with fresh coriander, onions and hot spices and a little garlic. Then pick out the fennel hearts and cut in half. Put over the meat. Put back some of the broth on it along with sheep's tail. Boil until cooked and the broth has been absorbed. Remove [from the heat].|author=[[Ibn al-Adim]] |title=''Kitab Al Wuslah il Al-Habib fi wasf al tayyibat wa Al-Tib''}}

==Pottery==
The traditional tajine [[pottery]], sometimes painted or [[ceramic glaze|glazed]], consists of two parts: a circular base unit that is flat with low sides and a large cone- or dome-shaped cover that sits on the base during cooking. The cover is designed to return all [[condensation]] to the bottom. That process can be improved by adding cold water into the specially designed well at the top of the lid.

Tajine is traditionally cooked over hot charcoal leaving an adequate space between the coals and the tajine pot to avoid having the temperature rise too quickly. Large bricks of charcoal are used, specifically for their ability to stay hot for hours.  Other methods are to use a tajine in a slow oven or on a gas or electric stove top, on the lowest heat necessary to keep the stew simmering gently. A [[Diffuser (heat)|diffuser]], a circular utensil placed between the tajine and the flame, is used to evenly distribute the stove's heat. European manufacturers have created tajines with heavy [[cast-iron]] bottoms that can be heated on a cooking stove to a high temperature, which permits the browning of meat and vegetables before cooking.

Tajine cooking may be replicated by using a [[slow cooker]] or similar item, but the result will be slightly different{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  Many ceramic tajines are decorative items as well as functional cooking vessels. Some tajines, however, are intended only to be used as decorative serving dishes.

== Moroccan and Algerian tajine ==

Moroccan and Algerian tajine dishes are slow-cooked savory stews, typically made with sliced meat, poultry or fish together with vegetables or fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine|work=fescooking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spices, nuts, and dried fruits are also used. Common spices include [[ginger]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]], [[cinnamon]], and [[saffron]]. [[Paprika]] and chili are used in vegetable tajines. The sweet and sour combination is common in tajine dishes like lamb with dates and spices. Tajines are generally served with bread. Because the domed or cone-shaped lid of the tajine pot traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables. This method of cooking is practical in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available.

==Tunisian tajine==
[[Image:Tajine tunisien.JPG|thumb|Tunisian tajine]]
What Tunisians refer to as a "tajine" is very different from the Moroccan dish.&lt;ref name="Wolfert-Tunisian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paula-wolfert.com/recipes/tun_tagine.html|author=Paula Wolfert|title=Recipe for Tunisian Tajine|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tunisian cuisine|Tunisian]] tajine is more like an Italian [[frittata]] or an [[eggah]]. First, a simple [[ragout]] is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried [[rose]][[bud]]s and ground cinnamon known as ''[[baharat]]'' or a robust combination of ground [[coriander]] and [[caraway]] seeds; this is called [[tabil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/divine-secrets-of-the-mahjoub-sisterhood|author=Nancy Harmon Jenkins|title=Divine Secrets of the Mahjoub Sisterhood|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include [[cannellini bean]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[breadcrumb]]s or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh [[parsley]], dried [[Mentha|mint]], [[saffron]], [[sun-dried tomato]]es, cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew is baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of [[lemon]]. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.

In rural parts of Tunisia, home cooks place a shallow earthenware dish over olive-wood coals, fill it, cover it with a flat earthenware pan, and then pile hot coals on top. The resulting tajine is crusty on top and bottom, moist within and is infused with a subtle smoky fragrance.

'''Thomas Andrew Merritt''' (born June 28, 1970) is a technology journalist, writer, and broadcaster best known as the host of several podcasts. He is the former co-host of [[Tech News Today]] on the [[TWiT.tv]] Network, and was previously an [[Executive Editor]] for [[CNET]] and developer and co-host of the daily podcast ''[[Buzz Out Loud]]''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.onlinereporter.com/article.php?article_id=6861 |title=CNET launches Podcast Central |journal=The Online Reporter |date=May 27, 2006 |issue=494 |page=10 |accessdate=November 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He currently hosts ''Daily Tech News Show'', ''Cordkillers'', and ''Sword and Laser'', among other shows.

==Early life==
Merritt was born in [[Greenville, Illinois]], to a food scientist father who worked on the [[Coffee-Mate]] project.&lt;ref name="bol577"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6776212.html |title=Buzz Out Loud 577: Steve Jobs' pants |website=[[CNET]] |host=[[Molly Wood]] and  Merritt |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113110113/http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6776212.html |archivedate=January 13, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merritt received a BS in [[journalism]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and pursued graduate work in communications at the [[University of Texas|University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tommerritt.com/?page_id=7 |title=Resume / CV |work=tommerritt.com |date=July 21, 2007 |accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Merritt's career in [[radio]] began in 1986 as a DJ for [[WGEL]], a [[country music]] station located in [[Greenville, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; In 1993, he worked as an intern for [[NPR|National Public Radio's]] "[[Morning Edition]]".&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; From 1999 to 2004 Merritt worked for [[TechTV]] in San Francisco as an Executive Web Producer and served as a radio host with TechTV until 2003.&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt;

===CNET===
Merritt started with CNET in 2004.&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt;  In addition to his duties as co-host of [[Buzz Out Loud]] with [[Molly Wood]], Merritt also had a regular column &amp; podcast (co-hosted with [[Rafe Needleman]]) dealing with consumer technology. He also co-hosted the tech support call-in program CNET Live with fellow editor [[Brian Cooley]], and was the host of CNET Top 5.

On April 16, 2010, Merritt announced he would be stepping down as co-host of Buzz Out Loud, and that he would be joining the [[TWiT.tv]] Network as a full-time daily host beginning June 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tommerritt.com/?p=1473 |title=I’m changing some things. UPDATE |publisher=Tom Merritt .com |date=April 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his last Buzz Out Loud episode on May 14, 2010 he announced that his main focus at [[TWiT.tv]] would be a new daily show, [[Tech News Today]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tommerritt.com/?p=1519 |title=Coming June 1- Tech News Today with Tom Merritt |publisher=Tom Merritt .com |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TWiT Network===
Prior to joining TWiT as an employee, Merritt had a long-standing working relationship with former TechTV colleague [[Leo Laporte]]'s network having regularly appeared on This Week in Tech as either a guest or as a relief host.  His general discussion podcast with [[Roger Chang]], [[East Meets West (Podcast)|East Meets West]], also featured on TWiT Live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.subbrilliant.com/emw |title=East Meets West |website=subbrilliant.com |host=[[Roger Chang]] and Tom Merritt |date=October 21, 2007 |accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tech News Today'' launched on June 1, 2010. Merritt was a regular host along with Sarah Lane, Iyaz Akhtar and Jason Howell.

Upon joining TWiT.tv, Merritt brought with him two shows previously produced by cartoonist [[Scott Johnson (cartoonist)|Scott Johnson]]'s Frogpants Studios. Originally started on July 7, 2009, "Fourcast" featured Merritt and Johnson inviting various guests to discuss the future and what it might contain in a so-called virtual fireside setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.fourcastpodcast.com/ |title=FourCast |website=fourcastpodcast.com |host=Scott Johnson and Tom Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, "Current Geek Weekly" is a weekly discussion of geek culture stories and the companion podcast to the Current Geek podcasts still produced by Frogpants Studios.  Merritt still appeared on the Frogpants Network for a segment called "Tom's Tech Time" on Wednesdays on the [[Scott Johnson (cartoonist)|Scott Johnson]]/[[Brian Ibbott]]-hosted podcast ''The Morning Stream''.

On November 10, 2010, Merritt officially launched his second new show on TWiT, FrameRate. Focusing on video in its many and varied forms (television, film, internet), Merritt co-hosted the show with magician and NSFW podcast host [[Brian Brushwood]].

On January 20, 2011, TWiT officially launched "Triangulation", a new show Merritt co-hosting with Leo Laporte and interviewing a notable figure in technology. In July 2012 he stopped hosting the show because he "wanted to work on other projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://twit.tv/tri |title=Triangulation |website=TWiT.tv |host=Leo Laporte and Tom Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these regular shows, Merritt hosted live breaking news coverage of major technology events on TWiT Live such as [[WWDC]], [[Google I/O]], and the resignation and passing of [[Steve Jobs]]. These are later released as "TWiT Live Specials" podcasts.  He has acted as a relief host for Laporte on TWiT, Windows Weekly, Security Now and other shows when Laporte has been unavailable.

On October 22, 2012, Merritt announced that he would be moving to Los Angeles to accommodate his wife's new employment at YouTube, but would still continue to present on the TWiT network over Skype.

On December 5, 2013, Leo Laporte announced that Merritt's contract would not be renewed. Leo stated that the decision was based on the need for an in-studio anchor for ''Tech News Today''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes at TWiT, Part 1 |url=http://twit.tv/2013/12/05/changes-twit-part-1|website=TWiT.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merritt hosted his last edition of ''Tech News Today'' on December 30, 2013.

===Other projects===
Since February 4, 2008, Merritt has hosted ''Sword &amp; Laser'', a sci-fi based book club podcast, co-hosted with his former CNET colleague, [[Veronica Belmont]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;L&gt;http://www.swordandlaser.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2010, he launched a new show for [[Revision3]], entitled ''[[Tom's Top 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revision3.com/tomstop5/tomstop5_1 |title=Tom's Top 5: Most wanted products - Tom's Top 5 |publisher=Revision3.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309060703/http://revision3.com/tomstop5/tomstop5_1 |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show counts down a new Top 5 list every week, and is released every Tuesday. Its final episode was published on November 1, 2011. He did a similar show on CNET.

Merritt has written a sci-fi novel, Boiling Point, which describes a near future United States civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Merritt |first1=Tom |title=Boiling Point |date= |publisher=Subbrilliant Media |location= |isbn=978-0-615-15790-0 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later narrated it as an audiobook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subbrilliant.com/blog/?cat=22&amp;paged=2 |title=SuBBrilliant Blog » Boiling Point |publisher=Subbrilliant.com |date=July 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he wrote another novel, United Moon Colonies, of which he posted chapters on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subbrilliant.com/blog/?cat=19&amp;paged=4 |title=SuBBrilliant Blog » UMC |publisher=Subbrilliant.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both novels were published on Lulu.com with a Creative Commons license.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Merritt appeared in two early episodes of his ''[[Frame Rate (podcast)|Frame Rate]]'' co-host [[Brian Brushwood]]'s [[Revision3]] show ''Scam School''.

On March 3, 2013, Merritt and [[Molly Wood]] began the [http://www.itsathing.me/ It's a Thing] podcast. According to the site's about page, "It’s a Thing is a show grown from the brain of Molly Wood, derived from a regular segment on the CNET podcast Gadgettes. Tom and Molly started the hit podcast “Buzz Out Loud” which they co-hosted for years after the turn of the century. They missed doing shows together, so they decided that in itself, should become a thing. Again."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In early January 2014 Merritt began co-hosting a podcast with [[Brian Brushwood]] called [http://www.cordkillers.com/blog/2014/1/6/cordkillers-ep-1-distributors-gotta-distribute Cordkillers],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cordkillers.com/blog/2014/1/6/cordkillers-ep-1-distributors-gotta-distribute&lt;/ref&gt; while also starting a beta for a new [http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com Daily Tech News Show].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/dtns-2140-my-car-has-lasers/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foxconn===
In 2012, newspapers reported calls by consumer groups to boycott [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products in response to accounts of worker suicides and dangerous working conditions at the [[Foxconn]] plant in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Paul |title=Apple hit by boycott call over worker abuses in China |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/29/apple-faces-boycott-worker-abuses |accessdate=June 23, 2014 |publisher=The Observer |date=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Curtis |first1=Sophie |title=Apple faces possible boycott over Foxconn investigation |url=http://news.techworld.com/mobile-wireless/3333686/apple-faces-possible-boycott-over-foxconn-investigation/ |accessdate=June 23, 2014 |publisher=Techworld |date=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merritt, who has followed tech news since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Host: Tom Merritt |url=http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com |website=Daily Tech News Show |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; responded by saying "Boycotts of Apple might be good to nudge Apple into doing something to improve conditions, but, you're going to have to boycott buying electronics if you really wanted to punish China. I'm not sure that that's called for, necessarily."&lt;ref name="Colanduno Interview"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Colanduno |first1=Derek |title=Skepticality #176 - A Midsummer Night's Foxconn |url=http://www.skepticality.com/midsummerfoxconn/ |website=Skepticality |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing a Forbes infographic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Worstall |first1=Tim |title=The Apple Boycott Graphically Explained |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/30/the-apple-boycott-graphically-explained/ |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |publisher=Forbes |date=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Worstall |first1=Tim |title=The Apple Boycott: People Are Spouting Nonsense About Chinese Manufacturing |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/29/the-apple-boycott-people-are-spouting-nonsense-about-chinese-manufacturing/ |accessdate=June 23, 2014 |publisher=Forbes |date=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing Foxconn with, reportedly, fewer suicides per million workers (18) than the number of suicides per million Chinese citizens (220), Merritt suggested it might be worth investigating whether the lower rate at Foxconn may be due to "the fact that people who are gainfully employed are in some way less likely to commit suicide." &lt;ref name= "Colanduno Interview" /&gt; There may be other reasons besides the working conditions at the plant for worker suicides.

Instead of boycotts, he advocated addressing the dangerous working conditions in a broader context. Comparing the conditions at Foxconn to [[History of coal mining in the United States|coal mines]] of the 1800s and early 1900s, he added, "There may be similar types of abuses going on at Foxconn, but we have those kinds of conditions arise because the conditions that the workers are in before they take the job are worse. That doesn't excuse the conditions, but you don't just want to get rid of the factory. You don't want to just get rid of the coal mine and send people back into abject poverty. What you want to do is put pressure on the coal mine or the factory or whatever to begin to change their ways and improve those conditions so that everybody wins."&lt;ref name= "Colanduno Interview" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Merritt is married to Eileen Rivera and they live in [[Los Angeles, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/acedtect/status/287076591660572672 |title=Twitter / acedtect: Traffic in San Francisco was |publisher=Twitter.com |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their dogs Sawyer and Rey (another dog, Jango, died of natural causes on January 25, 2017), and formerly lived in Marin County and Oakland.  Merritt is a fan of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[St. Louis Cardinals]].

[[File:1918 German UXOs1.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|British and Belgian officers stand beside an unexploded German shell in [[Flanders]], during the [[World War I|First World War]].]]
'''Unexploded ordnance''' ('''UXO''', sometimes abbreviated as '''UO'''), '''unexploded bombs''' ('''UXBs'''), or '''explosive remnants of war''' ('''ERW''') are [[explosive weapon]]s ([[bomb]]s, [[shell (projectile)|shells]], [[grenade]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[naval mine]]s, [[cluster munition]], etc.) that did not [[explosion|explode]] when they were employed and still pose a risk of [[detonation]], sometimes many decades after they were used or discarded. UXO does not always originate from wars; areas such as military training grounds can also hold significant numbers, even after the area has been abandoned. UXO from World War I continue to be a hazard, with poisonous gas filled munitions still a problem. When unwanted munitions are found, they are sometimes destroyed in controlled explosions, but accidental detonation of even very old explosives also occurs, sometimes with fatal results.

Seventy-eight countries are contaminated by land mines, which kill 15–20,000 people every year while severely maiming countless more. Approximately 80% of casualties are civilian, with children as the most affected age group. An estimated average of 50% of deaths occurs within hours of the blast. In recent years, mines have been used increasingly as weapons of terror against local civilian populations specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/demining/index.html |title=Demining |publisher= United Nations |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the obvious danger of explosion, buried UXO can cause environmental contamination. In some heavily used military training areas, munitions-related chemicals such as explosives and [[perchlorate]] (a component of pyrotechnics and rocket fuel) can enter soil and groundwater.

==Risks and problems==
Unexploded ordnance, however old, may explode. Even if it does not explode, environmental pollutants are released as it degrades. Recovery, particularly of deeply-buried projectiles, is difficult and hazardous—jarring may detonate the charge. Once recovered, explosives must either be detonated in place—sometimes requiring hundreds of homes to be evacuated—or transported safely to a site where they can be destroyed.

Unexploded ordnance from at least as far back as the [[American Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lakin |first=Matt |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local-news/history-shell-of-former-self |title=Deputies blow up Civil War ordnance found in Farragut |work=Knoxville News Sentinel |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9611/newsbriefs/civilwar.html |title=Live Civil War Ammo Found |work=Archaeology |volume=49 |issue=6 |date=November–December 1996 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24441427|title=Civil War Cannonball Explodes and Kills Virginia Relic Collector|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=5 March 2008| accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; still poses a hazard worldwide, both in current and former combat areas and on military firing ranges. A major problem with unexploded ordnance is that over the years the [[detonator]] and main charge deteriorate, frequently making them more sensitive to disturbance, and therefore more dangerous to handle. Construction work may disturb unsuspected unexploded bombs, which  may then explode. There are countless examples of people tampering with unexploded ordnance that is many years old, often with fatal results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/vietnam/121203/unexploded-mortar-shell-kills-vietnamese-children |title=Unexploded mortar shell kills Vietnamese children |publisher=GlobalPost |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/11/18/two-people-killed-in-rubbish-dump-blast |title=Two officials killed by unexploded ordnance at rubbish dump in Hasawna |work=Libya Herald |date=18 November 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128135206/http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/11/18/two-people-killed-in-rubbish-dump-blast |archivedate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/07/01/news/foreign/4-afghan-children-killed-by-unexploded-weaponry |title=4 Afghan children killed by unexploded weaponry |work=Pakistan Today |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it is universally recommended that unexploded ordnance should not be touched or handled by unqualified persons. Instead, the location should be reported to the local police so that [[bomb disposal]] or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) professionals can render it safe.

Although professional EOD personnel have expert knowledge, skills and equipment, they are not immune to misfortune because of the inherent dangers: in June 2010, construction  workers in [[Göttingen, Germany]] discovered an Allied {{convert|500|kg|lb|adj=on}} bomb dating from [[World War II]] buried approximately {{convert|7|m|ft}} below the ground. German EOD experts were notified and attended the scene. Whilst residents living nearby were being evacuated and the EOD personnel were preparing to disarm the bomb, it [[detonated]], killing three of them and severely injuring 6 others. The dead and injured each had over 20 years of hands-on experience, and had previously rendered safe between 600 and 700 unexploded bombs. The bomb which killed and injured the EOD personnel was of a particularly dangerous type because it was fitted with a delayed-action chemical [[fuze]] (with an integral [[anti-handling device]]) which had not operated as designed, but had become highly unstable after over 65 years underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,698245,00.html |title=Routine Disposal Goes Wrong: Three Killed in Explosion of World War II Bomb in Germany |work=Der Spiegel |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10212890.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=WWII bomb kills three in Germany | date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/7795709/Three-dead-as-Second-World-War-bomb-explodes-in-Germany.html|title=Three dead as Second World War bomb explodes in Germany|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 June 2010| accessdate=10 September 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/178648/Bomb-kills-German-explosive-experts/ |title=Bomb kills German explosive experts |work=Daily Express |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of delayed-action fuze in the Göttingen bomb was commonly used: a glass vial containing [[acetone]] was smashed after the bomb was released; the acetone was intended, as it dripped downwards, to disintegrate [[celluloid]] discs holding back a spring-loaded trigger that would strike a detonator when the discs degraded sufficiently after some minutes or hours. These bombs, when striking soft earth at an angle, often ended their trajectory not pointing downwards, so that the acetone did not drip onto and weaken the celluloid; but over many years the discs degraded until the trigger was released and the bomb detonated spontaneously, or when weakened by being jarred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/seventy-years-world-war-two-thousands-tons-unexploded-bombs-germany-180957680/ |title=There Are Still Thousands of Tons of Unexploded Bombs in Germany, Left Over From World War II |website=Smithsonian Magazine|date=January 2016 |author= Adam Higginbotham|accessdate= 23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 four [[US Marines]] were killed by an explosion whilst clearing unexploded ordnance from a firing range at [[Camp Pendleton]]. The exact cause is not known, but the Marines had been handing grenades they were collecting to each other, which is permitted but discouraged, and it is thought that a grenade may have exploded after being kicked or bumped, setting off hundreds of other grenades and shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-four-marines-killed-training-20140305-story.html |title=2 relieved of command for blast that killed 4 Camp Pendleton Marines|newspaper=LA Times|date=6 March 2014|author=Tony Perry|accessdate= 15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dramatic example of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) threat is the wreck of the [[SS Richard Montgomery|SS ''Richard Montgomery'']], sunk in shallow water about {{Convert|1.5|miles}} from the town of [[Sheerness]] and {{Convert|5|miles}} from [[Southend]], which still contains 1,400 tons of explosives. When the deeper World War II wreck of the ''Kielce'', carrying a much smaller load of explosives,  exploded in 1967, it produced an earth tremor measuring 4.5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].

[[North Africa]], and in particular the desert areas of [[The Sahara]], is heavily mined and with serious consequences for the local population. Egypt is the most heavily mined country in the world (by number) with as much as 19.7 million mines as of 2000.

Land mines and other explosive remnants of war are not limited to North Africa, however; they pose a persistent threat to local people all over the continent, including the countries of Ethiopia, Somalia, Nigeria, Senegal, Angola, Kenya, Uganda and South Africa to mention just a few. In the Tropics, typhoons and floods often displace and spread landmines, further aggravating the problem. In [[Mozambique]], as much as 70% of the country is now contaminated with mines because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/rpt/walkearth/2001/6939.htm |title=Africa – To Walk the Earth in Safety: The United States Commitment to Humanitarian Demining |author=Bureau of Political-Military Affairs |publisher=U.

====Colombia====
During the long [[Colombian conflict]] that began around 1964, a very large number of landmines were deployed in rural areas across Colombia. The landmines are homemade and were placed primarily during the last 25 years of the conflict, hindering rural development significantly. The rebel groups of [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] and the smaller [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] are usually blamed for having placed the mines. All [[departments of Colombia]] are affected, but [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], where the city of Medellin is located, holds the largest amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/a-legacy-of-landmines-in-colombia/?mcubz=0 |title=A Legacy of Land Mines in Colombia |author=Evelyn Nieves |publisher=The New Yorks Time |date=28 October 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Afghanistan, Colombia has the second-highest number of landmine casualties, with more than 11,500 people killed or injured by landmines since 1990, according to Colombian government figures.&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-aims-rid-country-landmines-by-year-twenty-twenty-one/3724700.html |title=Colombia Aims to Rid Country of Landmines by 2021 |author=Reuters |publisher=VOA News |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[Colombian peace process]] began officially in Havana and in August 2016, the US and Norway initiated an international five-year demining program, now supported by another 24 countries. Both the Colombian military and FARC are taking part in the demining efforts. The program intends to rid Colombia of landmines and other UXO by 2021 and it has been funded with nearly US$112 million, including US$30 million from the US (as part of the larger US foreign policy [[Plan Colombia]]) and US$9.4 million from the [[EU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Colombia-Aims-to-Be-Landmine-Free-in-Just-5-Years-20160801-0017.html |title=Colombia Aims to Be Landmine-Free in Just 5 Years |publisher=teleSUR |date=1 August 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts however, have estimated that it will take at least a decade due to the difficult terrain.&lt;ref name=VOA /&gt;

====United States====
While, unlike many countries in Europe and Asia, the United States has not been subjected to aerial bombardment, according to the Department of Defense, "millions of acres" may contain UXO,  Discarded Military Munitions (DMM) and Munitions Constituents (e.g., explosive compounds).&lt;ref name=mmrp&gt;[https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/Library/Cleanup/CleanupOfc/index.html Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol (MRSPP) Primer]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} US Dept. of Defense, Office of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP), 230pp (16&amp;nbsp;MB) April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] documents released in late 2002, UXO at 16,000 domestic inactive military ranges within the United States pose an "imminent and substantial" public health risk and could require the largest environmental cleanup ever, at a cost of at least US$14&amp;nbsp;[[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]]. Some individual ranges cover {{convert|500|sqmi|km2|-2}}, and, taken together, the ranges comprise an area the size of [[Florida]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

UXO on US military bases has caused problems for transferring and restoring [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) land. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s efforts to commercialize former munitions testing grounds are complicated by UXO, making investments and development risky.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

UXO cleanup in the US involves over {{convert|10|e6acre|km2}} of land and 1,400 different sites. Estimated cleanup costs are tens of billions of dollars. It costs roughly $1,000 to demolish a UXO on site. Other costs include surveying and mapping, removing vegetation from the site, transportation, and personnel to manually detect UXOs with metal detectors. Searching for UXOs is tedious work and often 100 holes are dug to every 1 UXO found. Other methods of finding UXOs include digital geophysics detection with land and airborne systems.&lt;ref name="acq.osd.mil"&gt;[https://www.denix.osd.mil/mmrp/upload/uxo.pdf Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Unexploded Ordnance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053308/https://www.denix.osd.mil/mmrp/upload/uxo.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, 150pp (4.5MB) December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Examples=====
In December 2007, UXO was discovered in new development areas outside [[Orlando, Florida]], and construction had to be halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.local6.com/news/14793135/detail.html |title=Construction Halted After Buried Bombs Found |work=Click Orlando |publisher=WKMG |date=6 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515200944/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/14793135/detail.html |archivedate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas nearby are also affected; for example boaters avoid the [[Indian River Lagoon]], which contains UXO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/sitedata1.cfm?siteno=1714 |title=UXO Site-Specific Data |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought to be left from live bombing runs performed during [[World War II]] by pilots from nearby [[DeLand Naval Air Station]].

[[Plum Tree Island National Wildlife Refuge]] in [[Poquoson, Virginia]] was heavily used as a bombing range by pilots from nearby [[Langley Air Force Base]] from 1917 through the 1950s.  The {{convert|3276|acre|ha|adj=on}} former bombing range was transferred to the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] in 1972. Air Force records show that {{convert|300000|lb|ST t}} of various-sized bombs were dropped in just one exercise in December 1938. Because the area is alternately marshy or sandy, many of the bombs didn't explode and instead were partly or completely buried in the mud and sand or lie in the surf just offshore. In 1958 three teenage boys who landed their boat on the island were seriously injured when a {{convert|25|lb|kg|adj=on}} practice bomb exploded. As of 2007 the US military had not removed a single bomb from the Island. The island is adjacent to the Poquoson Flats, a popular destination for fishermen and recreational boaters. Some signs that have been placed offshore to warn boaters of the hidden danger posed by the UXO in the surf or buried beneath the idyllic-looking sand beach and salt marsh have been blown down by storms and have not been replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-plumtreejun04-story.html|title=Bombs on Plum Tree Island|first=JOHN M.R.|last=BULL|website=Dailypress.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], the cleanup of the UXO on Plumtree Island could take years and cost tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pilotonline.com/news/military/bomb-cleanup-on-plum-tree-island-refuge-could-take-years/article_0718c686-cc27-5f45-9122-c1a6eb03ace5.html|title=Bomb cleanup on Plum Tree Island refuge could take years|first=Diane|last=Tennant|website=Pilotonline.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], the US Chemical Corps was established at [[American University]], based in the University's McKinley Building. After the war, many toxic chemicals and weaponry were buried in or around the Northwest DC community where the university is located. Excavations in the area were carried out after significant discoveries were made in 2010.&lt;ref name="The Eagle Online: 1919 Army Operations Leave Behind Toxic Reminders of War"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carignan|first=Sylvia|url=http://www.theeagleonline.com/news/story/1919-army-operations-leave-behind-toxic-reminders-of-war/ |title=1919: Army operations leave behind toxic reminders of war |work=The Eagle |publisher=American University|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although comparatively rare, unexploded ordnance from the [[American Civil War]] is still occasionally found and is still deadly 150 years later. Union and Confederate troops fired an estimated 1.5 million artillery shells and explosive cannonballs at each other from 1861 to 1865. As many as one in five did not explode.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/05/02/virginia-man-killed-in-civil-war-cannonball-blast.html|title=Virginia Man Killed In Civil War Cannonball Blast|date=2 May 2008|website=Foxnews.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, during the restoration of [[Weston Manor]], an 18th-century plantation house in [[Hopewell, Virginia]] that was shelled by Union gunboats during the Civil War, a live cannonball was found embedded in the dining room ceiling. The ball was disarmed and is shown to visitors to the plantation. In 1999, a Civil War cannonball fell from a large tree in the yard of country music singer [[Jimmy Dean]]'s home overlooking the James River, where it had been lodged since the battle of [[Chaffin's Bluff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19991201&amp;id=Hi4jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=088EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6829,21042&amp;hl=en|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2008, a {{convert|44|lb|kg|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on}} mortar shell was uncovered at the [[Petersburg National Battlefield]], the site of a 292-day siege. The shell was taken to the city landfill where it was safely detonated by ordnance disposal experts.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com" /&gt; Also in 2008, Civil War enthusiast Sam White was killed when a {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|75|lb|kg|adj=on}} naval cannonball he was attempting to disarm in the driveway of his home in a [[Richmond, Virginia]] suburb exploded. The explosion sent a chunk of shrapnel crashing into a house {{convert|1/4|mi|m|spell=in}} away.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com" /&gt;

===Asia===
====Japan====
Thousands of tons of UXOs remain buried across Japan, particularly in [[Okinawa]], where over 200,000 tons of ordnance were dropped during the final year of the Second World War. From 1945 until the end of the U.S. occupation of the island in 1972, the JSDF and US military disposed of 5,500 tons of UXO. Over 30,000 UXO disposal operations have been conducted on Okinawa by the JSDF since 1972, and it is estimated it could take close to a century to dispose of the remaining UXOs on the islands. No injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of UXO disposal, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=David|last2=Sumida|first2=Chiyomi|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/more-unexploded-wwii-ordnance-disposed-of-on-okinawa-1.86130|title=More unexploded WWII ordnance disposed of on Okinawa|work=Stars and Stripes|date=13 December 2008|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo]] and other major cities, including [[Kobe]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Fukuoka]], were targeted by several massive air raids during the Second World War, which left behind numerous UXOs. Shells from Imperial Army and Navy guns also continue to be discovered.

On 29 October 2012, an unexploded {{convert|250|kg|lb|adj=on}} US bomb with a functioning detonator was discovered near a runway at [[Sendai Airport]] during reconstruction following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], resulting in the airport being closed and all flights cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201210300022|title=Sendai airport closed after WWII bomb found|work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun|agency=Associated Press|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=2 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224011809/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201210300022|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport reopened the next day after the bomb was safely contained, but closed again on 14 November while the bomb was defused and safely removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westlake|first=Adam|url=http://japandailypress.com/unexploded-wwii-bomb-removed-from-sendai-airport-for-disposal-1418365/|title=Unexploded WWII bomb removed from Sendai Airport for disposal|work=The Japan Daily Press|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224013246/http://japandailypress.com/unexploded-wwii-bomb-removed-from-sendai-airport-for-disposal-1418365/|archive-date=24 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, an unexploded Imperial Army [[anti-aircraft]] shell measuring {{convert|40|cm|in}} long was discovered at a construction site in Tokyo's North Ward, close to the Kaminakazato Station on the JR [[Keihin Tohoku Line]].

An estimated 30% of these munitions did not detonate. Ten of the 18 Laotian provinces have been described as "severely contaminated" with artillery and mortar shells, mines, rockets, grenades, and other devices from various countries of origin. These munitions pose a continuing obstacle to agriculture and a special threat to children, who are attracted by the toylike devices. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Some 288 million cluster munitions and about 75 million unexploded bombs were left across Laos after the war ended.  From 1996–2009, more than 1 million items of UXO were destroyed, freeing up 23,000 hectares of land.

{{See also|Landmines in Israel}}
[[Western Asia]], including the [[Middle East]] and border states towards Russia, is severely affected by UXO, in particular land mines. Not only are civilians killed and maimed regularly, it also impedes economic growth and development by restricting the use of natural resources and farmland.

=====Iraq=====
[[File:Irakian corroded shell.jpg|right|thumb|Extremely corroded Iraqi [[artillery]] shell dating from the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. Live and dangerous.]]
Iraq is widely contaminated with unexploded remnants of war from the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–88), the [[Gulf War]] (1990–91), the [[Iraq War]] (2003–11) and lately the ongoing [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraq Civil War]]. The UXO in Iraq poses a particularly serious threat to civilians as millions of [[cluster bomb]] munitions were dropped in towns and densely populated areas by the US and British air forces, mostly in the first few weeks of the invasion in 2003. An estimated 30% of the munitions failed to detonate on impact and small unexploded bombs are regularly found in and around homes in Iraq, frequently maiming or killing civilians and restricting land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-31/devastating-legacy-unexploded-us-ordnance-iraq |title=The devastating legacy of unexploded US ordnance in Iraq |publisher=[[Public Radio International]] (PRI)|date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 2009, an estimated 8,000 people were killed by cluster bomblets alone, 2,000 of which were children. Land mines are another part of the UXO problem in Iraq as they litter large areas of farmland and many oil fields, severely affecting economic recovery and development.&lt;ref name=IraqLandmine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2009/04/06/landmine-clearance-critical-to-boost-iraqi-economy.html |title=Landmine clearance critical to boost Iraqi economy |publisher=UNDP|date=Apr 6, 2009 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting and monitoring is lacking in Iraq and no completely reliable survey and overview of the local threat levels exists. Useful statistics on injuries and deaths caused by UXO is also missing, only singular local reports exist. [[UNDP]] and [[UNICEF]] however, issued a partial survey report in 2009, concluding that the entire country is contaminated and more than 1.6 million Iraqis are affected by UXO. More than 1,730 km2 (670 square miles) in total are saturated with unexploded ordnance (including land mines). The south-east region and Baghdad are the most heavily contaminated areas and UNDP has designated around 4,000 communities as "hazard areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/8EB360688B867BBC492575E60022B140-Full_Report.pdf |title=Overview of landmines and explosive remnants of war in Iraq |publisher=UNDP and UNICEF|date=June 2009|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1470:landmines-and-unexploded-ordnances-factsheet-in-iraq&amp;Itemid=626&amp;lang=en |title=Landmines and Unexploded Ordnances Factsheet in Iraq |publisher=United Nations Iraq |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IraqLandmine /&gt;

===Europe===
{{See also|World War II bomb disposal in Europe|Land mine situation in Chechnya}}
Despite massive demining efforts, Europe is still affected to some extent by UXO from mainly World War I and World War II, some countries more than others. However, newer and present military conflicts are also affecting some areas severely, in particular the countries of former Yugoslavia in western Balkans and Ukraine.

====The Balkans====

As a legacy of the [[Civil war in Yugoslavia]] (1991–2001), [[Albania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?url=lm/2002/albania.html |title=albania |publisher=Landmine &amp; Cluster Munition Monitor |date= |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2011/02/16/albanians-stranded-by-landmines-to-restart-lives-.html |title=Albanians stranded by landmines to restart lives |publisher=UNDP |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Kosovo]] are all affected badly by UXO, mostly land mines.

====France and Belgium====
In the [[Ardennes]] region of France, large-scale citizen evacuations were necessary during MEC removal operations in 2001. In the forests of [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]] French government "''démineurs''" working for the ''Département du Déminage'' still hunt for poisonous, volatile, and/or explosive munitions and recover about 900 tons every year. The most feared are corroded artillery shells containing [[chemical warfare]] agents such as [[mustard gas]]. French and Flemish farmers still find many UXOs when ploughing their fields, the so-called "[[iron harvest]]".

In Belgium, Dovo, the country's bomb disposal unit, recovers between 150 and 200 tons of unexploded bombs each year.  Over 20 members of the unit have been killed since it was formed in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26663643?ocid |title=Behind the scenes with Belgium's bomb disposal unit |publisher=BBC |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Munich bomb.ogv|thumb|Video of the 2012 detonation in Munich]]
Germany has a specialized unit for defusing bombs called ({{lang-de|Kampfmittelbeseitigungsdienst}} (''KMBD''), ''Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service''). It is considered one of the busiest worldwide as it deactivates a bomb every two weeks.&lt;ref name="Frankfurt WW2 bomb defused"/&gt;

Thousands of UXOs from the Second World War are still uncovered each year in Germany. The daily average is 15, most of them aerial bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,801397,00.html |title=Luftmine bei Koblenz: Killer im Schlick  |work=Der Spiegel |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentration is especially high in [[Berlin]], where many [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shells]] and smaller munitions from the [[Battle of Berlin]] are uncovered each year. While most cases only make local news, one of the more spectacular finds in recent history was an American 500-pound aerial bomb discovered in [[Munich]] on 28 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/29/munich-war-bomb-video |title=Munich police detonates second world war bomb – video |work=The Guardian |date= 29 August 2012|accessdate=20 July 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was deemed too unsafe for transport, it had to be exploded in situ, shattering windows over a wide area of [[Schwabing]] and causing structural damage to several homes despite precautions to minimize damage.

One of the largest individual pieces ever found was an unexploded [[Tallboy (bomb)|'Tallboy' bomb]] uncovered in the [[Sorpe Dam]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=w.e. |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/archiv/pdf.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchiv.abendblatt.de%2Fha%2F1959%2Fpdf%2F19590106.pdf%2FASV_HAB_19590106_HA_012.pdf |title=Der größte Blindgänger wird heute entschärft |publisher=abendblatt.de |accessdate=8 July 2014 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714154212/http://www.abendblatt.de/archiv/pdf.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchiv.abendblatt.de%2Fha%2F1959%2Fpdf%2F19590106.pdf%2FASV_HAB_19590106_HA_012.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, a 1.8-tonne RAF bomb from the Second World War was uncovered in [[Koblenz]] on the bottom of the [[Rhine]] River after a prolonged drought. It caused the evacuation of 45,000 people from the city and was then called "the biggest bomb-related evacuation in Germany's post-war history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16018659 "Koblenz evacuated for WWII bomb removal from Rhine"], BBC, 3 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Some 20,000 people had to leave their homes in [[Cologne]] in order to defuse a one-tonne bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32897388 |title=Germany WW2 bomb find prompts Cologne's biggest evacuation |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 September 2017|format=|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2017, a British [[Blockbuster bomb|HC 4000 bomb]] was discovered during construction work near the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]] in [[Frankfurt]], requiring the evacuation of approximately 65,000 people within a radius of 1.5&amp;nbsp;km.

====Spain====
Since the 1980s, more than 750,000 pieces of UXO from to the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-1939) has been recovered and destroyed by the [[Guardia Civil]] in Spain. In the 2010s, around 1,000 bombs, artillery shells and grenades have been defused every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Las últimas bombas de la Guerra Civil|url=http://www.abc.es/espana/20131019/abci-bombas-guerra-civil-201310191714.html |language=Spanish |publisher=ABC España}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ukraine====
Ukraine is contaminated with UXO from WW I, WW II, former Soviet military training and the current [[Ukraine Crisis]], including the [[War in Donbass]]. Most of the UXO from the world wars has presumably been removed by demining efforts in the mid 1970s, but sporadic remnants may remain in unknown locations. The UXO from the recent military conflicts includes both landmines and cluster bomblets dropped and set by both Ukrainian, anti-government and Russian forces. Reports of [[booby traps]] harming civilians also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/ukraine-lasting-impact-landmines-civilians-161117114427487.html |title=Ukraine: The lasting impact of landmines on civilians |publisher=Aljazeera |date=5 December 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine reports that [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]] are the regions mostly affected by unexploded submunitions.

====United Kingdom====
[[File:1918 German UXOs2.JPG|thumb|A British [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] prepares to dispose of an unexploded bomb during the [[World War I|First World War]].]]
UXO is standard terminology in the United Kingdom, although in [[artillery]], especially on practice ranges, an unexploded shell is referred to as a ''blind'', and during [[the Blitz]] in [[World War II]] an unexploded bomb was referred to as a ''UXB''.

Most current UXO risk is limited to areas in cities, mainly [[London]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Portsmouth]], that were heavily bombed during the Blitz, and to land used by the [[British Armed Forces|military]] to store ammunition and for training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssrichardmontgomery.com/British%20textbook%20of%20Explosives%20.pdf|format=PDF|title=British textbook of Explosives (Technical reference book, not Instruction manual)|website=Ssrichardmontgomery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Construction Industry Research and Information Association ([[CIRIA]]), from 2006 to 2009 over 15,000 items of ordnance were found in construction sites in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciria.org/service/press_releases/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?Section=press_releases&amp;NoTemplate=1&amp;ContentID=13430|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419030120/http://www.ciria.org/service/press_releases/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?Section=press_releases&amp;NoTemplate=1&amp;ContentID=13430|deadurl=yes|title=Object reference not set to an instance of an object.|date=19 April 2013|archivedate=19 April 2013|website=Archive.is|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for many homes to be evacuated temporarily when a bomb is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-39924766 |title=Unexploded bomb shuts Aston Expressway|website=BBC News |date=15 May 2017  |author= |accessdate= 15 May 2017}} A typical example of UXB evacuation, a 500lb bomb in Birmingham.&lt;/ref&gt; 1,000 residents were evacuated in Plymouth in April 2007 when a Second World War bomb was discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/6524353.stm "Residents back after bomb found,"] ''BBC News'', 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2008 a 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg bomb was found in Bow in East London.

The burden of Explosive Ordnance Disposal in the UK is split between [[Royal Engineers]] Bomb Disposal Officers, [[Royal Logistic Corps]] [[Ammunition Technicians]] in the [[Army]], Clearance Divers of the [[Royal Navy]] and the Armourers of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The [[Metropolitan Police]] of London is the only force not to rely on the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], although they generally focus on contemporary [[terrorist]] devices rather than unexploded ordnance and will often call [[military]] teams in to deal with larger and historical bombs.

Buried and abandoned aerial and mortar bombs, artillery shells, and other unexploded ordnance from World War II have threatened communities across the islands of the South Pacific. {{as of |2014}} the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement in the U.S. Department of State's [[Bureau of Political-Military Affairs]] invested more than $5.6 million in support of conventional weapons destruction programs in the Pacific Islands.&lt;ref name=DOS&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pacific Islands: U.S. Conventional Weapons Destruction Programs Reduce Threats from World War II-era Munitions|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/12/235367.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the battlefield of [[Peleliu Island]] in the [[Republic of Palau]] UXO removal made the island safe for tourism.
At Hell's Point [[Guadalcanal Province]] in the [[Solomon Islands]] an explosive ordnance disposal training program was established which safely disposed of hundreds of items of UXO. It trained police personnel to respond to EOD call-outs in the island's highly populated areas.
On [[Mili Atoll]] and [[Maloelap Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] removal of UXO has allowed for population expansion into formerly inaccessible areas.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;

==In international law==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
[[Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War|Protocol V]] of the [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] requires that when active hostilities have ended the parties must clear the areas under their control from "explosive remnants of war". Land mines are covered similarly by [[Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices|Protocol II]].

==Detection technology==
Many weapons, including aerial bombs in particular, are discovered during construction work, after lying undetected for decades. Having failed to explode while resting undiscovered is no guarantee that a bomb will not explode when disturbed. Such discoveries are common in heavily bombed cities, without a serious enough threat to warrant systematic searching.

Where there is known to be much unexploded ordnance, in cases of unexploded subsoil ordnance a remote investigation is done by visual interpretation of available historical aerial photographs. Modern techniques can combine geophysical and survey methods with modern electromagnetic and magnetic detectors.  This provides digital mapping of UXO contamination with the aim to better target subsequent excavations, reducing the cost of digging on every metallic contact and speeding the clearance process. [[Magnetometer]] probes can detect UXO and provide geotechnical data before drilling or piling is carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geosoft.com/resources/casestudies/index.asp#uxo|title=Success Stories|publisher=Geosoft|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serdp.org/|title=Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, Environmental Security Technology Certification Program|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Defense programs fund research into the detection and discrimination of UXO from scrap metal. Much of the cost of UXO removal comes from removing non-explosive items that the metal detectors have identified, so improved discrimination is critical. New techniques such as shape reconstruction from magnetic data and better de-noising techniques will reduce cleanup costs and enhance recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serdp.org/Program-Areas/Munitions-Response/Land|title=Land|publisher=Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, Environmental Security Technology Certification Program|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109220603/http://www.serdp.org/Program-Areas/Munitions-Response/Land|archivedate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Interstate Technology &amp; Regulatory Council published a Geophysical Classification for Munitions Response guidance document in August 2015.&lt;ref name=itrc&gt;{{cite web|title=Geophysical Classification for Munitions Response Fact Sheets (GCMR-1)|url=http://itrcweb.org/GuidanceDocuments/GCMR-1.pdf|publisher=Interstate Technology &amp; Regulatory Council|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UXO or UXBs (as they are called in some countries – unexploded bombs) are broadly classified into buried and unburied. The disposal team carries out reconnaissance of the area and determines the location of the ordnance. If is not buried it may be dug up carefully and disposed of. But if the bomb is buried it becomes a huge task. A team is formed to find the location of the bomb using metal detectors and then the earth is dug carefully.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">There are a number of different '''waste treatment technologies''' for the disposal, [[recycling]], [[Waste storage|storage]], or [[energy recovery]] from different [[waste types]]. Each type has its own associated methods of waste Management

==Landfill==
{{Main|Landfill}}
[[Municipal solid waste]] consists mainly of household and commercial waste which is disposed of by or on behalf of a local authority. Landfills waste are categorized by either being hazardous, non-hazardous or inert waste. In order for a landfill design to be considered it must abide by the following requirements: final landforms profile, site capacity, settlement, waste density, materials requirements and drainage.

== Incineration ==
{{Main|Waste incineration}}
The advantages of the incineration are reduction of volume and mass by burning, reduction to a percentage of sterile ash, source of energy, increase of income by selling bottom ash, and is also environmentally acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;
The disadvantages of incineration are the following:&lt;ref name="Waste Treatment and Disposal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Waste Treatment and Disposal|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-0-470-84912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* higher cost and longer payback period due to high capital investment
* since incineration is design on the basis of a certain calorific value removing paper and plastics for recycling lowers the overall calorific value that may affect the incinerator performance&lt;ref name="Waste Treatment and Disposal" /&gt;
* the process still produces a solid waste residue at the end which still requires treatment and management&lt;ref name="Waste Treatment and Disposal" /&gt;
Emissions from incinerators consist of particulates, heavy metals, pollutant gases, odor dust and litter. Due to incomplete combustion, products such as [[dioxin]]s and [[furan]]s are formed.

==Bioremediation==
{{globalize|date=December 2014}}
The human sewage and the process waste from the manufacturing industries are the two major sources of the waste water. In Thailand, the total volume of the wastewater from  industries is much greater than that of the domestic sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chokewinyoo|first1=Pariyada|last2=Khanayai|first2=Pornsiri|title=Wastewater Production, Treatment, and Use in Thailand|url=http://www.ais.unwater.org/ais/pluginfile.php/501/mod_page/content/83/report_thailand.pdf|publisher=5th Regional Workshop on Safe Use of Wastewater in Agriculture Bali, Indonesia|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an effective method is needed.  Microbial remediation of xenobiotics has shown to be effective and the low cost technology, but it still has several limitations.  Consequently, the genetic engineering approaches are used to create the new strain of microbes (Genetically engineered microorganisms, GEMS) which have better catabolic potential than the wild type species for bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wrobleski|first1=Christopher M|title=Bioremediation and Genetic Modification|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/seminar/2004/grp3/GM%20Bioremediation.doc|publisher=Department of Biological Sciences, Davidson College|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four major approaches to GEM development for the bioremediation application which include the modification of enzyme specificity and affinity, pathway construction and regulation, bioprocess development, monitoring and control and lastly, bio-affinity bio-receptor sensor application for chemical sensing, toxicity reduction and end point analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EASTER|first1=JAMES|last2=SAYLER|first2=GARY|title=21 Genetically Engineered Microorganisms and Bioremediation|url=http://www.envismadrasuniv.org/pdf/Genetically%20Engineered%20Microorganisms.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allow the extensive use of genetically engineered microorganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Nilanjana|last2=Chandran|first2=Preethy|title=Microbial Degradation of Petroleum Hydrocarbon Contaminants: An Overview|journal=Biotechnology Research International|volume=2011|page=13|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/btri/2011/941810/|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the far future, the genetically engineered microorganisms could possibly be used to control the green house gases, convert the waste to the value-added product as well as to reduce and capture the carbon dioxide gases from the atmosphere (carbon sequestration),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is CO2 Sequestration?|url=http://www.undeerc.org/pcor/sequestration/whatissequestration.aspx|publisher=Plain CO2 Reduction Partnership|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lots of research still need to be done in order to make these potential become true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sayler|first1=Gary|last2=Ripp|first2=Steven|title=Field applications of genetically engineered microorganisms for bioremediation processes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Ripp/publication/12467700_Field_applications_of_genetically_engineered_microorganisms_for_bioremediation_processes/links/09e415093b296423a7000000|publisher=Center for Environmental Biotechnology, University of Tennessee|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a concern regarding the use of genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of pollutants. Once the genetically microorganisms has been added, it may disperse uncontrollably and hard to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papinazath|first1=Taniya|last2=Sasikumar|first2=C.Sheela|title=ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT:- BIOREMEDIATION OF POLLUTED ENVIRONMENT|url=http://www.yorku.ca/bunchmj/ICEH/proceedings/Sasikumar_CS_ICEH_papers_465to469.pdf|publisher=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Environment and Health, Chennai, India|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the serious major
concern that leads to the limitation of GEMs development seem to be the lack of information on gene as well as the regulatory constraints.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4628">'''Wet stacking''' is a condition in [[diesel engine]]s in which unburned fuel passes on into the [[exhaust system]].&lt;ref&gt; Burl Donaldson, Patent Assigned to New Mexico State University Technology, Feb 1, 2005, Patent	US6848419 &lt;blockquote&gt;
In order to avoid failures from either type of wetstacking, the conventional advice is that the engine should never be operated for extended periods of time at less than half-load. In order to assure that the engine operates at a load of at least 50%, artificial loads are sometimes applied... Wetstacking also occurs when solid carbon or nonvolatile liquids accumulate along the cylinder wall or in the piston ring grooves and inhibit expansion and sealing of the ring against the cylinder wall. The cylinder can become glazed which further contributes to poor charge air compression heating and poor combustion of fuel. The performance of the engine continues to deteriorate until charge air compression heating is no longer sufficient for the engine to operate. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The word "stacking" comes from the term "stack" for [[exhaust pipe]] or [[chimney stack]]. The oily exhaust pipe is therefore a "wet stack".

This condition can have several causes. The most common cause is idling the engine for long intervals, which does not generate enough heat in the cylinder for a complete burn. "Idling" may be running at full rated operating speed, but with very little load applied.  Another is excessive fueling. That may be caused by weak or leaky injectors, fuel settings turned up too high or overfueling for the given rpms. Cold weather running or other causes that prevent the engine from reaching proper operating temperature can cause a buildup of fuel due to incomplete burn that can result in 'wetstacking'. &lt;ref&gt; Tawanda Hove, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe, Henerica Tazvinga, Dept. of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Pretoria, South Africa. Journal of Energy in Southern Africa • Vol 23 No 4 • November 2012 &lt;blockquote&gt; It is already well known that when the diesel engine is operated for long periods at a partial load, a condition known as ‘wet-stacking’ occurs (Donaldson, 2005). This is mainly attributed to incomplete combustion of fuel when the engine runs at low operating temperature. This results in reduced fuel efficiency and, simultaneously, shortening of engine operating life, and the time interval between routine maintenance calls. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; Volt Master America, Engine Driven Generator Set Owner’s Manual, publication number 2593-CON, Revision 05/2009 &lt;blockquote&gt;
Operating the engine without an electrical load for prolonged periods of time (one hour or more) will eventually cause damage to the diesel engine (sometimes called wet stacking which is NOT covered by the engine manufacturer’s warranty) or damage to the rings, fuel oil entering the lubricating oil and excessive vibration. Breaking in the diesel engine can require 5 to 10 hours of operation. It is extremely important to have electrical loads of at least 25% to 50% of the rated capacity of the generator’s nameplate rating to have the valves properly seat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[diesel generator]]s, it is usually because the diesel engine is running at only a small percentage of its rated output.  For efficient combustion, a diesel should be run under at least 60 per cent of its rated power output.

It is detectable by the presence of a black ooze around the exhaust manifold, piping and turbocharger, if fitted. It can be mistaken for lubricating oil in some cases, but it consists of the "heavy ends" of the diesel fuel which do not burn when combustion temperature is too low. The heavier, more oily components of diesel fuel contain more stored energy than a comparable quantity of, say, gasoline, but diesel requires an adequate loading of the engine in order to keep combustion temperature high enough to make use of it. Often, one can hear a slight miss in the engine due to fuel buildup. When the engine is first placed under a load after long periods of idling and wetstacking it may blow some black exhaust out as it burns that excess fuel off. Continuous black exhaust from the stack when under a constant load is also an indication that all the fuel is not being burned.
