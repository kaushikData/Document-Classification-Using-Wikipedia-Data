'''1q21.1 deletion syndrome''' or '''1q21.1 (recurrent) microdeletion''' is a rare aberration of [[chromosome 1]].
 
A human cell has one pair of identical chromosomes on chromosome 1. With the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, one chromosome of the pair is not complete, because a part of the sequence of the chromosome is missing. One chromosome has the normal length and the other is too short.

In 1q21.1, the '1' stands for chromosome 1, the 'q' stands for the long arm of the chromosome and '21.1' stands for the part of the long arm in which the deletion is situated.

The syndrome is a form of the [[1q21.1 copy number variations]] and it is a deletion in the distal area of the 1q21.1 part. The CNV leads to a very variable [[phenotype]] and the manifestations in individuals are quite variable. Some people who have the syndrome can function in a normal way, while others have symptoms of mental retardation and various physical anomalies.

1q21.1 microdeletion is a very rare chromosomal condition. Only 46 individuals with this deletion have been reported in medical literature as of August 2011.&lt;ref name=ordr&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10813/1q211-microdeletion-syndrome/resources/1|work=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)|publisher=Office of Rare Diseases Research • U.S. National Institutes of Health|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Recognised symptoms are:
* Only one set of genes on the two chromosomes function ([[Haploinsufficiency]])
* Thrombocytopenia-absent radius ([[TAR syndrome]]), in case of a class II-deletion
* Neurological-psychiatric problems: [[Autism]]; [[schizophrenia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stefansson H, Rujescu D, Cichon S |title=Large recurrent microdeletions associated with schizophrenia |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7210 |pages=232–6 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18668039 |pmc=2687075 |doi=10.1038/nature07229 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The International Schizophrenia Consortium |title=Rare chromosomal deletions and duplications increase risk of schizophrenia |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7210 |pages=237–41 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18668038 |doi=10.1038/nature07239 |pmc=3912847}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[epilepsy]]; learning problems; cognitive disabilities — mild to moderate; developmental delay — mild to moderate (milestones like sitting, standing and walking; come at a later period in childhood); children show an ataxic gait and fall down a lot

* Eyes: [[Cataracts]]
* Heart abnormalities and cardiovascular anomalies (30% of the cases): Anomalous origin of the coronary artery&lt;ref name=clavicular/&gt; (Class II-deletion)

* Sleep disturbances

It is not clear whether the list of symptoms is complete. Very little information is known about the syndrome. The syndrome can have completely different effects on members of the same family.

A common deletion is between 1.0–1.9Mb. Mefford states that the standard for a deletion is 1.35Mb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mefford HC, Sharp AJ, Baker C |title=Recurrent rearrangements of chromosome 1q21.1 and variable pediatric phenotypes |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=16 |pages=1685–99 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18784092 |pmc=2703742 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0805384 |display-authors=etal|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:9219/ATTACHMENT01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest deletion seen on a living human is over 5 Mb.

==Cause ==
[[Meiosis]] is the process of dividing cells in humans. In meiosis, the chromosome pairs split and a representative of each pair goes to one daughter cell. In this way the number of chromosomes will be halved in each cell, while all the parts on the chromosome (genes) remain, after being randomized. Which information of the parent cell ends up in the daughter cell is purely decided by chance. Besides this random process, there is a second random process. In this second random process the DNA will be scrambled in a way that pieces are omitted ([[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]), added ([[Gene duplication|duplication]]), moved from one place to another ([[chromosomal translocation|translocation]]) and inverted ([[chromosomal inversion|inversion]]). This is a common process, which leads to about 0.4% variation in the DNA.

A problem of the second random process is that genetic mistakes can occur. Because of the deletion and duplication process, the chromosomes that come together in a new cell may be shorter or longer. The result of this spontaneous change in the structure of DNA is a so-called [[copy number variation]]. Due to the copy number variation chromosomes of different sizes can be combined in a new cell. If this occurs around conception, the result will be a first cell of a human with a genetic variation. This can be either positive or negative. In positive cases this new human will be capable of a special skill that is assessed positively, for example, in sports or science. In negative cases, you have to deal with a syndrome or a severe disability, as in this case the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome.

Based on the meiotic process, the syndrome may occur in two ways.
# a spontaneous deviation (a 'de novo' situation): two chromosomes come together of which one has a copy number variation as a result of the meiosis process.
# a parent is unknowingly the carrier of a chromosome with a copy number variation and passes it at conception to the child, with different consequences for the child.

Due to this genetic misprint, the embryo may experience problems in the development during the first months of pregnancy. Approximately 20 to 40 days after fertilization, something goes wrong in the construction of the body parts and brain, which leads to a chain reaction.&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[File:Chromosome 1 to 1q21.1.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The structure of 1q21.1]]

==Genetics==
===The structure of 1q21.1===
The structure of 1q21.1 is complex. The area has a size of approximately 6 Mega[[Base pair|base]] (Mb) (from 141.5 Mb to 147.9 Mb). Within 1q21.1 there are two areas where the CNVs can be found: the proximal area or TAR area (144.1 to 144.5) and the distal area (144.7 to 145.9). The 1q21.1 deletion syndrome will commonly be found in the distal area, but an overlap with the TAR-area is possible. 1q21.1 has multiple repetitions of the same structure (areas with the same color in the picture have equal structures) Only 25% of the structure is not duplicated. There are several gaps in the sequence. There is no further information available about the DNA-sequence in those areas up till now. The gaps represent approximately 700 Kilobase. New genes are expected in the gaps. Because the gaps are still a topic of research, it is hard to find the exact start and end markers of a deletion. The area of 1q21.1 is one of the most difficult parts of the human genome to map.

Because of the repetitions in 1q21.1, there is a larger chance of an unequal crossing-over during [[meiosis]]. CNVs occur due to [[non-allelic homologous recombination]] mediated by [[low copy repeats]] (sequentially similar regions).

===Typing===
A common deletion is restricted to the distal area. This is a Class I-deletion.

In some cases the deletion is so large that the proximal area is involved as well, the so-called Class II-deletion. There are some complex cases in which both the proximal area and the distal area are affected, while the area in between is normal. There are also some a-typical variants.

===Related genes===
Genes related to 1q21.1 deletion in the distal area are [[PDE4DIP]], [[HYDIN2]], [[PRKAB2]], [[PDIA3P]], [[FMO5]], [[CHD1L]], [[BCL9]], [[ACP6]], [[GJA5]], [[GJA8]], [[NBPF10]], [[GPR89B]], [[GPR89C]], [[PDZK1P1]] and [[NBPF11]].

==Diagnostics ==
A 'de novo'-situation appears in about 75% of the cases. In 25% of the cases, one of the parents is carrier of the syndrome, without any effect on the parent. Sometimes adults have mild problems with the syndrome. To find out whether either of the parents carries the syndrome, both parents have to be tested. In several cases, the syndrome was identified with the child, because of an autism disorder or another problem, and later it appeared that the parent was affected as well. In families where both parents have tested negative for the syndrome, chances of a second child with the syndrome are extremely low. If the syndrome was found in the family, chances of a second child with the syndrome are 50%, because the syndrome is [[autosomal dominant]]. The effect of the syndrome on the child cannot be predicted

The Syndrome can be detected with [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]].

For parents with a child with the syndrome, it is advisable to consult a physician before another pregnancy.

==Management==
Treatment of cause: Due to the genetic cause, no treatment of the cause is possible.

Treatment of manifestations: routine treatment of ophthalmologic, cardiac, and neurologic findings; speech, occupational, and physical therapies as appropriate; specialized learning programs to meet individual needs; antiepileptic drugs or antipsychotic medications as needed.
 
Surveillance: routine pediatric care; routine developmental assessments; monitoring of specific identified medical issues.
==Prevalence==
As of October 2012, Unique, an international rare chromosome disorder group and registry, has 64 genetically-confirmed cases of this deletion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chromosome 1 - 1q21.1 microdeletion|url=http://www.rarechromo.org/information/chromosome%20%201/1q21.1%20microdeletions%20ftnp.pdf|work=rarechromo.org|publisher=Unique|accessdate=9 September 2013|format=pdf|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121111025/http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome%20%201/1q21.1%20Microdeletions%20FTNP.pdf|archive-date=2010-11-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
On several locations in the world people are studying on the subject of 1q21.1 deletion syndrome. The syndrome was identified for the first time with people with heart abnormalities. The syndrome has later been found with patients with autism and schizophrenia. Research is done on patients with a symptom of the syndrome, to find more patients with the syndrome.

There may be a relation between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Literature shows that nine locations have been found on the DNA where the syndromes related to autism or schizophrenia can be found, the so-called "hotspots": 1q21.1, 3q29, 15q13.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.1, 16q21, 17p12, 21q11.2 and 21q13.3. With a number of hotspots both autism and schizophrenia were observed at that location. In other cases, either autism or schizophrenia has been seen.

Statistical research showed that schizophrenia is more common in combination with 1q21.1 deletion syndrome. On the other side, autism is significantly more common with [[1q21.1 duplication syndrome]]. Further research confirmed that the odds on a relation between schizophrenia and deletions at 1q21.1, [[3q29 microdeletion syndrome|3q29]], 15q13.3, 22q11.21 en Neurexin 1 (NRXN1) and duplications at 16p11.2 are at 7.5% or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levinson DF, Duan J, Oh S |title=Copy number variants in schizophrenia: confirmation of five previous findings and new evidence for 3q29 microdeletions and VIPR2 duplications |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=302–16 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21285140 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10060876 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21285140|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ikeda M, Aleksic B, Kirov G |title=Copy number variation in schizophrenia in the Japanese population |journal=Biol.

[[File:Relation 1q21 1.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Expected relation within 1q21.1]]

Common variations in the BCL9 gene, which is in the distal area, confer risk of schizophrenia and may also be associated with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Zhou G, Ji W |title=Common variants in the BCL9 gene conferring risk of schizophrenia |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=232–40 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21383261 |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.1 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21383261|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is done on 10–12 genes on 1q21.1 that produce [[DUF1220]]-locations. DUF1220 is an unknown [[protein]], which is active in the [[neuron]]s of the [[brain]] near the [[neocortex]]. Based on research on [[apes]] and other [[mammals]], it is assumed that DUF1220 is related to cognitive development (man: 212 locations; chimpanzee: 37 locations; monkey: 30 locations; mouse: 1 location). It appears that the DUF1220-locations on 1q21.1 are in areas that are related to the size and the development of the brain. The aspect of the size and development of the brain is related to autism ([[macrocephaly]]) and schizophrenia ([[microcephaly]]). It has been proposed that a deletion or duplication of a gene that produces DUF1220-areas might cause growth and development disorders in the brain &lt;ref&gt;e.g.: {{cite journal |vauthors=Dumas L, Sikela JM |title=DUF1220 domains, cognitive disease, and human brain evolution |journal=Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. |volume=74 |pages=375–82 |year=2009 |pmid=19850849 |pmc=2902282 |doi=10.1101/sqb.2009.74.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relation between [[macrocephaly]] with duplications and [[microcephaly]] with deletions has been seen in research on the HYDIN Paralog or HYDIN2. This part of 1q21.1 is involved in the development of the brain. It is assumed to be a dosage-sensitive gene. When this gene is not available in the 1q21.1 area, it leads to microcephaly. HYDIN2 is a recent duplication (found only in humans) of the HYDIN gene found on 16q22.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doggett NA, Xie G, Meincke LJ |title=A 360-kb interchromosomal duplication of the human HYDIN locus. |journal=Genomics |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=762–71 |date=Dec 2006 |pmid= 16938426|doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.07.012 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754306002138|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research on the genes [[CHD1L]] and [[PRKAB2]] within [[lymphoblast]] cells &lt;ref&gt;Understanding the impact of 1q21.1 Copy Number Variant; C. Harvard et al; Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2011, 6:54; {{doi|10.1186/1750-1172-6-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead to the conclusion that anomalies appear with the 1q21.1-deletionsyndrome: 
* [[CHD1L]] is an enzyme which is involved in untangling the [[chromatid]]es and the DNA repair system. With 1q21.1 deletion syndrome a disturbance occurs, which leads to increased DNA breaks. The role of CHD1L is similar to that of [[helicase]] with the [[Werner syndrome]]
* [[PRKAB2]] is involved in maintaining the energy level of cells. With 1q21.1-deletion syndrome this function was attenuated.

GJA5 has been identified as the gene that is responsible for the phenotypes observed with congenital heart diseases on the 1q21.1 location. In case of a duplication of GJA5 [[tetralogy of Fallot]] is more common. In case of a deletion other congenital heart diseases than tetralogy of Fallot are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Soemedi, R. |title=DPhenotype-Specific Effect of Chromosome 1q21.1 Rearrangements and GJA5 Duplications in 2436 Congenital Heart Disease Patients and 6760 Controls  |journal=Hum.

'''Agricultural chemistry''' is the study of both [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] which are important in agricultural [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], the processing of raw [[Product (business)|products]] into foods and beverages, and in [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. These studies emphasize the relationships between plants, [[animals]] and [[bacteria]] and their [[Natural environment|environment]].
The science of chemical compositions and changes involved in the production, protection, and use of crops and livestock. As a basic science, it embraces, in addition to test-tube chemistry, all the life processes through which humans obtain food and fiber for themselves and feed for their animals. As an applied science or technology, it is directed toward control of those processes to increase yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. One important branch of it, [[chemurgy]], is concerned chiefly with utilization of agricultural products as chemical [[raw material]]s. Etc.

==Sciences==

The goals of agricultural chemistry are to expand understanding of the causes and effects of biochemical reactions related to plant and animal growth, to reveal opportunities for controlling those reactions, and to develop chemical products that will provide the desired assistance or control. Every scientific discipline that contributes to agricultural progress depends in some way on chemistry. Hence agricultural chemistry is not a distinct discipline, but a common thread that ties together [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[entomology]], and numerous other sciences that impinge on agriculture.

Chemical materials developed to assist in the production of food, feed, and fiber include scores of [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and other [[pesticide]]s, plant growth regulators, [[fertilizer]]s, and animal feed supplements. Chief among these groups from the commercial point of view are manufactured fertilizers, synthetic pesticides (including herbicides), and supplements for feeds. The latter include both nutritional supplements (for example, [[mineral nutrients]]) and medicinal compounds for the prevention or control of disease.

Agricultural chemistry often aims at preserving or increasing the [[fertility (soil)|fertility of soil]], maintaining or improving the [[agricultural yield]], and improving the quality of the crop.

When agriculture is considered with [[ecology]], the [[sustainablility]] of an operation is considered. Modern agrochemical industry has gained a reputation for [[profit maximization|maximising profits]] while violating sustainable and ecologically viable agricultural principles. [[Eutrophication]], the prevalence of [[genetically modified crops]] and the increasing concentration of chemicals in the food chain (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]s) are only a few consequences of naive [[industrial agriculture]].

[[Image:Vitis labrusca BB-1913.png|thumb|''[[Vitis labrusca]]'']]

'''Ampelography'''  ([[Ampelos|ἄμπελος]], "vine" + γράφος, "writing") is the field of [[botany]] concerned with the identification and classification of grapevines, [[Vitis|''Vitis'' spp.]] Traditionally this has been done by comparing the shape and colour of the vine leaves and grape berries; more recently the study of vines has been revolutionised by DNA fingerprinting.

==Early history==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2016}}The grape vine is an extremely variable [[species]] and some [[:Category:Grape varieties|varieties]], such as [[Pinot noir|Pinot]], [[mutate]] particularly frequently. At the same time, the wine and table grape industries have been important since ancient times, so large sums of money can depend on the correct identification of different varieties and clones of grapevines.

The science of ampelography began seriously in the 19th century, when it became important to understand more about the different species of vine, as they had very different resistance to disease and pests such as [[phylloxera]].

Many vine identification books were published at this time, one of which is Victor Rendu's ''Ampélographie française'' of 1857, featuring hand-colored lithographs by Eugene Grobon.

==Pierre Galet==
Until the Second World War, ampelography had been an art. Then [[Pierre Galet]] of the ''École nationale supérieure agronomique de [[Montpellier]]'' made a systematic assembly of criteria for the identification of vines. The Galet system was based on the shape and contours of the leaves, the characteristics of growing shoots, shoot tips, petioles, the sex of the flowers, the shape of the grape clusters and the colour, size and pips of the grapes themselves. The grapes are less affected by environmental factors than the leaves and the shoots, but are obviously not around for as long. He even included grape flavour as a criterion, but this is rather subjective.

Galet then published the definitive book, ''Ampélographie pratique'', in 1952, featuring 9,600 types of vine. ''Ampélographie pratique'' was translated into English by Lucie Morton, published in 1979 and updated in 2000.

==''Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography''==
In 2012, Italian publisher L'Artistica Editrice published ''Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography'', a three volume set which contains the most important books edited in France and Italy between 1800 and 1900: the ''Ampélographie'' of Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel, the grapes section of ''Pomona Italiana'' by Count Giorgio Gallesio and the ''Ampelografia Italiana'' of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The book collects 551 color plates of grapes from all over the world, with texts in Italian and English, which describe the morphological and agricultural characteristics of each vine variety, as well as their synonyms and historical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infowine.com/default.asp?scheda=11209 Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography] InfoWine. Retrieved: 2012-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA==
[[Carole Meredith]] at the [[University of California, Davis]], pioneered the use of [[genetic fingerprinting]] for vine identification.  Famous successes with the technique include proving the identity of [[Zinfandel]], Primitivo, and Crljenak Kaštelanski, and identifying the parents of [[Sangiovese]] as Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. Such exercises are giving valuable insight into historical patterns of trade and migration.

DNA fingerprinting uses segments of DNA that do not affect the look or taste of the grapes.  More recent work has identified the [[gene]]s responsible for the differences between grape varieties, such as the ''VvMYBA1'' and ''VvMYBA2'' genes that control grape colour, or the ''VvGAI1'' gene that is [[mutation|mutated]] in some cells of [[Pinot Meunier]] compared to [[Pinot noir]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas.

[[Image:Anal beads.jpg|thumb|Rigid beads]]

'''Anal beads''' are a [[sex toy]] consisting of multiple spheres or balls attached together in series which are continuously inserted through the [[anus]] into the [[rectum]] and then removed with varying speeds depending on the desired effect (commonly at [[orgasm]] to enhance climax). Anal bead users enjoy the pleasurable feeling of the ball passing through the narrow [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|sphincter]] of the anus.

== Design ==
Anal beads are available in many sizes, with individual beads measuring from 25 mm in diameter to 125 mm diameter or larger. Most users enjoy beads of approximately 45 mm, but most will become more adventurous with experience, and try larger sizes.  Anal beads are commonly made of [[silicone]], [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[latex]], [[glass]] or [[metal]] and end with a ring or similar handle designed for pulling. The purpose of this ring is to prevent the beads from becoming fully lodged in the rectum, and to ease removal. The beads may either be joined flexibly, requiring individual insertion, or by a semi-rigid thin shaft, allowing anal insertion in a single motion. Both arrangements are forms of the sexual art of "beading off".

The many nerve endings of the sphincter provide arousal both during insertion and removal, and larger beads may create feelings of pressure while in the rectum.

Some anal beads are enhanced with vibration technology to enhance pleasure.

== Use ==
[[File:Illustration of anal bead use.svg|thumb|Illustration of anal bead use]]
Anal beads can be incorporated into many fetishes that involve [[anal sex]], [[Body worship|ass worship]], [[Erotic spanking|spanking]], [[enema]]s or anything involving the buttocks, anus, or the anal area.

As with all anal sexual activity, the anal beads and the rectum should be well-lubricated with a [[sexual lubricant]] intended for  anal sex.  It is important to do this as the rectum can be easily ripped, torn or injured. Anal sex toys should be well washed with warm soapy water and left to dry naturally after use.  Alternatively, they can be placed inside a [[condom]], which is recommended if they are shared with a partner.

Care must also be taken to count the beads before and after use to ensure they are all removed from the anus. String have reportedly broken during intense rectal movements.  If a bead gets stuck in the rectum and cannot be expelled naturally, medical intervention may be necessary.

== Safety ==
If the beads are threaded onto a string, which is a porous material, they cannot be fully disinfected. They should not be shared between partners without using a physical barrier such as a latex or neoprene condom to prevent the transfer of [[faeces]]. Sharing unsterilized anal toys can expose users to various [[sexually transmitted diseases]].

'''Art &amp; Language''' is a [[conceptual art|conceptual artists']] collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created in the late 1960s. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art. The first issue of the group's journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]], was published in November 1969 in [[Chipping Norton]] in England, and was an important influence on conceptual art in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/art-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First years==

The ''Art &amp; Language'' group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by [[Terry Atkinson]] (b. 1939), [[David Bainbridge (artist)|David Bainbridge]] (b. 1941), [[Michael Baldwin (artist)|Michael Baldwin]] (b. 1945) and [[Harold Hurrell]] (b. 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Neil Mulholland, ''The Cultural Devolution: art in Britain in the late twentieth century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p165. {{ISBN|0-7546-0392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four artists began their collaboration around 1966 while they were art teachers in [[Coventry]]. The name of the group was derived from their journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]], originally created as a work conversation in 1966. The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created conceptual art as part of their discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/art-and-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1968 and 1982, the group grew to nearly fifty people. Among the first to join were critic and art historian, [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], and artist [[Mel Ramsden]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p47. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the early 1970s, individuals including [[Ian Burn]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Preston Heller]], [[Graham Howard]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Andrew Menard]], and [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] joined the group. Two collaborators from Coventry, [[Philip Pilkington]] and [[David Rushton]], followed.
The relative degree of anonymity held within the group continues to have historical significance in the art community. Due to an uncertainty of the exact member lists, it is hard to know unequivocally not only who all of the contributors were but also what their exact contributions were.

The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html|title=Art &amp; Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Volume 1, Number 1, May 1969) is subtitled ''The Journal of Conceptual Art''.  By the second issue (Volume 1, Number 2, February 1970), it became clear that there were conceptual art pieces and conceptual artists for whom and to whom the journal did not speak. In order to better encompass the purpose of the journal, the title was abandoned. Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]] had, however, brought to light the beginning of a new art movement. It was the first [[wikt:imprint|imprint]] to identify a public entity called ''[[Conceptual art|Conceptual Art]].'' The journal was the first of its kind to serve the theoretical and conversational interests of a community of artists and critics, who were also its producers and users. While that community was far from a unanimous agreement as to how to define the nature of conceptual art, the editors and most of its historic contributors shared similar opinions about other art movements. Conceptual art was critical of [[modernism]] for its bureaucracy and its historicism, and of [[minimalism]] for its philosophical conservatism. The practice of conceptual art, especially in its early years of origin, was primarily based on theory, and its form, predominately textual.

As the distribution of the journal and the teaching practices of the editors and others contributors expanded, the conversation grew to include more people. In England, by 1971, artists and critics including [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], [[Philip Pilkington]], [[David Rushton]], [[Lynn Lemaster]], [[Sandra Harrison]], [[Graham Howard]] and [[Paul Wood (artist)|Paul Wood]] had joined. Around the same time in New York, [[Michael Corris]] joined, followed by [[Paula Ramsden]], [[Mayo Thompson]], [[Christine Kozlov]], Preston Heller, [[Andrew Menard]] and [[Kathryn Bigelow]].

The name ''Art &amp; Language'' remained precarious due to the various interpretations of both the many pieces of art and the purpose of the group. Its significance, or instrumentality, varied from person to person, alliance to alliance, discourse to discourse, and from those in New York who produced ''The Fox'' (1974–1976), for example, to those engaged in music projects and those who continued the Journal's edition. There was disagreement among members, and by 1976, there was a growing sense of divide that eventually led to competing individualities and varied concerns.

Throughout the 1970s, ''Art &amp; Language'' dealt with questions about art production and attempted a shift from conventional "nonlinguistic" forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, to more theoretically text-based works. The group often took argumentative positions against such prevailing views of critics like [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]].
The ''Art &amp; Language'' group that exhibited in the international ''[[Documenta 5]]'' exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by ''Art &amp; Language'' members.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen, Hazel Gardiner, ''Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'', Intellect Books, 2009, p104. {{ISBN|1-84150-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Art &amp; Language==
Burn and Ramsden co-founded ''The Society for Theoretical Art'' and ''Analysis in New York'' in the late 1960s. They joined ''Art &amp; Language'' in 1970-71. ''New York Art &amp; Language'' became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p48. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Beveridge]] and [[Carol Condé]], who had been peripheral members of the group in New York, returned to Canada where they worked with trade unions and community groups. In 1977, Ian Burn returned to Australia and Mel Ramsden to the United Kingdom.

==Late 1970s==

By the end of the 1970s, the group was essentially reduced to Baldwin, Harrison, and Ramsden with the occasional participation of [[Mayo Thompson]] and his group [[Red Crayola]]. The political analysis and development within the group resulted in several members leaving the group to work in more activist-oriented political occupations. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions. Other members from the United Kingdom drifted off into a variety of creative, academic and sometimes "politicized" activities.

At the beginning of the 1970s, there were about thirty members. The ''Art &amp; Language'' group emphasized the use of language on the theory that language is the basis from which ideas and concepts are built. Their philosophy was that language permits index words which appear, disappear, and for some even persist, thus allowing viewers and artists alike to analyze the evolution of a word through the proposal of different definitions.

==Exhibitions and awards==
=== Awards and critics ===
In 1986, ''Art &amp; Language'' was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
In 1999, ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibited at [[MoMA PS1|PS1 MoMA]] in New York, with a major installation entitled ''The Artist Out of Work''. This was a recollection of ''Art &amp; Language''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. This exhibition closely followed the revisionist exhibition of ''Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin'' at the [[Queens Museum|Queens Museum of Art]], also in New York. The ''Art &amp; Language'' show at PS1 offered an alternative account of the antecedents and legacy of '"classic" conceptual art and reinforced a transatlantic rather than nationalistic version of events from 1968-1972. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, [[art critic]] [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote, "A quarter century ago, 'Art &amp; Language' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, ''Seeing out loud: the Voice art columns, fall 1998-winter 2003'', Geoffrey Young, 2003, p293. {{ISBN|1-930589-17-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Permanent collections ===
Other exhibits around the world include the works of Atkinson and Baldwin (working as ''Art &amp; Language'') held in the collection of the [[Tate]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2202&amp;page=1 tate.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Papers and works relating to ''New York Art &amp; Language'' are held at the [[Getty Research Institute]], Los Angeles. 

In March 2011, [[Philippe Méaille]] loaned 800 artworks of the ''Art &amp; Language'' collective to the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]], also known as MACBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/390089-un-tresor-al-macba.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=mesCultura Un tresor al Macba]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the [[:fr:Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire|Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire]] and Philippe Méaille signed a long term lease agreement for the [[Château de Montsoreau]] to promote contemporary art in the [[Loire Valley]].

==Theoretical installations==

''Art &amp; Language'' and the ''[[Jackson Pollock Bar]]'' collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the ''Art &amp; Language &amp; Luhmann'' symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium saw the intervention of speakers including [[Catherine David]], who prepared the Documenta X, and [[Peter Weibl]], artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of a ''Art &amp; Language'' text produced in playback by the ''Jackson Pollock Bar''. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt. Using [[lip sync]], the actors used pre-recorded text for a "New Conceptual" conversation. Ever since this collaboration, each new ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibition has been joined by a ''Jackson Pollock Bar'' theoretical installation.

The '''British Academy of Management''' ('''BAM'''), founded in 1986, is a [[learned society]] dedicated  to advancing the academic discipline of [[management]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a member of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]]. The academy runs two [[academic journal]]s: the ''[[British Journal of Management]]'' and the ''[[International Journal of Management Reviews]]''. Once a year, it publishes an article which is presented at the annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = British Academy Of Management,London,UK|url = http://10times.com/organizers/british-academy-management|website = 10times.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquartered of the British Academy of Management is in London, United Kingdom.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The British Academy of Management was founded in 1986, exactly 50 years after the [[Academy of Management|AoM]] was formed in [[Chicago]]. [[Cary Cooper]] was its first President and [[Andrew Pettigrew]] was its first Chairman. During the AoM conference in [[San Diego]] in 1985 they realize the lack of a multidisciplinary association in the UK and decided to establish BAM.

The biggest challenges for this new organisation were to set up a [[constitution]] and to exercise good governance through a strong executive committee. The inaugural conference of BAM was at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1987. This was organised by [[Andrew Pettigrew]]. With over 200 delegates, the conference had an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = 1 November 2015|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early days ===
From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, the management of the Academy was still based on an amateur approach, because of the moving from one place to another. The nomadic life of the BAM office and the lack of a centralized system meant that outgoing chairpersons packaged the documents and sent them on to the institution of the new chair. Sometimes, this delivery arrived without all the key papers. BAM headquarters had to be moved from one city to another for a bit more than a decade, until they found a stable home in 2002 in [[London]]. Thus, the records eventually delivered to HQ were not very comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
In the 1990s, BAM struggled to find conference venues, and to attract persons due to the fact that the attendance was low. As the time passed there was a growth in both domestic and international attendance, especially from Europe. At this time, it was observed that the conferences were more about social interaction than about the discussion of serious research. Combining both consistently high academic quality and the fun factor became a priority by the late 1990s.

The first BAM Workshop took place on 5 January 1989 entitled ''‘Organisation and Strategic Decision Making’'' at [[Bradford Management Centre]], [[University of Bradford]]. It had 69 participants who came from [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Brazil]], [[United States|US]], [[China]] and [[France]]. It was organised by Richard Butler, Richard Pike and John Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First BAM Journal ===
BAM’s founders wanted to start publishing a journal. Cary Cooper managed one of the AoM divisions that had its own journal and he suggested that BAM should do the same.  Cooper coordinated a small group from Council who interviewed a number of  publishing companies for a five-year contract, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]] won the first contract. The [[British Journal of Management]] (BJM) was launched in early 1990 and had 4 issues a year running into 64 pages. The General Editor was [[David Otley]] and the Associate Editors were John Burgoyne, [[John McGee (editor)|John McGee]], Roy Payne, [[Nigel Piercy]] and [[Roy Rothwell]]. BJM purpose was to receive articles from a full range of business and management disciplines and to have a multi and inter disciplinary orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ===
One of the significant changes to BAM’s structure happened in 1999 with the formation of [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs). The aim of the SIGs was to encourage greater member participation and to provide a more diverse range of activities for members. The first SIGs were ''Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Management Consultancy but Learning and Knowledge, Interorganisational Relations, Performance Management, Philosophy of Management, Research Methodology, Creativity and Creative Industries'' and ''E-Business'' soon joined them. The SIG structure proved a thriving way to organise BAM’s  conferences,offering richer benefits for the membership. SIGs also provided new opportunities for less experienced academics to play active roles in the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = The History of British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Journal of Management Reviews (IJMR) ===
The success of the British Journal of Management (BJM) was joined by BAM’s acquisition of the [[International Journal of Management Reviews]] (IJMR). Cary Cooper and Alan Pearson had been the first editors.

== Governance ==
British Academy of Management has an Executive Committee and a Council.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Governance Structure {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/governance-structure|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BAM Executive ===
An Executive Committee, is elected to develop the strategy, work with Council and ensure an effective implementation of the chosen strategy. Since 2014 the leadership team was remodeled. This consist of a President, a Chair, four elected Vice-Chairs and an appointed Vice Chair of Resources/Treasurer.
* President : Professor Sir Cary Cooper
* Chair: Professor [[Nic Beech]]
* Treasurer/ Vice Chair: Resources: James Johnston
* Vice Chair:
** Research and Publications: Professor Bill Cooke
**  Academic Affairs of Conference and Capacity Building: Professor [[David Denyer]]
**  Special Interest Groups: [[Anne Clare Gillon]]
**  Management Knowledge and Education: Dr [[Katy Mason]]

=== BAM Council ===
The Council, which comprises approximately 30 people elected for a minimum of 3 years by the general membership, represents the interests of membership and contributes to the activities of the learned society through working with the vice-chairs. The role of Council is to elaborate strategy and policy, and to implement strategy in conjunction with the Executive and Academy office.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ==
Special Interest Groups are networks of researchers that are focused in a specific area of management research. They organize events throughout the year and provide the members with an academic forum for the discussion on relevant topics.

SIGs are run by BAM members, with support from the BAM office. They organise workshop and events on topics relevant to their research area, and take the lead in managing the academic programme at the annual BAM Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Special Interest Groups {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/special-interest-groups|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some SIGs networks:
* Corporate Governance
* e-Business and e-Government
* Entrepreneurship
* Human Resource Management
* Innovation
* International Business and International Management
* Inter-Organizational Collaboration: Partnerships, Alliances and Networks
* Knowledge and Learning
* Leadership and Leadership Development
* Marketing and Retail

==Life and career==
He served on the faculty of [[University of British Columbia]], where he taught linguistics and cognitive science,&lt;ref name="catdir.loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publisher-supplied biographical information about contributor(s) for Biological exuberance : animal homosexuality and natural diversity / Bruce Bagemihl ; illustrated by John Megahan|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/bios/hol054/98028528.html|website=catdir.loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from there in 1988.

''Biological Exuberance'' cites numerous studies on more than 450 species (see [[List of animals displaying homosexual behavior]]) showing that [[homosexual]] and [[bisexual]] behaviors are common among animals and proposes a theory of sexual behavior in which [[reproduction]] is only one of its principal biological functions.&lt;ref name = Harrold1999&gt;{{cite news|last = Harrold|first = Max|date = February 16, 1999|title = Creature Comforts|newspaper = [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|accessdate = March 10, 2018|pages = 61–62|issue = 779|publisher = [[Here Publishing]]|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|quote = In his news book, ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity'' ... author Bruce Bagemihl portrays an animal kingdom that embraces a whole spectrum of sexual orientations ...

This is something that is all-encompassing.' ... At 751 pages and with photos and documentation of homosexual behaviour in more than 450 species of mammals, birds, repties, and insects, ''Biological Exuberance'' brings the dusty facts to light as Bagemihl deconstructs the all-heterosexual Noah's Ark we've been sold.  ...  Although he doesn't claim to know the motivations of animals, Bagemihl says he does know procreation is not always the driving force: 'Same-sex couplings occur in the presence of the opposite sex, and in and out of captivity, and in and out of mating season.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagemihl proposes that group cohesion and lessening of tensions, seen for example among [[bonobo]]s, are other important functions of sexual behavior.&lt;ref name = Kluger1999&gt;{{cite news|last = Kluger|first = Jeffrey|authorlink = Jeffrey Kluger|date = April 26, 1999|quote = Although gay himself, Bagemihl says he did not write his landmark book (which he spent nine years researching) simply because of his own sexual identity but rather because 'the implications for humans are enormous.'|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990813,00.html|title = The Gay Side of Nature|newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate = March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also argues that the implications for humans of homosexual behaviour across the animal kingdom are "enormous."&lt;ref name = Harrold1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Kluger1999 /&gt;

'''Buddhist influences on print technology''' in [[East Asia]] are far-reaching.  The history of writing in Asia dates back to the 13th century BC.  China used bones and shells for religious inscriptions in the form of divinations.&lt;ref name="Tsien" &gt;{{cite book
  |author=[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]]
  |title=Written on Bamboo &amp; Silk: The Beginnings of Chinese Books &amp; Inscriptions
  |publisher=University of Chicago Press  |location=Chicago
  |year=2004
  |pages=201
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these beginnings, numerous forms of writing and printing were developed.  In many instances, as in [[Europe]], it was religion that played a major role in the development of writing and printing techniques or which was the reason behind the usage of these techniques. Of the religions in East Asia, it was [[Buddhism]] that played the strongest role in influencing writing and, in particular, printing. There were other factors that influenced the creation of manuscript and print culture, but Buddhism had the largest influence in spreading the usage of print technology, which in turn led to an increase in the dissemination of secular printing and literacy as well as wielding an important influence on economics, government, and competing religions/philosophies.

== Brief survey of writing &amp; printing in early China ==
The earliest known writing in [[China]] are inscriptions on bones and shells which were used for divination for approximately three centuries until the late 11th century BC. Inscriptions can also be found on bronze, [[jade]], stone, and pottery. [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze]] was developed as a permanent record of socio-political and ceremonial information in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Stone, on the other hand, is the only permanent method used continuously from ancient times to present. Also, stone was used extensively for inscriptions on monuments and for the preservation of [[Confucian]], Buddhist, and [[Taoist]] texts. Clay inscriptions flourished from the 4th or 5th century BC until the early 4th century AD.  These inscriptions were primarily records of names, titles, and phrases such as good luck sayings.&lt;ref name="Tsien" /&gt;(201)

[[History of silk|Silk]] was also used for the recording of information starting in the 7th or 6th century BC.  The predecessors to paper-based books in China were strips and tablets made of [[bamboo]] or wood, which were bound by cords and used much like books are today. This method of transmission of information was in use at the same time as the usage of bronze and the other methods.  Bamboo and wood was used for approximately three centuries more than paper and silk was in use for some 500 years longer than paper.  These methods were favoured by tradition and also had some advantages over paper. 
 
A less expensive alternative was developed, a form of paper made from a refuse fiber called [[zhi]]. This paper was developed before the Christian era and became commonplace in the 1st or 2nd century AD for books and other documents, but the other methods of recording information  continued.  Paper books were originally in the form of rolls, then folded leaves, and finally bound volumes like the books in use today.

There were various methods for the production of early Chinese records. Bone and stone media were engraved or incised with a metal stylus or knife.  Wood, bamboo, silk, and paper was written on with brush-pens; the ink was black; usage of ink dates to [[Neolithic China]].  [[stylus|Styli]] were also used and were made of bamboo, wood, horn, and metal, but it is not known when the stylus first came into common usage. Book knives were used as erasers for bamboo and wood tablets but not for inscriptions.  Inscriptions on bronze were [[casting|cast]] from molds. Inscriptions on clay were made by molds or were impressed with stamps. [[Seal (duplicate)|Seals]] were used to produce duplicates on soft clays and later on silk and paper. These seals were cast from metals or cut from [[jade]] or stone. Before the invention of woodblock printing, inked impressions from stone or other inscriptions would be made by rubbing or squeezing paper over their surfaces.  This technique was used up to the early 6th century and led to the invention of printing. Moveable type was invented in China some 400 years before [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s press.  (1, 202-203)

== Buddhism and printing in China ==
The period following the collapse of the [[Han empire|Han]] (220 AD) is known as (one of the many) “Dark Ages” and was typified by political strife, wars, and social upheaval.  Despite the turmoil of that period, learning and culture continued to grow. Among the intellectual elite and rulership, Confucianism continued to be the dominant philosophy. Taoism and Buddhism emerged as religions and began to flourish.

Buddhism, a populist religion, had been introduced to China at the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and quickly became a religion sought after in times of strife by the masses where it was propagated. The first translation of a Buddhist text appeared in China in the 2nd century AD and by the 3rd century the volume of translations had increased a great deal.  Buddhism’s influence on literature and scholarship grew in relation to the conversion of the elite and ruler ship.  (17)

During the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618 AD), Buddhism enjoyed an explosion in the production of printed texts.  This is partly due to the reunification of the empire and partly because [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] decreed that all Buddhist texts then in print were to be copied and placed in temple libraries in all the major cities.  Another factor that influenced this increase in printing was the creation of a bureau in 606 AD for the translation of Buddhist texts &lt;!--from what language to what language? --&gt; at the behest of [[Emperor Yang]].  To illustrate this diffusion of Buddhist texts, the History of the Sui Dynasty’s bibliography lists 1950 Buddhist titles as compared to 377 Taoist titles.

Buddhism was, therefore, probably the most important factor in the development of printing. The demand for Buddhist texts was so great that it encouraged accelerated levels of printing for the following century. Despite the increased demand for Buddhist literature, the production of books by hand did not end.  Printing only increased the number of copies of books, thus facilitating the ease and degree of communication.  (18, 205)

As Confucianism was the major competing native belief set among the elite, the reason that Buddhist texts enjoyed such widespread printing needs explanation.&lt;ref name="Mair" &gt;{{cite journal

Mair suggests that perhaps there is something inherent in Buddhism that is conducive to its being written in what he calls “vernacular Sinitic” as opposed to the “literary Sinitic” used for native Chinese texts.  One aspect of Buddhism that Mair cites is the notion of [[upaya]], known as fang-pien in Chinese; followers of the Buddha should do whatever is in their power to do to insure the salvation of all living things.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713) This would certainly help explain why Buddhist texts would be printed and circulated in a written language that is more accessible to a wider audience. Another point Mair makes is that lecture notes for sermons by laymen and monks were written in the vernacular language.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This makes sense considering that these notes were to be spoken from; one would not make notes for a sermon in a stilted and highly literary language.  Other Buddhist texts such as [[parable]]s were popular with the masses and so when written, the vernacular is the clear choice.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

Another inherent trait that Mair cites is the ostensibly oral nature of Buddhism and how the religion stresses that “…Buddha is beyond the ‘paths of speech’” and “…’the way of language is cut off, the workings of the mind are obliterated’….” (Ibid.)  Mair also writes:
: “Even the Zen masters, whose words are ironically preserved in written vernacular (perhaps one should say, especially the Zen masters),…’nonestablishment of written words’ (pu li wen-tzu), which disparages the efficacy of language, especially in its written form, to convey essential truths.”  &lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713-714)

Despite this, even Buddhism could not survive and function as a religion without sacred texts.  Many Buddhist texts begin with the phrase evam me sutam (ju shih wo wen, “thus I have heard”).  Buddhist texts also make use of other expressions such as fo shuo (“spoken by the Buddha”). Mair points out that this underlines the direct oral transmission of Buddha’s teachings to the community through Ananda.  So, these phrases are a stamp of authenticity for the text, even when a text did not originate in India.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714)  Given this oral nature of Buddhism, it makes sense that its texts would be rendered in vernacular rather than literary Chinese.

The strongest explanation for the use of vernacular, and by extension the rapid spread of Buddhism and its influence on print culture, is the process by which Buddhism was introduced to China.  Mair argues that the process of translation was what influenced the use of vernacular in Chinese Buddhist texts. Commerce also played a strong role, but this will be discussed later.  It was foreigners that began the process of translation into Chinese (“…the early impetus for the translation of Buddhist texts into [[Sinitic]] came primarily from foreign monks resident in China.”)&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714-715, 717)  What Mair calls “literary Sinitic” is an extremely difficult language to learn, “…requiring at least ten to fifteen years to gain a modicum of proficiency.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(716)  These foreign translators were adults when they came to China and most likely learned spoken Chinese through immersion in the culture before learning how to write the language.  When it came time to write, they used the language they knew which was the vernacular.  Also, when it was Chinese Buddhists working on writing a text, they worked in teams with other Chinese dictating their translations.  Obviously since literary Chinese is unspeakable, the dictation was done in the vernacular. (Ibid.)

The above argument is the strongest for what might be called the mechanical process for the rapid spread of Buddhism and the vast amount of texts available (and the rise in the use of printing) to a wider audience.  What is also a very important aspect in the spread of Buddhism and its influence on printing is the ideological aspects of Buddhism.  As opposed to the native Chinese religions/philosophies, Buddhism is a populist religion.  As Mair writes:  “…Buddhism functioned (and perhaps originated) as a means for the individual to escape from the normal societal bonds.” (719)  Buddhism appealed to the dispossessed, those that were outside the Confucian institutions.  Because Confucianism stressed a rigid social order, many people found themselves stuck in a social position they could not escape from.

The Buddhist community in China consisted of, for example, a large number of widows, orphans, and others that had no place in the fabric of Confucian society.  Literary Chinese was associated with the elite; those that could afford to attend the bureaucratic schools for example.  Buddhism aggressively pursued the conversion of followers and to move into a new area such as China&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721), it makes sense that Buddhism would make use of the vernacular in its texts; it was more accessible to the masses.  Because of this accessibility there was an increased demand for texts and thus the rise in printing.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(720)

Mair cites Daniel Gardner and his work on [[Neo-Confucianism]].  It seems that the vernacular was employed in Neo-Confucian texts because of its: 
: “…more inquisitive approach it permitted toward the classics…Considering the powerful influence of Buddhism
on the formation of Neo-Confucian thought and practice, the adoption of the written vernacular as a legitimate form of serious intellectual discussion would seem to be one more example of the radical restructuring of Confucianism brought about by this foreign religion.” (Ibid.)

So, not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also it also influenced society at large in adapting to the norms of Buddhist thought.  These influences were manifested in literature, philosophy, government, etc.  As Mair writes, “…may be analyzed sociolinguistically as emanating from the fundamentally demotic impulses of the religion."&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721)

== Buddhism and printing in Korea ==
The story of printing in [[Korea]] is slightly different from in China, but Buddhism did play an important role in the development of printing.  Just as in China and Japan, [[woodblock printing]] was the primary technique used for printing, but a scarcity of resources needed for the production of woodblocks in Korea created a need for the invention of an alternative, which was moveable type. Korea was in the unique position among Asian countries of having an [[Korean alphabet|alphabet]] that facilitated the use of moveable type. This is not to say that woodblocks were not used.  Once [[moveable type]] came into use, Korea was no longer quite as dependent on China for texts.

Sometime in the 4th century the Chinese educational system was introduced to what was then the [[Koguryo state]]. A [[civil service examination system]] was established in [[Silla]] after the Korean states consolidated in the 7th century.  As the power of the government grew, demand for books from China increased.  Korea began to print its own texts and books from woodblocks in the 10th century.  Prior to 1056 Korea was mainly a manuscript culture.  Complaints from a provincial capital spurred the government to order copies from the royal collection to be printed. Newly carved woodblocks were sent from the provinces to the royal library, which spurred the production of more woodblocks.&lt;ref name="Sohn" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;(97)

Other than the perceived (and possibly true) unreliability of manuscript copies, religion provided an additional stimulus for the printing of texts from woodblocks, just as in the other countries of East Asia.  A large scale carving of woodblocks for the purpose of printing the [[Tripitaka]] was undertaken starting sometime around 1014.  During the last twenty odd years of the 11th century, more Tripitaka woodblocks were carved, in addition to woodblocks for other Chinese Buddhist works.  The demand for Buddhist texts, as well as Confucian texts, grew in the following years.  Most of these were subsequently destroyed during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

At the time, Korea was rather zealous in its attempts to acquire Buddhist (and other) texts and utilized whatever means it could to acquire texts.  In addition to trade with [[Song dynasty|Song]] China, Korea bought books from private markets (once again, commerce and Buddhism will be discussed later).  The zealousness Korea had to acquire Buddhist texts also provided an impetus for the printing of texts.  By the end of the 11th century Korea had better copies of common texts as well as rare copies of certain editions.  Previously the flow of books was mainly from China to Korea, but in 1091 China asked Korea for 117 books that no longer existed in China’s libraries, a situation similar to that in Europe a few centuries earlier where Ireland had preserved Christian texts no longer in existence on the continent.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This illustrates the strong role that Buddhism played in printing.  Buddhism provided the stimulus to keep as many texts in print as possible.  When these texts were lost in China, Korea proved to be an important repository of Buddhist literature due to its commitment to the printing of Buddhist texts.

Buddhism also played a role in the development of moveable type. Religion was not the only contributing factor in Korea’s development of moveable type.  First, the Song dynasty (which was apparently the only source outside of Korea for books) fled south after the Chin invasion in 1127. Second, many of Korea’s libraries were destroyed resulting in the loss of many texts and woodblocks during a power struggle in the royal court.  Thirdly, the scarcity of hardwoods used in the production of woodblocks in Korea contributed to the need for a more readily made printing source. Pine was the most common wood available in Korea at the time, but is not a good source for woodblocks.  There was birch, but these trees were not common and were to be found mostly on mountainous terrain making it difficult to get to and expensive to transport. (98)

The Koreans at that time were most likely already aware of moveable type as it had already been invented in China. In China, moveable type was made from baked clay, but the Koreans improved upon this by making cast-type.  Metal casting existed in Korea, but with the introduction of a new method of coin casting from China in 1102, Korea finally had the technology to create an effective method of printing using moveable type.  This method of casting came in the form of carving two molds that were joined together with the liquid metal presumably being poured into the hollow thus created. (98-100)  So with the zealous desire for Buddhist texts, the scarcity of resources for woodblock production, the introduction of new technology, and the cessation of trade with China, Korea was able to continue to print Buddhist texts.

There are other examples of how Buddhism stimulated printing in Korea. Despite the difficulties the [[Mongol]] invasion presented, printing of texts continued.  While in exile on [[Kangwha Island]], the [[Goryeo#Mongol invasions .281231 - 1350.29|Koryo]] government re-carved a woodblock edition of a Buddhist text crucial to the [[Son sect]] that had become scarce. Sohn also suggests that the invention of moveable type was due to the general scarcity of books after 1127 but before the Mongol invasion.  Sohn mentions that there was an urgent need for these texts. (98)  What he does not mention, and I would suggest, is that moveable type was used because it would have taken too long to re-carve the woodblocks.  Thus moveable type was utilized to meet the urgent demand for the texts.

There is more evidence for the influence that Buddhism had on the printing of texts.  In 1446, King Sejong introduced the Hunmin chong um, a text that introduced the new system for writing vernacular Korean.  In the preface to this text, there is a line (“Even the sound of the winds, the cry of the crane, the cackle of fowl and the barking of dogs – all may be written” [Mair, 733]) that is derived from a Sung scholar (Cheng Ch’iao) that “praises the phonological sophistication of the Buddhist monks.”  The fact that Sejong was a devout Buddhist could possibly also be seen as evidence of the Buddhist influence on printing. All but two of the earliest texts using Sejong’s Hunmin chong um were Buddhist texts.  Also, Hunmin chong um is based partly on Phags-pa that can be traced back to Srong-brtsan-sgam-po, the king who introduced Buddhism to [[Tibet]].  “The Buddhist impetus, in turn, carried through to King Sejong’s Hunmin chong um.” (731, 734)   This illustrates that not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also on language reform, which in turn further influenced printing.  With the introduction of Hunmin chong um, printing using moveable type in Korea became much more practical.

There are a number of differences between China and Korea which rendered moveable type easier for Korea than China. First, China did not have a script reform that made the use of moveable type more practical as in Korea.  The large number of characters used in written Chinese posed a great challenge to the use of moveable type. Instead of making type for every character all at once, why not make new type as it was needed?  In this way a gradual shift to moveable type printing could have been accomplished. Second, the historical record shows that in China there was a preference for that which was already established and familiar (e.g. the preference of bamboo/wood books over the usage of paper books). Chinese moveable type was made from baked clay, rendering it breakable.

== Buddhism and printing in Japan ==
Little is known about the techniques and procedures used for woodblock printing before 1600 in [[Japan]]; printing and publishing in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period became more commercialized and thus there is more information about it.&lt;ref name="Kornicki" &gt;Kornicki, Peter. The Book in Japan:  A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century.  Brill, Leiden, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;(47)

First a manuscript is passed to a copyist and a clean copy (''hanshita'') is written out.  Sometimes a [[calligrapher]] would be employed to make a copy when quality calligraphy was desired, although the author often prepared the copy.  Second, the hanshita was given to the block-carver who pasted the hanshita face down onto a wooden block and carved away the white parts leaving the text, illustrations, and borders in relief.  Third, the block was passed to the printer who inked the block, laid a sheet of paper on it, and then rubbed the paper to make the impression.  Sometimes a printing was made for the purpose of proofreading but this seems to have been rather rare.  It is not clear how much proofreading was done but it was done for the more important texts. (52)  Fourth, when enough copies were printed they were passed to someone who aligned the pages.  Lastly, a cover was made and the book was finally bound. (47, 48)

The reproduction of texts was done by the technique called ''[[kabusebori]]''.  Reproduction was an unstable process.  Copies would be made from earlier editions of the text by using the text itself as the hanshita.  The woodblock resulting from this technique of duplication was similar but not an exact replica.  This method was used during the Muromachi period to reproduce Chinese texts and also when a popular text needed to be reprinted but the original woodblocks were worn down, damaged, or lost. (49)  This method was also used when particular pages of a text needed to be replaced such as when some woodblocks were more worn than others or when a family or business needed to update its directories. (52)

Umeki was another technique used to make corrections to a text to avoid censorship or when mistakes were made during the carving process.  A portion of the woodblock would be carved out and removed, then replaced with the corrected text on a portion of wood measuring the same dimensions as that which had been removed. (52)

Print technology was introduced to Japan in the 8th century but it took approximately 1000 years for Japan to become a print culture when printing had finally become commercialized. (112)  Initially printing in Japan was a ritual exercise for the production of devotional texts and it was not until the 11th century that texts were printed for the purpose of reading.  This was much the case in China although calendars and Buddhist texts had been printed for reading for quite some time.  Therefore, printing reached Japan from China in the form of a ritual practice. (113)

The only surviving evidence of printing from the 8th century Japan comes from Nara in the form of the [[Hyakumanto Dharani]]. (115) The Hyakumanto Dharani are slips of paper with Buddhist text printed on them installed in miniature pagoda that were placed at various locations in Nara.  They were apparently made to atone for a rebellion that took place 746.  The rebellion was in response to the growing influence Buddhism had in the Japanese court; a Buddhist monk, Dokyo, had been able to have himself appointed to the position of Chancellor of the Realm.  The interference in courtly matters by the Buddhist clergy led to much resentment and Fujiwara no Nakamaro led a rebellion against Dokyo.  The ex-Empress Shotoku ordered the printing of one million charms to appease the Buddhist monks and temples, although it is unclear whether this order was fully carried out.&lt;ref name="Hickman" &gt;Hickman, Brian.  “A Note on the Hyakumanto Dharani.” Monumenta Nipponica, vol. 30, no. 1, (Spring, 1975), 87-93&lt;/ref&gt;(87-88)  Very few of the dharani survived to this day.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;(89)  Hyakumanto dharani represent the earliest existing proof (from Japan) that Buddhism was an influence on printing in East Asia.

[[Inbutsu]], religious stamps depicting the Buddha, were common in pre-Heian times and continued to be made through the Heian period.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"/&gt;(117)  Further evidence of printing in the Heian period comes in the form of books and other texts imported from China by Japanese monks returning to Japan from China and Chinese monks and travelers.  Devotional printing was common in [[Heian period|Heian]] Japan.  Fujiwara no Michinaga’s diary (1009 AD) mentions that 1000 copies of the “[[Lotus Sutra]]” were commissioned but none of these survive. It seems that the paper that these devotional texts were printed on was of poor quality and this explains why so few of them exist to this day.  The reason for printing these devotional texts lay in the meritorious act of reproducing sacred texts, not in the reading of them.  Therefore, there was no concern for the fate of the texts after being printed since the act of printing them was what brought about merit. (118)  As described above, Buddhist influence on printing in Japan was initially for gaining merit with the Buddha and great effort was put into printing texts for this reason.  Because Japan during the Nara and Heian periods was primarily a manuscript culture and texts for reading were hand copied, Buddhism’s influence on print had yet to exhibit the influence it did in China.

Practical printing can be dated to the 11th century, during the Heian era when Chinese texts from the [[Song dynasty]] became popular in Japan in the form of commentaries on [[Sūtra|sutras]] and doctrines. [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] became the center of non-devotional printing in Heian Japan and the oldest existing example of this kind is the [[Joyuishikiron]] (a Buddhist text in Chinese) of 1088 printed by the monks of the [[Kofukuji temple]]. [[Kyoto]] became the center of devotional printing because this is where the aristocratic sponsorship for such printing existed. (118-119)

During the [[Kamakura period]] printing became more established and began to shift its emphasis from devotional printing to practical printing.  Inbutsu continued to be produced but their production began to expand to more populist images such as the Amida Buddha and Jizo.  The Kofukuji was important in the shift to practical printing as well as other temples such as Todaiji, Daianji, and Saidaiji.  The monasteries of [[Mt. Koya]] also began printing texts of the Shingon sect, continuously printing up to the 19th century.  It was during the Kamakura period that Kyoto began to be a center of printing.  The 13th-century temple Sen’yuji was one of the most prominent.  Its founder, Shunjo, had brought back books from China and reproduced them using the kabusebori technique.  Texts from Song editions relating to monastic discipline were also printed. Kyoto temples also began printing Pure Land Sect texts during the Kamakura period but the location and dates of production is unknown. (119-121)

It is from the [[Pure Land Sect]] that the first book printed in Japanese, the Kurodani shonin gotoroku (1321), originates. It is most likely due to the populist nature of the Pure Land Sect that this text was printed in Japanese.  It was a collection of sayings by the sect’s founder Honen (1133–1212).  It was printed in hiragana with kanji glossed with furigana.  Later in the 14th century more of Honen’s works were printed.  The Pure Land Sect was one of the first Buddhist sects responsible for reaching out to a general audience through the print medium in the Kamakura period. (121)

[[Zen]] sects had the largest influence on printing during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods.  Texts came from five monasteries in [[Kyoto]] and five in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and later other Zen temples began to print texts.  It was with the Zen-printed texts that an educational element began to enter into the act of printing.  These texts were reproductions of Zen master sayings intended for the training of novices and disseminating the teachings to lay persons.  Devotionals were still printed but when Zen monasteries printed devotional texts it was at the behest of sponsors rather than the monasteries themselves. (121-122)

Gozan-ban (the name given to texts printed by Zen sects) were for the most part written by Chinese authors but some were by Japanese authors (monks).  They were also kabusebori editions so they looked like Chinese editions.  Chinese monks also assisted in the printing of Gozan-ban.  Eight Chinese monks had traveled to Kyoto in the 14th century (1367) and these monks were mostly block-carvers and printers employed by the Japanese monks and temples.  Some texts, though, were printed at the expense of the Chinese monks.  Most of the Gozan-ban were Zen and other Buddhist texts but some were secular texts of Chinese origin.  It was in the 14th century that the first non-Buddhist texts were printed.  By the 16th century a large number of secular Chinese texts had been printed by Zen temples.  It would seem then that the Zen monks were the custodians of Chinese culture in Japan. (122)

From the 14th to 16th century secular texts are divided into three categories:  1) canonical texts, 2) dictionaries and other sinological reference texts, and 3) poetic texts.  The first secular Chinese text to be printed was [[Confucius]]’ [[Analects]], printed in Sakai in 1364 with commentaries by the third century scholar He Yan.  In 1528, some Chinese medical texts were printed.  Not all the secular texts were printed by Zen monks, but one quarter of the Gozan-ban were secular texts and printed in Japan for the first time.  The Zen monks' interest in secular Chinese literature resulted in much of the Chinese poetry and Confucian literature printed. (123)

By the 16th Century printing was well established but had yet to become commercial.  Prior to this, the printing of books for reading was done primarily by Buddhist monasteries and monks and were mostly Buddhist texts in the original Chinese.  These books may have been made available for sale.  Little is known how the books were circulated before the Tokugawa era. (124-125)

Buddhism influenced both printing and reading.  The earliest references to reading in Japan relates to Buddhist texts. (251) There is a question regarding “reading” because at first Buddhist texts were printed as a meritorious act and “reading” was secondary.  Buddhist texts were studied and there was a ritualized reading of them.  When discussing reading of the sutras and other tests, “reading” takes a number of forms:  silent vs. chanted, individual vs. mass/group.  During the Nara and Heian periods, there was a number of public readings of Buddhist texts for devotional and other religious reasons. (252)

Buddhism played a large role in literacy during the Nara and Heian periods.  Because Buddhism was a scriptural religion, literacy in Chinese was required because texts available to the Japanese were printed in Chinese. During the Heian period it was men who were for the most part literate in Chinese (most likely the “literary Sinetic” that Mair refers to) but there is proof that some women were literate in Chinese as well. After the Heian period Buddhism remained a text-based religion and it was the Zen monks were particularly interested in secular Chinese texts. The literacy in Chinese that was thought to be so important during the Nara and Heian periods became less stringent during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Literacy gave way to the Sino-Japanese kanbun. The literate were most likely to be found in the Zen monasteries during these periods. (270-271) Literacy began to rise during the Tokugawa period as a result of printing becoming commercialized and the Tokugawa bureaucracy had become dependent on printed and written communications among the various government offices in the capital and provinces. (272-273)

So from the Nara period on, literacy in Chinese was important for the Japanese bureaucracy, but more important for the reproduction of Buddhist texts and the production of commentaries on Buddhist texts.  In the 7th and 8th Centuries the greatest efforts at manuscript and printed text (by extension) production was for the copying of Buddhist texts.  There is evidence that the entire Buddhist canon existent in Japan had been copied by 673.  By 700 there was a large number of Buddhist temples and monasteries that required texts.  By 727 the government had established a sutra scriptorium (the Shakyojo) in Nara that was the center of sutra-copying.  It did not survive the move to Heian-kyo.   The number of surviving printed Buddhist texts, as opposed to printed secular texts, helps to illustrate the influence Buddhism had on printing. (91)

== Commerce and Buddhism ==
Buddhism and commerce were also tied closely together.  The two stimulated each other in a cyclical fashion such that, among other things, printing was influenced to a large degree.

The official histories of China, Korea, Japan, and other Asian societies largely neglected to record a number of commercial enterprises that the elite (bureaucracy) were not directly involved with.  The elite (bureaucracy) was only concerned with official missions and held an elitist view regarding the merchants and other commoners that partook in trade with neighboring societies and cultures, which contributes to the manner in which Buddhism was able to infiltrate these societies.  Buddhism followed the same routes the merchants used. As Buddhism spread, so did the demand for religious artifacts and literature. Buddhism also stimulated religious pilgrimages which in turn stimulated trade.  These factors stimulated the growth of local economies and the production of artifacts and the printing of religious texts. This all often went unnoticed by the elite who would otherwise have been vehemently opposed to the spread of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" &gt;Holcombe, Charles.  “Trade-Buddhism:  Maritime Trade, Immigration, and the Buddhist	Landfall in Early Japan.”  Journal of the American Oriental Society.  vol. 119, no.	2, (Apr.-June 1999), 280-292. (pages 280-281)&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the stimulation of commerce and travel, Buddhism assisted trade by providing a social lubricant.  As Holcombe states, “The Buddhist spirit minimized regional differences.”&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(283)  Because of its universalistic philosophy, followers of the religion from different cultures who behaved differently, looked different, and so on, were still able to engage in commerce because they held a common faith.  This in turn helped to propel the spread of Buddhism to other regions.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(282-283)

Buddhist missionaries would accompany private trading caravans and sailing vessels along established trade routes into regions that were untouched by Buddhism.  Sometimes those missionaries would settle in these regions and establish schools/missions or, during the voyage, would convert merchants and traders who would in turn settle in these new regions, raising families, and assisting in the dissemination of the Buddhist faith.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(285)  Sometimes this immigration was accidental, as in the case with Japan. At the time sailing between Japan, China, and Korea was a dangerous affair, so it is understandable that many of these “immigrants” would opt to remain in Japan (or wherever it was they landed), as happened with ten Paekche monks blown off course as they were sailing to China. The elite, for the most part, ignored travelers that were not members of official missions so it is plausible that the number of immigrants such as the Paekche monks was much higher than the official immigrant count indicates.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(288-289)

Commerce and trade facilitated the spread of Buddhism to new regions and with it the spread of Buddhist texts which stimulated the growth of printing industries.  The extensive book trade between Sung China and Korea as well as the employment of Chinese monks by Japanese temples and monasteries was a common practice.  It is very important to keep in mind the role commerce played in the printing of Buddhist texts.

== Conclusion ==
As mentioned above, the Japanese case provides the best example of how Buddhism influenced printing.  In China the religion was a populist one, which actively sought out those that were marginalized by Confucian society.  Korea had a voracious appetite for Buddhist texts and the combination of the scarcity of resources for woodblock printing as well as the Mongol invasions stimulated the use of new printing technologies.  As Mair writes, “There is little doubt that printing in East Asia, from its inception, was primarily a Buddhist phenomenon.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(736)  Buddhism, being a universalistic and populist religion, as well as its zealous conversion of the common person to its faith, was able to utilize print technology like no other religion at the time was able to.  The ostensibly oral origins of the religion allowed Buddhism to utilize vernacular language in the printed form to reach a much wider audience than Confucianism, Taoism, or other religions.  So in this way Buddhism was able to wield an influence on print technology that was unknown before its introduction to East Asia.

'''Computational geometry''' is a branch of [[computer science]] devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of [[geometry]]. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric [[algorithms]], and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity.

[[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] is central to computational geometry, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and O(''n'' log ''n'') may be the difference between days and seconds of computation.

The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in [[computer graphics]] and computer-aided design and manufacturing ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from [[mathematical visualization]].

Other important applications of computational geometry include [[robotics]] (motion planning and visibility problems), [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), [[integrated circuit]] design (IC geometry design and verification), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) (mesh generation), [[computer vision]] ([[3D reconstruction]]).

The main branches of computational geometry are:

*''Combinatorial computational geometry'', also called ''algorithmic geometry'', which deals with geometric objects as [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities. A groundlaying book in the subject by [[Franco P. Preparata|Preparata]] and [[Michael Ian Shamos|Shamos]] dates the first use of the term "computational geometry" in this sense by 1975.&lt;ref name=PS&gt;{{cite book
|author = [[Franco P. Preparata]] and [[Michael Ian Shamos]] | title = Computational Geometry - An Introduction | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| year = 1985 | id = 1st edition: {{ISBN|0-387-96131-3}}; 2nd printing, corrected and expanded, 1988: {{ISBN|3-540-96131-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Numerical computational geometry'', also called ''machine geometry'', ''[[computer-aided geometric design]]'' (CAGD), or ''geometric modeling'', which deals primarily with representing real-world objects in forms suitable for computer computations in CAD/CAM systems. This branch may be seen as a further development of [[descriptive geometry]] and is often considered a branch of computer graphics or CAD. The term "computational geometry" in this meaning has been in use since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Forrest, "Computational geometry", ''Proc. Royal Society London'', 321, series 4, 187-195 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Combinatorial computational geometry ==

The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, [[polygon]]s, [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], etc.

Some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of [[computer]]s. Consider, for example, the ''[[Closest pair problem]]'':

* Given ''n'' points in the plane, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.

One could compute the distances between all the pairs of points, of which there are ''n(n-1)/2'', then pick the pair with the smallest distance. This [[brute-force search|brute-force]] algorithm takes [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time; i.e. its execution time is proportional to the square of the number of points. A classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes O(''n'' log ''n''). [[Randomized algorithm]]s that take O(''n'') expected time,&lt;ref&gt;S. Khuller and Y. Matias. A simple randomized sieve algorithm for the closest-pair problem. Inf. Comput., 118(1):34&amp;mdash;37,1995&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes O(''n'' log log ''n'') time,&lt;ref&gt;S. Fortune and J.E. Hopcroft. "A note on Rabin's nearest-neighbor algorithm." Information Processing Letters, 8(1), pp. 20&amp;mdash;23, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; have also been discovered.

=== Problem classes ===

The core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways, according to various criteria. The following general classes may be distinguished.

====Static problems====
In the problems of this category, some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found. Some fundamental problems of this type are:

* [[Convex hull]]: Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points.
* [[Line segment intersection]]: Find the intersections between a given set of line segments.
* [[Delaunay triangulation]]
* [[Voronoi diagram]]: Given a set of points, partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points.
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Closest pair of points]]: Given a set of points, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.
* [[Largest empty circle]]: Given a set of points, find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them. 
* [[Euclidean shortest path]]: Connect two points in a Euclidean space (with polyhedral obstacles) by a shortest path.
* [[Polygon triangulation]]: Given a polygon, partition its interior into triangles
* [[Mesh generation]]
* [[Boolean operations on polygons]]

The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space (computer memory) required to solve a given problem instance.

====Geometric query problems====

In geometric query problems, commonly known as geometric search problems, the input consists of two parts: the [[Computational geometry#Geometric query problems|search space]] part and the [[query (complexity)|query]] part, which varies over the problem instances. The search space typically needs to be [[data pre-processing|preprocessed]], in a way that multiple queries can be answered efficiently.

Some fundamental geometric query problems are:

* [[Range searching]]: Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region.
* [[Point location]]: Given a partitioning of the space into cells, produce a data structure that efficiently tells in which cell a query point is located.
* [[nearest neighbour search|Nearest neighbor]]: Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently find which point is closest to a query point.
* [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]]: Given a set of objects in space, produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first.

If the search space is fixed, the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by:
*the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in
*the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer queries.

For the case when the search space is allowed to vary, see "[[#Dynamic problems|Dynamic problems]]".

====Dynamic problems====

Yet another major class is the [[dynamic problem (algorithms)|dynamic problem]]s, in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data (addition or deletion input geometric elements). Algorithms for problems of this type typically involve [[dynamic data structures]]. Any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one, at the cost of increased processing time. For example, the [[range searching]] problem may be converted into the [[dynamic range searching]] problem by providing for addition and/or deletion of the points. The [[dynamic convex hull]] problem is to keep track of the convex hull, e.g., for the dynamically changing set of points, i.e., while the input points are inserted or deleted.

The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by:
*the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in
*the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space
*the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer a query.

====Variations====

Some problems may be treated as belonging to either of the categories, depending on the context. For example, consider the following problem.
* [[Point in polygon]]: Decide whether a point is inside or outside a given polygon.

In many applications this problem is treated as a single-shot one, i.e., belonging to the first class. For example, in many applications of [[computer graphics]] a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a [[pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointer]]. However, in some applications, the polygon in question is invariant, while the point represents a query. For example, the input polygon may represent a border of a country and a point is a position of an aircraft, and the problem is to determine whether the aircraft violated the border. Finally, in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics, in [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures, which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries.

In some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries, which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates. For example, in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of N queries, rather than for a single query. See also "[[amortized analysis]]".

== Numerical computational geometry ==

{{Main|computer-aided geometric design}}

This branch is also known as '''geometric modelling''' and '''computer-aided geometric design''' (CAGD).

Core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation.

The most important instruments here are [[parametric curve]]s and [[parametric surface]]s, such as [[Bézier curve]]s, [[spline (mathematics)|spline]] curves and surfaces. An important non-parametric approach is the [[level-set method]].

Application areas of computational geometry include shipbuilding, aircraft, and automotive industries.

'''Cytoarchitecture''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wiktionary:κύτος#Ancient_Greek|κύτος]]''= "cell" + ''[[wiktionary:ἀρχιτέκτων#Ancient_Greek|ἀρχιτεκτονική]]''= "architecture"), also known as '''cytoarchitectonics''', is the study of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular composition of the central nervous system's tissues under the microscope. Cytoarchitectonics is one of the ways to parse the brain, by obtaining sections of the brain using a microtome and staining them with chemical agents which reveal where different [[neuron]]s are located.

The study of the parcellation of ''nerve fibers'' (primarily [[axon]]s) into layers forms the subject of '''myeloarchitectonics''' (&lt;Gk. ''μυελός''=marrow + ''ἀρχιτεκτονική''=architecture), an approach complementary to cytoarchitectonics.&lt;ref name="ByrnesWasik2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James P. Byrnes|author2=Barbara A.

== History of the cerebral cytoarchitecture ==
Defining cerebral cytoarchitecture began with the advent of [[histology]]—the science of slicing and staining brain slices for examination.&lt;ref name="Petrides2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Petrides|title=Neuroanatomy of Language Regions of the Human Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYlqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|date=3 December 2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-405931-3|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is credited to the Viennese psychiatrist [[Theodor Meynert]] (1833–1892), who in 1867 noticed regional variations in the histological structure of different parts of the gray matter in the cerebral hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;Meynert, T. (1872) ''Der Bau der Gross-Hirnrinde und seine örtlichen Verschiedenheiten, nebst einem pathologisch–anatomischen Corollarium''. J.H. Heuser’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Neuwied &amp; Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Flechsig]] was the first to present the cytoarchitecture of human brain into 40 areas.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Untersuchungen über die Markbildung in den menschlichen Grosshirnlappen. Neurologisches Centralblatt 17, 977-996 (1898)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Walter Campbell]], then, present the cytoarchitecture of the human brain into 14 areas.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, A.W. (1903) Histological studies on cerebral localisation. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London 72:'' 488-492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a New South Wales native working in Cairo, identified 50 areas.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Smith, G. (1907) A new topographical survey of the human cerebral cortex, being an account of the distribution of the anatomically distinct cortical areas and their relationship to the cerebral sulci. ''Journal of Anatomy and Physiology (London) 41:'' 237-254.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korbinian Brodmann]] worked on the brains of diverse mammalian species and developed a division of the cerebral cortex into 52 discrete areas (of which 44 in the human, and the remaining 8 in non-human primate brain).&lt;ref&gt;Brodmann, K. (1909) ''Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues''. Johann Ambrosius Barth, Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garey, L.J. (2006) ''Brodmann’s Localisation in the Cerebral Cortex''. Springer Science, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodmann used numbers to categorize the different architectural areas&lt;ref name="Petrides2013" /&gt; and he believed that each of these regions served a unique functional purpose.&lt;ref name="UniversityUniversity2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yosef Grodzinsky Professor and Canadian Research Chair in Neurolinguistics McGill University|author2=Katrin Amunts Professor of Structural-Functional Brain Mapping Aachen University|title=Broca's Region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onsnTke-STgC&amp;pg=PA18|date=24 March 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803952-5|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constantin von Economo]] and [[Georg N. Koskinas]], two neurologists in Vienna, produced a landmark work in brain research by defining 107 cortical areas on the basis of cytoarchitectonic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Economo, C. von, Koskinas, G.N. (1925) ''Die Cytoarchitektonik der Hirnrinde des erwachsenen Menschen''. Julius Springer, Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Economo, C. von, Koskinas, G.N. (2008) ''Atlas of Cytoarchitectonics of the Adult Human Cerebral Cortex'' (translated, revised and edited by L.C. Triarhou). Karger, Basel.&lt;/ref&gt; They used letters to categorize the architecture, e.g., "F" for areas of the [[frontal lobe]].

== The Nissl staining technique ==
The Nissl staining technique (named for [[Franz Nissl]] the neuroscientist and histologist who originated the technique) is commonly used for determining the cytoarchitectonics of neuroanatomical structures, using common agents such as [[thionin]], [[cresyl violet]], or [[neutral red]]. These dyes intensely stain "[[Nissl bodies]]" ([[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]), which are abundant in neurons and reveal specific patterns of cytoarchitecture in the brain. Other common staining techniques used by histologists in other tissues (such as the hematoxylin and eosin or "[[H&amp;E stain]]") leave brain tissue appearing largely homogeneous and do not reveal the level of organization apparent in a Nissl stain. Nissl staining reveals details ranging from the macroscopic, such as the laminar pattern of the cerebral cortex or the interlocking nuclear patterns of the diencephalon and brainstem, to the microscopic, such as the distinctions between individual neurons and [[glia]] in any subregion of the central nervous system. Many other neuroanatomic and cytoarchitectonic techniques are available to supplement Nissl cytoarchitectonics, including [[immunohistochemistry]] and [[in situ hybridization]], which allow one to label any [[gene]] or [[protein]] expressed in any group of cells in the brain. However, Nissl cytoarchitecture remains a reliable, inexpensive, and familiar starting or reference point for neuroscientists wishing to examine or communicate their findings in a widely recognized anatomical framework and/or in reference to neuroanatomical atlases which use the same technique.

A '''cytotechnologist''' is an allied health professional trained in cytotechnology.  Cytotechnologists evaluate specimens on glass slides using [[microscope]]s. In some [[Clinical laboratory|laboratories]], a computer performs an initial evaluation, indicating slides that are sufficiently normal that no human reading is needed, or pointing out areas that may be of particular interest for later examination. In many laboratories, cytotechnologists perform the initial evaluation.  The cytotechnologist performs a secondary evaluation and determines whether a specimen is normal or abnormal. Abnormal specimens are referred to a [[pathologist]] for final interpretation or [[medical diagnosis]].

Different countries have different certification requirements and standards for cytotechnologists.  In the United States there are currently two routes for certification: a person can first earn a baccalaureate degree and then attend an accredited program in cytotechnology for 1 year, or they can attend a cytotechnology program that also awards a baccalaureate degree. After successful completion of either route the individual becomes eligible to take a certification exam offered by the [[American Society for Clinical Pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org/certification/CertifyingExaminations American Society for Clinical Pathology, certification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321102925/http://www.ascp.org/certification/CertifyingExaminations/ |date=2006-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who complete the requirements and pass the examination are entitled to designate themselves as "CT (ASCP)".  The [[American Society for Cytotechnology]] (ASCT) sets U.S. professional standards, monitors legislative and regulatory issues, and provides education. Individual states regulate the licensure of cytotechnologists, usually following [[American Society of Cytopathology]] (ASC) guidelines.

The ASC is for [[cytopathologist]]s but certain qualified cytotechnologists can join it too.

'''Decellularization''' (also spelt '''decellularisation''' in British English) is the process used in biomedical engineering to isolate the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) of a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] from its inhabiting cells, leaving an ECM [[Tissue scaffold|scaffold]] of the original tissue, which can be used in [[artificial organ]] and tissue regeneration. [[Organ (anatomy)|Organ]] and tissue transplantation treat a variety of medical problems, ranging from end organ failure to cosmetic surgery.  One of the greatest limitations to organ transplantation derives from organ rejection caused by [[antibodies]] of the transplant recipient reacting to [[donor]] [[antigens]] on cell surfaces within the donor organ.&lt;ref&gt;Colaco, M., &amp; Atala, A. (2014). The Future of Transplant Biology and Surgery. Interdisciplinary Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of unfavorable [[Immune system|immune]] responses, transplant patients suffer a lifetime taking immunosuppressing medication. Stephen F. Badylak pioneered the process of decellularization at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Thomas W.|last2=Sellaro|first2=Tiffany L.|last3=Badylak|first3=Stephen F.|title=Decellularization of tissues and organs|journal=Biomaterials|date=14 February 2006|volume=27|pages=3675–3683|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.02.014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This process creates a natural [[biomaterial]] to act as a scaffold for cell growth, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] and tissue development. By recellularizing an ECM scaffold with a patient’s own cells, the adverse immune response is eliminated. Nowadays, commercially available ECM scaffolds are available for a wide variety of [[tissue engineering]].  Using peracetic acid to decellularize ECM scaffolds have been found to be false and only disinfects the tissue.

With a wide variety of decellularization-inducing treatments available, combinations of physical, [[chemical]], and enzymatic treatments are carefully monitored to ensure that the ECM scaffold maintains the structural and chemical integrity of the original tissue.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; Scientists can use the acquired ECM scaffold to reproduce a functional organ by introducing [[progenitor cell]]s, or [[adult stem cell]]s (ASCs), and allowing them to differentiate within the scaffold to develop into the desired tissue.

== Process overview ==
Researchers are able to take the tissue from a donor or [[cadaver]], [[Lysis|lyse]] and kill the cells within the tissue without damaging the extracellular components, and finish with a product that is the natural ECM scaffold that has the same physical and biochemical functions of the natural tissue.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;  After acquiring the ECM scaffold, scientists can recellularize the tissue with [[Cell potency|potent stem]] or progenitor cells that will differentiate into the original type of tissue.  By removing the cells from a donor tissue, the immunogenic antibodies from the donor will be removed.  The progenitor cells can be taken from the host, therefore they will not have an adverse response to the tissue.  This process of decellularizing tissues and organs is still being developed, but the exact process of taking a tissue from a donor and removing all the cellular components is considered to be the decellularization process. The steps to go from a decellularized ECM scaffold to a functional organ is under the umbrella of recellularization.  Because of the diverse applications of tissue in the human body, decellularization techniques have to be tailored to the specific tissue being exercised on. The researched methods of decellularization include physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments.  Though some methods are more commonly used, the exact combination of treatments is variable based on the tissue’s origin and what it is needed for.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

As far as introducing the different liquidized chemicals and [[enzyme]]s to an organ or tissue, [[perfusion]] and immersion decellularization techniques have been used. Perfusion decellularization is applicable when an extensive vasculature system is present in the organ or tissue. It is crucial for the ECM scaffold to be decellularized at all levels, and evenly throughout the structure.&lt;ref name="Perfusion 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ott|first1=H.C|title=Perfusion-decellularized matrix: using nature's platform to engineer a bioartificial heart.|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2008|volume=14|pages=213–221|doi=10.1038/nm1684|pmid=18193059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guyette|first1=Jacques P|last2=Gilpin|first2=Sarah E|last3=Charest|first3=Jonathan M|last4=Tapias|first4=Luis F|last5=Ren|first5=Xi|last6=Ott|first6=Harald C|title=Perfusion decellularization of whole organs|journal=Nature Protocols|date=29 May 2014|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1451–1468|doi=10.1038/nprot.2014.097|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v9/n6/abs/nprot.2014.097.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this requirement, vascularized tissues can have chemicals and enzymes perfused through the present arteries, veins, and capillaries. Under this mechanism and proper physiological conditions, treatments can diffuse equally to all of the cells within the organ. The treatments can be removed through the veins at the end of the process. Cardiac and pulmonary decellularization often uses this process of decellularization to introduce the treatments because of their heavily vascularized networks. Immersion decellularization is accomplished through the submersion of a tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. This process is more easily accomplished than [[perfusion]], but is limited to thin tissues with a limited vascular system.

== Physical treatments ==
The most common physical methods used to lyse, kill, and remove cells from the matrix of a tissue through the use of temperature, force and pressure, and electrical disruption. Temperature methods are often used in a rapid freeze-thaw mechanism. By quickly freezing a tissue, microscopic ice crystals form around the plasma membrane and the cell is lysed.&lt;ref name="Freeze-Thaw 1 Flynn 50"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=L.E.|title=The use of decellularized adipose tissue to provide an inductive microenvironment for the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells.|journal=Biomaterials|date=2010|volume=31|pages=4715–4724|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.046|pmid=20304481}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After lysing the cells, the tissue can be further exposed to liquidized chemicals that degrade and wash out the undesirable components. Temperature methods conserve the physical structure of the ECM scaffold, but are best handled by thick, strong tissues.

Direct force of pressure to a tissue will guarantee disruption of the ECM structure, so pressure is commonly used. Pressure decellularization involves the controlled use of [[hydrostatic pressure]] applied to a tissue or organ.  This is done best at high temperatures to avoid unmonitored ice crystal formation that could damage the scaffold. Electrical disruption of the plasma membrane is another option to lyse the cells housed in a tissue or organ.  By exposing a tissue to electrical pulses, micropores are formed at the plasma membrane. The cells eventually turn to death after their homeostatic electrical balance is ruined through the applied stimulus. This electrical process is documented as Non-thermal irreversible [[electroporation]] (NTIRE) and is limited to small tissues and the limited possibilities of inducing an electric current ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

== Chemical treatments ==
The proper combination of chemicals is selected for decellularization depending on the thickness, extracellular matrix composition, and intended use of the tissue or organ.  For example, enzymes would not be used on a collagenous tissue because they disrupt the connective tissue fibers. However, when [[collagen]] is not present in a high concentration or needed in the tissue, enzymes can be a viable option for decellularization. The chemicals used to kill and remove the cells include acids, alkaline treatments, [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] [[detergent]]s, non-ionic detergents, and [[zwitterion]]ic detergents.

The ionic detergent, [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS), is commonly used because of its high efficacy for lysing cells without significant damage to the ECM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ott|first=Harald C.|last2=Matthiesen|first2=Thomas S.|last3=Goh|first3=Saik-Kia|last4=Black|first4=Lauren D.|last5=Kren|first5=Stefan M.|last6=Netoff|first6=Theoden I.|last7=Taylor|first7=Doris A.|date=February 2008|title=Perfusion-decellularized matrix: using nature's platform to engineer a bioartificial heart|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=14|issue=2|pages=213–221|doi=10.1038/nm1684|issn=1546-170X|pmid=18193059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guyette|first=Jacques P.|last2=Gilpin|first2=Sarah E.|last3=Charest|first3=Jonathan M.|last4=Tapias|first4=Luis F.|last5=Ren|first5=Xi|last6=Ott|first6=Harald C.|date=2014|title=Perfusion decellularization of whole organs|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1451–1468|doi=10.1038/nprot.2014.097|issn=1750-2799|pmid=24874812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilpin|first=Sarah Elizabeth|last2=Guyette|first2=Jacques P.|last3=Gonzalez|first3=Gabriel|last4=Ren|first4=Xi|last5=Asara|first5=John M.|last6=Mathisen|first6=Douglas J.|last7=Vacanti|first7=Joseph P.|last8=Ott|first8=Harald C.|date=March 2014|title=Perfusion decellularization of human and porcine lungs: bringing the matrix to clinical scale|journal=The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation: The Official Publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation|volume=33|issue=3|pages=298–308|doi=10.1016/j.healun.2013.10.030|issn=1557-3117|pmid=24365767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detergents act effectively to lyse the cell membrane and expose the contents to further degradation. After SDS lyses the cell membrane, [[endonucleases]] and [[exonucleases]] degrade the genetic contents, while other components of the cell is solubilized and washed out of the matrix. SDS is commonly used even though it has a tendency to slightly disrupt the ECM structure. Akaline and acid treatments can be effective companions with an SDS treatment due to their ability to degrade [[nucleic acid]]s and solubilize [[cytoplasmic inclusion]]s.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

The most well known non-ionic detergent is [[Triton X-100]], which is popular because of its ability to disrupt the interactions between lipids and between [[lipid]]s and proteins. [[Triton X-100]] does not disrupt protein-protein interactions, which is beneficial to keeping the ECM intact. [[EDTA]] is a chelating agent that binds [[calcium]], which is a necessary component for proteins to interact with one another. By making calcium unavailable, [[EDTA]] prevents the integral proteins between cells from binding to one another.  EDTA is often used with trypsin, an enzyme that acts as a protease to cleave the already existing bonds between integral proteins of neighboring cells within a tissue.  Together, the EDTA-Trypsin combination make a good team for decellularizing tissues.

== Enzymatic treatments ==
Enzymes used in decellularization treatments are used to break the bonds and interactions between nucleic acids, interacting cells through neighboring proteins, and other cellular components. [[Lipase]]s, [[thermolysin]], [[galactosidase]], [[nucleases]], and [[trypsin]] have all been used in the removal of cells.  After a cell is lysed with a detergent, acid, physical pressure, etc., endonucleases and exonucleases can begin the degradation of the genetic material.  Endonucleases cleave DNA and RNA in the middle of sequences.  Benzoase, an endonuclease, produces multiple small nuclear fragments that can be further degraded and removed from the ECM scaffold.&lt;ref name=Benzoase&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersen|first1=T.H.|last2=Calle|first2=E.A.|last3=Zhao|first3=L.|last4=Lee|first4=E.J.|last5=Gui|first5=L.|last6=Raredon|first6=M.B.|title=Tissue-engineered lungs for in vivo implantation|journal=Science|date=2010|volume=329|issue=5991|pages=538–541|doi=10.1126/science.1189345|pmc=3640463}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exonucleases act at the end of DNA sequences to cleave the phosphodiester bonds and further degrade the nucleic acid sequences.

Enzymes such as trypsin act as proteases that cleave the interactions between proteins. Although trypsin can have adverse effects of collagen and elastin fibers of the ECM, using it in a time-sensitive manner controls any potential damage it could cause on the extracellular fibers. Dispase is used to prevent undesired aggregation of cells, which is beneficial in promoting their separating from the ECM scaffold.  Experimentation has shown dispase to be most effective on the surface of a thin tissue, such as a lung in pulmonary tissue regeneration.  To successfully remove deep cells of a tissue with dispase, mechanical agitation is often included in the process.

[[Collagenase]] is only used when the ECM scaffold product does not require an intact collagen structure. Lipases are commonly used when decellularized skin grafts are needed.  Lipase acids function in decellularizing dermal tissues through delipidation and cleaving the interactions between heavily lipidized cells. The enzyme, α-galactosidase is a relevant treatment when removing the Gal epitope antigen from cell surfaces.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

A natural ECM scaffold provides the necessary physical and biochemical environment to facilitate the growth and specialization of potent progenitor and stem cells.  Acellular matrices have been isolated ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' in a number of different tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Engineering Paper" /&gt; The most applicable success from decellularized tissues has come from symmetrical tissues that have less specialization, such as bone and dermal grafts; however, research and success is ongoing at the organ level.

Acellular dermal matrices have been successful in a number of different applications. For example, skin grafts are used in cosmetic surgery and burn care.  The decellularized skin graft provides mechanical support to the damaged area while supporting the development of host-derived connective tissue. Cardiac tissue has clinical success in developing human valves from natural ECM matrices.&lt;ref name="Myocardial tissue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=W.H.|title=Engineered heart tissue grafts improve systolic and diastolic function in infarcted rat hearts|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2004|volume=12|issue=4|pages=452–458|doi= 10.1038/nm1394|pmid=16582915}}&lt;/ref&gt; A technique known as the Ross procedure uses an acellular heart valve to replace a defective valve, allowing native cells to repopulate a newly functioning valve. Decellularized [[allografts]] have been critical in bone grafts that function in bone reconstruction and replacing of deformed bones in patients.

The limits to myocardial tissue engineering come from the ability to immediately perfuse and seed and implemented heart into a patient. Though the ECM scaffold maintains the [[protein]] and [[growth factor]]s of the natural tissue, the molecular level specialization has not yet been harnessed by researchers using decellularized heart scaffolds. Better success at using a whole organ from decellularization techniques has been found in pulmonary research. Scientists have been able to regenerate whole lungs ''in vitro'' from rat lungs using perfusion-decellularization. By seeding the matrix with [[Fetus|fetal]] rat lung cells, a functioning lung was produced.  The ''in vitro''-produced lung was successfully implemented into a rat, which attests to the possibilities of translating an ''in vitro'' produced organ into a patient.

Other success for decellularization has been found in small intestinal submucosa (SIS), renal, hepatic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazza|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Rombouts|first2=Krista|last3=Rennie Hall|first3=Andrew|last4=Urbani|first4=Luca|last5=Vinh Luong|first5=Tu|last6=Al-Akkad|first6=Walid|last7=Longato|first7=Lisa|last8=Brown|first8=David|last9=Maghsoudlou|first9=Panagiotis|last10=Dhillon|first10=Amar P.|last11=Fuller|first11=Barry|last12=Davidson|first12=Brian|last13=Moore|first13=Kevin|last14=Dhar|first14=Dipok|last15=De Coppi|first15=Paolo|last16=Malago|first16=Massimo|last17=Pinzani|first17=Massimo|title=Decellularized human liver as a natural 3D-scaffold for liver bioengineering and transplantation|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 August 2015|volume=5|pages=13079|doi=10.1038/srep13079|pmid=26248878|pmc=4528226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pancreatic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goh|first1=Saik-Kia|last2=Bertera|first2=Suzanne|last3=Olsen|first3=Phillip|last4=Candiello|first4=Joseph E.|last5=Halfter|first5=Willi|last6=Uechi|first6=Guy|last7=Balasubramani|first7=Manimalha|last8=Johnson|first8=Scott A.|last9=Sicari|first9=Brian M.|last10=Kollar|first10=Elizabeth|last11=Badylak|first11=Stephen F.|last12=Banerjee|first12=Ipsita|title=Perfusion-decellularized pancreas as a natural 3D scaffold for pancreatic tissue and whole organ engineering|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=28|pages=6760–6772|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.066|pmid=23787110|pmc=3748589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is a thin material, the SIS matrix can be decellularized through immersing the tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. Renal tissue engineering is still developing, but cadaveric kidney matrices have been able to support development of potent fetal kidney cells. Pancreatic engineering is a testament to the molecular specificity of organs. Scientists have not yet been able to produce an entirely functioning [[pancreas]], but they have had success in producing an organ that functions at specific segments. For example, diabetes in rats was shown to decrease by seeding a pancreatic matrix at specific sites.&lt;ref name="Engineering Paper" /&gt; The future applications of decellularized tissue matrix is still being discovered and is considered one of the most hopeful areas in regenerative research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20050">'''Radiation dosimetry''' in the fields of [[health physics]] and [[radiation protection]] is the measurement, calculation and assessment of the [[ionizing radiation]] dose absorbed by an object, usually the human body. This applies both internally, due to ingested or inhaled radioactive substances, or externally due to irradiation by sources of radiation.

[[Internal dosimetry]] assessment relies on a variety of monitoring, bio-assay or radiation imaging techniques, whilst external dosimetry is based on measurements with a [[dosimeter]], or inferred from measurements made by other radiological protection instruments.

Dosimetry is used extensively for radiation protection and is routinely applied to monitor occupational radiation workers, where irradiation is expected, or where radiation is unexpected, such as in the aftermath of the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]], [[Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] radiological release incidents.  The public dose take-up is measured and calculated from a variety of indicators such as ambient measurements of gamma radiation, radioactive particulate monitoring, and the measurement of levels of [[radioactive contamination]].

Other significant areas are medical dosimetry, where the required treatment [[absorbed dose]] and any collateral absorbed dose is monitored, and in environmental dosimetry, such as [[radon]] monitoring in buildings.

==Measuring radiation dose==

===External dose===
There are several ways of measuring absorbed doses from ionizing radiation. People in occupational contact with radioactive substances, or who may be exposed to radiation, routinely carry personal [[dosimeter]]s. These are specifically designed to record and indicate the dose received. Traditionally, these were lockets fastened to the external clothing of the monitored person, which contained photographic film known as [[film badge dosimeter]]s. These have been largely replaced with other devices such as the TLD badge which uses [[Thermoluminescent dosimetry]] or [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) badges.

A number of electronic devices known as Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPDs) have come into general use using semiconductor detection and programmable processor technology. These are worn as badges but can give an indication of instantaneous dose rate and an audible and visual alarm if a dose rate or a total integrated dose is exceeded. A good deal of information can be made immediately available to the wearer of the recorded dose and current dose rate via a local display. They can be used as the main stand-alone dosimeter, or as a supplement to such as a TLD badge. These devices are particularly useful for real-time monitoring of dose where a high dose rate is expected which will time-limit the wearer's exposure. 

The [[ICRP]] guidance states that if a personal dosimeter is worn on a position on the body representative of its exposure, assuming whole-body exposure, the value of personal dose equivalent Hp(10) is sufficient to estimate an effective dose value suitable for radiological protection.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP pub 103 para 138&lt;/ref&gt; Such devices are known as "legal dosimeters" if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes. In cases of non-uniform irradiation such personal dosimeters may not be representative of certain specific areas of the body, where additional dosimeters are used in the area of concern.

In certain circumstances, a dose can be inferred from readings taken by fixed instrumentation in an area in which the person concerned has been working. This would generally only be used if personal dosimetry had not been issued, or a personal dosimeter has been damaged or lost. Such calculations would take a pessimistic view of the likely received dose.

===Internal dose===
{{main article|Internal dosimetry}}
[[Internal dosimetry]] is used to evaluate the [[committed dose]] due to the intake of radionuclides into the human body. 


==Medical dosimetry==
{{Main article|Treatment planning}}
Medical dosimetry is the calculation of absorbed dose and optimization of dose delivery in [[radiation therapy]]. It is often performed by a professional health physicist with specialized training in that field. In order to plan the delivery of radiation therapy, the radiation produced by the sources is usually characterized with [[percentage depth dose curve]]s and [[dose profile]]s measured by [[Medical physics|medical physicists]].

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions are often evaluated using the dosimetry technique known as [[gel dosimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;C Baldock, Y De Deene, S Doran, G Ibbott, A Jirasek, M Lepage, KB McAuley, M Oldham, LJ Schreiner 2010. Polymer gel dosimetry. Physics in Medicine and Biology 55 (5) R1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental dosimetry==
Environmental Dosimetry is used where it is likely that the environment will generate a significant radiation dose. An example of this is [[radon]] monitoring. Radon is a radioactive gas generated by the decay of uranium, which is present in varying amounts in the earth's crust. Certain geographic areas, due to the underlying geology, continually generate radon which permeates its way to the earth's surface. In some cases the dose can be significant in buildings where the gas can accumulate. A number of specialised dosimetry techniques are used to evaluate the dose that a building's occupants may receive.

==Measures of dose==
{{Main article|sievert}}
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External radiation protection dose quantities in SI units]]
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of SI radiation dose units]]

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent and effective doses, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in [[radiation protection]] and dosimetry assessment the [[ICRP|International Committee on Radiation Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these.

===Units of measure===
There are a number of different measures of radiation dose, including [[absorbed dose]] (''D'') measured in: 
*[[gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy) energy absorbed per unit of mass ([[Joule|J]]·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Equivalent dose]] (''H'') measured in [[sievert]]s (Sv)
*[[Effective dose (radiation)|Effective dose]] (''E'') measured in sieverts 
*[[Kerma (physics)|Kerma]] (K) measured in grays 
*[[dose area product]]  (DAP) measured in gray centimeters&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*dose length product (DLP) measured in gray centimeters 
*[[rad (unit)|rads]] a deprecated unit of absorbed radiation dose, defined as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg
*[[Roentgen (unit)|Roentgen]] a legacy unit of measurement for the exposure of X-rays

Each measure is often simply described as ‘dose’, which can lead to confusion. Non-[[SI]] units are still used, particularly in the USA, where dose is often reported in rads and dose equivalent in [[Rontgen equivalent man|rems]].  By definition, 1 Gy = 100 rad and 1 Sv = 100 rem.

The fundamental quantity is the absorbed dose (''D''), which is defined as the mean energy imparted [by ionising radiation] (dE) per unit mass (dm) of material (D = dE/dm)&lt;ref name="Measurements 2011"&gt;International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU).Options for Characterizing Energy Deposition. Journal of the ICRU Vol 11 No 2 (2011) Report 86&lt;/ref&gt; The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) defined as one joule per kilogram. Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate stochastic risk provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0-50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.&lt;ref&gt;Feinendegen LE. The cell dose concept; potential application in radiation protection. 1990 Phys. Med. Biol. 35 597&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalent dose===
{{Main article|equivalent dose}}
The absorbed dose required to produce a certain biological effect varies between different types of radiation, such as [[photons]], [[neutrons]] or [[alpha particles]]. This is taken into account by the equivalent dose (H), which is defined as the mean dose to organ T by radiation type R (''D''&lt;sub&gt;T,R&lt;/sub&gt;), multiplied by a weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; . This designed to take into account the  [[RBE|biological effectiveness]] (RBE) of the radiation type,&lt;ref name="Measurements 2011"/&gt; For instance, for the same absorbed dose in Gy, alpha particles are 20 times as biologically potent as X or gamma rays. The measure of ‘dose equivalent’ is not organ averaged and now only used for "operational quantities". Equivalent dose is designed for estimation of stochastic risks from radiation exposures. Stochastic effect is defined for radiation dose assessment as the ''probability'' of cancer induction and genetic damage.&lt;ref&gt;The ICRP says "In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues" ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64&lt;/ref&gt;

As dose is averaged over the whole organ; equivalent dose is rarely suitable for evaluation of acute radiation effects or tumour dose in radiotherapy. In the case of estimation of stochastic effects, assuming a [[LNT model|linear dose response]], this averaging out should make no difference as the total energy imparted remains the same.

===Effective dose===
{{Main article|Effective dose (radiation)}}

Effective dose is the central dose quantity for radiological protection used to specify exposure limits to ensure that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to compare the stochastic risk from localised exposures of different parts of the body (e.g. a chest x-ray compared to a CT scan of the head), or to compare exposures of the same body part but with different exposure patterns (e.g. a cardiac CT scan with a cardiac nuclear medicine scan). One way to avoid this problem is to simply average out a localised dose over the whole body. The problem of this approach is that the stochastic risk of cancer induction varies from one tissue to another.

The effective dose ''E'' is designed to account for this variation by the application of specific weighting factors for each tissue (''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;). Effective dose provides the equivalent whole body dose that gives the same risk as the localised exposure. It is defined as the sum of equivalent doses to each organ (''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), each multiplied by its respective tissue weighting factor (''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;).

Weighting factors are calculated by the International Commission for Radiological Protection (ICRP), based on the risk of cancer induction for each organ and adjusted for associated lethality, quality of life and years of life lost. Organs that are remote from the site of irradiation will only receive a small equivalent dose (mainly due to scattering) and therefore contribute little to the effective dose, even if the weighting factor for that organ is high.

Effective dose is used to estimate stochastic risks for a ‘reference’ person, which is an average of the population. It is not suitable for estimating stochastic risk for individual medical exposures, and is not used to assess acute radiation effects.

==Dose versus source or field strength==
Radiation dose refers to the amount of energy deposited in matter and/or biological effects of radiation, and should not be confused with the unit of radioactive activity ([[becquerel]], Bq) of the source of radiation, or the strength of the radiation field (fluence).  The article on the [[sievert]] gives an overview of dose types and how they are calculated. Exposure to a source of radiation will give a dose which is dependent on many factors, such as the activity, duration of exposure, energy of the radiation emitted, distance from the source and amount of shielding.

===Background radiation===
The worldwide average background dose for a human being is about 3.5 mSv per year [https://web.archive.org/web/20031117124002/http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/baseline/bg_rad.pdf], mostly from [[cosmic radiation]] and natural [[isotope]]s in the earth.  The largest single source of radiation exposure to the general public is naturally occurring [[radon]] gas, which comprises approximately 55% of the annual background dose.  It is estimated that radon is responsible for 10% of lung cancers in the United States.

===Calibration standards for measuring instruments===
Because the human body is approximately 70% water and has an overall density close to 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, dose measurement is usually calculated and calibrated as dose to water.

National standards laboratories such as the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]] provide calibration factors for ionization chambers and other measurement devices to convert from the instrument's readout to absorbed dose. The standards laboratories operate a Primary Standard, which is normally calibrated by absolute [[calorimetry]], the warming of substances when they absorb energy. A user sends their Secondary Standard to the laboratory, where it is exposed to a known amount of radiation (derived from the Primary Standard) and a factor is issued to convert the instrument's reading to that dose. The user may then use their Secondary Standard to derive calibration factors for other instruments they use, which then become tertiary standards, or field instruments.

The [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]] in the UK operates a graphite-calorimeter for absolute photon dosimetry.  Graphite is used instead of water as its [[specific heat capacity]] is one-sixth that of water and therefore the temperature rises in graphite are 6 times more than the equivalent in water and measurements are more accurate.  Significant problems exist in insulating the graphite from the laboratory in order to measure the tiny temperature changes.  A lethal dose of radiation to a human is approximately 10–20 Gy.  This is 10-20 joules per kilogram.  A 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; piece of graphite weighing 2&amp;nbsp;grams would therefore absorb around 20–40 mJ.  With a specific heat capacity of around 700 J·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, this equates to a temperature rise of just 20 mK.

Dosimeters in radiotherapy ([[linear particle accelerator]] in external beam therapy) are routinely calibrated using [[ionization chamber]]s&lt;ref&gt;Hill R, Mo Z, Haque M, Baldock C, 2009. An evaluation of ionization chambers for the relative dosimetry of kilovoltage x-ray beams. Medical Physics. 36 3971-3981.&lt;/ref&gt; or diode technology or gel dosimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Baldock C, De Deene Y, Doran S, Ibbott G, Jirasek A, Lepage M, McAuley KB, Oldham M, Schreiner LJ, 2010.

==Radiation exposure monitoring==
Records of legal dosimetry results are usually kept for a set period of time, depending upon the legal requirements of the nation in which they are used.

[[Radiation Exposure Monitoring|Medical radiation exposure monitoring]] is the practice of collecting dose information from radiology equipment and using the data to help identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary dose in medical situations.

'''Eavesdropping''' is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private [[conversation]] or [[communication]]s of others without their consent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garner, p. 550{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal.

==Etymology==
The verb ''eavesdrop'' is a back-formation from the noun ''eavesdropper'' ("a person who eavesdrops"), which was formed from the related noun ''eavesdrop'' ("the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop|title=eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries, ''Inside the Court of Henry VIII'' (April 8, 2015)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Court of Henry VIII|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/inside-court-henry-viii/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace'' (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss "eavedrops", carved wooden figures [[Henry VIII]] had built into the [[eaves]] (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of [[Hampton Court]] to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King's wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stollznow, Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=August 7, 2014|title=Eavesdropping: etymology, meaning, and some creepy little statues|url=http://karenstollznow.com/eavesdropping/|website=KarenStollznow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include [[telephone]] lines, [[cellular network|cellular networks]], [[email]], and other methods of private instant messaging. [[VoIP]] communications software is also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping via infections such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small ''packets'' from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers; however, government agencies, such as the [[National Security Agency]], have also been connected.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works cover [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[Psalms]], and his major interests centered on the oral tradition behind written sources and in folklore.

== Biography ==
Gunkel was born in [[Springe]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]],&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; where his father and grandfather were [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]]s.&lt;ref name=briefhistory&gt;{{cite book | last=Gignilliat | first=Mark S. | title=A Brief History of Old Testament Criticism | year=2012 | publisher=Zondervan | location=Grand Rapids, MI | page=108 | chapter=Hermann Gunkel | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrJln5IwiZ8C&amp;pg=PT108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and the [[University of Giessen]]. He eventually taught at both universities in addition to those of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C | editor-last=McKim | editor-first=Donald K | first=M. J. | last=Buss | chapter=Gunkel, Hermann | title=Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters | year=2007 | publisher=InterVarsity Press | pages=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel started his career in [[New Testament]] studies at [[Göttingen]] in 1888. However, he was soon transferred to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1889-1894) and told to concentrate on the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the Prussian academic appointments authority. He went on to teach in [[Berlin]] (1894-1907), where he made many inter-disciplinary contacts. His 1895 book, ''Creation and Chaos in the Primeval Era and the Eschaton'', compared the symbolism in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12. In 1901, he produced the first of three editions of commentary on Genesis, ''Genesis Translated and Explained''.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

In 1907, Gunkel finally obtained a full professorship at the [[University of Giessen]]. There he produced the third and final edition of ''Genesis'' in 1910 and ''The Prophets'' in 1917. He moved to the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1920. He published another standard work, his commentary on the book of [[Psalms]], ''The Psalms: Translated and Explained'' in 1926. ''Introduction to the Psalms'' was his last major project, brought to completion by his student [[Joachim Begrich]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

Gunkel founded the series ''Research into the Religion and Literature of the Old and New Testaments'' (1903-) with [[Wilhelm Bousset]].&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; He also co-edited with Leopold Zscharnack the second edition of the German religious encyclopedia ''Religion in History and the Present'' (1927-1931), in which he authored over one hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Psalms: A Form-Critical Introduction | url=http://www.ericlevy.com/revel/Psalms/Gunkel%20H%20-%20The%20Psalms%20-%20A%20Form-Critical%20Introduction%20Abridged.PDF | first=James | last=Muilenburg | author-link=James Muilenburg|chapter=Introduction | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1967 | page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel became a leading representative of the "[[history of religions school]]" (''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule''), which addressed the history of traditions behind the biblical text. In addition to Gunkel, the original group also included [[Albert Eichhorn]], [[William Wrede]], Heinrich Hackmann, [[Alfred Rahlfs]], [[Johannes Weiss]], [[Wilhelm Bousset]], [[Ernst Troeltsch]], and [[Wilhelm Heitmüller]].&lt;ref name=ludemann&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Form criticism examined the genres used in the biblical text to identify the ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' (setting in life) that produced the text. This approach was based on the assumption that each genre is organically associated with a particular social and historical situation. Nineteenth-century [[source criticism]] had examined the biblical text, especially the [[Pentateuch]], on the basis of style, vocabulary, theology, and other criteria to identify the basic literary sources used to create the text. Form criticism allowed scholars to go behind these larger literary sources by identifying the smaller and older sources used by their authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Form Criticism |url=http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t94/e693 |work=Oxford Biblical Studies Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its utility, form criticism became immensely influential in Germany and Europe during the 20th century, with important scholars like [[Gerhard von Rad]] and [[Martin Noth]] applying and developing it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">'''Hierotopy''' (from {{lang-grc|ἱερός}}, sacred + {{lang-grc|τόπος}}, place, space) is the creation of [[sacred]] spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002  by [[Russia]]n art-historian and [[Byzantinism|byzantinist]] [[Alexei Lidov]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy. The creation of sacred spaces as a form of creativity and subject of cultural history" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.Lidov, Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2006, pp. 32-58&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious [[image]]s, [[ritual]], [[song]], [[incense]], [[light]]) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[religious studies]], but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Pavel Florensky]]) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. Though related with religious [[mysticism]], hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. 

According to the hierotopic approach, [[icon]]s and other sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the erection of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]], as well as the work of [[Abbot Suger]] in the conception of first [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642&lt;/ref&gt; architectural compounds &lt;ref&gt;G. Zelenskaya. "New Jerusalem near Moscow. Aspects of the Conception and New Discoveries" in: ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 745-773&lt;/ref&gt; and even cities&lt;ref&gt;E. Kirichenko. "The Church and the City: on the Symbolic and Structural Unity of the Russian Sacred Space" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 292-322&lt;/ref&gt; and countries&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Петрухин, Владимир Яковлевич|V. Petrukhin]]. "Hierotopy of the Russian Land and the Primary Chronicle" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow, 2006, pp. 480-490&lt;/ref&gt; have become products of hierotopic creativity. 

The topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture &lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts&lt;ref&gt;L. Beliaev. "The Hierotopy of the Orthodox Feast: on the National Traditions in the Making of Sacred Spaces" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 270-291&lt;/ref&gt; and folk customs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moroz. "Sacred and Horrible Places. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Traditional Culture" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 259-269&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest.&lt;ref&gt;N. Isar. "Vision and Performance. A Hierotopic Approach to Contemporary Art", in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 341-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chegodaev. "The Hierotopy of the Ancient Egyptian Sarcophagus" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 18-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six international [[symposium|symposia]] (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.

== Spatial icons ==
The concept of the ''[[spatial icon]]'' plays a central role in  hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009, Ch. 2. Spatial Icons. The miraculous performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople. pp. 39-70, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of "sacred landscapes", such as the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the [[Donkey walk]] in [[medieval]] Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp.533-562&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of sacred spaces ==
The transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a [[theophany]], such as a divine visitation or omen, this  primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or [[temple]]s as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the [[First Temple]], as recounted in the [[Old Testament]], can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the [[Tabernacle]]. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype.  Multiple "New Jerusalems" (reproductions of the Holy City of [[Jerusalem]]), aimed to establish a link to the space of the [[Holy Land]], are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image-paradigms ==
The perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of ''image-paradigms''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-paradigms as a category of visual culture. Hierotopic approach to the art history", ''Russian Journal of Art History(Iskusstvoznanie)'', 2011, No 3-4, pp.109-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-Paradigms as a Notion of Mediterranean Visual Culture: a Hierotopic Approach to Art History" in ''Crossing Cultures. Papers of  the International Congress of Art History. CIHA-2008'', Melbourne, 2009, pp.177-183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], which was present in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Quentin_Massys_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_National_Gallery_of_Scotland.jpg|200px|thumb|16th-century painting of a [[civil law notary]], by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]]. A civil law notary is roughly analogous to a common law [[solicitor]], except that, unlike solicitors, civil law notaries do not practice litigation.]]

The [[legal profession]] has its origins in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the [[Lawsuit|cause]] of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of [[Claudius]], lawyers (''iuris consulti'') could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the [[Byzantine Empire]]: [[advocate]]s acquired more status, and a separate class of [[Notary|notaries]] (''tabelliones'') appeared.

In [[Western Europe]], the legal profession went into decline during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], re-emerging during the 12th and 13th centuries in the form of experts on [[canon law]]. The profession started to be regulated and to extend its reach to civil as well as ecclesiastical law.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
The earliest people  who could be described as "lawyers" were probably the [[orators]] of ancient [[Athens]] (see [[History of Athens]]). However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a "friend" for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession&amp;mdash;with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance&amp;mdash;like their modern counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly&amp;mdash;but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complain that there was no money in working as an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"&gt;Crook, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby. Advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt; Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so "precise, detailed, and technical."&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt;

During the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]], jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation. This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession. By the start of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey'', vol. 1 ([[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman, OK]]: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schulz, ''History of Roman Legal Science'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1946), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Fritz Schulz, "by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 508–510.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing the need for a separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, [[Leo I the Thracian|Emperor Leo]] imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 512–513.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius's fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]].&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"&gt;Jones, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, it was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a ''sub rosa'' [[barter (economics)|barter]] transaction.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt; The latter was cause for disbarment.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt;

The notaries (''tabelliones'') appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"&gt;Jones, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; Roman notaries were not law-trained; they were often barely literate, with an unfavorable reputation for wrapping simple transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Pieter Brueghel the Younger - Village Lawyer - WGA3633.jpg|300px|thumb|''Village Lawyer'' by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], 1621 ]]

After the fall of the western Empire and the onset of the Dark Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed. As James Brundage has explained: "[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term 'professional.' "&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brundage, "The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century," &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;20 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 185&lt;/span&gt; (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1150 onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in [[canon law]] but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The legal profession's return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231 two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the papal legate in London in 1237.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, Frederick II, the emperor of the Kingdom of Sicily, imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1250 the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"&gt;Brundage, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"/&gt; The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of deceit, and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1990), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
ITC was founded in 1950 with the name International Training Centre for Aerial Survey by the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Prof. Dr. [[Willem Schermerhorn]] to provide training in map making as an aid to developing countries. Over the years its mission has been adjusted to changing technological and development realities, so that today it offers [[MSc]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], Diploma and Certificate courses in Geo-information Science (GIS) and Earth Observation (EO) with emphasis on applications in developing countries. ITC promotes [[PhD]] Research in collaboration with universities in the Netherlands. In addition, ITC undertakes applied and technological consultancy projects world wide and contributes to fundamental research in the fields of its expertise.

==Education at ITC ==
More than 19,000 students from over 170 countries have followed ITC courses since 1950. The institute's degrees are accredited by the Dutch system of higher education.

ITC offers degree, diploma and certificate courses in geo-information science and earth observation applied to eight domains: Disaster management; Earth sciences; Geoinformatics; Governance; Land administration; Natural resources; Urban planning; and Water resources.

ITC has several joint educational programmes with partner institutes in the developing world, for example joint MSc programmes in geo-hazards with the [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]] in [[Dehradun]], [[India]] and [[Gadjah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. It also offers much of its curriculum as distance education modules, and offers custom training courses to meet specific capacity building requirements, both in Enschede and abroad.

The '''Experimental Medicine and Biology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental}}, IByME) is a [[research and development]] centre affiliated to the [[University of Buenos Aires]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

==History==
The institute was privately founded on March 14, 1944 by Dr. [[Bernardo A. Houssay]], [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] and [[Medicine]] (1947) for his work in [[diabetes]] and the control of the [[carbohydrate]] [[metabolism]]. Drs. [[Eduardo Braun-Menéndez]], [[Oscar Orías]], [[Juan T. Lewis]] and [[Virgilio G. Foglia]] were co-founders. The founding of the Institute was motivated by the dismissal of Dr. Houssay, together with 150 other professors from the [[University of Buenos Aires]], by the military government. Dr. Houssay became its director and brought to work with him several colleagues and students. The initiative was made possible by the support of Dr. [[Miguel F. Laphitzondo]] and others who granted financial contributions in memory of [[Juan B. Sauberán]].

The institute was the first organization devoted to [[scientific research]] in Argentina.  Its initial structure resembled that of the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] (now [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States) and of the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France. In 1949, the Institute was established as a [[charter]]ed [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] recognized by the National Bureau of Non-Profit Entitites (''Registro Nacional de Entidades de Bien Público'').

Later on, several Houssay’s disciples left the Institute to settle research groups in many Argentine and other [[Latin American]] universities. Many research laboratories were founded following the model of Houssay’s Institute. For example, Dr. [[Miguel Rolando Covian]] chaired the Department of Physiology of the [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto|Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto]] of the [[University of São Paulo]] from 1952 to 1986, giving origin to a large scientific group in [[Brazil]].

On January 16, 1959, Eduardo Braun Menéndez, who played an outstanding role in the life of the Institute, died. His vacancy in the Board of Directors was filled by Dr. [[Luis F. Leloir]] who would later receive the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] (1970).

After Dr. Houssay and others were reintegrated into the University of Buenos Aires, in 1959, the Institute was affiliated to this University, remaining so until today. Dr. Bernardo Houssay was the director of the Institute until his death in 1971. Thereupon, an Administrative Commission led by Prof. Dr. Virgilio Foglia, assisted by Dr. Julia V. Uranga and Dr. Luis F. Leloir, undertook the Institute's affairs. The Institute established legal associations with the [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council]].

The death of Prof. Dr. Luis F. Leloir, in December 1987, and the growth of the Institute prompted the need of increasing the number of members in the Administrative Commission. Accordingly, the necessary changes in the Institute Bylaws were submitted to the National Bureau of Legal Entitites (''Dirección General de Personas Jurídicas'') for approval. While the new Bylaws were under consideration, Drs. Alberto Baldi, Jorge Blaquier, Ricardo Calandra, Eduardo Charreau, Alejandro De Nicola, Enrique Segura, Alicia Roldán, Enrique del Castillo, Carlos Libertun, and Marta Tesone collaborated with Dr. Virgilio G. Foglia and Dr. Uranga in the administration of the Institute.

On July 12, 1993, the Institute was given the status of a Unit of Technological Transfer by the Argentinian Secretary of Science and Technology. This enabled the participation of technological and scientific sectors as consultants to productive sectors, public or private, both in the selection and adaptation of available technology and in the transfer of results derived from research.

==Activities==

The interests of the Institute can be grouped into three categories: 
* Basic and applied investigations in [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]];
* Training of students and pre- and postdoctoral fellows; and
* Organization of courses at pre- and post-graduate levels.

The Institute is the site for the Argentine Committee of the Postdoctoral Program of selection of postdoctoral research fellowships in the area of Biomedical Sciences granted by [[John E. Fogarty International Center]] from the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]]; such Committee being chaired by Dr. Eduardo Charreau.

Historically, the main discoveries were in the fields of [[endocrinology]] and physiology.  The current research areas are wider and include [[Neurosciences]], [[Biology of Reproduction]], Experimental [[Oncology]] and [[Immunology]].  Results are published in journals of international recognition, thus demonstrating the level of excellence reached by the different research groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">'''Interindividual differences in perception''' describes the effect that differences in brain structure or factors such as culture, upbringing and environment have on the [[perception]] of humans.
Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand [[human behavior]]. With the help of modern [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in  behavior and [[cognition]] across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of [[illusion]]s, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as [[culture]], [[Human genetics|genetics]] and the [[Human ecology|environment]] can influence human behavior.

==Optical Illusions==

===Bistable Motion===

 }}

A motion quartet is a [[Bistability|bistable]] stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the [[aspect ratio]] of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the [[visual system]]. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias.&lt;ref name="metastable anisotropy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Metastable motion anisotropy. | author=Chaudhuri, Avi | journal=Visual Neuroscience | year=1991 | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=397–407 | pmid=1764411 | doi=10.1017/s0952523800009706}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others.
A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences.&lt;ref name="Genç bistable"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008773 | title=Interhemispheric Connections Shape Subjective Experience of Bistable Motion | author= Genç, Erhan | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 |  volume=21 | issue=17 | pages=1494–1499 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.003| pmid=21885284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object size estimation===
There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the [[Ebbinghaus illusion|Ebbinghaus]] and the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]] illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human [[Perspective (visual)#Linear perspective|perspective]] processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al.&lt;ref name="surface_V1" /&gt; found that the size of the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|primary visual cortex (V1)]] has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect).&lt;ref name="surface_V1"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n1/full/nn.2706.html | title=The surface area of human V1 predicts the subjective experience of object size | author=Schwarzkopf, D Samuel | journal=Nature Neuroscience | volume=14 | year=2011 | issue=1 | pages=28–30 | doi=10.1038/nn.2706 | pmid=21131954 | pmc=3012031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory Illusions==

===McGurk Effect===
The [[McGurk effect]] is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable "ba" is presented while the mouth movement is "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion.&lt;ref name="McGurk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception" ''Experimental Brain Research'' 167(1), 66-75. McGurk, H., &amp; MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the [[fuzzy logic]] model of speech perception&lt;ref name="fuzzy speech"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oden | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | year = 1978 | title = Integration of featural information in speech perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 172–191 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.85.3.172 | pmid=663005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as "da".

Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus(STS)]].&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = M. S. | year = 2012 | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 781–787 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 | pmid=21787869 | pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is critical for the [[multisensory integration]] of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover,  there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS  correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived.

In one study&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath" /&gt; [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non-perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory "ba" + visual "ga" producing perception of "da"),  and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory "ga" + visual "ba" producing auditory perception of "ga"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3T7LWIkP8|title=McGurk effect: Auditory "ba" + Visual "ga"|first=|last=anathfMRI|date=18 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration.&lt;ref name="TMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Nath | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Pasalar | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals that the superior temporal sulcus is a cortical locus of the McGurk effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7| pages = 2414–2417 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4865-09.2010 | pmid=20164324 | pmc=2844713}}&lt;/ref&gt; They applied single pulses of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) to the STS of McGurk perceivers during presentation of McGurk stimuli. The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect.

Moreover, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurler | first1 = D. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N. | last3 = Walker | first3 = E. | last4 = Magnotti | first4 = J. | last5 = Beauchamp | first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = A link between individual differences in multisensory speech perception and eye movements | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1333–1341 | doi=10.3758/s13414-014-0821-1| pmc = 4437244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker’s face. The experimenters carried out an [[eye tracking]] study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker.

===Other auditory illusions===
[[File:Pitch class space.svg|thumb|right|Representation of the [[pitch class]] circle with respect to tone height]]
Interindividual differences have also been researched for the '''[[Tritone paradox]] illusion'''. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half [[octave]]. Each tone is made of a set of [[harmonics]] which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to [[Diana Deutsch]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"&gt;Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt; the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the [[pitch class]] with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"/&gt; found that for people from [[California]], the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern [[England]] it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.

Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the '''phantom words illusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=211|title=Diana Deutsch - Phantom Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinn-Cunningham | first1 = B.G. | year = 2008 | title = Object-based auditory and visual attention | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 182–186 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.003| pmc = 2699558}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed.

==Effect of Culture on Perception==
[[File:Frame_and_Line_Test.svg|thumb|height=width|right|The framed line test]]
Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object perception]] and [[attention]] deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as [[theory of mind]] and [[emotion recognition]]).&lt;ref name= "Culture_and_self"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly [[Western World|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an ''analytical'' culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a ''holistic'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JB|last2=Rule|first2=NO|last3=Ambady|first3=N|title=The cultural neuroscience of person perception|journal=Progress in Brain Research|date=2009|volume=178|pages=191–201|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17813-5|pmid=19874970|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444533616}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[individualism]] and [[freedom]] are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on [[collectivism]] and [[interdependence]] on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=RE|last2=Peng|first2=K|last3=Choi|first3=I|last4=Norenzayan|first4=A|title=Culture and systems of thought: holistic versus analytic cognition.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 2001|volume=108|issue=2|pages=291–310|pmid=11381831|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003).&lt;ref name="New Look"/&gt; The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, [[United States|Americans]] and [[Japan]]ese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context.

In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009)&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedden|first1=T.|last2=Mormino|first2=E. C.|last3=Amariglio|first3=R.

Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing  the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with [[attentional control]] in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture.&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"/&gt;

A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutchess|first1=AH|last2=Welsh|first2=RC|last3=Boduroglu|first3=A|last4=Park|first4=DC|title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing.|journal=Cognitive, affective &amp; behavioral neuroscience|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=102–9|pmid=17007231|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of ''only the object'' pictures, ''object with background'' pictures and ''only the background'' pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

'''Jugend debattiert international''' is a German-language [[debating]] competition for students based on the national German pupils' contest ''Jugend debattiert''. It is held in ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] ([[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]), [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Hungary]]. The project is funded by the [[Goethe-Institut]], the [[Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"]], the Hertie Foundation and the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad (Zentralstelle für das Auslandsschulwesen). There are local supporters in three countries: In Czech Republic the project is supported by the Czech-German Future Fund, in Lithuania by the Lithuanian Information and Technology Center for students. In Poland Jugend debattiert international is supported by the Foundation for Polish-German Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Competition==
''Jugend debattiert international'' is the only international German-language debating contest for students.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It helps young people in Central and Eastern Europe to advocate their views and opinions and represents and promotes the German language as a medium of [[debate]]. Beyond supporting language acquisition, it strengthens conversation skills and promotes a deeper understanding of [[democracy]]. Thus the project not only encourages democracy, but also works towards the formation of an international young elite. The debates revolve around topics such as school life, [[fundamental rights]], history (especially historical experiences of injustice), and [[Europe]]. ''Jugend debattiert international'' targets students from 10th grade onwards who master German at least to the level of B2 of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/wettbewerb/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015/16 more than 2300 students at 157 schools took part in the competition. The project is integrated into the curriculum. In class students are trained in the rules of debating and enter the competition on a school level. The best students compete the next stages of the competition: school district and national level. The winners (first and second) from each of the eight countries will finally compete in the international finale. Since the fourth international finale 2010 in Berlin, the winners of the German competition ''Jugend debattiert'' support them as advisors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/wettbewerb/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and evaluation of the debates==
The format of the [[debate]] is strictly set up: Four students, two on the ''pro'' side, two on the ''contra'' side, debate for 24 minutes in German language on socio-political issues (e.g., "Should Turkey accede to the European Union?"). The debate starts with an opening round in which every participant has two minutes to outline his or her position. In the following twelve minutes the four debaters can exchange their arguments without strict regulations. During the final round the participants have one minute each to reflect on the arguments and summarize their final position in the light of the debate.
A jury of three evaluates the debate according to the following points: expertise, eloquence, conversational competence and persuasiveness. Language skills are not included in the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/die-debatte/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Jugend debattiert international'' was first carried out in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2005. Since 2006, schools in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine have been taking part in the project. In 2009 Moscow and Saint Petersburg joined the competition after a two-year pilot phase.
In 2007, students from all seven countries and Germany met for the first international finale in [[Prague]] under the auspices of the former president of Czech Republic, [[Václav Havel]]. Winners of the first international finale were Jakub Štefela from [[Liberec]], Czech Republic and Peer Klüßendorf from [[Rostock]], Germany. The Second international finale took place in October 2008 in ''Warsaw'' under the auspices of the [[Sejm Marshal]] of the Republic of Poland, Mr. [[Bronislaw Komorowski]]. Barbara Wasilewska from Warsaw, Poland and Wiebke Neelsen from [[Wismar]], Germany, won this competition. In February 2010 the third international finale took place in Prague. Jitka Rutrlová from Prague, Czech Republic and Maximilian Behrens from [[Münster]], Germany, were the winners of the final debate. The fourth international finale was held in [[Berlin]] in November 2010. Irina Avdeeva from Russia was awarded first place in competition 2009/2010 after the final debate. In 2011 the international final took place for the fifth time in [[Kiev]], Ukraine. Annett Lymar from Estonia won the final debate. In 2012 the sixth international final was won by the Hungarian student Gréta Szabó from [[Budapest]]. The international final was held for the seventh time in 2013 in [[Budapest]]. Dominika Perlínová from the Czech Republic was announced as the international winner. The 8th international final took place in Warsaw. Anastasija Minitš from Estonia won this year´s competition. In 2015 the international finale was held for the 9th time in Latvian capital Riga. The international winner was Anna Ryan from Hungary. From 2016 on, Slovakia and Slovenia take part in the project. In this year the international final took place in Prague and Khoi Nguyen won in his hometown.

'''Kelp forests''' are underwater areas with a high density of [[kelp]]. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic [[ecosystem]]s on Earth.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"&gt;Mann, K.H. 1973. Seaweeds: their productivity and strategy for growth. Science 182: 975-981.&lt;/ref&gt;   Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called '''kelp beds'''.

Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout [[temperate]] and [[polar region|polar]] coastal oceans.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"/&gt; In 2007, kelp forests were also discovered in [[tropical]] waters near [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="Graham et al. 2007"&gt;Graham, M.H., B.P.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 104: 16576-16580.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in [[Trophic dynamics|trophic]] ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem. For example, kelp forests can influence coastal [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] patterns&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G.A. and C.D. Winant. 1983. Effect of a kelp forest on coastal currents. Continental Shelf Report 2: 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and provide many [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"&gt;Steneck, R.S., M.H. Graham, B.J. Bourque, D. Corbett, [[Jon Erlandson|J.M.

However, the influence of humans has often contributed to kelp forest degradation. Of particular concern are the effects of [[overfishing]] nearshore ecosystems, which can release [[herbivore]]s from their normal population regulation and result in the overgrazing of kelp and other algae.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"&gt;Sala, E., C.F.

== Kelp ==
{{main|Kelp}}

The term [[kelp]] refers to [[marine algae]] belonging to the [[Order (biology)|order]] Laminariales (phylum: [[Heterokontophyta]]). Though not considered a taxonomically diverse order, kelps are highly diverse structurally and functionally.&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"/&gt; The most widely recognized species are the giant kelps (''[[Macrocystis]]'' spp.), although numerous other genera such as ''[[Laminaria]]'', ''[[Ecklonia]]'', ''[[Lessonia (alga)|Lessonia]]'', ''[[Alaria (alga)|Alaria]]'', and ''[[Eisenia (alga)|Eisenia]]'' are described.

A wide range of sea life uses kelp forests for protection or food, including fish. In the North Pacific kelp forests, particularly [[Sebastidae|rockfish]], and many [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[amphipod]]s, [[shrimp]], [[marine snail]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[brittle star]]s. Many marine mammals and birds are also found, including seals, sea lions, whales, [[sea otter]]s, gulls, terns, [[snowy egret]]s, [[great blue heron]]s, and cormorants, as well as some shore birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/kelplives.html Kelp forests provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, and birds] NOAA. Updated 11 January 2013. Retrieved 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently considered an [[ecosystem engineer]], kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.G., J. H. Lawton and M. Shachak. 1997. Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers. Ecology 78: 1946-1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In algae (kingdom [[Protista]]), the body of an individual organism is known as a [[thallus]] rather than as a plant (kingdom [[Plantae]]). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus.
:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features.
:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.
In addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.

The environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock or sand), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose &gt; 50 E m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"&gt;Druehl, L.D. 1981. The distribution of Laminariales in the North Pacific with reference to environmental influences. Proceedings of the International Congress on Systematic Evolution and Biology 2: 248-256.&lt;/ref&gt;). Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic [[upwelling]], a process that delivers cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s [[mixed layer|mixed surface layer]].&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"/&gt; Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, W.N. 1980. Effect of boundary layer transport on the fixation of carbon by the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera''. Marine Biology 56: 103-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (''Macrocystis'' spp.) can grow as much as 30–60&amp;nbsp;cm vertically per day. Some species, such as ''Nereocystis'', are [[annual plant|annual]]s, while others such as ''Eisenia'' are [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, living for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Steneck, R.S. and M.N. Dethier. 1994. A functional group approach to the structure of algal-dominated communities. Oikos 69: 476-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods, and increased storm frequency.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;

Kelps are primarily associated with [[temperate]] and [[arctic]] waters worldwide. Of the more dominant genera, ''Laminaria'' is mainly associated with both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the coasts of [[China]] and [[Japan]]; ''Ecklonia'' is found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]; and ''Macrocystis'' occurs throughout the northeastern and southeastern [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Southern Ocean]] archipelagos, and in patches around Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt; The region with the greatest diversity of kelps (&gt;20 species) is the northeastern Pacific, from north of [[San Francisco, California]], to the [[Aleutian Islands]], Alaska.

Although kelp forests are unknown in tropical surface waters, a few species of ''Laminaria'' have been known to occur exclusively in tropical deep waters.&lt;ref&gt;Joly, A.B. and E.C. Oliveira Filho. 1967. Two Brazilian ''Laminarias''. Instituto de Pesquisas da Marinha 4: 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrov, J.E., M.V. Suchovejeva and G.V. Avdejev. 1973. New species of the genus ''Laminaria'' from the Philippines Sea. Nov Sistem. Nizch. Rast. 10: 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; This general absence of kelp from the tropics is believed to be mostly due to insufficient nutrient levels associated with warm, [[oligotroph]]ic waters.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt; One recent study spatially overlaid the requisite physical parameters for kelp with mean oceanographic conditions has produced a model predicting the existence of subsurface kelps throughout the tropics worldwide to depths of 200 m. For a hotspot in the [[Galapagos Islands]], the local model was improved with fine-scale data and tested; the research team found thriving kelp forests in all eight of their sampled sites, all of which had been predicted by the model, thus validated their approach. This suggests that their global model might actually be fairly accurate, and if so, kelp forests would be prolific in tropical subsurface waters worldwide.&lt;ref name="Graham et al. 2007"/&gt; The importance of this contribution has been rapidly acknowledged within the scientific community and has prompted an entirely new trajectory of kelp forest research, particularly emphasizing the potential for a spatial refuge from climate change also the  explanations to evolutionary patterns of kelps worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Santelices, B. 2007.

The architecture of a kelp forest ecosystem is based on its physical structure, which influences the associated species that define its community structure. Structurally, the ecosystem includes three guilds of kelp and two guilds occupied by other algae:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
*Canopy kelps include the largest species and often constitute floating canopies that extend to the ocean surface (e.g., ''Macrocystis'' and ''Alaria'').
*Stipitate kelps generally extend a few meters above the sea floor and can grow in dense aggregations (e.g., ''Eisenia'' and ''Ecklonia'').
*Prostrate kelps lie near and along the sea floor (e.g., ''Laminaria'').
*The [[benthic]] assemblage is composed of other algal species (e.g., filamentous and foliose functional groups, articulated corallines) and sessile organisms along the ocean bottom.
*Encrusting coralline algae directly and often extensively cover geologic substrate.

Multiple kelp species often co-exist within a forest; the term understory canopy refers to the stipitate and prostrate kelps. For example, a ''Macrocystis'' canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the kelps ''Eisenia'' and ''Pterygophora'' reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these kelps, a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt; Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies.&lt;ref name="Foster 1985"&gt;Foster, M.S. and D.R. Schiel. 1985. The ecology of giant kelp forests in California: a community profile. US Fish and Wildlife Service Report 85: 1-152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham2004"&gt;Graham, M.H. 2004.

Gillanders, S.D. Connell and A.D. Irving. 2005. Patterns of association between canopy-morphology and understory assemblages across temperate Australia. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]] 63: 133-141.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California, ''Macrocystis pyrifera'' forests, the [[nudibranch]] ''[[Melibe leonina]]'', and [[skeleton shrimp]] ''Caprella californica'' are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch ''Brachyistius frenatus'', rockfish ''[[Sebastes]]'' spp., and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; [[brittle stars]] and turban snails ''[[Tegula (gastropod)|Tegula]]'' spp. are closely associated with the kelp holdfast, while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and [[benthic]] fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various [[gastropods]], and [[echinoderms]] live over the encrusting coralline algae.&lt;ref name="Foster 1985"/&gt; In addition, [[pelagic fish]]es and [[marine mammals]] are loosely associated with kelp forests, usually interacting near the edges as they visit to feed on resident organisms.

== Trophic ecology ==

Classic studies in kelp forest ecology have largely focused on trophic interactions (the relationships between organisms and their [[food webs]]), particularly the understanding and top-down trophic processes. Bottom-up processes are generally driven by the abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher trophic levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G.A. 1977. Nutrients and production of giant kelp, ''Macrocystis pyrifera'', off southern California. Limnology and Oceanography 22: 979-995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayton1999"&gt;Dayton, P.K. M.J. Tegner, P.B. Edwards and K.L. Riser. 1999. Temporal and spatial scales of kelp demography: the role of the oceanographic climate. Ecological Monographs 69: 219-250.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, M.H. 1994. Effects of macroalgal dynamics on recruitment of a temperate reef fish. Ecology 75: 1320-1333.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower trophic levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests,&lt;ref name="Estes1995"&gt;[[James A. Estes|Estes, J.A.]] and D.O. Duggins. 1995. Sea otters and kelp forests in Alaska: generality and variation in a community ecological paradigm. Ecological Monographs 65: 75-100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sea otters]] (''Enhydra lutris'') control populations of herbivorous [[sea urchins]] through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results in the loss of physical ecosystem structure and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the [[keystone species]] that mediates this [[trophic cascade]]. In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the [[California sheephead]]. The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the trophic levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins.&lt;ref name="Graham2004"/&gt; However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp forest degradation.&lt;ref name="Pearse&amp;Hines"&gt;Pearse, J.S. and A.H.

The transition from macroalgal (i.e. kelp forest) to denuded landscapes dominated by sea urchins (or ‘urchin barrens’) is a widespread phenomenon,&lt;ref name ="Steneck 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J.M. 1975.

Buschmann. 2006. Long term variability in the structure of kelp communities in northern Chile and the 1997-98 ENSO. Journal of Applied Phycology 18: 505-519.&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery from intermediate states of deterioration is less predictable and depends on a combination of abiotic factors and biotic interactions in each case.

Though urchins are usually the dominant herbivores, others with significant interaction strengths include [[starfish|seastars]], [[isopods]], kelp [[crabs]], and herbivorous fishes.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sala&amp;Graham"/&gt; In many cases, these organisms feed on kelp that has been dislodged from substrate and drifts near the ocean floor rather than expend energy searching for intact thalli on which to feed. When  sufficient drift kelp is available, herbivorous grazers do not exert pressure on attached plants; when drift subsidies are unavailable, grazers directly impact the physical structure of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, R.K. 1983.

== Patch dynamics ==
Another major area of kelp forest research has been directed at understanding the spatial-temporal patterns of kelp patches. Not only do such dynamics affect the physical landscape, but they also affect species that associate with kelp for refuge or foraging activities.&lt;ref name="Foster 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"/&gt; Large-scale environmental disturbances have offered important insights concerning mechanisms and ecosystem [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]]. Examples of environmental disturbances include:
*Acute and chronic [[pollution]] events have been shown to impact southern California kelp forests, though the intensity of the impact seems to depend on both the nature of the contaminants and duration of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, R.W. and R.S. Kiwala. 1970. Some ecological effects of discharged wastes on marine life. California Department of Fish and Game 56: 145-155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stull, J.K. 1989. Contaminants in sediments near a major marine outfall: history, effects and future. OCEANS ’89 Proceedings 2: 481-484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North, W.J., D.E. James and L.G. Jones. 1993. History of kelp beds (''Macrocystis'') in Orange and San Diego Counties, California. Hydrobiologia 260/261: 277-283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegner, M.J., P.K. Dayton, P.B. Edwards, K.L. Riser, D.B. Chadwick, T.A. Dean and L. Deysher. 1995. Effects of a large sewage spill on a kelp forest community: catastrophe or disturbance? Marine Environmental Research 40: 181-224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.R., R.F. Caraco, D.F. Cornell, R.W. Howarth, A.N. Sharpley and V.N. Smith. 1998. Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen. Ecological Applications 8: 559-568.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution can include sediment deposition and [[eutrophication]] from sewage, industrial byproducts and contaminants like [[PCBs]] and heavy metals (for example, copper, zinc), runoff of [[organophosphates]] from agricultural areas, anti-fouling chemicals used in harbors and marinas (for example, [[Tributyltin|TBT]] and [[creosote]]) and land-based pathogens like [[fecal coliform bacteria]].
*Catastrophic storms can remove surface kelp canopies through wave activity, but usually leave understory kelps intact; they can also remove urchins when little spatial refuge is available.&lt;ref name="Dayton1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebeling"/&gt; Interspersed canopy clearings create a seascape mosaic where sunlight penetrates deeper into the kelp forest and species that are normally light-limited in the understory can flourish. Similarly, substrate cleared of kelp holdfasts can provide space for other sessile species to establish themselves and occupy the seafloor, sometimes directly competing with juvenile kelp and even inhibiting their settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Kennelly, S.J. 1987. Physical disturbances in an Australian kelp community. I. Temporal effects. Marine Ecology Progress Series 40: 145-153.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) events involve the depression of oceanographic thermoclines, severe reductions of nutrient input, and changes in storm patterns.&lt;ref name="Dayton1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPhaden, M.J. 1999. Genesis and evolution of the 1997-1998 El Niño. Science 283: 950-954.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress due to warm water and nutrient depletion can increase the susceptibility of kelp to storm damage and herbivorous grazing, sometimes even prompting phase shifts to urchin-dominated landscapes.&lt;ref name="Vasquez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayton 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, M.S. and G. Hernández-Carmona. 2005. Delayed recovery of giant kelp near its southern range limit in the North Pacific following El Niño. Marine Biology 147: 273-279.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, oceanographic conditions (that is, water temperature, currents) influence the recruitment success of kelp and its competitors, which clearly affect subsequent species interactions and kelp forest dynamics.&lt;ref name="Dayton1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duggins, D.O., J.E. Eckman and A.T. Sewell. 1990. Ecology of understory kelp environments. II. Effects of kelps on recruitment of benthic invertebrates. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 143: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Overfishing higher trophic levels that naturally regulate herbivore populations is also recognized as an important stressor in kelp forests.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halpern2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2001"&gt;Jackson, J.B.C, M.X. Kirby, W.H. Berger, K.A. Bjorndal, L.W. Botsford, B.J. Bourque, R.H. Bradbury, R. Cooke, J. [[Jon Erlandson|Erlandson]], [[James A. Estes|J.A. Estes]], T.P. Hughes, S. Kidwell, C.B. Lange, H.S. Lenihan, J.M. Pandolfi, C.H. Peterson, R.S. Steneck, M.J. Tegner and R.R. Warner. 2002. Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems. Science 293: 629-638.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the previous section, the drivers and outcomes of trophic cascades are important for understanding spatial-temporal patterns of kelp forests.&lt;ref name="Estes1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearse&amp;Hines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sala&amp;Graham"/&gt;

In addition to ecological monitoring of kelp forests before, during, and after such disturbances, scientists try to tease apart the intricacies of kelp forest dynamics using experimental manipulations. By working on smaller spatial-temporal scales, they can control for the presence or absence of specific biotic and abiotic factors to discover the operative mechanisms. For example, in southern Australia, manipulations of kelp canopy types demonstrated that the relative amount of ''Ecklonia radiata'' in a canopy could be used to predict understory species assemblages; consequently, the proportion of ''E. radiata'' can be used as an indicator of other species occurring in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, A.D. and S.D. Connell. 2006. Predicting understory structure from the presence and composition of canopies: an assembly rule for marine algae. [[Oecologia]] 148: 491-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human use ==
Kelp forests have been important to human existence for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Simenstad, C.A., [[James A. Estes|J.A. Estes]] and K.W. Kenyon. 1978. Aleuts, sea otters, and alternate stable-state communities. Science 200: 403-411.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many now theorise that the first colonisation of the Americas was due to fishing communities following the Pacific kelp forests during the last ice age. One theory contends that the kelp forests that would have stretched from northeast Asia to the American Pacific coast would have provided many benefits to ancient boaters. The kelp forests would have provided many sustenance opportunities, as well as acting as a type of buffer from rough water. Besides these benefits, researchers believe that the kelp forests might have helped early boaters navigate, acting as a type of "kelp highway". Theorists also suggest that the kelp forests would have helped these ancient colonists by providing a stable way of life and preventing them from having to adapt to new ecosystems and develop new survival methods even as they traveled thousands of miles.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle [http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/20-did-humans-colonize-the-world-by-boat/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C=. ''Did Humans Colonize the World by Boat?'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern economies are based on [[fisheries]] of kelp-associated species such as  [[lobster]] and rockfish. Humans can also harvest kelp directly to feed aquaculture species such as  abalone and to extract the compound [[alginic acid]], which is used in products like toothpaste and antacids.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, A., T. Correa, V. Muñoz, A. Santibañez, R. Marcos, C. Cáceres and A.H. Buschmann. 2006. Farming of the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera'' in southern Chile for development of novel food products.

Ecological and eco-social models for the introduction of the abalone ''Haliotis discus hannai'' into benthic systems of north-central Chile: sustainability assessment. Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems 17: 89-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelp forests are valued for recreational activities such as SCUBA diving and kayaking; the industries that support these sports represent one benefit related to the ecosystem and the enjoyment derived from these activities represents another. All of these are examples of [[ecosystem services]] provided specifically by kelp forests.

== Threats and management ==

Given the complexity of kelp forests – their variable structure, geography, and interactions – they pose a considerable challenge to environmental managers. Extrapolating even well-studied trends to the future is difficult because interactions within the ecosystem will change under variable conditions, not all relationships in the ecosystem are understood, and the nonlinear thresholds to transitions are not yet recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer, M., S. Carpenter, J.A. Foley, C. Folke and B. Walter. 2001. Catastrophic shifts in ecosystems. Nature 413: 591-596.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to kelp forests, major issues of concern include marine pollution and [[water quality]], kelp harvesting and fisheries, [[invasive species]], and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"/&gt; The most pressing threat to kelp forest preservation may be the overfishing of coastal ecosystems, which by removing higher trophic levels facilitates their shift to depauperate urchin barrens.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"/&gt; The maintenance of [[biodiversity]] is recognized as a way of generally stabilizing ecosystems and their services through mechanisms such as functional compensation and reduced susceptibility to foreign species invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, T.M., S.R.

A '''laptop orchestra''' ('''lork''' or '''LO''') or '''laptop ensemble''' ('''LE''') is a [[chamber music]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] consisting primarily of [[laptop]]s. Education based laptop orchestras include '''BLOrk''' ('''University of Colorado Boulder Laptop Orchestra'''), '''[[#CLOrk|CLOrk]]''' (Concordia Laptop Orchestra), '''CMLO''' ('''CMU Laptop Orchestra''', Carnegie Mellon), '''HELO''' ('''Huddersfield Experimental Laptop Orchestra'''), '''OLO''' ('''Oslo Laptop Orchestra'''&lt;!--University of Oslo and Norwegian Academy of Music--&gt;), '''[[#PLOrk|PLOrk]]''' (Princeton Laptop Orchestra), and '''SLOrk''' ('''Stanford Laptop Orchestra'''). City based laptop orchestras include '''BiLE''' ('''Birmingham Laptop Ensemble''') and '''MiLO''' ('''Milwaukee Laptop Orchestra''').

==CLOrk==
{{anchor|Clork|Concordia Laptop Orchestra}}
'''Concordia Laptop Orchestra''' ('''CLOrk''') is an ensemble of laptop performers, consisting of up to 25 members, based at [[Concordia University]]'s Music Department in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada. Founded and directed by professor Eldad Tsabary, CLOrk specializes in networked and multidisciplinary performances and collaborations, such as with dance and video.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite news|last=La Leggia|first=Stephanie|title=An orchestra made up of computers|url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/saturdayextra/story.html?id=84b639d4-f605-4ae3-9662-344317697d2e|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLOrk's first performance (January 2011) was a [[telematic]] collaboration with other laptop ensembles across Canada as part of the [[University of Calgary]] Happening Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telematic Performance by the Concordia Laptop Orchestra|url=http://music.concordia.ca/news-and-events/events/telematic-performance-by-the-concordia-laptop-orchestra.php|work=Concordia Music Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that performance, CLOrk has performed telematically on several occasions with other laptop ensembles (such as McMaster's Cybernetic Orchestra) and acoustic ensembles at [[New York University]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[Queens University Belfast]], [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg|Hamburg Hochschule of Music]], [[University of California, Irvine]], and Mustek duo (Edinburgh), among others, at international events such as Birmingham Network Music Festival,&lt;ref name=midland&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotton|first=Ross|title=Network Music Festival returns to Birmingham for a second year|url=http://www.midlandstimes.co.uk/2013/01/network-music-festival-returns-to-birmingham-for-a-second-year/|newspaper=The Midlands Times of Greater Birmingham|date=January 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130620005703/http://www.midlandstimes.co.uk/2013/01/network-music-festival-returns-to-birmingham-for-a-second-year/|archivedate=June 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToBeContinued,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ToBeContinued Programme|url=http://www.stazioneditopolo.it/24h/|work=stazione di topolò|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903024810/http://www.stazioneditopolo.it/24h/|archivedate=2013-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Penta Locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Stage: Penta Locus (Networked Music Review)|url=http://turbulence.org/networked_music_review/2011/11/14/live-stage-penta-locus/|work=turbulence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laptop orchestra trend began with Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laptop Orchestra trend started by Princeton University’s PLOrk|url=http://www.thefutureofmusic.org/laptop-orchestra-trend-started-by-princeton-universitys-plork|newspaper=The Future of Music|date=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and continued with the emergence of many laptop orchestras and ensembles around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laptop Orchestra Directory|url=https://esp-mcmaster.wikispaces.com/Laptop+Orchestra+Directory|work=esp-mcmaster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=association&gt;{{cite web|title=Laptop Orchestras|url=http://www.ialo.org/doku.php/laptop_orchestras/orchestras#concordia_laptop_orchestra_clork|work=The International Association of Laptop Orchestras}}&lt;/ref&gt; each characterized by certain technological traits and artistic approaches. CLOrk is characterized by a non-uniform technological approach, based on the idea of "music first; technology follows," by its network music activities, by its collaboration with acoustic ensembles, and by its use of [[soundpainting]] conduction.&lt;ref name=association /&gt;

The '''Electro-Acoustic Ensemble''' is a laptop-based ensemble at [[Loyola University New Orleans]].  The ensemble was formed in January 2009 by professor Paul J. Botelho and is composed of thirteen performers.  Custom software instruments are developed for the ensemble primarily using the [[ChucK]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming languages.  The ensemble focuses on contemporary and classical [[Electro-acoustic music|electro-acoustic]] works and performs in a variety of situations with a special focus on [[Guerrilla theatre|guerrilla performance]].

===Notable performances===

''Futurist Manifesto'' was premiered at a guest lecture by philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] at Loyola University New Orleans on November 17, 2009.  The work was based on the manifest of the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]] and included live recitation of the manifesto with computer manipulation.  This work was also performed at the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]] on April 1, 2011 as a part of the museum's ''Where Y'Art?'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artsneworleans.org/events_framed/detail/5358/IMA-Director-Maxwell-Anderson-at-NOMA-Where-YArt |title=Where Y’Art? at the New Orleans Museum of Art Friday April 1st |work=Arts New Orleans |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904111015/http://www.artsneworleans.org/events_framed/detail/5358/IMA-Director-Maxwell-Anderson-at-NOMA-Where-YArt |archivedate=September 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2009, the ensemble performed a twenty-four-hour meta-performance of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Vexations]]'' at Loyola University New Orleans.  Notably, one audience member, pianist Michael Bennett, remained for the entire twenty-four hour performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.loyno.edu/news/laag/20091204/1849|title=Electro-Acoustic Ensemble gives 24-hour meta-performance|work = Loyola at a Glance|accessdate=April 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PLOrk==
{{anchor|Plork|Princeton Laptop Orchestra}}
{{multiple issues|section=yes|

{{COI|date=May 2011}}
}}
The '''Princeton Laptop Orchestra''' (abbreviated '''PLOrk''') is an ensemble of [[computer]]-based meta-[[musical instrument|instruments]] at [[Princeton University]]. 
PLOrk is part of research at Princeton University that investigates ways in which the computer can be integrated into conventional music-making contexts while also radically transforming those contexts. The Princeton Laptop Orchestra is a group of 12–15 persons and uses the “[[orchestra]]” (in a very general sense) as a model.

Each PLOrk “instrument” consists of a laptop, a multi-channel hemispherical speaker, and a variety of “control” devices (keyboards, graphics tablets, sensors). The members of this ensemble act as performers, researchers, composers, and software developers.

===History===
PLOrk was co-founded in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Rossing, Thomas; ed. (2015). ''Springer Handbook of Acoustics'', p.773. Springer. {{ISBN|9781493907557}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by professors [[Perry Cook]] and [[Dan Trueman]], with graduate students Scott Smallwood and [[Ge Wang]], and funding and support from many Princeton University departments, organizations, and industrial affiliations.  Composers and performers from Princeton and elsewhere developed new pieces for the ensemble, including [[Paul Lansky]] (Professor of Music at Princeton), [[Brad Garton]] (Director of the Columbia Computer Music Center), [[Pauline Oliveros]], PLOrk co-founders Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, Scott Smallwood, Ge Wang, and others.  The new PLOrk gave its first performance on April 4, 2006, in Richardson Auditorium, Princeton University. Grammy-winning tabla player [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], renowned accordionist [[Pauline Oliveros]], and [[So Percussion]] also performed with the group. PLOrk has since performed at [[Dartmouth College]], the [http://www.eartotheearth.org/ Ear to the Earth] festival (produced by the Electronic Music Foundation), [http://ffmup.org ffmup] and elsewhere. Several scholarly articles describing the motivations for establishing such an ensemble, the issues involved in composing for laptop orchestra, and pedagogical concerns, are currently in press. PLOrk was first presented academically at the 2006 International Computer Music Conference in New Orleans.  The guest director of the PLOrk for 2007 was [[R. Luke DuBois]].

Since the beginning, PLOrk has made extensive use of [[ChucK]], a new music programming language created by Ge Wang and Perry Cook which allows the performers to develop new code both in preparation and in performance, and which serves as a primary teaching tool.

A number of composers from Princeton and elsewhere have been developing pieces for PLOrk that address the unconventional composition of the group.  PLOrk works closely with these composers on their pieces with the aim of developing them further and further exploring a new branch of computer music and new media musical composition and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
There are 15 PLOrk stations. Each station consists of a laptop with audio software; a rack containing an 8-channel audio amplifier, a power conditioner, and other electronic components; and a custom-made 6-channel hemispherical speaker.  In April 2008, PLOrk began using a new hemispherical unit which combines the functionality of the old rack and speakers into one more portable device.  The laptops are Apple 12" powerbooks, or more recently, 14" Macbooks.  HCI devices include keyboard controllers, TriggerFinger interfaces, graphics tablets, Nintendo [[Wii]] remotes, and infrared, light, pressure, and tilt sensors.  Additional gears include sitting mats and pillows, laptop lapdesk, and gears for transportation.

The PLOrk ensemble uses a variety of commercial and open-source software.  Two [[audio programming languages]], [[ChucK]] and [[Max/MSP]] are primarily used for pedagogy and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Lucas van Uffelen''' or '''Uffel''' (1586 – 1637) was a Dutch merchant and art collector.

Uffelen was born in [[Amsterdam]], but moved to Venice where he grew his art collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ta.sandrart.net/en/person/view/1574 Lucas von Uffelen], mentioned by [[Joachim von Sandrart]] on Sandrart.net&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Amsterdam in 1630, he continued to collect art. When he died, many of his Italian paintings were purchased by the [[Reynst Collection]]. He had his portrait painted by [[Anthony van Dyck]] twice, once in 1622 and later in the fashionable "action" style of getting up from one's chair. He appears to be getting up to greet the viewer after studying the objects of his collection.

MAXI was developed by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Tsukuba, Japan, and is designed to continuously monitor X-ray sources and variability as the International Space Station (ISS) orbits Earth. It was launched in 2009.

MAXI conducts a full sky survey every 96 minutes searching for variations in X-ray sources.

MAXI helped discover the rapidly rotating black-hole/star system [[MAXI J1659-152]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5840 E. Kuulkers, et al. - MAXI J1659-152: The shortest orbital period black-hole transient in outburst (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
MAXI has been in operation for several years and has made several x-ray photos of nebulae and space objects while being stationed on the ISS (International Space Station).

==iWF-MAXI==
''iSEEP Wide-Field MAXI'' (iWF-MAXI) is a follow-on instrument to the current MAXI. Compared with MAXI, which can only monitor 2% of the celestial sphere instantaneously, iWF-MAXI is always capable of monitoring 10%, and can monitor up to 80% in 92 minutes. iWF-MAXI will utilize the i-SEEP (IVA-replaceable Small Exposed Experiment Platform) bus, an exposure adapter for middle-sized payloads in [[Kibo (ISS module)#Exposed Facility|JEM-EF]].

'''MIKE 21C''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates the development in the [[river bed]] and [[Channel (geography)|channel]] plan form in two dimensions. MIKE 21C was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. MIKE 21C uses curvilinear finite difference grids.

Simulated processes with MIKE 21C include [[bank erosion]], scouring and shoaling brought about by activities such as construction and dredging, seasonal fluctuations in flow, etc.

==Applications==
MIKE 21C can be used for designing protection schemes against bank erosion, evaluating measures to reduce or manage shoaling, analyzing alignments and dimensions of navigation channels for minimizing capital and maintenance dredging, predicting the impact of bridge, tunnel and pipeline crossings on river channel hydraulics and morphology, optimizing restoration plans for habitat environment in channel floodplain systems, designing monitoring networks based on morphological forecasting.

Due to its accurate descriptions of the physical processes, MIKE 21C can simulate a [[braided river]] developing from a plane bed, which was illustrated by Enggrob &amp; Tjerry (1998).

==Theory==
As most other models made by DHI, MIKE 21C applies an add-on concept in which the overall time-loop can contain processes to be simulated, selected by the user. In its basic form the model is a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model that can simulate dynamic as well as quasi-steady or steady-state hydrodynamic solutions. The [[hydrodynamic]] model solves the Saint-Venant equations in two dimensions with the water depth defined in cell centers and a staggered velocity field (internally the code solves the flux field, i.e. the water depth multiplied by the velocity vector) defined with direction as the local grid base vector.

The model is computationally a parallel code (written in [[Fortran]]) with parallelizations in all modules, which allows for simulations of morphological developments on fine grids over long periods of time. The model is typically applied with as much 25,000 computational points over periods of several years or even decades.

The most important secondary flow in rivers is the so-called helical flow, with its name derived from Helios (the Sun in Greek). The name helical is used because the flow arises as the water in the lower portions of the water column flowing towards the local center of curvature, and away from the local center of curvature along the water surface. This has only a minor impact on the hydrodynamics, usually only pronounced on a laboratory scale, but it has profound impacts on the sediment transport and morphology because the helical flow influences the otherwise zero transverse sediment component. MIKE 21C applies standard theory for the helical flow, which can be found in e.g. Rozowsky (1957). Standard helical flow theory provides a secondary flow velocity profile that is fully characterised by friction and the deviation angle between the main flow direction and the direction of the shear stress at the river bed.

MIKE 21C uses the traditional division of [[sediment]] transport into [[bedload]] and suspended load, and the model can simulate both non-cohesive and cohesive sediment in a mixture.

The bed-load model accounts for the impacts of secondary flow (bed shear stress direction) and local bed slope (gravity). Suspended load is calculated with an advection-dispersion equation for each fraction, which includes adaptation in time and space as well as the 2-dimensional depth-integrated effects of the 3-dimensional flow pattern through profile functions (Galappatti &amp; Vreugdenhil, 1985).

'''Medical microbiology ''', the large subset of [[microbiology]] that is [[applied science|applied]] to [[medicine]], is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of [[infection|infectious disease]]s.  In addition, this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health.  There are four kinds of [[microorganism]]s that cause infectious disease: [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[Parasitism|parasites]] and [[virus]]es, and one type of infectious protein called  [[prion]].

A medical [[microbiologist]] studies the characteristics of [[pathogen]]s, their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/10/3465.full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803235551/http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/10/3465.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this information, a treatment can be devised.  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for [[physicians]], providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options.
Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially [[virulent]] or resistant strains of microbes, educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices.  They may also assist in preventing or controlling [[epidemics]] and outbreaks of disease.
Not all medical microbiologists study microbial [[pathology]]; some study common, non-pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop [[antibiotics]] or other treatment methods.

[[Epidemiology]], the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of [[health]] and [[disease]] conditions in populations, is an important part of medical microbiology, although the clinical aspect of the field primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals, their effects on the human body, and the methods of treating those infections. In this respect the entire field, as an applied science, can be conceptually subdivided into academic and clinical subspecialties, although in reality there is a fluid continuum between '''public health microbiology''' and '''clinical microbiology''', just as the state of the art in [[medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] depends on continual improvements in academic medicine and [[research institute|research laboratories]]. 

==History ==
[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe microorganisms using a microscope.]]
In 1676, [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] observed bacteria and other microorganisms, using a single-lens [[microscope]] of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Frank N. Egerton |date=2006| doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2006)87[47:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2| volume=87| pages=47| title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 19: Leeuwenhoek's Microscopic Natural History| journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]] developed a method using [[cowpox]] to successfully immunize a child against smallpox.  The same principles are used for developing [[vaccines]] today.

Following on from this, in 1857 [[Louis Pasteur]] also designed vaccines against several diseases such as [[anthrax]], fowl [[cholera]] and [[rabies]] as well as [[pasteurization]] for food preservation.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | editor = Madigan M| editor2 = Martinko J | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 13th | publisher = Pearson Education | date = 2006 | isbn = 0-321-73551-X |page = 1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] is considered to be the father of [[antiseptic]] surgery.  By sterilizing the instruments with diluted [[carbolic acid]] and using it to clean wounds, post-operative infections were reduced, making surgery safer for patients.

In the years between 1876 and 1884 [[Robert Koch]] provided much insight into infectious diseases. He was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in [[Microbiological culture|pure culture]].  This gave rise to the [[germ theory]], a certain microorganism being responsible for a certain disease. He developed a series of criteria around this that have become known as the [[Koch's postulates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=Brock TD |author-link=Thomas D. Brock |date=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major milestone in medical microbiology is the [[Gram stain]]. In 1884 [[Hans Christian Gram]] developed the method of staining bacteria to make them more visible and differentiable under a microscope. This technique is widely used today.

In 1929 [[Alexander Fleming]] developed the most commonly used antibiotic substance both at the time and now: [[penicillin]].

[[DNA sequencing]], a method developed by [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Frederick Sanger]] in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR (1977) DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors" ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 74:5463-5467.&lt;/ref&gt; caused a rapid change the development of [[vaccine]]s, medical treatments and diagnostic methods. Some of these include synthetic [[insulin]] which was produced in 1979 using [[recombinant DNA]] and the first genetically engineered vaccine was created in 1986 for [[hepatitis B]].

In 1995 a team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] sequenced the first bacterial [[genome]]; ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J, al. e (1995) Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd" ''Science'' 269:496-512.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few months later, the first [[eukaryotic]] genome was completed. This would prove invaluable for diagnostic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott LM, Harley JP, Klein DA (2005) Microbiology: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and transmission of infectious diseases ==
{{See also|Infection}}

Infections may be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[parasite]]s. The pathogen that causes the disease may be exogenous (acquired from an external source; environmental, animal or other people, e.g. [[Influenza]]) or endogenous (from normal flora e.g. [[candidiasis]]).&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book| last=Washington| first=JA| editor-first=S| editor-last=Baron| title=Medical Microbiology| edition=4th| publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston| date=1996| chapter=10 Principles of Diagnosis| isbn=0-9631172-1-1| chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8014/| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613091205/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8014/| archivedate=2016-06-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at which a microbe enters the body is referred to as the portal of entry.&lt;ref name=Bittar&gt;{{cite book |last=Siebeling|first=RJ|editor-first=E, B |editor-last=Bittar, Neville |title=Microbiology| publisher = Elsevier| date = 1998|chapter=Chapter 7 Principles of bacterial pathogenesis | isbn = 1-55938-814-5|page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[respiratory tract]], [[GI tract|gastrointestinal tract]], [[genitourinary tract]], [[skin]], and [[mucous membranes]].&lt;ref name=Rhinehart&gt;{{cite book | author = Rhinehart E| author2 = Friedman M| title = Infection control in home care| publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning| date = 1999 | isbn = 0-8342-1143-2|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portal of entry for a specific microbe is normally dependent on how it travels from its natural habitat to the host.&lt;ref name=Bittar /&gt;

There are various ways in which disease can be transmitted between individuals. 
These include:&lt;ref name=Bittar /&gt;
* Direct contact - Touching an infected host, including [[Transmission (medicine)#Sexual transmission|sexual contact]]
* Indirect contact - Touching a contaminated surface
* [[Transmission (medicine)#Droplet contact|Droplet contact]] - Coughing or sneezing
* [[Fecal–oral route]] - Ingesting contaminated food or water sources
* Airborne transmission - Pathogen carrying [[Spore#Dispersal|spores]]
* [[Vector borne transmission|Vector transmission]] - An organism that does not cause disease itself but transmits infection by conveying pathogens from one host to another 
* [[Fomite|Fomite transmission]] - An inanimate object or substance capable of carrying infectious germs or parasites
* Environmental - Hospital-acquired infection ([[Nosocomial|Nosocomial infections]])

Like other pathogens, viruses use these methods of transmission to enter the body, but viruses differ in that they must also enter into the host's actual cells. Once the virus has gained access to the host's cells, the virus' genetic material ([[RNA]] or [[DNA]]) must be [[Viral replication|introduced to the cell]].  Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them. Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts RJ, "Fish pathology, 3rd Edition", Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baron1&gt;{{cite book|last=Roizman|first=B|editor-first=S|editor-last=Baron|title=Medical Microbiology|edition=4th|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|date=1996|chapter=42 Multiplication|isbn=0-9631172-1-1|chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511212551/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/|archivedate=2018-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms for infection, proliferation, and persistence of a virus in cells of the host are crucial for its survival. For example, some diseases such as [[measles]] employ a strategy whereby it must spread to a series of hosts. In these forms of viral infection, the illness is often treated by the [[Cell-mediated immunity|body's own immune response]], and therefore the virus is required to disperse to new hosts before it is destroyed by [[Immune system|immunological resistance]] or host death.&lt;ref name= Hilleman&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hilleman M| title= Strategies and mechanisms for host and pathogen survival in acute and persistent viral infections| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| volume=101| pages=14560–14566| date=October 2004| doi=10.1073/pnas.0404758101| pmc=521982| pmid=15297608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, some infectious agents such as the [[Feline leukemia virus]], are able to withstand immune responses and are capable of achieving long-term residence within an individual host, whilst also retaining the ability to spread into successive hosts.&lt;ref name= Greggs&gt;{{cite journal |author = Greggs WM| author2 = Clouser CL |author3 = Patterson SE|author4 = Manksy LM| title= Discovery of drugs that possess activity against feline leukemia virus| journal= Journal of General Virology| volume=93| issue=4| pages=900–905| date=April 2012| doi=10.1099/vir.0.039909-0 |url=http://jgv.sgmjournals.org/content/93/Pt_4/900.full|pmc=3542715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnostic tests ==
{{main|Diagnostic microbiology}}
Identification of an infectious agent for a minor illness can be as simple as clinical presentation; such as [[gastrointestinal disease]] and skin infections.  In order to make an educated estimate as to which microbe could be causing the disease, epidemiological factors need to be considered; such as the patient's likelihood of exposure to the suspected organism and the presence and prevalence of a microbial strain in a community.

Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by consulting the patient's medical history and conducting a physical examination. More detailed identification techniques involve [[microbial culture]], [[microscopy]], [[Infectious disease#Biochemical tests|biochemical tests]] and [[genotyping]]. Other less common techniques (such as [[X-rays]], [[CAT scans]], [[PET scans]] or [[NMR]]) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent.

=== Microbial culture ===
[[Image:K pneumoniae M morganii providencia styphimuriuma.JPG|thumb|200px|Four [[nutrient agar]] plates growing colonies of common [[Gram negative]] bacteria.]]
[[Microbiological culture]] is the primary method used for isolating infectious disease for study in the laboratory. Tissue or fluid samples are tested for the presence of a specific [[pathogen]], which is determined by growth in a selective or differential [[Growth medium|medium]].

The 3 main types of media used for testing are:&lt;ref name=Nester&gt;{{cite book | author = Nester E| author2 = Anderson D| author3 = Evans Roberts, C | author4=Nester M| title = Microbiology: A human perspective| publisher = McGraw Hill| date = 2009 | isbn = 1-55938-814-5|pages = 336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solid culture: A solid surface is created using a mixture of nutrients, salts and [[agar]]. A single microbe on an agar plate can then grow into colonies (clones where cells are identical to each other) containing thousands of cells. These are primarily used to culture bacteria and fungi.
* Liquid culture: Cells are grown inside a liquid media. Microbial growth is determined by the time taken for the liquid to form a [[colloidal suspension]]. This technique is used for diagnosing parasites and detecting [[mycobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Møller"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Møller M| author2= El Maghrabi R| author3= Olesen N|author4= Thomsen VØ| title=Safe inoculation of blood and bone marrow for liquid culture detection of mycobacteria| journal=Occupational Medicine |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=530–3 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15520021 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqh106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cell culture: Human or animal [[cell culture]]s are infected with the microbe of interest. These cultures are then observed to determine the effect the microbe has on the cells. This technique is used for identifying viruses.

=== Microscopy ===
[[Microbiological culture|Culture techniques]] will often use a microscopic examination to help in the identification of the microbe. Instruments such as [[compound light microscope]]s can be used to assess critical aspects of the organism. This can be performed immediately after the sample is taken from the patient and is used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques, allowing for resolution of cellular features. [[Electron microscopes]] and [[fluorescence microscope]]s are also used for observing microbes in greater detail for research.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan MT (2009) Brock Biology of Microorganisms: Pearson/Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biochemical tests ===
Fast and relatively simple [[Infectious disease#Biochemical tests|biochemical tests]] can be used to identify infectious agents. For bacterial identification, the use of [[metabolic]] or enzymatic characteristics are common due to their ability to ferment [[carbohydrates]] in patterns characteristic of their [[genus]] and [[species]]. Acids, alcohols and gases are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in [[Growth Medium|selective liquid or solid media]], as mentioned above. In order to perform these tests en masse, automated machines are used.  These machines perform multiple biochemical tests simultaneously, using cards with several wells containing different dehydrated chemicals.  The microbe of interest will react with each chemical in a specific way, aiding in its identification.

[[Serological]] methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid laboratory tests used to identify different types of microorganisms. The tests are based upon the ability of an [[antibody]] to bind specifically to an [[antigen]]. The antigen (usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent) is bound by the antibody, allowing this type of test to be used for organisms other than bacteria. This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be easily and definitively observed, depending on the test. More complex serological techniques are known as [[immunoassays]]. Using a similar basis as described above, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or the proteins generated by an infected host in response to the infection.&lt;ref name=Nester/&gt;

=== Polymerase chain reaction ===

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) assays are the most commonly used molecular technique to detect and study microbes.&lt;ref name=Mackay&gt;{{cite book | author = Mackay I | title = Real-time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterisation| publisher = Horizon Scientific Press  | date = 2007 | isbn = 9781904455189|pages = 1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to other methods, sequencing and analysis is definitive, reliable, accurate, and fast.&lt;ref name=Viljoen&gt;{{cite book | editor = Viljoen GJ| editor2 = Nel LH| editor3 = Crowther JR | title = Molecular Diagnostic PCR Handbook| publisher = Springer| date = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4020-3404-6 |page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[quantitative PCR]] is the primary technique used, as this method provides faster data compared to a standard PCR assay. For instance, traditional PCR techniques require the use of [[gel electrophoresis]] to visualize amplified DNA molecules after the reaction has finished. [[quantitative PCR]] does not require this, as the detection system uses [[Fluorometer|fluorescence]] and [[DNA probe|probes]] to detect the DNA molecules as they are being amplified.&lt;ref name=Tang&gt;{{cite book | author = Tang YW| author2 = Persing DH| title = Encyclopedia of Microbiology| publisher = Oxford Academic Press  | date = 2009 | isbn =  978-0-12-373944-5 |pages = 308–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, [[quantitative PCR]] also removes the risk of contamination that can occur during standard PCR procedures (carrying over PCR product into subsequent PCRs).&lt;ref name=Mackay /&gt; Another advantage of using PCR to detect and study microbes is that the DNA sequences of newly discovered infectious microbes or strains can be compared to those already listed in databases, which in turn helps to increase understanding of which organism is causing the infectious disease and thus what possible methods of treatment could be used.&lt;ref name=Viljoen /&gt; This technique is the current standard for detecting viral infections such as [[AIDS]] and [[hepatitis]].

== Treatments ==

Once an infection has been diagnosed and identified, suitable treatment options must be assessed by the physician and consulting medical microbiologists. Some infections can be dealt with by the body's own [[immune system]], but more serious infections are treated with [[antimicrobial]] drugs. [[Pathogenic bacteria|Bacterial infections]] are treated with [[antibacterials]] (often called antibiotics) whereas [[Mycosis|fungal]] and [[Viral disease|viral]] infections are treated with [[Antifungal medication|antifungals]] and [[Antiviral drug|antivirals]] respectively. A broad class of drugs known as [[antiparasitics]] are used to treat [[parasitic diseases]].

Medical microbiologists often make treatment recommendations to the patient's physician based on the strain of [[microbe]] and its [[antibiotic resistance]]s, the site of infection, the potential [[toxicity]] of  antimicrobial drugs and any [[drug allergies]] the patient has.

[[File:Antibiotic sensitvity and resistance.JPG|right|thumb|Antibiotic resistance tests:  bacteria in the culture on the left are sensitive to the antibiotics contained in the white, paper discs. Bacteria in the culture on the right are resistant to most of the antibiotics.]]
In addition to drugs being specific to a certain kind of organism (bacteria, fungi, etc.), some drugs are specific to a certain [[genus]] or [[species]] of organism, and will not work on other organisms. Because of this specificity, medical microbiologists must consider the effectiveness of certain antimicrobial drugs when making recommendations. Additionally, [[strain (biology)|strains]] of an organism may be resistant to a certain drug or class of drug, even when it is typically effective against the species. These strains, termed resistant strains, present a serious public health concern of growing importance to the medical industry as the spread of [[antibiotic resistance]] worsens. [[Antimicrobial resistance]] is an increasingly problematic issue that leads to millions of deaths every year.&lt;ref name="WHO 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/ | title=Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance 2014 | publisher=WHO | work=WHO | date=April 2014 | accessdate=May 9, 2015 | author=WHO | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515101620/http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/ | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst drug resistance typically involves microbes chemically inactivating an antimicrobial drug or a cell mechanically stopping the uptake of a drug, another form of drug resistance can arise from the formation of [[biofilm]]s. Some bacteria are able to form biofilms by adhering to surfaces on implanted devices such as catheters and prostheses and creating an [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix]] for other cells to adhere to.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery K, Hu H, Jacombs AS, Bradshaw DA, Deva AK (2013) A review of bacterial biofilms and their role in device-associated infection. Healthcare Infection .&lt;/ref&gt; This provides them with a stable environment from which the bacteria can disperse and infect other parts of the host. Additionally, the extracellular matrix and dense outer layer of bacterial cells can protect the inner bacteria cells from antimicrobial drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Stewart PS| author2=Costerton JW |title=Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9276 |pages=135–8 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11463434 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05321-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical microbiology is not only about diagnosing and treating disease, it also involves the study of beneficial microbes.  Microbes have been shown to be helpful in combating infectious disease and promoting health. Treatments can be developed from microbes, as demonstrated by Alexander Fleming's discovery of [[penicillin]] as well as the development of new antibiotics from the bacterial genus [[Streptomyces#Medicine|Streptomyces]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Taguchi T, Yabe M, Odaki H, Shinozaki M, Metsä-Ketelä M, Arai T, Okamoto S, Ichinose K (2013) Biosynthetic Conclusions from the Functional Dissection of Oxygenases for Biosynthesis of Actinorhodin and Related Streptomyces Antibiotics. Chemistry &amp; Biology 20:510-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only are microorganisms a source of antibiotics but some may also act as [[probiotics]] to provide health benefits to the host, such as providing better gastrointestinal health or inhibiting pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Williams NT (2010) Probiotics. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy 67:449-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unpublished manuscript entitled "Ordenanzas del Baratillo de México"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|first=Pedro Anselmo

Ordenanzas del baratillo de México dadas por vía de exortación o consejo a sus doctores compuestas por don Pedro Anselmo Chreslos Jache
|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de España}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Decrees of the Baratillo of Mexico) was signed and dated in 1754 by Pedro Anselmo Chreslos Jache, likely a pseudonym for an educated Spaniard.  It is a satirical piece of eighteenth-century colonial literature written in [[New Spain]] (modern day Mexico), which sought to offer an alternative view of life in colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Julie Greer|title=Satire in Colonial America: Turning the New World Upside Down|year=1993|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-72980-3|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The Baratillo was an infamous market in [[Mexico City]] known for the sale of used items, many of which had been stolen and were cheaply priced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Sandra|title=La Plaza Mayor, tres siglos de dominación española|url=http://www.guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/kmcero/1-el-centro-fondo/la-plaza-mayor-tres-siglos-de-dominaci-n-espa-ola|publisher=Nueva Guia del Centro Histórico de México|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a place for the poor and lower class of Mexico, usually racially mixed people, to mingle and purchase items for subsistence.

Ordenanzas, or official decrees, were established to regulate New Spanish society in general. The author’s 377 ordenanzas mimicked the official statutes, but would completely reverse the power system based on the [[Casta|sistema de castas]]. In effect, Chreslos Jache mocks the [[limpieza de sangre]] by creating a separate system of classification for Spaniards. For example, “medio Españoles” (half-Spanish) and “cuartilla de Español” (one-quarter Spanish) were parodies of terms to identify persons of mixed race, like “[[mestizo]]”, “[[castiza]]”, “[[Zambo|lobo]]”, and countless others.

The purpose of this manuscript was to show a chaotic view of life in Mexico in which the castas used a variety of strategies to substantiate their control over society and that the casta system itself is self-regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona Katzew|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10971-7|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chreslos Jache pokes fun at this idea of self-regulation by making up ridiculous names that are impossible to adequately translate for the terminology of the sistema de castas. The manuscript states that the sistema de castas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruffin II|first=Herbert G.|title=Blackpast.org: Remembered and Reclaimed.|publisher=Blackpast.org|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also mocked by the formation of the Baratillo “brotherhood” which was composed exclusively of non-whites, mainly [[mulatto]]s. This brotherhood banned membership to Spaniards and their descendants, and instead made them targets of the brotherhood’s scams. By using the Baratillo brotherhood, Chreslos Jache inverts the traditional racial attitude of the time where Spaniards and [[Criollo people|creole]]s dominated the system.

==Impact==

The manuscript reinforced race as a category of power differentiation within New Spain because it was a text that circulated among the educated elite in a time when primarily upper class people were literate. The significance of this satirical manuscript in relation to [[Casta]] paintings is that, much like the manuscript, the paintings reflect racial debate and also contribute to the interpretation of racial culture during the second half of the eighteenth-century in New Spain.

{{Renewable energy sources}}
'''Osmotic power''', '''salinity gradient power''' or '''blue energy''' is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between [[seawater]] and [[fresh water|river water]]. Two practical methods for this are [[reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) and
[[pressure retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Both processes rely on [[osmosis]] with [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s. The key waste product is [[brackish water]]. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.

In 1954, Pattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=R.E. Pattle|title=Production of electric power by mixing fresh and salt water in the hydroelectric pile|journal=Nature|date=2 October 1954|volume=174|page=660|doi=10.1038/174660a0|issue=4431|bibcode=1954Natur.174..660P}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. Loeb|title=Osmotic power plants|journal=Science|date=22 August 1975|volume=189|issue=4203|pages=654–655|doi=10.1126/science.189.4203.654|pmid=17838753|bibcode=1975Sci...189..654L}}&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined.

The method of generating power by pressure retarded osmosis was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;^ Israel Patent Application 42658 of July 3, 1973. (see also {{patent|US|3906250|title=Method and apparatus for generating power utilizing pressure-retarded-osmosis}} Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973 {{patent|US|3906250|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came to Prof. Loeb, in part, as he observed the Jordan River flowing into the Dead Sea. He wanted to harvest the energy of mixing of the two aqueous solutions (the Jordan River being one and the Dead Sea being the other) that was going to waste in this natural mixing process.&lt;ref&gt;^ Weintraub, Bob. "Sidney Loeb," Bulletin of the Israel Chemical Society, Dec. 2001, issue 8, page 8-9. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpgY6dd0Qtb4M6xnNXhutP4pMxidq_jqG962VzWt_W7-hssGnSxSzjTY8RvW/edit&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Loeb invented a method of producing power by a reverse electrodialysis heat engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US4171409?dq=4,171,409&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sVRiUoX1N8bA0QXm6YGIDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA%20 United States Patent US4171409 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406074428/https://www.google.com/patents/US4171409?dq=4%2C171%2C409&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sVRiUoX1N8bA0QXm6YGIDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA%20 |date=2016-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technologies have been confirmed in laboratory conditions. They are being developed into commercial use in the Netherlands (RED) and Norway (PRO). The cost of the membrane has been an obstacle. A new, lower cost membrane, based on an electrically modified [[polyethylene]] plastic, made it fit for potential commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.statkraft.com/Images/Faktaark%20OSMOTIC%20ENG_tcm4-7797.pdf History of osmotic power (PDF) at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods have been proposed and are currently under development.

==Basics of salinity gradient power==
[[Image:Blue energy mechanism.png|thumb|right|Pressure-retarded osmosis]]
Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.

Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of “osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water.”&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, A.T., W. Finley. “Recent developments in salinity gradient power”. Oceans. 2003. 2284-2287.)&lt;/ref&gt; All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on the evaporation to separate water from salt. Osmotic pressure is the "chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water trough salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?” Environmental Process and Technology. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low, solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure.

Differing salinity gradient power generations exist but one of the most commonly discussed is [[pressure-retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states "only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water through salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?.” ''Environmental Process and Technology''. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to "pump" fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.

==Efficiency==
A 2012 study on efficiency from Yale university concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is 0.75 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; while the free energy of mixing is 0.81 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of 91.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es300060m | pmid=22463483 | volume=46 | issue=9 | title=Thermodynamic and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Power Generation from Natural Salinity Gradients by Pressure Retarded Osmosis | year=2012 | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=5230–5239 | last1 = Yin Yip | first1 = Ngai | last2 = Elimelech | first2 = Menachem| bibcode=2012EnST...46.5230Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.

===Pressure-retarded osmosis===
[[File:Simplistic pressure retarded osmosis power generation diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Simple PRO power generation scheme]]
[[File:Hurum osmosis power 02.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte (Hurum), Norway]]
One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called [[pressure-retarded osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TGK-4MDGP8H-1&amp;_user=607017&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=607017&amp;md5=acc4682fd086886dff4b0cb1ee6123df Salinity-gradient power: Evaluation of pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun, providing kinetic energy. This method is being specifically studied by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[public utility|utility]] [[Statkraft]], which has calculated that up to 2.85 GW would be available from this process in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf Recent Developments in Salinity Gradient Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211414/http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf |date=2011-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statkraft has built the world's first [[Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum|prototype PRO power plant]] on the Oslo fjord which was opened by [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |title=The world's first osmotic power plant from Statkraft |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024125/http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }} Statkraft-osmotic-power&lt;/ref&gt; on November 24, 2009. It aims to produce enough electricity to light and heat a small town within five years by osmosis. At first, it will produce a minuscule 4 kilowatts – enough to heat a large electric kettle, but by 2015 the target is 25 megawatts – the same as a small wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8377186.stm BBC News Norway's Statkraft opens first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |title=Is PRO economically feasible? Not according to Statkraft &amp;#124; ForwardOsmosisTech |accessdate=2017-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118220928/http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversed electrodialysis===
A second method being developed and studied is [[reversed electrodialysis]] or reverse dialysis, which is essentially the creation of a salt battery. This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as “an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water.”

The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages, even though the principle was discovered in the 1950s. Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order make this clean energy source more viable in the future.

===Capacitive method===
A third method is [[Doriano Brogioli]]'s&lt;ref name="Brogioli" /&gt; capacitive method, which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale. With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up [[electrode]]s in contact with saline water, followed by a discharge in freshwater. Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step, each completed cycle effectively produces energy. An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of [[ion]]s in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface, known as an [[double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]]. Therefore, the [[voltage]] over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy. In between the charge and discharge step, the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater. After this, there are less ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases. The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy. A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor, there is a mutually attractive [[electric force]] between the [[electric charge]] on the electrode, and the ionic charge in the liquid. In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode, osmotic pressure must do [[work (physics)|work]]. This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor. An electronic explanation is that [[capacitance]] is a function of ion density. By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor, this reduces the capacitance, and so the voltage must increase, since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance.

===Vapor pressure differences: open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)===
Both of these methods do not rely on membranes, so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO &amp; RED schemes.

====Open cycle====
Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine (75 meters +) operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity &amp; the water with greater salinity.

====Absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)====
For the purpose of dehumidifying air, in a [[absorption refrigerator#Water spray absorption refrigeration|water-spray absorption refrigeration]] system, water vapor is dissolved into a [[deliquescent]] salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary. The primary power source originates from a thermal difference, as part of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat engine]] cycle.

===Solar pond===
At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a technology called "salinity gradient [[solar pond]]" (SGSP) is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine. '''This method does not harness osmotic power''', only solar power (see: [[solar pond]]). Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of [[natural convection]], wherein "heat rises", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an "insulator" for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an [[organic Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756432-k7Q3X9/webviewable/756432.pdf Salinity Gradient Solar Pond Technology Applied to Potash Solution Mining]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory a solar pond ''could'' be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient, ''and'' the potential energy in this salinity gradient is ''harnessed directly'' using one of the first three methods above, such as the capacitive method.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===

A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statoil prototype. It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers. With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir, the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube.

The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere. The researchers claim this is 1,000 times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power.

The team claimed that a {{convert|1|m2}} membrane could generate around 4&amp;nbsp;kW and be capable of generating up to 30 MWh per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |title=Nanotubes boost potential of salinity power as a renewable energy source |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028032447/http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity===
At Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that [[ammonium bicarbonate]] disappears into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in warm water to form ammonia bicarbonate again in cold water. So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |title=Energy from Water |accessdate=2017-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202195525/http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible negative environmental impact==

Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality, namely salinity. Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine, brackish, or freshwater environments. There are species that can tolerate both, but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment. The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water. The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters, if done in large quantities and with any regularity, will cause salinity fluctuations. While some variation in salinity is usual, particularly where fresh water (rivers) empties into an ocean or sea anyway, these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters. Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes.&lt;ref name=Montague&gt;Montague, C., Ley, J. A Possible Effect of Salinity Fluctuation on Abundance of Benthic Vegetation and Associated Fauna in Northeastern Florida Bay. Estuaries and Coasts. 1993. Springer New York. Vol.15 No. 4. Pg. 703-717&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions, the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments.

The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer, away from the surface and bottom ecosystems.

Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes. Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local, state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to 18 months.

A '''party motivator''' is a person paid to entertain attendants at a party. Typically, party motivators are attractive young men and women who dress fashionably and attempt to engage guests in socializing and dancing. Hiring party motivators is primarily a phenomenon within the [[United States|American]] upper middle and upper classes; they are especially common at [[bar mitzvah]]s.

'''Peter William Geoffrey Newman AO''' (born 1945) is an environmental scientist, author and educator based in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. He is currently Professor of Sustainability at [[Curtin University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.curtin.edu.au/about/staff/index.cfm/p.newman Curtin University: Staff Profiles], retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded an Order of Australia for [[sustainable transport]] and urban design in 2014. 
He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in Chemistry (1972, University of Western Australia) and completed post doctoral studies in [[Environmental Science]], [[Delft University of Technology|Delft University]], Dip EST, Environmental Science, 1972.

Newman has written 20 books and over 330 papers on sustainable cities and is most known for creating the term ‘[[Automobile dependency|automobile dependence]]’ in the second half of the 1980s. He was closely associated with the redevelopment of Perth's rail system from 1979 to the present, which is now seen as a model for how car dependent cities can change towards more sustainable transport. He is a Lead Author for Transport on the IPCC - [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

==Career and influence==
Newman is best known internationally for popularizing the term ‘[[Automobile dependency|automobile dependence]]’ in the second half of the 1980s to explain how the cities of the time based on sprawling suburbs were inevitably leading to the growth in automobile use.  He led an international research project with colleague Jeff Kenworthy on transport practices and structures (original data collected on 33 global cities). The results were published in ''Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook'',  which introduced the concept of [[Automobile dependency|car dependence]] -  now a feature of planning literature and policy.  The two researchers later collaborated on the book ''Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming Automobile Dependence'' which was launched in the [[White House]] in 1999, as the President’s [[Commission on Sustainable Development|Council on Sustainable Development]] was moving toward a more urban focus, and more recently The End of Automobile Dependence: How Cities are Moving Beyond Car-based Planning.

In ''Cities as Sustainable Ecosystems: Principles and Practices'' written with Isabella Jennings, Newman shows how city residents can begin to reintegrate into their bioregional environment, and how cities themselves can be planned with [[ecological sustainability]] in mind. Drawing on examples from many parts of the world, the authors show how urban redevelopment in some cities has involved harvesting rainwater, greening roofs, and producing [[renewable energy]]. Other cities have biodiversity parks for endangered species, community gardens that support a connection to their foodshed, and pedestrian-friendly spaces that encourage walking and cycling.&lt;ref name=sust&gt;[http://www.sustainability.murdoch.edu.au/  Cities as Sustainable Ecosystems: Principles and Practices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021023827/http://www.sustainability.murdoch.edu.au/ |date=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local, State and Federal Government===
Between 1976-80 Newman has served as a local government councillor in the [[City of Fremantle]].&lt;ref name="Curtin"&gt;[http://humanities.curtin.edu.au/about/staff/index.cfm/p.newman Curtin University: ''Staff Profiles''], retrieved 6 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Newman has been a government advisor through three secondments to the Western Australian State Government. In the last secondment (2001–03), he was the Director of Sustainability Policy in the Department of Premier and Cabinet where he managed and wrote the State Sustainability Strategy: the first in the world at the state/province level.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 2004-2005 he was the New South Wales Sustainability Commissioner.

Between 2008 and 2014 he was a member of [[Infrastructure Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/aa/releases/2008/May/AA043_2008.htm The Hon Anthony Albanese MP: Media Release 19 May 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303100203/http://www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/aa/releases/2008/May/AA043_2008.htm |date=3 March 2011 }}, retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
From 1989 to 2007 Newman was Director of the Institute for Sustainability and Technology Policy, [[Murdoch University]] in [[Murdoch, Western Australia]]. In 2007, Newman left Murdoch University to join Curtin University.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://campusnews.curtin.edu.au/media_centre/archives.cfm?release=2823 Sustainability experts join Curtin]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006-07 he was a [[Fulbright Scholar]] at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville.

===International advisor===
Peter Newman is member of the Global Research Network on Human Settlements Advisory Board and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the [[UNESCO]] ''SCOPE Ecopolis Project''. He is Senior Consultant at [[Jan Gehl|Gehl Architects]], Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gehlarchitects.com/?#/160161/ Gehl Architects: ''Team Members''], retrieved 6 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Police are often a significant source of abuse for sex workers, particularly poor sex workers. Greater exposure to the police often means more experience of police abuse; one study found that sex workers with greater police oversight were more likely to be obliged to provide free sexual services to the police than sex workers with less police oversight.&lt;ref name="levittChicago"/&gt; For some groups of sex workers in some locations in the U.S., police are the primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="torrezChicago"/&gt; Police may be the most abusive towards sex workers who have experienced the most victimization from other sources; a study found that sex workers who had been manipulated, coerced, or forced into sex work were more likely to suffer police abuse than sex workers who chose to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="burnsAlaska"/&gt; 

Police abuse can have long lasting consequences; when police falsely arrest someone for prostitution, the resulting criminal record may make it difficult for that person to find jobs or get housing. Incarceration and court attendance for false charges can disrupt efforts to pursue careers outside of sex work, as when a student misses classes.&lt;ref name="viceNYC"/&gt; Seemingly innocuous actions can affect safety; when officers tell sex workers to "move along", the workers often end up in areas where they feel less safe.&lt;ref name="arringtonDC"/&gt; When police target an HIV+ person for repeated arrests, they may prevent the person from going to scheduled appointments with health care providers, and jail disrupts medication routines.&lt;ref name="hrwNewOrleans"/&gt; And sometimes abuse creates physical harm that is immediate and intentional, as when police officers physically assault a sex worker without evidence of crime and without making an arrest.&lt;ref name="thukral0NYC"/&gt;

This article lists government investigations, research reports, and news articles that describe police abuse of sex workers in the United States, and gives a description of the relevant information from each document.

The general trend of the study statistics was that the sex workers who had suffered the worst victimization in the past were the ones most likely to be abused by the police.

The following tables compare the experiences of three groups: all the respondents in the study, the respondents where were manipulated or coerced into sex work, and the respondents who were forced into sex work.

Respondents who were manipulated or coerced into sex work were more likely to attempt to report a crime, but the police were less likely to take their report and more likely to threaten or arrest them.

The DOJ found "indications that the BCPD disregards reports of sexual assault by people involved in the sex trade..." Investigators heard from the community that officers were coercing sexual favors from sex workers. Internal records indicated that this was true and the officers weren't being punished. Prior to the DOJ investigation, an internal investigation by the BCPD found an officer receiving sex from a sex worker in exchange for money and immunity from arrest. The case was closed without any attempt to gather more evidence, interview the police officer, or prosecute the officer. Cases were opened for the same officer a second and third time for the same offense. The witness for the third case died before she could be interviewed, and only then did the BCPD review the officer's phone records and discover that he had sent sexually explicit messages to a number of female sex workers. The officer was allowed to retire. The DOJ found similar cases involving other officers.

The study compared two neighborhoods, one where none of the women had pimps, and one where all the women had pimps. The women without pimps were more likely to be arrested and three percent of all sexual services were provided to police officers free of charge. The women with pimps were less likely to be arrested and didn't provide free sexual services. Sex workers were more likely to have sex with a police officer than be arrested by one.

Twenty four percent of street-based sex workers had been raped by a police officer. Twenty percent had experienced other sexual assault from police officers. Women doing survival sex and women in drug houses experienced a lot of violence from police. Thirty percent of exotic dancers who had been raped were raped by police, and twenty percent of the sexual violence they experienced was committed by police. Twenty five percent of escorts had been robbed by a police officer. Eighteen percent of escorts had been forced to masturbate a police officer.

This is a survey of bad encounters experienced by young people in the sex trade and street economy. Bad encounters were divided into three categories: violence, harassment, and refusal to help. The largest source of both harassment and violence was the category of police, which included the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and security guards in schools. Sexual violence by police made up 11% of all bad encounters.

One of the main findings was that institutional violence made individual violence worse. When girls suffered harm and sought help, the system they were seeking help from often did more harm. An example was a girl being arrested when she tried to file a report for rape. Or this:

{{ quote
| text= I went to the hospital for a rape kit and when I got there the police officer accused me and my advocate of not cooperating. The officer started yelling at us both and said I was going to jail for lying. The officer never filed a report but called Child Services and I got sent to a group home but nothing ever happened with the rape.
}}

Another finding was that bad encounters increase when institutions work together. In over 40% of bad encounters with police, another institution was involved. Young people run away from hospitals, foster care, and other service systems because they are physically, emotionally, or sexually harmed or neglected. When police forcibly return someone to one of these settings, they place the young person back in the harmful situation they were escaping from.

An example of police working with another institution to scare a person away from getting help:

{{ quote
| text= I got hit on the head by someone on the train. The police took me to the hospital. The hospital tried to put me in the psych ward because I was transgender. They said I couldn't leave the hospital even though I didn't want to stay. They called the policeman back to try to force me to stay because they said I was a minor. I went to the bathroom then hid and left before they got there.
}}

The result was that the person never got the medical help they needed because of gender discrimination and fear of being put in a psych ward.

The researchers found that police frequently sexually assaulted youth in the sex trade. The following story, sex followed by arrest, was repeated many times:

{{ quote
| text= I was solicited by a police officer who said that if I had sex with him he wouldn't arrest me. So I did. Then afterwards he cuffed me and pressed charges anyway.
}}

Sometimes it was worse.

{{ quote
| text= I was going to meet a new john, it turned out to be a sting set up by the cops. He got violent with me, handcuffed me and then raped me. He cleaned me up for the police station and I got sentenced to four months in jail for prostitution.
}}

Young trans women profiled as prostitutes was another common story.

{{ quote
| text= I keep being arrested in Rogers Park just for standing still. They keep taking me in for prostitution even though I'm not doing anything at all. It's the same white cop doing it too.
}}

From the point of view of the young people in the study, the transition to an anti-trafficking regime hasn't made much difference.

{{ quote
| text= When being held in protective custody [because they said I was a victim of human trafficking] they started withholding my sheets, then towels, then pillows, then food because they said I wasn't telling them everything I could&amp;mdash;when in fact I was.
}}

And this:

{{ quote
| text= I was receiving a rape kit after a trafficking experience and the detective was questioning me and my advocate. The officer physically wouldn't let me out of the room. She threatened to send me and my advocate to jail unless we reported what happened [but I didn't want to tell her about my experience.] The officer got loud and in our faces, swore at us and made a big scene. I got between the officer and my advocate to get her out of my advocate's face. As soon as I could I ran out the door but the officer grabbed my arm so I pushed away and hid until I could get out of the hospital.

The sample consists of one hundred sixty nine respondents between the ages of thirteen and twenty four.

One respondent was given the choice between arrest and doing something "disgusting". She wouldn't tell the researcher what she was asked to do, but she told the other police officers at the station about it and they laughed at her.

A respondent was asked by an officer to show her breasts in order to avoid arrest. Another respondent had charges dropped because of police misconduct; the officer who arrested her had her perform oral sex on him.

Survey respondents said that police profiled transgender people as sex workers and subjected them to verbal abuse and sexual misconduct, including demands for sex in exchange for leniency. Police were arresting people for solicitation if they carried condoms. Even trans sex workers who weren't arrested for carrying condoms saw it happen to others and where afraid to carry condoms. Some police officers used possession of condoms to coerce trans sex workers into providing free sexual services. 

People who tested positive for HIV while in jail were visited by an HIV task force that scheduled appointments at a clinic. However, many people were rearrested before their scheduled appointment. One woman was arrested ten times in three years, preventing her from going to any scheduled appointments to receive care for her HIV infection during that period. Jail interrupts taking medication on a regular basis.

Transgender youth reported being picked up for prostitution or loitering for prostitution when they weren't working. One eighteen year old transgender youth reported being extorted for sex by police officers eight times. Once arrested, transgender youth were more likely to be sexually exploited by jail staff than cisgender youth were. 

Two quotes from cisgender respondents:

Police officers propositioned underage youth and made lewd comments. Most female youth in the study reported trading sex to avoid arrest. Pimps were not arrested or received less jail time than the youth that worked with them, even when one of the youths was identified as fourteen years old.

Abuse varied by location and police officer. Women were more likely to be arrested or ticketed in Brooklyn. Interactions with police in the Bronx were more likely to involve off-duty officers. However, a white woman in the Bronx reported that the police targeted her because she was white, telling her that she was making white people look bad. In Bushwick police harassment was so bad that a service organization was forced to change its location to protect its outreach staff. Latinas reported the worst harassment, including name-calling, stalking, and throwing food. A couple of women based in Bushwick reported daily harassment that caused them to avoid leaving their homes.

Examples of police language: 

{{ quote
| text= bitch

ho

slut

you're not dead yet?

we gotta go clean up the trash

why should we help you?
}}

A transwoman said she was subjected to constant harassment, and the officers who harassed her were the ones who wanted "oral sex on the side."

Thirty percent of the respondents reported threats of violence from the police, and twenty seven percent reported experiencing violence. One respondent said "I've seen cops get out of a car and beat a girl, and then get back in the car and leave." Another said that her greatest fear during arrest was "not coming home at all." The white woman from the Bronx said "... they throw you on the floor and they step on you..."

Another respondent reported seeing officers injure a women in the pelvic area to prevent her from working.
{{ quote
| text= ... it was like he was squeezing a handball or something, but really really hard... it was two guys in a car and they drove up on the sidewalk. He pushed her against the wall and then he pushed her against the wall after he finished that and then he said "now get off the street"...

One respondent reported that an officer followed her for thirty blocks in his civilian car. Another reported that an officer followed her and warned off clients with his bullhorn. Another reported that an officer felt her breasts and made her expose them as cars were driving by while he wrote a ticket. Some statements made by police officers to sex workers:

{{ quote
|text= It's hot tonight, it's a sweep, you should get out of here, now what can you do for me?

You wanna get arrested or you wanna give up some head?

I gave you two cigarettes, you want anything else, you know what you can do for me.

Can I rub against you for $10? [said during arrest]

Either you give me a blow job or I'm going to lock you up.

}}

Several respondents reported having money stolen while being searched or arrested.

A sampling of the false arrest stories:

*A respondent reported getting a summons while waiting to have her hair done. 

*A transwomen who was first arrested for prostitution at age fifteen reported that "I got arrested for prostitution long before I knew what prostitution was." She also said "... they just snatch you coming out of the subway, just because you're a tranny." 

*A ciswoman was approached in a park by an officer who checked and discovered that she had no outstanding warrants. He walked away and another officer approached her and arrested her. She was held for five hours before being released. By way of explanation, a police officer said "See this sheet? All these warrants aren't yours.[sic]"

*Another woman reported being stopped coming out of a grocery store. The police spilled her groceries on the ground and arrested her for prostitution.

This is an article from the Vice website. It opens with an ex-sex worker's story of false arrest; when she turned down an undercover officer's offer of money for sex, the police arrested her anyway. Because of being locked up, she missed a day of classes she needed to start a career outside of sex work. She informed the reporter that it's common for new officers to arrest women walking to the park where she was arrested, even though they're not working. One woman was arrested because the police said she was waving while wearing a low cut top and a miniskirt. Her attorney took pictures of her at arraignment wearing a jacket and pants and got the charges dropped. Another woman was arrested while wearing a peacoat and jeans that "outlined her legs."

A transwoman named Ryhannah Combs was picked up on prostitution charges while running errands. She was carrying no condoms but the arresting officer said she was carrying nine. Instead of being put in a cell, she was chained to a wall. The city settled when she sued.

A staff attorney at the Trafficking Victims Advocacy Project said that the police frequently verbally abused her clients when arresting them, and on multiple occasions have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.

Women who are addicted and becoming dope sick are targeted for sex. This was described as "a deal with the Devil," because the police officer will keep coming back for information, sex, or an easy arrest.

Study data was drawn from 1,400 client records from the Legal Aid Society's Exploitation Intervention Project. The researchers also interviewed twenty EIP clients who had had prostitution-related offenses cleared from their record.

Some of the study respondents had positive or neutral experiences with the police, but most of them had overwhelmingly negative experiences: verbal abuse, intimidation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and profiling.

Verbal abuse included slurs, derogatory comments, and refusal to use the person's native language, even when able to do so. Police used humiliation to extract cooperation. One trans woman described particularly intense humiliation, recurring with each arrest.

Some respondents had been propositioned by the police or had police as clients. One respondent described an officer who started off as a client. After their last session he came back the next day in his uniform and arrested her.

Some respondents reported repeated prostitution arrests by the same officer, even when the women weren't working. One woman was arrested while going to the store in pajamas and bedroom slippers. She described another arrest that occurred while she was meeting a cousin for dinner. She was charged even though the cousin came to the police station and told the police what they had been doing. One respondent described a police officer stating that he would lock her up if he saw her on the street.

Some respondents who were trafficked or victims of violence sought help from the police, only to be ridiculed or ignored.

2005

The study sample was fifty two indoor sex workers.

63% of the respondents had police-initiated contact with the police, but 63% of those said the contact was rare. Only one person, a trans woman, had police-initiated contact as often as a couple of times a week. The police in her neighborhood knew her because she had previously worked outdoors. They harassed her, honking at her as she was walking down the street, telling her to go home or they would arrest her, and calling her "Mr." or "homeboy". Another trans woman said the police harassed her because she was transgender.

Several respondents said that during arrests, police took their pictures with personal cameras. They believed the pictures were for the officers' personal use. 12% of respondents had been falsely arrested at least once.

29% of respondents had been taken into custody but released without arrest. The researchers believe the lack of police follow up indicates that there was no basis for taking the people into custody.

14% of respondents had experienced police violence and felt they had no recourse. One woman said she was beaten twice, both times because she refused to give police officers free oral sex. The first time, after she bit the officer's penis, he beat her until she passed out. Another woman was having problems with a particularly violent officer:

{{ quote
| text= One likes to beat me now and then, or he wants me to suck his dick. I mean, it's crazy. He hits me with his gun and gives me these marks on my legs and my back. I don't know what to do...

I can't call the other cops. I did that once and they asked this guy to stop beating me. But he got so mad that he came around and beat me up even worse. So I really have to get out of here. Now he wants me to give him 25% of what I make...

I had to go to the hospital because I got beat so bad.

Four respondents said that police had stolen money. One said that police steal from her about once a year. Two respondents had $4,000 and a laptop stolen from them during an arrest.

16% of respondents said they had been in sexual situations with the police. Some had sex with the police for protection or because the officers were customers, but others were picked up by the police and given the choice between sex and arrest.

Some of the Latinos reported regular police harassment.

The study sample was two hundred eighty three young people selected through RDS.

Most of the respondents had been profiled, but only a small number were profiled for sex work. White and black youth were more likely to be profiled than Latinx. A black Dominican trans woman described moving into Manhattan and talking a walk around her new neighborhood. A police officer stopped her and told her she had better not be "on a stroll." At the time, she didn't know what a stroll was.

For interactions initiated by the police, 38.5% of survey respondents reported being humiliated or verbally abused by police during relatively minor interactions such as checking ID. One respondent said the officer called her a whore, prostitute, and trick. During 8.6% of these interactions, officers confiscated or destroyed safe sex supplies, including condoms. 17.3% of respondents said that police-initiated interactions involved the officer asking for sexual services, or demanding sexual services to avoid arrest. 9.1% of respondents reported being assaulted by police officers. 3 respondents reported strip searches.

Seventy eight respondents were profiled as sex workers and ordered to "move along." The most common result of this was that they ended up in an area where they felt less safe.

75% of trans people and 82.4% of Latinos said they were treated worse than others when they were in lock up.

When the survey respondents initiated contact with the police, usually to report a crime, in a number of cases the police tried to have sex with them. This seemed to be particularly true of trans Latinas.

This is an overview of the literature available at the time of publication on law enforcement abuse of various groups of women. There's a short discussion of sex workers at the end.

Police abuse of sex workers includes verbal insults, coerced sex, brutal beatings, and rape. When police know that a woman is a sex worker, they may harass her when she is not working. 

The most common abuses are verbal abuse and threats to arrest sex workers if the police don't receive sexual services. Police often assume that sex workers don't care who they will have sex with and will do anything to avoid arrest. But experienced street-based sex workers often refuse to provide free services. They are resigned to frequent arrests, including arrests for questionable charges. What they want to avoid are fear and indignity forced on them by bad officers.

One observer describes Chicago police picking up sex workers when the workers are on their way to and from work, and asking for sexual services. New York City police have threatened to shut down sex parlors if they didn't get free sexual services. Women picked up in raids have been taken away in their underwear and had their possessions confiscated.

Trans female sex workers face these and other more complex forms of abuse. If their official documentation doesn't match their gender presentation, they may face verbal abuse and cruel jokes centered around the difference. They may be subjected to unnecessary and illegal strip searches, ostensibly to determine their gender.

Police use sex work to profile people, stop them on the street, intimidate and question them, check for warrants, and often arrest them.

The discussion of sex work ends with the description of two rapes suffered by Mary Barr. In the first, a police officer chased off her client and then told her she might as well have sex with him because the client had already paid. In the second, an officer ordered her into the back seat of his car, told her "do what you do best," and then raped her.

Best Practices Policy Project, Desiree Alliance, and Sex Workers Outreach Project- NYC

2014-09-15

This was submitted as part of the UN Universal Periodic Review of the U.S.A.

During arrest or taking someone into custody, police often degrade or humiliate sex workers, including removing wigs or clothing, confiscating or destroying property, making homophobic, anti-transgender, and racists slurs, and engaging on sexual harassment. Organizations working with sex workers have documented a pattern of police practice that includes assault, sexual harassment, public strip searches for the purpose of viewing genitalia, and rape. This pattern of practice is supported by the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining justice in these cases. 

Police are able to extend this abuse from sex workers to trans women and women of color by profiling them as sex workers. A study in Los Angeles of Latina trans women found that 42% reported being solicited for sex by law enforcement and 24% reported being sexually abused by police officers.

When sex workers try to report crimes against them, officers don't take their complaints seriously, refuse to file a report, and may arrest them, physically assault them, or pressure them for sex. When a sex worker tried to bring charges against a security guard who handcuffed and raped her, the police referred to the guard as "a big teddy bear", and added exculpatory statements to her report that she didn't make. This refusal to deal with crimes against sex workers leads serial killers to target sex workers and people profiled as sex workers.

While most witnesses who are in danger because of their testimony are put in witness protection programs, sex workers are pressured to testify by putting them in jail, exposing them to witness intimidation and denying them their right to liberty. An African-American trans female sex worker was placed in the mens' jail in Baltimore in an effort to compel her to testify in a violent crime case. Police in some areas force sex workers to participate in drug stings, exposing them to violence from the people targeted by the stings.

In New York, transgender and gender non-conforming people are often profiled as sex workers and arrested. They then have to decide whether to request being held as a "special category" prisoner. If they make the request, police are often harsh, holding them alone in a back cell longer than usual or assaulting them. If no empty cells are available, police chain them to a desk or metal bar, often for hours at a time. If they don't make the request, they may be put in a cell where they aren't safe, or the police may incite trouble with the other prisoners by saying "here's another [anti-LGBT slur] for you."

Police discourage the use of condoms by using condoms as evidence, or they destroy condoms and safe sex supplies. This encourages the spread of HIV and STIs. Carrying condoms may also be a signal for sexual harassment, cuing police to ask intrusive questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, touch inappropriately, and make disparaging comments. Police particularly target young women of color and trans youth and gender non-conforming youth of color.

Sex workers with severe injuries from violent attacks are often belittled and blamed for the attacks, and police often don't escort them or refer them to medical care. People in medical facilities seeking care for injuries from attacks have been accusingly questioned by police officers when they were profiled as sex workers.

The study sample consisted of fifteen woman who were sex workers, trafficked victims, or both.

Six of the twelve women who had been trafficking victims left their trafficking situation without help from law enforcement, through the help of a coworker or an attorney they met through a coworker or friend. Nationwide, it appears that the majority of trafficking victims escape without the involvement of law enforcement. One supervisor in a national organization said that 90% of their cases were not produced by raids or identified by law enforcement.

(N.b. Most people who fit the legal definition of trafficking victim seem to exit trafficking without any organizational help. In a study of underage sex workers in NYC, only 2% said they would ever go to a service organization if they were in trouble.&lt;ref name="curtisNYC"/&gt; On the whole, they age out of sex work rather than being "rescued." Young sex workers studied in NYC and Atlantic City experienced greater control over their work over time, regardless of whether they had pimps.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, it appears that the majority of people who fall under the category of trafficking victim exit the category through their own efforts. Only a minority of trafficking victims exit trafficking with help from organizations created to help them. Of that minority, only a further minority, perhaps 10%, are identified by law enforcement. And this study suggests that most of the people picked up in raids could have been rescued or self-rescued in other, less traumatic ways, had they been aware of the help available to them.)

Of the six trafficking victims picked up in law enforcement raids, one would have left her situation in a few days if she had not been picked up in a raid and arrested. As a result of the raid, she was pistol-whipped by a police officer and incarcerated. Her conclusion:

{{ quote
| text= A better way to help leave my situation would be anything that didn't involve the police.
}}

Another would have left on her own if she had known where to go, and another said that she would have preferred leaving with a coworker rather than being picked up in a raid. One didn't know another way to escape, but still thought the raid was "terrible." Had these women known of the resources available to trafficked people, they very likely could have left on their own and gotten the assistance they needed without the trauma or injury of a raid.

Raids often involve intimidation, verbal abuse, excessive force, and sexual harassment. Raids result in detention and deportation of trafficking victims who are afraid to come forward, or who come forward and aren't believed. Victims who aren't detained or deported are often terrorized into silence. 

The respondents who experienced raids didn't know which government agency was raiding them, and in one case initially knew only that they were being attacked by people carrying guns. They didn't know what purpose the raids had, other than to detain and deport them, and they didn't know what was going to happen to them.

The women who left trafficking situations on their own, without being traumatized by a law enforcement raid, were better able to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18950">'''Protein [[adsorption]]''' refers to the adhesion of [[protein]]s to solid surfaces.  This phenomenon is an important issue in the [[food processing industry]], particularly in [[milk processing]] and [[wine making|wine]] and [[beer making]].  Excessive adsorption, or protein fouling, can lead to health and sanitation issues, as the adsorbed protein is very difficult to clean and can harbor bacteria, as is the case in [[biofilm]]s.  Product quality can be adversely affected if the adsorbed material interferes with processing steps, like [[pasteurization]].  However, in some cases protein adsorption is used to improve food quality, as is the case in [[Finings|fining]] of wines.

==Protein adsorption==
Protein adsorption and protein fouling can cause major problems in the food industry (particularly the [[dairy industry]]) when proteins from food adsorb to processing surfaces, such as [[stainless steel]] or plastic (e.g. [[polypropylene]]). Protein fouling is the gathering of protein aggregates on a surface.  This is most common in heating processes that create a temperature gradient between the equipment and the bulk substance being heated.&lt;ref name= fouling&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ayadi | first = MA |author2=T Benezech  |author3=F Chopard  |author4=M Berthou  | title = Thermal Performance of a Flat Ohmic Cell Under Non-fouling and Whey Protein Fouling Conditions | journal = LWT-Food Science and Technology | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In protein-fouled heating equipment, adsorbed proteins can create an insulating layer between the heater and the bulk material, reducing heating efficiency.  This leads to inefficient sterilization and pasteurization.  Also, proteins stuck to the heater may cause a burned taste or color in the bulk material.&lt;ref name= fouling /&gt;  Additionally, in processes that employ filtration, protein aggregates that gather on the surface of the filter can block the flow of the bulk material and greatly reduce filter efficiency.&lt;ref name= filter&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ho | first = Chia-Chi |author2=Andrew L. Zydney  | title = Protein Fouling of Asymmetric and Composite Microfiltration Membranes | journal = Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of adsorption ==

===Beer stone===
[[Beerstone]] is a buildup that forms when oxalate, proteins, and calcium or magnesium salts from the grains and water in the beer brewing process precipitate and form scale on kegs, barrels and tap lines.  The minerals adsorb to the surface of the container first, driven by charge attractions. Proteins are often coordinated to these minerals in the solution and can bind with them to the surface. In other cases proteins also adsorb to the minerals on the surface, making deposits difficult to remove,&lt;ref name=beerstone&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Johnson | first = Dana | date = March 23, 1998| title = Removing Beerstone |url = http://www.birkocorp.com/brewery/white-papers/removing-beerstone-a-look-at-alternative-cleaning-methods/ | magazine = Modern Brewery Age |via=Birko Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as providing a surface that can easily harbor microorganisms.   If built-up beer stone inside tap lines flakes off, it can negatively affect the quality of the finished product by making beer hazy and contributing "off" flavors.  It is also harmful from a nutritional standpoint: oxalates can decrease absorption of calcium in the body, in addition to increasing risk of kidney stone formation.&lt;ref name=oxalate&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = McIntire | first = Donald B.  | title = Beer Lagering Process |journal = US Pat. No. 3,128,188  | year = 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wine making ===
Grape and [[wine protein]]s tend to aggregate and form hazes and sediment in finished wines, especially white wines.&lt;ref name=wine1&gt;{{cite book |title= Wine Chemistry and Biochemistry|last= Moreno-Arribas|first= M. Victoria|author2=Carmen Polo |author3=María Carmen Polo |year= 2009|publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |page= 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haze-causing proteins can persist in wine due to low settling velocities or charge repulsion on individual particles. Fining agents, such as [[bentonite]] clays, are used to clarify wine by removing these proteins.  Also, proteinaceous agents such as albumin, casein, or gelatin are used in wine clarification to remove tannins or other phenols.&lt;ref name=wine2&gt;{{cite book |title= Principles and Practices of Winemaking|last= Boulton|first= Roger B.|author2=Vernon L. Singleton |author3=Linda F. Bisson |year= 1996|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers Group |page= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofilms===
A [[biofilm]] is a community of microorganisms adsorbed to a surface.  Microorganisms in biofilms are enclosed in a polymeric matrix consisting of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and proteins.  Seconds after a surface (usually metal) is placed in a solution, inorganic and organic molecules adsorb onto the surface. These molecules are attracted mainly by Coulombic forces (see above section), and can adhere very strongly to the surface. This first layer is called the conditioning layer, and is necessary for the microorganisms to bind to the surface. These microorganisms then attach reversibly by [[Van der Waals force]]s, followed by irreversible adhesion through self-produced attachment structures such as pili or flagella.&lt;ref name=biofilm1&gt;{{cite book |title= Microbial Biofilms|last= Lappin-Scott|first= Hilary M. |author2=J. William Costerton |year= 1995|publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biofilms form on solid substrates such as stainless steel.  A biofilm's enclosing polymeric matrix offers protection to its microbes, increasing their resistance to detergents and cleaning agents.  Biofilms on food processing surfaces can be a biological hazard to food safety.  Increased chemical resistance in biofilms can lead to a persistent contamination condition.&lt;ref name=biofilm2&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Tarver  | first = Toni  | title = Biofilms: A Threat to Food Safety  | journal = Food Technology  | volume = 63  | issue = 2  | pages = 46–52  | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy industry===
[[File:Pasteurized milk.jpg|thumb|Pasteurized milk being held in bulk heating tank for cheese making.]]
Thermal treatment of milk by indirect heating (e.g. pasteurization) to reduce microbial load and increase shelf life is generally performed by a [[plate heat exchanger]].  Heat exchanger surfaces can become fouled by adsorbed milk protein deposits.  Fouling is initiated by formation of a protein monolayer at room temperature, followed by heat induced aggregation and deposition of [[whey protein]] and calcium phosphate deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Visser|first1= J|last2= Jeurnink|first2= Th. J. M|year= 1997|title= Fouling of Heat Exchangers in the Dairy Industry|journal= Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science|volume= 14|issue= 4|pages= 407–424|doi=10.1016/s0894-1777(96)00142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adsorbed proteins decrease efficiency of heat transfer and potentially affect product quality by preventing adequate heating of milk.

==Mechanisms for protein adsorption==
The common trend in all examples of protein adsorption in the food industry is that of adsorption to minerals adsorbed to the surface first. This phenomenon has been studied but it is not well understood. [[Spectroscopy]] of proteins adsorbed onto clay-like minerals show variations in the C=O and N-H [[chemical bond|bond]] stretches, meaning that these bonds are involved in the protein binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fusi|first1= P.| last2= Ristori|first2= G.G.| last3= Calamai| first3= L.|last4= Stotzky|first4=G.|year= 1989|title=Adsorption and Binding of Protein on "clean" (Homoionic) and "dirty" (coated with Fe oxyhydroxides) Montmorillonite, Illite and Kaolinite| journal= Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume= 21| pages=911–920| doi=10.1016/0038-0717(89)90080-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coulombic===
In some cases proteins are attracted to surfaces by an excessive [[surface charge]].  When a surface in a fluid has a net charge, ions in the fluid will adsorb to the surface.  Proteins also have charged surfaces due to charge amino acid residues on the surface of the protein. The surface and the protein are then attracted by Coulombic forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Andrade|first1= J.D. |last2= Hlady|first2= V.|last3= Wei| first3= A.P.| year=1992|title= Adsorption of Complex Proteins at Interfaces| journal=Pure Appl. Chem.| volume= 64| pages= 1777–1781| doi=10.1351/pac199264111777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attraction a protein feels from a charged surface (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) depends exponentially on the surface's charge, as described by the following formula:&lt;ref name =surface&gt;{{cite book|title= Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces| last1= Butt| first1=Hans-Jurgen| last2=Graf| first2= Karlheinz| last3= Kappl| first3=Michael| year=2006| publisher=Wiley-VCH| location=Federal Republic of Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi=\phi_0 e^{\frac{-x}{\lambda_D}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
* '''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;''' is the potential felt by the protein
* '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;''' is the actual potential of the surface
* '''x''' is the distance from the protein to the surface, and
* '''&lt;math&gt;\lambda_D&lt;/math&gt;''' is the [[Debye length]].

A protein's surface's potential is given by the number of charged amino acids it has and its [[isoelectric point]], pI.

===Thermodynamic===
Protein adsorption can also occur as a direct result of heating a mixture. Protein adsorption in milk processing is often used as a model for this type of adsorption in other situations. Milk is composed mainly of water, with less than 20% of suspended solids or dissolved proteins. Proteins make up only 3.6% of milk in total, and only 26% of the components that are not water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheyoflife.org/faq.cfm#1| title=Whey Protein FAQ's}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are all responsible for fouling that occurs during [[pasteurization]].

[[File:Composition of Milk Pie Chart.svg|thumb|Composition of solids (non-water elements) in milk]]

As milk is heated during [[pasteurization]] many of the proteins in the milk are denatured. Pasteurization temperatures can reach 161&amp;nbsp;°F (71.7&amp;nbsp;°C). This temperature is high enough to denature the proteins below, lowering the nutritional value of the milk and causing fouling. Milk is heated to these high temperatures for a short time (15–20 seconds) to reduce the amount of [[denaturization]]. However fouling from denatured proteins is still a significant problem.  
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center
|-
!'''Protein'''!!'''ΔH'''!!'''Denaturization Temperature (K)'''!!'''Tm (C)&lt;ref name=Isotherm/&gt;'''
|-
|β-[[Lactoglobulin]]||599±19||344.0||70.85
|-
|α-[[Lactalbumin]]||184±11||312.7||39.55
|-
|BSA||799±44||334.3||61.15
|}
[[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturation]] exposes hydrophobic amino acid residues in the protein, which had been previously protected by the protein. The exposed hydrophobic amino acids decrease the entropy of the water surrounding them, making it favorable for surface adsorption. Some of the β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) will adsorb directly onto the surface of a heat exchanger or container. Other denatured β-lg molecules adsorb to casein [[micelles]], which are also present in the milk. As more and more β-lg proteins bind to the casein micelle it forms an aggregate, which will then diffuse to the heat exchanger and/or surface of the container. 
[[File:Denatrued_Adsorption.png|thumb|Mechanism of denaturing protein adsorption]]

===Biochemical===
While the aggregates can explain much of the protein fouling found in milk processing, this does not account for it all.  A third type of fouling has been discovered that is explained by the chemical interactions of the denatured β-lg proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Nakanishi|first1=Kazuhiro|last2=Sakiyama|first2=Takaharu|last3=Imamura|first3=Koreyoshi| title=Review On the Adsorption of Proteins on Solid Surfaces, a Common but Very Complicated Phenomenon| year=2001| journal=Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering| volume=91| pages=233–244| doi=10.1016/s1389-1723(01)80127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

β-lg contains 5 [[cysteine]] residues, four of which are covalently bonded to each other, forming an S-S bond.  When β-lg is denatured, the fifth [[cysteine]] residue is exposed to the water. This residue then bonds to other β-lg proteins, including those already adsorbed to the surface. This produces a strong interaction between the denatured proteins and the surface of the container.

==Isotherms==
Isotherms are used to quantify the amount of adsorbed protein on a surface at a constant temperature, depending on the concentration of protein above the surface.  Researchers have used a Langmuir-type isotherm model to describe experimental values for protein adsorption.&lt;ref name=Isotherm&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Al-Malah|first1= Kamal|last2= McGuire|first2=Joseph|last3= Sproul|first3= Robert| year= 1995 | title=A Macroscopic Mocel for the Single-Component Protein Adsorption Isotherm| journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science| volume= 170 |pages= 261–268 | doi=10.1006/jcis.1995.1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{V_pC_e}{A_pe^{\frac{W_aA_c}{RT}+V_pC_e}}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation 
* '''&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;''' is the amount of adsorbed protein
* '''&lt;math&gt;A_c&lt;/math&gt;''' is the surface area per molecule
* '''&lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt;''' is the partial molar volume of protein
* '''&lt;math&gt;W_a&lt;/math&gt;''' is the negative of the Gibbs Free Energy of adsorption per unit area and
* '''&lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt;''' is the equilibrium protein concentration.

This equation has been applied to a laboratory setting of protein adsorption at temperatures higher than 50&amp;nbsp;°C from a model solution of protein and water. It is especially useful for modeling protein fouling in milk processing.

== Removal of adsorbed proteins ==
Adsorbed proteins are among the most difficult food soils to remove from food contact surfaces.  In particular, heat-denatured proteins (such as those found in dairy industry applications) adhere tightly to surfaces and require strong alkaline cleaners for removal.&lt;ref name = marriott&gt;{{cite book |title= Principles of Food Sanitation|last= Marriott|first= Norman G.|author2=Robert B. Gravani |year=2006 |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media|location= New York|page= 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important that cleaning methods are capable of removing both visible and non-visible protein soils.  Nutrients for bacterial growth must be removed as well as biofilms that may have built up on the food contact surface.  Proteins are water-insoluble, slightly soluble in acidic solutions and soluble in alkaline solutions, which limits the type of cleaner that can be used to remove protein from the surface.&lt;ref name=marriott/&gt;  Generally speaking, highly alkaline cleaners with peptizing and wetting agents are most effective in protein removal on food contact surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fs077|title= Basic Elements of Equipment Cleaning and Sanitizing in Food Processing and Handling Operations|author= Ronald H. Schmidt|date= July 1997|publisher= Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cleaning temperature is also a concern for effective protein removal.  As temperature increases, the activity of the cleaning compound increases, making soil removal easier.  However, at higher temperatures (&gt; 55&amp;nbsp;°C) proteins denature and cleaning efficacy is reduced.&lt;ref name = marriott/&gt;

===Alkaline cleaners===
Alkaline cleaners are classified as compounds with pH 7-14.  Proteins are most effectively removed from surfaces by cleaners with a pH of 11 or higher.&lt;ref name=marriott/&gt;  An example of a strong alkaline cleaning agent is [[sodium hydroxide]], also called caustic soda.  Although sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can cause corrosion on food contact surfaces such as stainless steel, it is the preferred cleaning agent for protein removal due to its efficacy in dissolving proteins and dispersing/emulsifying food soils.  Silicates are often added to these cleaners to reduce corrosion on metal surfaces.  The mechanism of alkaline cleaning action in proteins follows a three-step process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fryer|first1= P J|last2= Christian |first2= G K | last3 = Liu | first3 = W|year= 2006|title= How Hygiene Happens: physics and chemistry of cleaning |journal= International Journal of Dairy Technology |volume= 59|issue= 2|pages= 76–84 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0307.2006.00249.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gel formation:  Upon contact with the alkaline solution, the protein soil swells and forms a removable gel.
# Protein removal:  The protein gel is removed through mass transfer, while the cleaning agent continues to diffuse through the soil, increasing gel formation.
# Decay stage:  The protein gel has been eroded to the point where it is a thin deposit.  Removal at this stage is governed by shear stress forces and mass transfer of the gel.
[[Hypochlorite]] is often added to alkaline cleaners to peptize proteins.  Chlorinated cleansers work by oxidizing sulfide crosslinks in proteins.&lt;ref name = marriott/&gt;  Cleaning speed and efficiency is improved due to increased diffusion of the cleaner into the soil matrix, now composed of smaller, more soluble proteins.

===Enzyme cleaners===
[[File:Enzyme mechanism 1.jpg|thumb|Basic mechanism of enzyme action]]
Enzyme-based cleaners are especially useful for biofilm removal.  Bacteria are somewhat difficult to remove with traditional alkaline or acid cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Flint|first1= S H |last2= van den Elzen|first2= H | last3 = Brooks | first3 = J D | last4 = Bremer | first4 = P J|year= 1999|title= Removal and inactivation of thermo-resistant streptococci colonising stainless steel|journal=International Dairy Journal|volume= 9|issue= 7|pages= 429–436 | doi=10.1016/s0958-6946(99)00048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enzyme cleaners are more effective on biofilms since they work as proteases by breaking down proteins at bacterial attachment sites.  They work at maximum efficiency at high pH and at temperatures below 60&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = marriott/&gt;  Enzyme cleaners are an increasingly attractive alternative to traditional chemical cleaners because of biodegradability and other environmental factors, such as reduced wastewater generation and energy savings from using cold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Palmowski|first1=L |last2= Baskaran|first2= K | last3 = Wilson | first3 = H | last4 = Watson | first4 = B|title= Clean in Place – A Review of Current Technology and its Use in the Food and Beverage Industry | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are typically more expensive than alkaline or acid cleaners.

'''Qinpu''' ({{zh|t=「琴譜」}}) are [[tablature]] [[Sheet music|score]] collections for the Chinese musical instrument, the [[guqin]]. 

==What are qinpu?==
Qinpu are collections of tablatures of music for the guqin. In the past, music was passed on from teacher to student. Only recently has tablature been written down, often to preserve music or as a reference book. Tablature comes in form of individual and collections. Collections often have additional material attached to them, like explanation of fingering, qin lore, music theory, etc.

===Different types of qinpu===
There are several different types of qinpu one can obtain: original editions, photographic reprint, [[lithographic]] facsimiles and modern reset editions.

'''Original editions''' are qinpu printed at the original time of publication, or re-issues during the past. These are mostly kept in libraries and private collections. Since they are original, they tend to be fragile.

'''Photographic reprints''' is basically a scan of the original qinpu and reduced size reprint in modern binding. The most famous is the ''Qinqu Jicheng''.

'''Lithographic facsimiles''' are becoming more popular. The original qinpu is scanned, then it is lithographically printed on xuan paper. They are bound in [[traditional Chinese book binding]] method. 

'''Modern reset editions''' appeared after 2005. These have modern typographic elements and are often reset using more recent editions or handcopies of original qinpu.

The '''Rational Unified Process''' ('''RUP''') is an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative]] [[software development process]] framework created by the [[Rational Software]] Corporation, a division of [[IBM]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/IBM-Acquires-Rational/ IBM Acquires Rational]&lt;/ref&gt; RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process [[Software framework|framework]], intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs. RUP is a specific implementation of the [[Unified Process]].

== History ==
Rational Software originally developed the rational unified process as a software process product. The product includes a hyperlinked knowledge-base with sample [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] and detailed descriptions for many different types of activities. RUP is included in the [[IBM Rational Method Composer]] (RMC) product which allows customization of the process.

[[Philippe Kruchten]], an experienced Rational technical representative was tasked with heading up the original RUP team. This journey began with the creation of the Rational Objectory Process (ROP) in 1996, when Rational acquired the Objectory Process that had been written by [[Ivar Jacobson]] and company. This was renamed Rational Unified Process (RUP) in subsequent releases, in part to align the name with that of the Unified Modeling Language.

These initial versions combined the Rational Software organisation's extensive field experience building object-oriented systems (referred to by Rational field staff as the Rational Approach) with Objectory's guidance on practices such as use cases, and incorporated extensive content from Jim Rumbaugh's [[Object-modeling technique|Object Modeling Technology]] (OMT) approach to modeling, Grady Booch's [[Booch method]], and the newly released [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] 0.8.&lt;ref name='rop-overview'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscn.at/select_newspaper/object/rational.html |title=The Rational Objectory Process - A UML-based Software Engineering Process |accessdate=2014-12-17 |last=Jacobson |first=Sten |date=2002-07-19 |publisher=[[Rational Software Scandinavia AB]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='rup-introduction-history'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=RYCMx6o47pMC&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Rational Unified Process: An Introduction
|pages=33
|accessdate=2014-12-17 |last=Kruchten |first=Philippe |date=2004-05-01 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help make this growing knowledge base more accessible, [[Philippe Kruchten]] was tasked with the assembly of an explicit process framework for modern software engineering. This effort employed the [[HTML]]-based process delivery mechanism developed by Objectory. The resulting "Rational Unified Process" (RUP) completed a strategic tripod for Rational:

* a ''tailorable process'' that guided development
* ''tools'' that automated the application of that process
* ''services'' that accelerated adoption of both the process and the tools.

This guidance was augmented in subsequent versions with knowledge based on the experience of companies that Rational had acquired.

In 1997, a requirements and test discipline were added to the approach, much of the additional material sourced from the Requirements College method developed by Dean Leffingwell et al. at Requisite, Inc., and the SQA Process method developed at SQA Inc., both companies having been acquired by Rational Software.

In 1998 Rational Software added two new disciplines:
# business modeling, much of this content had already been in the Objectory Process
# a Configuration and Change Management discipline, sourced through the acquisition of Pure Atria  Corporation.

These additions lead to an overarching set of principles that were defined by Rational and articulated within RUP as the six ''best practices'' for modern software engineering:
# Develop iteratively, with risk as the primary iteration driver&lt;ref name='rup-in-brief'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/1826.html#N100E4 |title=RUP in brief |accessdate=2011-07-12 |last=Aked |first=Mark |date=2003-11-25 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Manage requirements
# Employ a component-based architecture
# Model software visually
# Continuously verify quality
# Control changes

These best practices were tightly aligned with Rational's product line, and both drove the ongoing development of Rational's products, as well as being used by Rational's field teams to help customers improve the quality and predictability of their software development efforts.

Additional techniques including performance testing, UI Design, data engineering were included, and an update to reflect changes in UML 1.1.

In 1999, a project management discipline was introduced, as well as techniques to support real-time software development and updates to reflect UML 1.3. Besides, the first book to describe the process, The Unified Software Development Process ({{ISBN|0-201-57169-2}}), was published in the same year.

Between 2000 and 2003, a number of changes introduced guidance from ongoing Rational field experience with iterative development, in addition to tool support for enacting RUP instances and for customization of the RUP framework. These changes included:
# the introduction of concepts and techniques from approaches such as eXtreme Programming (XP), that would later come to be known collectively as agile methods. This included techniques such as pair programming, test-first design, and papers that explained how RUP enabled XP to scale for use on larger projects.
# a complete overhaul of the testing discipline to better reflect how testing work was conducted in different iterative development contexts.
# the introduction of supporting guidance - known as "tool mentors" - for enacting the RUP practices in various tools. These essentially provided step-by-step method support to Rational tool users.
# automating the customization of RUP in a way that would allow customers to select parts from the RUP process framework, customize their selection with their own additions, and still incorporate improvements in subsequent releases from Rational.

IBM acquired Rational Software in February 2003.

In 2006, IBM created a subset of RUP tailored for the delivery of [[Agile software development|Agile]] projects - released as an OpenSource method called [[OpenUP]] through the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] web-site.&lt;ref&gt;
http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/openup/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rational unified process topics ==

=== RUP building blocks ===
RUP is based on a set of building blocks and content elements, describing what is to be produced, the necessary skills required and the step-by-step explanation describing how specific development goals are to be achieved. The main building blocks, or content elements, are the following:
* Roles (who) – A role defines a set of related skills, competencies and responsibilities.
* Work products (what) – A work product represents something resulting from a task, including all the documents and models produced while working through the process.
* Tasks (how) – A task describes a unit of work assigned to a Role that provides a meaningful result.

Within each iteration, the tasks are categorized into nine disciplines:
* Six "engineering disciplines"
** Business modelling
** Requirements
** Analysis and design
** Implementation
** Test
** Deployment
* Three supporting disciplines
** [[Software configuration management|Configuration and change management]]
** [[Software project management|Project management]]
** [[Environment discipline|Environment]]

=== Four project life-cycle phases ===
[[Image:Development-iterative.png|thumb|320px|RUP phases and disciplines.]]
The RUP has determined a project life-cycle consisting of four phases. These phases allow the process to be presented at a high level in a similar way to how a 'waterfall'-styled project might be presented, although in essence the key to the process lies in the iterations of development that lie within all of the phases. Also, each phase has one key objective and milestone at the end that denotes the objective being accomplished. The visualization of RUP phases and disciplines over time is referred to as the [[RUP hump]] chart.

==== Inception phase ====
The primary objective is to scope the system adequately as a basis for validating initial costing and budgets.
In this phase the business case which includes business context, success factors (expected revenue, market recognition, etc.), and financial forecast is established. To complement the business case, a basic use case model, project plan, initial risk assessment and project description (the core project requirements, constraints and key features) are generated.
After these are completed, the project is checked against the following criteria:
* [[Stakeholder (corporate)#In management|Stakeholder]] concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates.
* Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases.
* Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process.
* Depth and breadth of any architectural prototype that was developed.
* Establishing a baseline by which to compare actual expenditures versus planned expenditures.

If the project does not pass this milestone, called the life cycle objective milestone, it either can be cancelled or repeated after being redesigned to better meet the criteria.

==== Elaboration phase (Ortner) ====
The primary objective is to mitigate the key risk items identified by analysis up to the end of this phase.
The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. In this phase the problem domain analysis is made and the architecture of the project gets its basic form.

The outcome of the elaboration phase is:
* A use-case model in which the use-cases and the actors have been identified and most of the use-case descriptions are developed. The use-case model should be 80% complete.
* A description of the software architecture in a software system development process.
* An [[Executable Architecture|executable architecture]] that realizes architecturally significant use cases.
* Business case and risk list which are revised.
* A development plan for the overall project.
* Prototypes that demonstrably mitigate each identified technical risk.
* A preliminary user manual (optional)

This phase must pass the lifecycle architecture milestone criteria answering the following questions:
* Is the vision of the product stable?
* Is the architecture stable?
* Does the executable demonstration indicate that major risk elements are addressed and resolved?
* Is the construction phase plan sufficiently detailed and accurate?
* Do all stakeholders agree that the current vision can be achieved using current plan in the context of the current architecture?
* Is the actual vs. planned resource expenditure acceptable?

If the project cannot pass this milestone, there is still time for it to be canceled or redesigned. However, after leaving this phase, the project transitions into a high-risk operation where changes are much more difficult and detrimental when made.

The key domain analysis for the elaboration is the system architecture.

==== Construction phase ====
The primary objective is to build the software system.
In this phase, the main focus is on the development of components and other features of the system. This is the phase when the bulk of the coding takes place. In larger projects, several construction iterations may be developed in an effort to divide the use cases into manageable segments produce demonstrable prototypes.

==== Transition phase ====
The primary objective is to 'transit' the system from development into production, making it available to and understood by the end user.
The activities of this phase include training the end users and maintainers and beta testing the system to validate it against the end users' expectations. The system also goes through an evaluation phase, any developer which is not producing the required work is replaced or removed. The product is also checked against the quality level set in the Inception phase.

If all objectives are met, the product release milestone is reached and the development cycle is finished.

=== The IBM Rational Method Composer product ===
The IBM Rational Method Composer product is a tool for authoring, configuring, viewing, and publishing processes. See [[IBM Rational Method Composer]] and an open source version [[Eclipse Process Framework]] (EPF) project for more details.

=== Certification ===
In January 2007 the new RUP certification examination for ''IBM Certified Solution Designer - Rational Unified Process 7.0'' was released which replaces the previous version of the course called ''IBM Rational Certified Specialist - Rational Unified Process''.&lt;ref name='rupcert'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/jan07/krebs/ |title=The value of RUP certification |accessdate=2014-05-05 |last=Krebs |first=Jochen |date=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new examination will not only test knowledge related to the RUP content but also to the process structure elements.&lt;ref name='rup7'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/38008003.shtml |title=Spacer IBM Certified Solution Designer - IBM Rational Unified Process V7.0 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To pass the new RUP certification examination, a person must take IBM's ''Test 839: Rational Unified Process v7.0''. You are given 75 minutes to take the 52 question exam. The passing score is 62%.&lt;ref name='test389'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.bm.com/certify/tests/ovr839.shtml |title=Test 839: Rational Unified Process v7.0 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six best practices ===
Six best practices as described in the rational unified process is a paradigm in [[software engineering]] that lists six ideas to follow when designing any software project to minimize faults and increase productivity. These practices are:&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Schach (2004). ''Classical and Object-Oriented Software Engineering''. 6/e, WCB McGraw Hill, New York, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustana.ab.ca/~mohrj/courses/2000.winter/csc220/papers/rup_best_practices/rup_bestpractices.html Rational Unified Process white paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501034302/http://www.augustana.ab.ca/~mohrj/courses/2000.winter/csc220/papers/rup_best_practices/rup_bestpractices.html |date=2009-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Develop iteratively: It is best to know all requirements in advance; however, often this is not the case. Several software development processes exist that deal with providing solution on how to minimize cost in terms of development phases.
; Manage requirements: Always keep in mind the requirements set by users.
; Use components: Breaking down an advanced project is not only suggested but in fact unavoidable. This promotes ability to test individual components before they are integrated into a larger system. Also, code reuse is a big plus and can be accomplished more easily through the use of [[object-oriented programming]].
; Model visually: Use diagrams to represent all major components, users, and their interaction. "UML", short for [[Unified Modeling Language]], is one tool that can be used to make this task more feasible.
; Verify quality: Always make testing a major part of the project at any point of time. Testing becomes heavier as the project progresses but should be a constant factor in any software product creation.
; Control changes: Many projects are created by many teams, sometimes in various locations, different platforms may be used, etc. As a result, it is essential to make sure that changes made to a system are synchronized and verified constantly. (See [[Continuous integration]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">'''Roughness length''' (&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[parameter]] of some vertical wind profile equations that model the horizontal mean wind speed near the ground; in the [[log wind profile]], it is equivalent to the height at which the wind speed theoretically becomes zero. In reality the wind at this height no longer follows a mathematical logarithm. It is so named because it is typically related to the height of terrain roughness elements. Whilst it is not a physical length, it can be considered as a length-scale representation of the roughness of the surface.

==Application==
As an approximation, the roughness length is approximately one-tenth of the height of the surface roughness elements. For example, short grass of height 0.01m has a roughness length of approximately 0.001m. Surfaces are rougher if they have more protrusions. Forests have much larger roughness lengths than tundra, for example. Roughness length is an important concept in [[urban meteorology]] as the building of tall structures, such as skyscrapers, has an effect on roughness length and wind patterns.

==Life==

Sara Baartman, called "Saartjie" (the diminutive form), was born in the 1770s likely in the Camdeboo valley in the eastern part of the [[Cape Colony]]. It is commonly thought she was born in the Gamtoos valley, but she only moved there with her family years after her birth.&lt;ref name="crais_scully" /&gt; In 1810, she went to England with her employer, a free black man (a Cape designation for someone of slave descent) called Hendrik Cesars, and William Dunlop, an English doctor who worked at the Cape slave lodge.&lt;ref name="crais_scully" /&gt; They sought to show her for money on the London stage. Sara Baartman spent four years on stage in England and Ireland. Early on, her treatment on the [[Piccadilly]] stage caught the attention of British abolitionists, who argued that her performance was indecent and that she was being forced to perform against her will. Ultimately, the court ruled in favour of her exhibition after Dunlop produced a contract made between himself and Baartman. It is doubtful that this contract was valid: it was probably produced for the purposes of the trial.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; Cesars left the show and Dunlop continued to display Baartman in country fairs. Baartman also moved to [[Manchester]], where she was baptized as Sarah Bartmann. In 1814, after Dunlop's death, a man called Henry Taylor brought Baartman to Paris. He sold her to an animal trainer, S. Reaux, who made her amuse onlookers who frequented the [[Palais-Royal]]. [[Georges Cuvier]], founder and professor of comparative anatomy at the [[Museum of Natural History]], examined Baartman as he searched for proof of a so-called missing link between animals and human beings. Baartman's body was exploited for scientific racism.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} 

Baartman lived in poverty, and died in Paris of an undetermined inflammatory disease in December 1815. After her death, Cuvier [[dissection|dissected]] her body, and displayed her remains. For more than a century and a half, visitors to the [[Musée de l'Homme|''Museum of Man'']] in Paris could view her brain, skeleton and genitalia as well as a plaster cast of her body.  Her remains were returned to South Africa in 2002 and she was buried in the Eastern Cape on South Africa's [[National Women's Day]].&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Qureshi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qureshi|first=Sadiah|title=Displaying Sara Baartman, the 'Venus Hottentot'|journal=History of Science|date=June 2004|volume=42|pages=233–257|issue=136|doi=10.1177/007327530404200204|quote=The woman ... is now called Sara Baartman. Unfortunately, no record of her original name exists and she is better known by her epithet, the Hottentot Venus', to her contemporaries, present-day historians, and political activists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life in South Africa ===
Sara Baartman was born to a [[Khoikhoi]] family in the vicinity of the Camdeboo in what is now the [[Eastern Cape]] of South Africa, on land taken over by Dutch farmers.&lt;ref name="crais_scully" /&gt;&lt;ref name=atrest/&gt; Her father was killed by Bushmen while driving cattle.&lt;ref&gt;In her testimony to the Court of King's Bench via a Dutch interpreter Baartman said: 'Her father was a drover of cattle, and in going up the country was killed by the Bushmen.' ''The Times'' (London, England), 29 November 1810, p. 3: Law Report. Court of King's Bench.&lt;/ref&gt; Saartjie is the [[diminutive]] form of Sara; in Cape Dutch the use of the diminutive form commonly indicated familiarity, endearment or contempt. Her birth name is unknown.&lt;ref name=Qureshi /&gt;

Baartman spent her childhood and teenage years on settler farms. She went through puberty rites, and kept the small tortoise shell necklace, probably given to her by her mother, until her death in France. In the 1790s, a free black (the Cape designation for individuals of enslaved descent) trader named Peter Cesars met her and encouraged her to move to Cape Town, which had recently come under British control. Records do not show whether she was made to leave, or went willingly, or was sent by her family to Cesars. She lived in Cape Town for at least two years working in households as a washerwoman and a nursemaid, first for Peter Cesars, then in the house of a Dutch man in Cape Town. She moved finally to be a wet-nurse in the household of Peter Cesars' brother, Hendrik Cesars, outside of Cape Town in present day Woodstock.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Clifton Crais |author2=Pamela Scully |title=Hendrik Cesars and the Tragedies of Race in South Africa |url=http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2015/02/hendrik-cesars-and-the-tragedies-of-race-in-south-africa-2.html |website=Wonders and Marvels|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baartman lived alongside slaves in the Cesars' household. As someone of Khoisan descent she could not be formally enslaved{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, but probably lived in conditions similar to slaves in Cape Town. There is evidence that she had two children, though both died as babies.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; She had a relationship with a poor European military man, Hendrik Van Jong, who lived in Hout Bay near Cape Town, but the relationship ended when his regiment left the Cape.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; William Dunlop, a Scottish military surgeon in the Cape slave lodge, with a sideline in supplying showmen in Britain with animal specimens, suggested she travel to England to make money by exhibition. Baartman refused. Dunlop persisted and Sara Baartman said she would only go if Hendrik Cesars came too. He also refused, but became ever more in debt in part because of unfavorable lending terms because of his status as free black. Finally, in 1810 he agreed to go to England to make money through putting Baartman on stage. The party left for London in 1810. It is unknown if Baartman went willingly or was forced, but she was in no position to refuse even if she chose to do so.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

Dunlop was the frontman and conspirator behind the plan to exhibit Baartman: According to an English law report of 26 November 1810, an affidavit supplied to the Court of King's Bench from a "Mr. Bullock of Liverpool Museum" stated: "some months since a Mr. Alexander Dunlop, who, he believed, was a surgeon in the army, came to him sell the skin of a Camelopard, which he had brought from the Cape of Good Hope.... Some time after, Mr. Dunlop again called on Mr. Bullock, and told him, that he had then on her way from the Cape, a female Hottentot, of very singular appearance; that she would make the fortune of any person who shewed her in London, and that he (Dunlop) was under an engagement to send her back in two years..."&lt;ref&gt;"Law Report", ''The Times'' (London, England(, 26 November 1810: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon|Lord Caledon]], governor of the Cape, gave permission for the trip, but later said regretted it after he fully learned the purpose of the trip.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England), 29 November 1810, p. 3: "Law Report". Court of King's Bench. The Attorney-General commented: "As to Lord Caledon's permission, it would have been wrong in his lordship to have given it. But it should be known, that ... no contract among them [the Khoisan] was valid unless it was made before a Magistrate. This contract between the Hottentot and Cezar[sic] was made as usual; but when Lord Caledon discovered for what purpose, he was much displeased, and would have stopped the parties if they had then been in his power."&lt;/ref&gt;

===On show in Great Britain ===
[[File:Baartman.jpg|thumb|upright|A caricature of Baartman drawn in the early 19th century]]
[[Image:Hottentot Venus Poster.png|thumb|upright|Baartman's exhibition poster in London]]
Hendrik Cesars and Alexander Dunlop brought Baartman to London in 1810.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; The group lived together in Duke Street, St. James, the most expensive part of London. In the household were Sara Baartman, Hendrik Cesars, Alexander Dunlop, and two African boys, probably brought illegally by Dunlop from the slave lodge in Cape Town.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

Dunlop schemed to have Baartman exhibited and Cesars was the showman. Dunlop exhibited Baartman in the Egyptian Hall of [[Piccadilly Circus]] on 24 November 1810.&lt;ref name=leder /&gt; Dunlop thought he could make money because of Londoners' lack of familiarity with Africans and because of Baartman's large bottom. Crais and Scully say: "People came to see her because they saw her not as a person but as a pure example of this one part of the natural world".&lt;ref name=crais_scully/&gt; A handwritten note made on an exhibition flyer by someone who saw Baartman in London in January 1811 indicates curiosity about her origins and probably reproduced some of the language from the exhibition, thus the origin story should be treated with skepticism: "Sartjee is 22 Years old is 4 feet 10 Ins high, and has (for an Hottentot) a good capacity.  She lived in the occupation of a Cook at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Her Country is situated not less than 600 Miles from the Cape the Inhabitants of which are rich in Cattle and sell them by barter for a mere trifle, A Bottle of Brandy, or small roll of Tobacco will purchase several Sheep – Their principal trade is in Cattle Skins or Tallow. – Beyond this Nation is an other, of small stature, very subtle &amp; fierce; the Dutch could not bring them under subjection, and shot them whenever they found them.  9th Jany. 1811.  [H.C.?]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&amp;strucID=352644&amp;imageid=1107949&amp;total=1&amp;e=w|title=Sartjee, the Hottentot Venus|website=NYPL Digital Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of freak shows was longstanding in Britain at this time, and historians have argued that this is at first how Baartman was displayed.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; Baartman never allowed herself to be exhibited nude &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Strother, Z.S. (1999). "Display of the Body Hottentot", in Lindfors, B., (ed.), ''Africans on Stage: Studies in Ethnological Show Business''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press: 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and an account of her appearance in London in 1810 makes it clear that she was wearing a garment, albeit a tight-fitting one.&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;''The Times'', 26 November 1810, p. 3: "...she is dressed in a colour as nearly resembling her skin as possible. The dress is contrived to exhibit the entire frame of her body, and the spectators are even invited to examine the peculiarities of her form."&lt;/ref&gt;

Her exhibition in London just a few years after the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] created a scandal. This is in part because British audiences misread Hendrik Cesars, thinking he was a Dutch farmer, boer, from the frontier. Scholars have tended to reproduce that error, but tax rolls at the Cape show he was free black.&lt;ref name="erasure"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scully |first1=Pamela |first2=Clifton |last2=Crais |title=Race and Erasure: Sara Baartman and Hendrik Cesars in Cape Town and London |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=47 |issue=2 |date=2008 |pages=301–323 |doi=10.1086/526552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence was part of the show. An [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] benevolent society called the [[African Association]] conducted a newspaper campaign for her release. [[Zachary Macaulay]] led the protest. Hendrik Cesars protested that Baartman was entitled to earn her living, stating: "has she not as good a right to exhibit herself as an Irish Giant or a Dwarf?"&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt; Cesars was comparing Baartman to the contemporary Irish giants [[Charles Byrne (giant)|Charles Byrne]] and [[Patrick Cotter O'Brien]].&lt;ref name=leder&gt;Lederman, Muriel and Ingrid Bartsch (2001). ''The Gender and Science Reader''. New York: Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9obFtmhcCNsC&amp;pg=PA351 p. 351].&lt;/ref&gt; Macaulay and The African Association took the matter to court and on 24 November 1810 at the Court of King's Bench the Attorney-General began the attempt "to give her liberty to say whether she was exhibited by her own consent." In support he produced two affidavits in court. The first, from a [[William Bullock (collector)|Mr Bullock]] of Liverpool Museum, was intended to show that Baartman had been brought to Britain by persons who referred to her as if she were property.  The second, by the Secretary of the African Association, described the degrading conditions under which she was exhibited and also gave evidence of coercion.&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; Baartman was then questioned before an attorney in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], in which she was fluent, via interpreters. However the conditions of the interview were stacked against her, in part again because the court saw Hendrik Cesars as the boer exploiter, rather than seeing Alexander Dunlop as the organizer.  They thus ensured that Cesars was not in the room when Baartman made her statement, but Dunlop was allowed to remain.

Historians have stated that this therefore casts great doubt on the veracity and independence of the statement that Baartman then made.&lt;ref name=erasure/&gt; She stated that she in fact was not under restraint, did not get sexually abused, and that she came to London on her own free will.&lt;ref name=leder/&gt; She also did not wish to return to her family and understood perfectly that she was guaranteed half of the profits. The case was therefore dismissed.&lt;ref name=erasure/&gt;  She was questioned for three hours. The statements directly contradict accounts of her exhibitions made by [[Zachary Macaulay]] of the [[African Institution]] and other eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; A written contract was produced,&lt;ref&gt;"Dunlop produced a contract signed by himself and Sara dated 29 October 1810, which was to run from the preceding March for five years. This stated that she was his domestic servant and would allow herself to be exhibited in public in return for 12 guineas a year."{{Cite ODNB|id=73573|title=Baartman, Sarah|first=Karen|last=Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered by some modern commentators to be a legal [[Deception|subterfuge]].&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

The publicity given by the court case increased Baartman's popularity as an exhibit.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;  She later toured other parts of England and was exhibited at a fair in Limerick, Ireland in 1812. She also was exhibited at a fair at [[Bury St Edmunds]] in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;  On 1 December 1811 Baartman was baptized at [[Manchester Cathedral]] and there is evidence that she was married on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Thursday, 12 December 1811, p. 3: "The African ''fair'' one who has so greatly attracted the notice of the town... is stated to have been baptized on Sunday week last, in the Collegiate church at Manchester, by the name of Sarah Bartmann."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familysearch.org Sarah Bartmann] at England Births and Christenings 1538–1975, FamilySearch.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life in France ===
A man called Henry Taylor took Sara Baartman to France, from around September 1814. Taylor then sold her to an [[Animal training|animal trainer]], S. Réaux, who exhibited her under more pressured conditions for 15 months at the [[Palais Royal]]. In France she was in effect enslaved. In Paris, her exhibition became more clearly entangled with [[scientific racism]]. French scientists were curious about whether she had the [[elongated labia]] which earlier naturalists such as [[François Levaillant]] had purportedly observed in Khoisan at the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] recounted [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier's]] monograph on Baatman's genitalia, "The [[labia minora]], or inner lips, of the ordinary female genitalia are greatly enlarged in Khoi-San women, and may hang down three or four inches below the [[vulva]] when women stand, thus giving the impression of a separate and enveloping curtain of skin."Gould, Stephen Jay (1985). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626195901/http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu//courses/MatCult/content/Gould.pdf "The Hottentot Venus."] ''[[The Flamingo's Smile]]''. New York: W. W. Norton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=whOUFTkj4d4C&amp;pg=PA298 p. 298.]&lt;/ref&gt; French [[Natural history|naturalists]], among them [[Georges Cuvier]], head keeper of the [[menagerie]] at the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], and founder of the discipline of comparative anatomy visited her. She was the subject of several scientific paintings at the [[Jardin du Roi]], where she was examined in March 1815: as Saint-Hilaire&lt;ref&gt;Possibly [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frédéric Cuvier]], a younger brother of Georges, reported: "she was obliging enough to undress and to allow herself to be painted in the nude."  This was not literally true: although by his standards she appeared to be naked, in accordance with her own cultural norms of modesty&lt;ref&gt;"It is but justice to the modesty of the Hottentots to say that I have constantly found as many difficulties in the part of the women to submit to the exposure parts which a closer inspection required, as in all probability would have occurred in persuading an equal number of females of any other description to undergo examination." William Somerville, a British surgeon stationed at the Cape between 1799 and 1802, describing his difficulty in gathering information about Khoisan anatomy.&lt;/ref&gt; throughout these sessions she wore a small apron-like garment which concealed her genitalia.  She steadfastly refused to remove this even when offered money by one of the attending scientists.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;{{r|crais_scully|page1=131–134}} In Paris, Baartman's promoters didn't need to concern themselves with slavery charges. Crais and Scully state: "By the time she got to Paris, her existence was really quite miserable and extraordinarily poor. Sara was literally treated like an animal. There is some evidence to suggest that at one point a collar was placed around her neck."&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Baartman died on 29 December 1815 aged 26, of an undetermined&lt;ref name="jsa-154"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Science and the Arts|year=1818|volume=III|issue=V|page=154|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalsciencea02britgoog#page/n187/mode/1up/search/venus|accessdate=19 July 2010|title=Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences of the Royal Institute of France}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflammatory ailment, possibly [[smallpox]],&lt;ref&gt;''In The Blood'' by Steve Jones has it that "Saartje's hands are covered by the marks of the smallpox that killed her" (p. 204).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hottentot Venus, it appears from the French papers, died at Paris last week, after an illness of eight days.  Her malady is said to have been the small pox, which the physicians mistook successively for a catarrh, a pleurisy, and a dropsy of the chest." ''The Times'' (London, England), 6 January 1816: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources suggest she contracted [[syphilis]],&lt;ref name=atrest/&gt; or [[pneumonia]]. Cuvier conducted a dissection, but did not do an autopsy to inquire into the reasons for Baartman's death.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

French anatomist [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] published notes on the dissection in 1816, which were republished by [[Georges Cuvier]] in the ''Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle'' in 1817. Cuvier, who had met Baartman, notes in his [[monograph]] that its subject was an intelligent woman with an excellent memory, particularly for faces. In addition to her native tongue, she spoke fluent Dutch, passable English, and a smattering of French.  He describes her shoulders and back as "graceful", arms "slender", hands and feet as "charming" and "pretty". He adds she was adept at playing the [[jew's harp]],&lt;ref&gt;Cuvier refers to her instrument as a "guimbarde", usually translated into English as "jew's harp": a contemporary illustration however shows Baartman with a Khoi instrument, the [[goura (instrument)|goura]].&lt;/ref&gt; could dance according to the traditions of her country, and had a lively personality.&lt;ref&gt;"Son caractère étoit gai, sa mémoire bonne, et elle reconnoissoit après plusieurs semaines une personne qu'elle n'avoit vue qu'une fois.  Elle parloit tolérablement le hollandais qu'elle avoit appris au Cap, savoit aussi un peu d'anglais, et commencoit à dire quelques mots de francais.  Elle dansoit à la manière de son pays, et jouoit avec assez d'oreille de ce petit instrument qu'on appelle guimbarde....ses épaules, son dos, le haut de sa poitrine avoient de la grace...Ses bras un peu grèles, étoient très-bien faits, et sa main charmante. Son pied étoit aussi fort joli..."("Her personality was lively, her memory good and, after a gap of some weeks, she recognised someone she had seen only the once.  She spoke reasonable Dutch, which she had learned in The Cape, knew some English, and was beginning to say a few words in French.  She danced according to the fashion of her own country, and played on the instrument they call the 'jew's harp' quite by ear....her shoulders, back, and upper chest were graceful...Her arms (rather slender) were very well-made, and her hand charming.  Her foot was also very pretty....") Cuvier, G.:"Extrait d'observations faites sur le cadavre d'une femme connue à Paris et à Londres sous le nomme de Vénus Hottentotte", ''Mémoires du Musée Nationale d'Histoire Naturelle,'' iii (1817), pp. 259–274.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, Cuvier interpreted her remains, in accordance with his theories on racial evolution, as evidencing ape-like traits.  He thought her small ears were similar to those of an [[orangutan]] and also compared her vivacity, when alive, to the quickness of a [[monkey]].&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

[[File:South Africa-Hankey-Sarah Baartmans grave.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sarah Baartman's grave, on a hill overlooking [[Hankey]] in the [[Gamtoos River]] Valley, Eastern Cape, South Africa]]

From the 1940s, there were sporadic calls for the return of her remains. A poem written in 1978 by [[Diana Ferrus]], herself of Khoisan descent, entitled "I've come to take you home", played a pivotal role in spurring the movement to bring Baartman's remains back to her birth soil.&lt;ref name=atrest/&gt; The case gained world-wide prominence only after [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote ''The Mismeasure of Man'' in the 1980s. Mansell Upham, a researcher and jurist specializing in South African colonial history also helped spur the movement to bring Baartman's remains back to South Africa.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; After the victory of the [[African National Congress]] in the [[South African general election, 1994]], President [[Nelson Mandela]] formally requested that France return the remains.  After much legal wrangling and debates in the [[French National Assembly]], France acceded to the request on 6 March 2002. Her remains were repatriated to her homeland, the Gamtoos Valley, on 6 May 2002,&lt;ref name=bbcnews2002&gt;{{cite news |title='Hottentot Venus' goes home|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/1957240.stm |work=BBC News|date=29 April 2002|accessdate=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were buried on 9 August 2002 on ''Vergaderingskop'', a hill in the town of [[Hankey]] over 200 years after her birth.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the politics of her return, see chapter 7 Crais and Scully, ''Sara Baartman and the Hottentot Venus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Baartman became an icon in South Africa as representative of many aspects of the [[history of South Africa|nation's history]]. The Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saartjiebaartmancentre.org.za|title=Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; a refuge for survivors of [[domestic violence]], opened in Cape Town in 1999. South Africa's first offshore environmental protection vessel, the ''[[Sarah Baartman (ship)|Sarah Baartman]]'', is also named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_1645283,00.html  |title=SA takes on poachers |date= 11 November 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211009/http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_1645283,00.html |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolism ===
Sarah Baartman was not the only Khoikhoi to be taken from her homeland. Her story is always used as a symbol to illustrate various social and political strains, and through these applications, her true story has been lost among the discussions. Dr. Yvette Abraham, professor of women and gender studies at the [[University of the Western Cape]] says, "we lack academic studies that view Sarah Baartman as anything other than a symbol. Her story becomes marginalized, as it is always used to illustrate some other topic…." For some reason, Baartman is always employed to represent African discrimination and suffering in the West, even though there were many other Khoekhoe people who were taken to Europe. For example, historian Neil Parsons writes about two Khoekhoe children of 13 and six who were taken from South Africa and displayed at a holiday fair in Elberfeld, Germany, 1845. Secondly, a traveling show called the Bosjemans traveled around Britain, Ireland, and France, consisting of two men, women, and one baby. The circus was in business from 1846 to 1855. Thirdly, P. T. Barnum's show, called "Little People", advertised a 16-year-old girl by the name of Flora as the "missing link" and acquired six more Khoekhoe children after her. These are just some of the cases of Khoekhoe Africans who were enslaved and put on display in the West. There may be some reason Baartman's tale is so famous. She was the first Khoekhoe to be taken from her homeland. However, instead of being the first, it is most likely that her fame is due to the extensive exploitation of her body by the general public and scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]], as well as the horrible mistreatment she received during her life and after her death. She was brought to the West solely on the premise of her exaggerated female form, and the European public found a sickening obsession with her reproductive organs. Her body parts were on display at the [[Musée de l'Homme]] for 150 years, and her story as a symbol may be due to the awareness and sympathy it has evoked in the public eye. Even though Baartman was the first Khoekhoe to land in Europe, much of her story has been lost, and she is instead defined by her tragic utilization and exploitation in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representation and Black Womanhood: The Legacy of Sarah Baartman|last=Gordon-Chipembere|first=Natasha|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-1-349-29798-6|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her body as a foundation for scientific racism==
[[File:A Pair of Broad Bottoms.jpg|thumb|upright|1810 caricature of Baartman by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]]]] [[Julien-Joseph Virey]] used Sarah Baartman's published image to validate racial typologies. In his essay "Dictionnaire des sciences medicales" (Dictionary of medical sciences), he summarizes the true nature of the black female within the framework of accepted medical discourse. Virey focused on identifying her sexual organs as more developed and distinct in comparison to white female organs. All of his theories regarding sexual primitivism are influenced and supported by the anatomical studies and illustrations of Sarah Baartman which were created by [[Georges Cuvier]].&lt;ref name=gilman/&gt; In cartoons and drawings Baartman's features were often exaggerated to highlight her difference from European females. This social construction of visual imagery likely amplified and reinforced racist perspectives. Little of this knowledge can be considered completely factual as most knowledge of Baartman is not extrapolated from diverse sources of documentation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Sexism===
During 1814–70, there were at least seven scientific descriptions of the bodies of women of color done in comparative anatomy. Cuvier's dissection of Baartman helped shape European science. Baartman, along with several other African women who were dissected, were referred to as Hottentots, or sometimes Bushwomen. The "savage woman" was seen as very distinct from the "civilised female" of Europe, thus 19th-century scientists were fascinated by "the Hottentot Venus". In the 1800s, people in London were able to pay two shillings apiece to gaze upon her body in wonder. Baartman was considered a freak of nature. For extra pay, one could even poke her with a stick or finger. Sara Baartman's organs, genitalia, and buttocks were thought to be evidence of her sexual primitivism and intellectual equality with that of an orangutan.

===Colonialism===
There has been much speculation and study about [[South Africa#European colonisation|colonialist influence]] that relates to Baartman's name, social status, her illustrated and performed presentation as the "Hottentot Venus", and the negotiation for her body's return to her homeland.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; These components and events in Baartman's life have been used by activists and theorists to determine the ways in which 19th-century European colonists exercised control and authority over Khoekhoe people and simultaneously crafted racist and sexist ideologies about their culture.&lt;ref name=erasure/&gt; In addition to this, recent scholars have begun to analyze the surrounding events leading up to Baartman's return to her homeland and conclude that it is an expression of recent contemporary post colonial objectives.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

In Janet Shibamoto's book review of Deborah Cameron's book ''Feminism and Linguistic Theory'', Shibamoto discusses Cameron's study on the patriarchal context within language, which consequentially influences the way in which women continue to be contained by or subject to ideologies created by the patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Shibamoto, S Janet. Feminism and Linguistic Theory by Deborah Cameron (Book Review), ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' (1988): 635–640.Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have presented information on how Baartman's life was heavily controlled and manipulated by colonialist and patriarchal language.{{r|crais_scully|page1=131–134}}

Baartman grew up on a farm. There is no historical documentation of her indigenous Khoisan name.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Chipembere, Natasha ( 2011). ''Representation and Black Womanhood''. Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the Dutch name "Saartjie" by Dutch colonists who occupied the land she lived on during her childhood. According to Clifton Crais and Pamela Scully:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her first name is the Cape Dutch form for "Sarah" which marked her as a colonialist's servant. "Saartje" the diminutive, was also a sign of affection. Encoded in her first name were the tensions of affection and exploitation. Her surname literally means "bearded man" in Dutch. It also means uncivilized, uncouth, barbarous, savage. Saartjie Baartman – the savage servant.{{r|crais_scully|page1=9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dutch colonizers also bestowed the term "Hottentot", which is derived from "hot" and "tot", Dutch approximations of common sounds in the Khoi language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/hottentot |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch used this word when referencing Khoikhoi people because of the clicking sounds and staccato pronunciations that characterize the Khoikhoi language; these components of the [[Khoekhoe language|Khoikhoi language]] were considered strange and "bestial" to Dutch colonizers.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; The term was used until the 20th century, at which point most people understood its effect as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;Mary McMahon, [http://originalpeople.org/saartjie-sarah-baartman-hottentot-venus/ "Who are the Hottentots"], ''Wise Geek'', 9 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelogues that circulated in Europe would describe Africa as being "uncivilized" and lacking regard for religious virtue.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; Travelogues and imagery depicting Black women as "sexually primitive" and "savage" enforced the belief that it was in Africa's best interest to be colonized by European settlers. Cultural and religious conversion was considered to be an altruistic act with imperialist undertones; colonizers believed that they were reforming and correcting Khoisan culture in the name of the Christian faith and empire.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

During the lengthy negotiation to have Baartman's body returned to her home country after her death, the assistant curator of the Musée de l'Homme, [[Philippe Mennecier]], argued against her return, stating: "We never know what science will be able to tell us in the future. If she is buried, this chance will be lost ... for us she remains a very important treasure." According to Sadiah Qureshi, due to the continued treatment of Baartman's body as a cultural artifact, Philippe Mennecier's statement is contemporary evidence of the same type of ideology that surrounded Baartman's body while she was alive in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

==Feminist reception==

===Traditional iconography of Sarah Baartman and feminist contemporary art===
Many African female diasporic artists have criticized the traditional iconography of Baartman. According to the studies of contemporary feminists, traditional iconography and historical illustrations of Baartman are effective in revealing the ideological representation of black women in art throughout history. Such studies assess how the traditional iconography of the black female body was institutionally and scientifically defined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=gilman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilman |first=Sander L. |title=Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an iconography of Female Sexuality in Late Nineteenth Century Art, Medicine, and Literature |journal=Critical Inquiry |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |date=1985 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=204–242 |jstor=1343468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renee Cox]], Renee Green, Joyce Scott, Lorna Simpson, Cara Mae Weems and Deborah Willis are artists who seek to investigate contemporary social and cultural issues that still surround the African female body. [[Sander Gilman]], a cultural and literary historian states: "While many groups of African Blacks were known to Europeans in the 19th century, the Hottentot remained representative of the essence of the Black, especially the Black female. Both concepts fulfilled the iconographic function in the perception and representation of the world."&lt;ref name=gilman/&gt;
His article "Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an Iconography of Female Sexuality in the Late Nineteenth Century Art, Medicine and Literature" traces art historical records of black women in European art, and also proves that the association of black women with concupiscence within art history has been illustrated consistently since the beginning of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=gilman/&gt;

[[Lyle Ashton Harris]] and Renee Valerie Cox worked in collaboration to produce the photographic piece Hottentot Venus 2000.  In this piece, Harris photographs Victoria Cox who presents herself as Baartman while wearing large, sculptural, gold, metal breasts and buttocks attached to her body.&lt;ref name=willis&gt;Willis, Deborah. "Black Venus 2010: They called her 'Hottentot.'" Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2010. Project Muse&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deborah Willis, the paraphernalia attached to Cox's body are markers for the way in which Baartman's sexual body parts were essential for her constructed role or function as the "Hottentot Venus". Willis also explains that Cox's side-angle shot makes reference to the "scientific" traditional propaganda used by Cuvier and Julian-Joseph Virey, who sourced Baartman's traditional illustrations and iconography to publish their "scientific" findings.&lt;ref name=willis /&gt;

Reviewers of Harris and Cox's work have commented that the presence of "the gaze" in the photograph of Cox presents a critical engagement with previous traditional imagery of Baartman.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; [[bell hooks]] has elaborated further on the function of the gaze:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gaze has been and is a site of resistance for colonized black people globally. Subordinates in relations of power learn experientially that there is a critical gaze, one that "looks" to document, one that is oppositional. In resistance struggle, the power of the dominated to assert agency by claiming and cultivating "awareness" politicizes "looking" relations – one learns to look a certain way in order to resist.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (1992) Black Looks : Race and Representation. South End Press.  pp. 115 – 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Permitted" is an installation piece created by Renee Samwise Green inspired by Sarah Baartman. Green created a specific viewing arrangement to investigate the European perception of the black female body as "exotic", "bizarre" and "monstrous". Viewers were prompted to step onto the installed platform which was meant to evoke a stage, where Baartman may have been exhibited. Green recreates the basic setting of Baartman's exhibition. At the centre of the platform, which there is a large image of Baartman, and wooden rulers or slats with an engraved caption by Francis Galton encouraging viewers to measure Baartman's buttocks. In the installation there is also a peephole that allows viewers to see an image of Baartman standing on a crate. According to Willis, the implication of the peephole,  demonstrates how ethnographic imagery of the black female form in the 19th century functioned as a form of pornography for Europeans present at Baartmans exhibit.&lt;ref name=willis/&gt;

In her film ''Reassemblage: From the firelight to the screen'', [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]] comments on the ethnocentric bias that the colonizers eye applies to the naked female form, arguing that this bias causes the nude female body to be seen as inherently sexually provocative, promiscuous and pornographic within the context of European or western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Min-ha, Trin – T, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc5G2-rTKis "Reassemblage: From the firelight to the screen."], ''Youtube'', 23 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Feminist artists are interested in re-representing Baartman's image, and work to highlight the stereotypes and ethnocentric bias surrounding the black female body based on art historical representations and iconography that occurred before, after and during Baartman's lifetime.&lt;ref name=willis/&gt;

===Media representation and feminist criticism===
In November 2014, ''[[Paper Magazine]]'' released a cover of [[Kim Kardashian]] in which she was illustrated as balancing a champagne glass on her extended rear. The cover received much criticism for endorsing "the exploitation and fetishism of the black female body".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jolie, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/13/kim-kardashian-photo-black-female-bodies-grio/18962603/ "Kardashian photo plays off controversial black imagery"] ''USA today'', 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities with the way in which Baartman was represented as the "Hottentot Venus" during the 19th century have prompted much criticism and commentary.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Thomas, Geneva, [http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2010/10/kim-kardashian-posing-black-femaleness/ "Kim Kardashian: Posing Black Femaleness?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125606/http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2010/10/kim-kardashian-posing-black-femaleness/# |date=4 March 2016 }} ''Clutch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer Geneva S. Thomas, anyone that is aware of black women's history under colonialist influence would consequentially be aware that Kardashian's photo easily elicits memory regarding the visual representation of Baartman.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;
The photographer and director of the photo, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], based the photo on his previous work "Carolina Beaumont", taken of a nude model in 1976 and published in his book ''Jungle Fever''.&lt;ref name=Miller2014&gt;Miller, Kelsey, [http://www.refinery29.com/2014/11/77809/kim-kardashian-carolina-beaumont-john-paul-goude "The Troubling Racial History of Kim K's Champagne Shot"], ''Refinery 29'', 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''People Magazine'' article in 1979 about his relationship with model [[Grace Jones]] describes Goude in the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean-Paul has been fascinated with women like Grace since his youth. The son of a French engineer and an American-born dancer, he grew up in a Paris suburb. From the moment he saw West Side Story and the Alvin Ailey dance troupe, he found himself captivated by "ethnic minorities" — black girls, PRs. "I had jungle fever." He now says, "Blacks are the premise of my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073475,00.html|title=When Disco Queen Grace Jones Lamented 'I Need a Man,' Artist Jean-Paul Goude Prowled Too Near Her Cage|date=|work=people.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Days before the shoot, Goude often worked with his models to find the best "hyperbolized" position to take his photos. His model and partner, Grace Jones, would also pose for days prior to finally acquiring the perfect form. "That's the basis of my entire work," Goude states, "creating a credible illusion."&lt;ref name=Miller2014/&gt; Similarly, Baartman and other black female slaves were illustrated and depicted in a specific form to identify features, which were seen as proof of ideologies regarding black female primitivism.&lt;ref name=gilman /&gt;

The professional background of Goude and the specific posture and presentation of Kardashian's image in the recreation on the cover of ''[[Paper Magazine]]'' has caused feminist critics to comment how the objectification of the Baartman's body and the ethnographic representation of her image in 19th-century society presents a comparable and complementary parallel to how Kardashian is currently represented in the media.&lt;ref name=telusma&gt;Telusma, Blue, [http://thegrio.com/2014/11/12/kim-kardashian-butt/ "Kim Kardashian doesn't realize she's the butt of an old racial joke"], ''The Grio'', 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the November 2014 photograph of Kim Kardashian, Cleuci de Oliveira published an article on [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] titled "Saartjie Baartman: The Original Bootie Queen", which claims that Sarah Baartman was "always an agent in her own path."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/saartje-baartman-the-original-booty-queen-1658569879|title=Saartjie Baartman: The Original Booty Queen|last=Oliveira|first=Cleuci de|work=Jezebel|access-date=28 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliveira goes on to assert that Baartman performed on her own terms and was unwilling to view herself as a tool for scientific advancement, an object of entertainment, or a pawn of the state.

Neelika Jayawardane, a literature professor and editor of the website Africa is a Country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africasacountry.com/author/neelika71/|title=Neelika Jayawardane|website=Africa is a Country|language=en-US|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a response to Oliveira's article. Jayawardane criticizes de Oliveira's work, stating that she "did untold damage to what the historical record shows about Baartman."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://africasacountry.com/2014/11/when-jezebel-wanted-to-make-saartjie-baartman-relevant-to-millenials-epicfail-2/|title=#EpicFail When @Jezebel Wanted to make Saartjie Baartman Relevant to Millenials|date=18 November 2014|work=Africa is a Country|access-date=28 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayawardane's article is cautious about introducing what she considers false agency to historical figures such as Baartman.

Frieze.com published an article entitled "‘Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists’, curated by Cameroonian-born Koyo Kouoh", which mentions Baartman's legacy and its impact on young female African artists. The work linked to Baartman is meant to reference the ethnographic exhibits of the 19th century that enslaved Baartman and displayed her naked body. Artist Oka's (''Untitled'', 2015) rendered a live performance of a black naked woman in a cage with the door swung open, walking around a sculpture of male genitalia, repeatedly. Her work was so impactful it led one audience member to proclaim,  "Do we allow this to happen because we are in the white cube, or are we revolted by it?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/body-talk|title=Body Talk|website=frieze.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oka's work has been described as 'black feminist art' where the female body is a site for activism and expression. The article also mentions other African female icons and how artists are expressing themselves through performance and discussion by posing the question "How Does the White Man Represent the Black Woman?".

James McKay and Helen Johnson, social scientists from England and Australia, respectively, invoke Baartman to fit newspaper coverage of the tennis-playing [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] within racist trans-historical narratives of "pornographic eroticism" and "sexual grotesquerie." According to McKay and Johnson, white male reporters covering the Williams sisters have fixated upon their on-court fashions and their muscular bodies, while downplaying their on-court achievements, describing their bodies as mannish, animalistic, or hyper-sexual, rather than well-developed. Their victories have been attributed to their supposed natural physical superiorities, while their defeats have been blamed on their supposed lack of discipline. This analysis demonstrates that commentary on the size of Serena's breasts and bottom, in particular, mirrors the spectacle made of Baartman's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=James|last2=Johnson|first2=Helen|date=July 2008|title=Pornographic eroticism and sexual grotesquerie in representations of African American sportswomen|url=|journal=Social Identitities|volume=14|issue=4|pages=491-504|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display of remains==

After Baartman's death, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire applied on behalf of the [[Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle|Muséum d' Histoire Naturelle]] to retain her corpse on the grounds that it was of singular specimen of humanity and therefore of special scientific interest.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; The application was approved and Baartman's skeleton and body cast were displayed in [[Muséum d'histoire naturelle d’Angers]]. Her skull was stolen in 1827 but returned a few months later. The restored skeleton and skull continued to arouse the interest of visitors until the remains were moved to the Musée de l'Homme, when it was founded in 1937, and continued up until the late 1970s. Her body cast and skeleton stood side by side and faced away from the viewer which emphasized her [[steatopygia]] (accumulation of fat on the buttocks) while reinforcing that aspect as the primary interest of her body. The Baartman exhibit proved popular until it elicited complaints  for being a degrading representation of women. The skeleton was removed in 1974, and the body cast in 1976.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

'''Sauropod neck posture''' is a subject occasionally debated among scientists, with some favoring postures closer to horizontal whilst others a more upright posture. Research has looked at various avenues of evidence and analysis including: attempting to reconstruct the neutral posture of their necks and estimating range of motion by studying the bones; attempting to reconstruct sauropod metabolism and the energy requirements of sustaining incredibly long necks in various postures; and comparing sauropod neck anatomy to those of living animals.&lt;ref name="pose2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = M.

The biomechanics of sauropod skeletons and necks can help determine at what angle the neck was positioned.&lt;ref name="uprightsauropods"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Christian | first1 = A. | authorlink1 = Andreas Christian | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = Some sauropods raised their necks–evidence for high browsing in ''Euhelopus zdanskyi'' | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–825 | publisher = Royal Society | jstor =  | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0359 | pmc = 3001369 | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/05/29/rsbl.2010.0359.full | format =  | accessdate = | pmid=20519198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexibility ===
In 2013, a study led by Matthew J. Cobley and published in [[PLOS ONE]] focused on the flexibility of the necks of sauropods. They compared the necks of [[ostrich]]es with sauropod genera to find out how flexible the necks really were. The study noted that previous biomechanics studies found the necks to have been positioned between the extremes of a vertical, and a downward slanted neck. In conclusion, the study found that sauropod neck flexibility should not be based on osteology alone, and if it is, the results should be used with caution. Even though there is a lack of preserved muscle tissue that would determine flexibility, sauropod necks were probably less flexible than previously thought.&lt;ref name="plosbio"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0072187| title = Inter-Vertebral Flexibility of the Ostrich Neck: Implications for Estimating Sauropod Neck Flexibility| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 8| issue = 8| pages = e72187| year = 2013| last1 = Cobley | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Rayfield | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Barrett | first3 = P. M. | pmid=23967284 | pmc=3743800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Mike P. Taylor]] analysed the flexibility in the necks of ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus]]''. He found that Cobley ''et al.'' was incorrect in the fact that vertebrae imply the neck is less flexible than in actuality. Cobley ''et al.'' found necks to be much less flexible than in reality when cartilage was added. It was found that the cartilage between the joints would have allowed for the neck to flex far past 90°. However, Taylor noted that while the neck could flex above the vertical, the osteological neutral pose would have been around horizontal, with the habitual pose having the head held upwards in an alert pose.&lt;ref name="taylor14"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=M.P.|year=2014|title=Quantifying the effect of intervertebral cartilage on the neutral posture in the necks of sauropod dinosaurs|url=https://peerj.com/articles/712/|journal=PeerJ|volume=2|pages=e712|doi=10.7717/peerj.712|pmid=25551027|pmc=4277489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscling ===

Sauropod necks were probably highly muscled to suit their feeding level. ''[[Brachiosaurus brancai]]'' (now ''[[Giraffititan]]'') was probably a high browser, so it would have been more muscled along the neck than other sauropods like ''Diplodocus'' and ''Dicraeosaurus'' who were low browsers. The tail and limb length of ''B. brancai'' would also need to be greater, to balance out the inclined neck.&lt;ref name="neckmuscles"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Christian | first1 = Andreas | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 2008 | title = Neck posture and overall body design in sauropods | journal = Fossil Record | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 271–281 | publisher = Wiley | jstor =  | doi = 10.1002/mmng.20020050116 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mmng.20020050116/abstract | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the question of whether sauropods were [[endothermic]] or [[ectothermic]] plays a major part in how sauropods were muscled, as endotherms have particularly more intestines and stomach than ectotherms. The amount of gut needed could determine how much food was eaten by sauropods, and therefore at what elevation their heads were held.&lt;ref name="guts"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Franz | first1 = R. | last2 = Hummel | first2 = J. | last3 = Keinzle | first3 = E. | last4 = Kölle | first4 = P. | last5 = Gunga | first5 = H-C. | last6 = Clauss | first6 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Allometry of visceral organs in living amniotes and its implications for sauropod dinosaurs | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 276 | issue = 1662 | pages = 1731–1736 | publisher = Royal Society | jstor =  | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2008.1735 | pmc = 2660986 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/02/21/rspb.2008.1735.full | format =  | accessdate = | pmid=19324837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heart and metabolic stress ===

The previous upright posture of sauropod necks would require great blood pressure and a strong heart. One 2000 study conducted by Roger Seymour and Harvey Lillywhite found that the blood pressure needed to reach the head with an upright neck would be {{convert|700|mmHg|inHg}}. This could be fatal to an endotherm, and also highly dangerous to an ectotherm. If sauropods were endothermic metabolically, it would certainly be impossible for them to survive with upright necks, as the blood pressure would be too high to live even with thicker heart muscling.&lt;ref name="seymour"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1225| title = Hearts, neck posture and metabolic intensity of sauropod dinosaurs| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 267| issue = 1455| pages = 1883–7| year = 2000| last1 = Seymour | first1 = R. S.| last2 = Lillywhite | first2 = H. B. | pmid=11052540 | pmc=1690760}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study by Seymour concluded that it would have required half the energy of any particular sauropod to pump the blood to the head. This would lower the probability of sauropods being high browsers, and instead having lower necks while feeding than commonly portrayed.&lt;ref name="seymour2"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2009.0096| pmid = 19364714| title = Raising the sauropod neck: It costs more to get less| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 5| issue = 3| pages = 317–9| year = 2009| last1 = Seymour | first1 = R.

== Hypotheses ==
[[File:Opisthocoelicaudia posture.svg|thumb|Restored posture of ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' from the original description (A),&lt;ref name="borsuk-bialynicka_1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borsuk-Białynicka|first=M.M.|year=1977|title=A new camarasaurid sauropod Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii gen. n., sp. n. from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|journal=Palaeontologia Polonica|series=37|pages=5–64|url=http://www.palaeontologia.pan.pl/Archive/1977-37_5-64_1-14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Schwartz ''et al.'' (B)&lt;ref name="schwartz"/&gt;]]
A few hypotheses have been generated to solve the dispute over how sauropods held their necks.&lt;ref name="pose2009"/&gt;

=== Horizontal pose ===
Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish are the two main supporters of a horizontal neck posture. In 1999, they studied the genera ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus]]'', finding the habitual pose of the genera to be slightly declined. They claimed that both sauropods had necks much less flexible than previously thought, with the neck vertebrae of ''Diplodocus'' being more inflexible than ''Apatosaurus''. Those two poses would suggest that the sauropods were ground feeders, instead of browsing off taller flora.&lt;ref name="parrish1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.284.5415.798| title = Neck Posture and Feeding Habits of Two Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs| journal = Science| volume = 284| issue = 5415| pages = 798–800| year = 1999| last1 = Stevens | first1 = K. A. | pmid=10221910}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, in 2005, Stevens and Parrish again studied the biomechanics of sauropod necks, but this time on a wider variety of sauropods, those inhabiting the Jurassic. Specifically, ''Apatosaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Dicraeosaurus]]'', ''[[Cetiosaurus]]'', and ''[[Euhelopus]]'' were studied, and each and every one was stated to have a horizontally held neck by Stevens and Parrish. The pair even went as far a saying that all but a few had necks that curved downward towards the head.&lt;ref name="parrish2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=K.A.|authorlink=Kent Stevens|last2=Parrish|first2=M.J.|authorlink2=Michael Parrish|year=2005|chapter=Neck Posture, Dentition, and Feeding Strategies in Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMnKDusJuYUC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Sauropod+neck+posture+Parrish+2005#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor-last=Tidwell|editor-first=Virginia|editor-link=Virginia Tidwell|editor2-last=Carpenter|editor2-first=Kenneth|editor2-link=Kenneth Carpenter|title=Thunder-lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=212–232|isbn=0-253-34542-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009 multiple things were found to be incorrect with this hypothesis. Michael P. Taylor ''et al.'' compared the neck posture of sauropods to that of extant [[reptiles]], finding the habitual pose of different sauropods to be quite different from the hypothesis of Stevens and Parrish, including an upright neck for ''Diplodocus''. The inaccuracies of Stevens and Parrish come mostly from their thought about the habitual pose, which was, according to them, the Osteological Neutral Pose (or ONP) of every sauropod. Taylor ''et al.'' find the ONP not to be the habitual pose, far from it, but just the midpoint between the two structural extremes of the neck orientation.&lt;ref name="pose2009"/&gt;

=== Incline pose ===
Another, more widely supported hypothesis about sauropod neck posture is that the necks were held at an incline, but not as upright as commonly shown.&lt;ref name="pose2009"/&gt; Daniela Schwartz ''et al.'' in 2006 published a study of the scapula and coracoids, sometimes fused into scapulocoracoids, of sauropod genera. Previously, sauropod shoulder girdles were thought to have been positioned horizontally along the torso, but Schwartz ''et al.'' found that the girdles should not have been positioned horizontally, and instead, they would have been angled at an average of 55° to 65°. The study reconstructed the skeletons of ''Diplodocus'', ''Camarasaurus'', and the titanosaur ''[[Opisthocoelicaudia]]'', all known from a complete shoulder girdle, with the correct orientation of the scapulocoracoids. For ''Diplodocus'', a 60° shoulder blade would have meant that the neck was more-or-less horizontal,&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ar.20405| title = Novel reconstruction of the orientation of the pectoral girdle in sauropods| journal = The Anatomical Record| volume = 290| pages = 32–47| year = 2007| last1 = Schwarz| first1 = Daniela| last2 = Frey| first2 = Eberhard| last3 = Meyer| first3 = Christian A.| pmid=17441196}}&lt;/ref&gt; not too much different from the horizontal pose.&lt;ref name="parrish1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="parrish2005"/&gt; A juvenile ''Camarasaurus'' found by Gilmore was originally described as having the scapulocoracoid in "just the right place", but with it oriented at an angle of 45°, Schwartz ''et al.'' criticized the stance. The skeleton found by Schwartz ''et al.'' with the angle of the scapulocoracoid is similar to previous reconstruction of the genus by Osborn and Mook, and Jensen. ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' was found to have had two possibly poses, both with the scapulocoracoid angled at about 60°. No previous reconstructions, unlike with ''Camarasaurus'', have restored ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' similarly.&lt;ref name="schwartz"/&gt;

=== Upright pose for some sauropods ===
''Euhelopus'' and ''Brachiosaurus'' have been found to be among only a few sauropods to hold their necks at a vertical angle, which would have been impossible for other sauropods. Many studies have stated that the blood pressure and energy spent would have been too great to survive, but for ''Euhelopus'' and ''Brachiosaurus'' it would have suited them better. The energy spent by pumping blood to the head would probably be too great for sauropods, but when they travel often, which has been suggested for those two genera, it would have actually saved energy. The biomechanical evidence favours an upright neck when travelling to spread apart resources. The study finding this conclusion also tested how much energy would have been expended when walking {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} and standing, both with an upright neck. The approximate conclusion was that an about equal amount of energy would have been used up. Elongated cervical ribs are skeletal evidence for a strong core to support the neck and limit its movement when walking. The study supports the idea that during times of drought and famine, an upright neck was crucial for these sauropods to survive.&lt;ref name="uprightsauropods"/&gt;

In [[computer science]], the '''sign bit''' is a [[bit]] in a [[signed number representation]] that indicates the [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] of a number.  Although only [[signedness|signed]] numeric data types have a sign bit, it is invariably located in the [[most significant bit]] position, so the term may be used interchangeably with "most significant bit" in some contexts.

Almost always, if the sign bit is 0, the number is non-negative (positive or zero).  If the sign bit is 1 then the number is negative, although formats other than [[two's complement]] integers allow a [[signed zero]]: distinct "positive zero" and "negative zero" representations, the latter of which does not correspond to the mathematical concept of a [[negative number]].

In the two's complement representation, the sign bit has the [[positional notation|weight]] {{math|−2&lt;sup&gt;''w''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{mvar|w}} is the number of bits.  In the ones' complement representation, the most negative value is {{math|1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''w''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but there are [[signed zero|two representations of zero]], one for each value of the sign bit.  In a [[sign-and-magnitude]] representation of numbers, the value of the sign bit determines whether the numerical value is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{Rp|52–54}}

[[Floating point]] numbers, such as [[IEEE floating point|IEEE format]], [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|IBM format]], [[VAX]] format, and even the format used by the Zuse [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]] and [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] use a sign-and-magnitude representation.

When using a complement representation, to convert a signed number to a wider format the additional bits must be filled with copies of the sign bit in order to preserve its numerical value,&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}} a process called ''[[sign extension]]'' or ''sign propagation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adrc.com/glossary/s1.html |title=Data Dictionary (Glossary and Algorithms) |website=Adroit Data Recovery Centre Pte Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">The '''Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality''' ('''SSSS''', or "'''quad-S'''"), formed in 1957, is a non-profit, international professional membership organization, based in the United States, that says it is "the oldest professional society dedicated to the advancement of knowledge about sexuality."  It reports to have more than 1,000 members and has a quarterly newsletter, ''Sexual Science''.  It produces two other publications:
* ''[[Annual Review of Sex Research]]'',  "''An Integrative and Interdisciplinary Review''"
* ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'', a scholarly journal published quarterly

==History==
According to its website, SSSS was established in 1957 by psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] to encourage the rigorous, systematic study of sexuality.

In 1980, organizer [[Robert Francoeur]] invited Philadelphia biologist [[Timothy Perper]] to join the society. Perper had recently finished charting the mating behavior of five-hundred couples in bars in the U.S. and Canada. That year he presented the early results of his findings to the society. His book, detailing findings, is called ''Sex  Signals – the Biology of Love'' and was published in 1985.

Today, SSSS includes members of the following disciplines:  anthropologists, biologists, educators, historians, nurses, physicians, psychologists, sociologists, theologians, therapists, and many other disciplines.

SSSS boasts a strong commitment to its student members, with a "vigorous" student membership program and student awards, in addition to the other awards for professional members.

'''Thanatophages''', are [[olophage|olophages]] that obtain [[nutrient]]s by consuming decomposing dead plant biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Getz, W. (2011). Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer–resource modelling. Ecology Letters, {{doi|10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 



==Ecology==
In [[food webs]], thanatophages generally play the roles of [[decomposers]]. 

The eating of wood, whether live or dead, is known as [[xylophagy]]. Τhe activity of animals feeding only on dead wood is called sapro-xylophagy and those animals, sapro-xylophagous.

==Saprophytes==
''Saprophyte'' (''-phyte'' meaning "plant") is a botanical term that is no longer in popular use. &lt;ref&gt;biology online&lt;/ref&gt;There are no real saprotrophic organisms that are [[embryophytes]],{{fact|date=December 2010}} and fungi and bacteria are no longer placed in the [[Plant|plant kingdom]]. Plants that were once considered saprophytes, such as non-photosynthetic [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]s and [[Monotropaceae|monotrope]]s, are now known to be [[parasite]]s on fungi. These species are now termed [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotroph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey DR. 1999. Myco-heterophytes and parasitic plants in food chains an webs. ''American Biology Teacher'' 61:575-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leake JR. 2005.

==Appearance==
Tillie the All-Time Teller machines were red and gold to make them look more attractive.&lt;ref name=digest /&gt; On the bottom left was the place to enter an "access card," which featured a cartoon character.&lt;ref name=digest /&gt; Above that was a place to enter a "secret code" that the customer chose.&lt;ref name=digest /&gt; On the bottom center was a picture of a cartoon blonde girl with china-blue eyes&lt;ref name=news /&gt; and a red hat. Above that was the place it handed out cash and coins. On the top right was the place to enter a desired amount of money.

==How it worked==
[[File:Tillie the All-Time Teller appearence.jpeg|thumb|A diagram showing the steps to using Tillie the All-Time Teller]]

Customers could use Tillie the All-Time Teller by following these steps:
# Inserting an "Alltime Tellercard"
# Following instructions presented on its TV screen
# Entering a "secret code" and entering a desired amount of money on the "money keyboard" ($200 was the limit)
# The machine would automatically hand out the desired amount of money.
# Entering a transaction envelope into the deposit slot

==Advertising==
There were a variety of advertisements made by the [[First National Bank of Atlanta]] in order to promote Tillie the All-Time Teller. These include:&lt;!--all three cited in the "Bibliography" section.--&gt;
* In one of the advertisements, a blonde woman that wore a red and white polka-dotted dress sang "I'm Tillie the All-Time Teller, I work for First National Bank" while standing beside the machine.
* In another advertisement, a balding, middle-aged man approached the machine singing "If You Knew Tillie" to the tune of "[[If You Knew Susie]]." The song went like this:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Oh, if you knew Tillie like I know Tillie
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl!
She works to please me, to make life easy
Oh, oh, she makes my banking smooth and breezy
Day or nighttime, I don’t care
When I need money, I know my all-time teller’s there!
If you knew Tillie, like I know Tillie
Oh, oh, oh!&lt;/poem&gt;}}
* For Tillie the All-Time Teller's third anniversary, the machine was featured in an advertisement where they sang "She's a Jolly Good Teller." It  originally aired on KSEL-TV and [[KAMC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=Dub_Rogers_-_KLBK_Archival_Footage%2C_no._9_-_American_State_Bank|title=Dub Rogers - KLBK Archival Footage, no. 9 - American State Bank|work=Texas Archive of the Moving Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The word "Tillie" has become a slang to describe any ATM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billips|first1=Mike|title=Since '78, Atlanta lost banks, but not economic power|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/1998/06/15/focus8.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:At the Chittagong University - CO 1069-511-38 (7831812362).jpg|thumb|Chittagong University in 1970.]]

From the beginning of the 20th century the enlightened section of local people was pressing to set up a university in Chittagong. Necessary grants for the construction of Chittagong University were allocated on 9 March 1964 in the meeting of National Economic Council. 

Professor of History, University of Rajshahi and Ex-Curator of Varendra Research Museum Dr Azizur Rahman Mallick was made the Project Director of Chittagong University on 3 December 1965. He set up the project office of the university at a building 'Kahkashan' on road no 3, Nasirabad Housing Society, Chittagong. All the officers and staffs of the university wing, Department of Education were transferred to the Chittagong University Project office through a gazette notification issued on 14 December 1965. A master plan of the university was prepared through 'Bastukala', an organisation led by Architect Mazharul Islam. Initially a two-storeyed administrative building, departmental offices, classrooms and a library building were built. Student hostels and a teachers' dormitory were also constructed in the first phase.

Dr. Azizur Rahman Mallick was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of Chittagong University through the Chittagong University Ordinance promulgated on 25 September 1966. The classes of M A (preliminary) of Bangla, English, History and Economics departments under the Faculty of Arts began first from 18 November 1966 with only 200 students and seven teachers. Dr. Abdul Karim joined as the Reader and head of the Department of History while Mohammad Ali and Dr. Shafiul Alam were appointed as Reader and Head of the Departments of English and Economics respectively. Abul Kalam Manzor Morshed joined as a Senior Lecturer in Bangla. Professor Syed Ali Ahsan was the first full professor of Chittagong University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=University_of_Chittagong|title=University of Chittagong - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Dr. Iftekhar Uddin Chowdhury  ==
Dr. Iftekhar told , “Our main target is to explore the modern education and research, ensuring information and technology-based study and according to the light of digital thinking of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina”. “University is a family. So, we need cooperation of all the members to run the institution fairly”, he added. 

Earlier on June 2, 2015 President of the country M Abdul Hamid, also chancellor of the CU, had appointed Dr. Iftekhar Uddin as the 17th VC of the university. He thanked President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid. Born on July 1, 1955, at North Kattoli of the port city, Dr. Iftekhar achieved PhD in Sociology from University of Tsukuba in Japan in March 1988. The new VC completed his masters and bachelor degrees from Sociology Department in Chittagong University in 1981 and 1976 respectively. 

He also got Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) from the same university in 1978. Dr Iftekhar was a pro-VC from May 30, 2013 to June, 2015. He served as the chairman of Sociology Department, president of Chittagong University Teachers’ Association (CUTA), and a secretary general of Bangladesh University Teachers’ Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banglanews24.com/education/article/41486/CU-VC-Dr-Iftekhar-takes-charge|title=CU VC Dr Iftekhar takes charge|last=http://www.banglanews24.com|website=www.banglanews24.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some Facts &amp; Figures ==
Different faculties of Chittagong University conduct course work and examinations on behalf of several other bodies like Bangladesh Military Academy, (Bhatiari), Bangladesh Marine Academy (Patenga), Bangladesh College of Forestry (Sholoshahar), Chittagong College of Fine Arts and Bangladesh Navel Academy (Patenga). The University of Chittagong awards honours, post-graduation, MBBS, DVM degrees and diploma beside higher degrees like MPhil, PhD, MD and MPH.

A council of the University was constituted to intensify the struggle for liberation in a meeting held on 8 March 1971 with Vice Chancellor Dr AR Mallick in the chair. One teacher, eleven students and three staff members of the university embraced martyrdom in the war of liberation. Mohammad Hossain, an employee of the Engineering department of Chittagong University was honored with the gallantry award of 'Bir Protik' for his heroic role in the war of liberation.

{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}
[[File:Weewee.JPG|thumb|Sample of human urine]]
'''Urine''' is a liquid [[by-product]] of [[metabolism]] in humans and in many animals. Urine flows from the [[kidney]]s through the [[ureter]]s to the [[urinary bladder]]. [[Urination]] results in urine being [[excretion|excreted]] from the body through the [[urethra]].

The cellular metabolism generates many by-products which are rich in [[nitrogen]] and must be [[clearance (medicine)|cleared]] from the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]], such as [[urea]], [[uric acid]], and [[creatinine]]. These by-products are expelled from the body during urination, which is the primary method for excreting water-soluble chemicals from the body. A [[urinalysis]] can detect [[nitrogenous waste]]s of the [[mammal]]ian body.

Urine has a role in the earth's [[nitrogen cycle]]. In balanced [[ecosystem]]s urine fertilizes the [[soil]] and thus helps [[plant]]s to grow. Therefore, [[Reuse of excreta|urine can be used]] as a [[fertilizer]]. Some animals use it to [[territory (animal)#Scent marking|mark their territories]]. Historically, aged or fermented urine (known as [[lant]]) was also used for [[gunpowder]] production, household cleaning, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of leather and [[dyeing]] of textiles. 

Human urine and [[human feces|feces]] are collectively referred to as [[human waste]] or human excreta, and are managed with a [[sanitation]] system. [[Livestock]] urine and feces also require proper management if the [[concentrated animal feeding operation|livestock population density is high]].

==Physiology==
{{Main|Renal physiology}}
[[File:Urea Structural Formula V2.svg|thumb|Urea structure]]
Most animals have [[excretory system]]s for elimination of soluble toxic wastes. In humans, soluble wastes are excreted primarily by the [[urinary system]] and, to a lesser extent in terms of [[urea]], removed by [[perspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arthur C. Guyton|author2=John Edward Hall|title=Textbook of medical physiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTZHAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|edition=11|isbn=978-0-8089-2317-6|chapter=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urinary system consists of the [[kidney]]s, [[ureter]]s, [[urinary bladder]], and [[urethra]]. The system produces urine by a process of [[filtration]], [[absorption (chemistry)|reabsorption]], and tubular secretion. The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, and a variety of other compounds. The resulting urine contains high concentrations of urea and other substances, including toxins. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra before passing from the body.

=== Duration ===
Research looking at the duration of [[urination]] in a range of [[mammal]] species found that nine larger species urinated for 21 ± 13 seconds irrespective of body size.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=P. J.|last2=Pham|first2=J.|last3=Choo|first3=J.|last4=Hu|first4=D. L.|title=Duration of urination does not change with body size|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=26 June 2014|volume=111|issue=33|pages=11932–11937|doi=10.1073/pnas.1402289111|pmc=4143032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller species including rodents and bats cannot produce jets and instead urinate with a series of drops.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Quantity===
Average urine production in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine per person per day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L per person per day, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health.&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015" /&gt; Producing too much or too little urine needs medical attention. [[Polyuria]] is a condition of excessive production of urine (&gt; 2.5 L/day), [[oliguria]] when &lt; 400 mL are produced, and [[anuria]] one of &lt; 100 mL per day.

===Constituents===
{{Further|Urinalysis}}
About 91-96% of urine consists of water.&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015" /&gt; Urine also contains an assortment of inorganic salts and organic compounds, including proteins, hormones, and a wide range of metabolites, varying by what is introduced into the body.

The total solids in urine are on average 59 g per person per day. Organic matter makes up between 65% and 85% of urine dry solids, with volatile solids comprising 75–85% of total solids. [[Urea]] is the largest constituent of the solids, constituting more than 50% of the total. On an elemental level, human urine contains 6.87 g/L carbon, 8.12 g/L nitrogen, 8.25 g/L oxygen, and 1.51 g/L hydrogen. The exact proportions vary with individuals and with factors such as [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and health.&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=C.|last2=Parker|first2=A.|last3=Jefferson|first3=B.|last4=Cartmell|first4=E.|title=The Characterization of Feces and Urine: A Review of the Literature to Inform Advanced Treatment Technology|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|volume=45|issue=17|year=2015|pages=1827–1879|issn=1064-3389|doi=10.1080/10643389.2014.1000761 | pmc= 4500995 | pmid=26246784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In healthy persons, urine contains very little protein; an excess is suggestive of illness.

===Color===
[[File:P. 28 a chart showing urine colours and their meaning.jpg|thumb|Medical experts have long connected urine colour with certain medical conditions. A medieval chart showing the medical implications of different urine color]]
Urine varies in appearance, depending principally upon a body's level of [[tissue hydration|hydration]], as well as other factors. Normal urine is a transparent solution ranging from colorless to amber but is usually a pale yellow. In the urine of a healthy individual the color comes primarily from the presence of [[urobilin]]. Urobilin is a final waste product resulting from the breakdown of [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] during the destruction of aging blood cells.

Colorless urine indicates over-hydration, generally preferable to dehydration (though it can remove essential salts from the body). Colorless urine in drug tests can suggest an attempt to avoid detection of illicit drugs in the bloodstream through over-hydration.

* Dark yellow urine is often indicative of dehydration.
* Yellowing/light orange may be caused by removal of excess [[B vitamin]]s from the bloodstream.
* Certain medications such as [[rifampin]] and [[phenazopyridine]] can cause orange urine.
* Bloody urine is termed [[hematuria]], a symptom of a wide variety of medical conditions.
* Dark orange to brown urine can be a symptom of [[jaundice]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], or [[Gilbert's syndrome]].
* Black or dark-colored urine is referred to as melanuria and may be caused by a [[melanoma]] or non-melanin [[acute intermittent porphyria]].
* Pinkish urine can result from the consumption of [[beet]]s.
* Greenish urine can result from the consumption of [[asparagus]] or foods or beverages with green dyes.
* Reddish or brown urine may be caused by [[porphyria]] (not to be confused with the harmless, temporary pink or reddish tint caused by [[beeturia]]).
* Blue urine can be caused by the ingestion of [[methylene blue]] (e.g., in medications) or foods or beverages with blue dyes.
* Blue urine stains can be caused by [[blue diaper syndrome]].
* Purple urine may be due to [[purple urine bag syndrome]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Odor===
Some time after leaving the body, urine may acquire a strong "fish-like" odor because of contamination with bacteria that break down urea into [[ammonia]]. This odor is not present in fresh urine of healthy individuals; its presence may be a sign of a [[urinary tract infection]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The odor of normal human urine can reflect what has been consumed or specific diseases. For example, an individual with diabetes mellitus may present a sweetened urine odor. This can be due to kidney diseases as well, such as kidney stones.

Eating asparagus can cause a strong odor reminiscent of the vegetable caused by the body's breakdown of [[asparagusic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lison M, Blondheim SH, Melmed RN | title = A polymorphism of the ability to smell urinary metabolites of asparagus | journal = Br Med J | volume = 281 | issue = 6256 | pages = 1676–8 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7448566 | pmc = 1715705 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.281.6256.1676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise consumption of [[saffron]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[coffee]], [[tuna fish]], and [[onion]] can result in telltale scents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Particularly spicy foods can have a similar effect, as their compounds pass through the kidneys without being fully broken down before exiting the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stefan Gates|author2=Max La Riviere-Hedrick|title=Gastronaut: adventures in food for the romantic, the foolhardy, and the brave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlSXXguGw9UC&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=15 March 2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-603097-7|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713222322/http://www.livestrong.com/article/248141-foods-that-affect-the-odor-of-urine/ Foods that Affect the Odor of Urine].

==Examination for medical purposes==
[[File:Bigot, Trophime - A Doctor Examining Urine.jpg|thumb|270px|right|''A Doctor Examining Urine''. [[Trophime Bigot]].]]Many physicians in ancient history resorted to the inspection and examination of the urine of their patients. [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]] wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of [[Andalusia]] d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the [[Umayyad]] empire.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Habib, Abdul Malik d.862CE/283AH "Kitaab Tib Al'Arab" (The Book of Arabian Medicine), Published by Dar Ibn Hazm, Beirut, Lebanon 2007(Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diabetes mellitus]] got its name because the urine is [[polyuria|plentiful]] and [[sweetness|sweet]]. The name ''[[uroscopy]]'' refers to any visual examination of the urine, including [[microscopy]], although it often refers to the aforementioned prescientific or protoscientific forms of urine examination. [[Clinical urine tests]] today duly note the gross color, turbidity, and odor of urine but also include [[urinalysis]], which chemically analyzes the urine and [[quantification (science)|quantifies]] its constituents. A [[microbiological culture|culture]] of the urine is performed when a [[urinary tract infection]] is suspected, as [[bacteriuria|bacteria in the urine]] are unusual otherwise. A microscopic examination of the urine may be helpful to identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis.

The color and volume of urine can be reliable indicators of hydration level. Clear and copious urine is generally a sign of adequate hydration. Dark urine is a sign of [[dehydration]]. The exception occurs when [[diuretics]] or excessive amounts of [[ethanol|alcohol]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} or [[caffeine]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} are consumed, in which case urine can be clear and copious and the person still be dehydrated.

Urine can also be used to produce [[urokinase]] which is used clinically as a [[Thrombolysis|thrombolytic]] agent.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Fertilizer===
{{Main|Reuse of excreta#Urine}}

Urine contains large quantities of nitrogen (mostly as [[urea]]), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved potassium. The exact composition of nutrients in urine varies with diet, in particular nitrogen content in urine is related to quantity of protein in the diet. A high protein diet results in high urea levels in urine.

Urine is very high in nitrogen (can be over 10% in a high protein diet), low in phosphorus (1%), and moderate in potassium (2-3%). Urine typically contains 70% of the [[nitrogen]] and more than half the [[potassium]] found in urban waste water flows, while making up less than 1% of the overall volume. If urine is to be separated and collected for use as a fertiliser in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is with [[sanitation]] systems that utilise waterless [[urinals]], [[Urine-diverting dry toilets|urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs)]] or [[urine diversion]] flush toilets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011).

Undiluted urine can chemically burn the leaves or roots of some plants, particularly if the soil moisture content is low. For this reason, urine fertilizer is usually applied diluted with water.

When diluted with water (at a 1:5 ratio for container-grown [[annual plant|annual]] crops with fresh growing medium each season or a 1:8 ratio for more general use), it can be applied directly to soil as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ecosanres.org/PM_Report.htm|title=An Ecological Approach to Sanitation in Africa: A Compilation of Experiences|last=Morgan|first=Peter|year=2004|edition=CD release|location=Aquamor, Harare, Zimbabwe|chapter=10.

Urine can also be used safely as a source of complementary nitrogen in carbon-rich [[compost]].&lt;ref name="LiquidGold"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.liquidgoldbook.com/ | title = Liquid Gold: The Lore and Logic of Using Urine to Grow Plants | last = Steinfeld | first = Carol | publisher = Ecowaters Books | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-9666783-1-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risks of using urine as a natural source of agricultural fertilizer are generally regarded as negligible or acceptable.

===Cleaning===
Because urea in urine breaks down into ammonia, urine has been used for the cleaning properties of the ammonia therein. In pre-industrial times urine was used – in the form of ''[[lant]]'' or aged urine – as a cleaning fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Sueton, Vespasian 23 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 English], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 Latin]. Cf. [[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'', Book 65, chapter 14,5 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#14 English], [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/Dion/livre66.htm Greek/French (66, 14)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Urine was also used for [[Urine therapy#Rome|whitening teeth in Ancient Rome]].

===Gunpowder===
{{Main|Potassium nitrate}}
Urine was used before the development of a [[chemical industry]] in the manufacture of [[gunpowder]]. Urine, a nitrogen source, was used to moisten straw or other organic material, which was kept moist and allowed to rot for several months to over a year. The resulting [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] were washed from the heap with water, which was evaporated to allow collection of crude saltpeter crystals, that were usually refined before being used in making gunpowder.&lt;ref name="LeConte"&gt;&lt;!-- this ref is also used in the potassium nitrate article --&gt;

===Survival uses===
{{See also|Urophagia}}
The ''[[US Army Field Manual]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equipped.com/21-76/ch6.pdf Water Procurement], US Army Field Manual&lt;/ref&gt; advises ''against'' drinking urine for survival. These guides explain that drinking urine tends to worsen rather than relieve dehydration due to the salts in it, and that urine should not be consumed in a survival situation, even when there is no other fluid available. In hot weather survival situations where other sources of water are not available, soaking cloth (a shirt for example) in urine and putting it on the head can help cool the body.

During [[World War I]] the [[Germans]] experimented with numerous poisonous gases for use during war. After the first German [[chlorine]] gas attacks, Allied troops were supplied with masks of cotton pads that had been soaked in urine. It was believed that the [[ammonia]] in the pad neutralized the chlorine. These pads were held over the face until the soldiers could escape from the poisonous fumes, although it is now known that chlorine gas reacts with urine to produce [[Chloramine|toxic fumes]] (''see [[chlorine]] and [[use of poison gas in World War I]]'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Vickers machine gun]], used by the British Army during World War I, required water for cooling when fired so soldiers would resort to urine if water was unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalarmouries.org/what-we-do/research/nfc/single-object/172 | title=Vickers Mk.I machine gun | publisher=[[Royal Armouries]] | accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urban legend]] states that urine works well against [[jellyfish]] stings. This scenario has appeared many times in popular culture including in the ''[[Friends]]'' episode "The One With the Jellyfish", an early episode of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', as well as the films ''[[The Real Cancun]]'' (2003), ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Paperboy (2012 film)|The Paperboy]]'' (2012). However, at best it is ineffective, and in some cases this treatment may make the injury worse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2283933&amp;page=1 Old Wives' Tale?

===Textiles===
Urine has often been used as a [[mordant]] to help prepare textiles, especially wool, for dyeing. In the Scottish Highlands and Hebrides, the process of "[[waulking]]" (fulling) woven wool is preceded by soaking in urine, preferably infantile.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by an interviewee in ''[[Lomax the Songhunter]]'', a 2004 documentary film.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

On the top of the left hand page is an illuminated letter "D" - initial of "De urinarum differencia negocium" (The matter of the differences of urines). Inside the letter is a picture of a master on bench pointing at a raised flask while lecturing on the "Book on urines" of Theophilus. The right hand page is only shown in part. On its very bottom is an illuminated letter "U" - initial of "Urina ergo est colamentum sanguinis" (Urine is the filtrate of the blood). Inside the letter is a picture of a master holding up a flask while explaining the diagnostic significance of urine to a student or a patient. HMD Collection, MS E 78.]]
[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] used fermented human urine (in the form of [[lant]]) to cleanse grease stains from clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa031303a.htm |title=Hygiene in Ancient Rome |accessdate=2010-02-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] instituted a tax ({{lang-la|vectigal urinae}}) on the urine industry, continued by his successor, [[Vespasian]].  The Latin saying ''[[Pecunia non olet]]'' (money doesn't smell) is attributed to Vespasian – said to have been his reply to a complaint from his [[Titus|son]] about the unpleasant nature of the tax. Vespasian's name is still attached to public [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s in France (''vespasiennes''), Italy (''vespasiani''), and Romania (''vespasiene'').

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] spent much time trying to extract gold from urine, which led to discoveries such as [[white phosphorus]] by German alchemist [[Hennig Brand]] when distilling [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] urine in 1669. In 1773 the French chemist [[Hilaire Rouelle]] discovered the organic compound [[urea]] by boiling urine dry.

== Society and culture ==

=== Language ===
The English word ''urine'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|r|ᵻ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɜːr|ᵻ|n}}) comes from the [[Latin]] ''urina'' (''-ae'', ''f''.), which is cognate with ancient words in various [[Indo-European languages]] that concern water, liquid, diving, rain, and urination. The [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] term "piss" was the usual word for urination before the 14th century. "Urinate" was at first used mostly in medical contexts. "Piss" continues to be used, but is considered vulgar; it is also used in such colloquialisms as "to piss off" and "piss poor", and the slang expression "pissing down" to mean "heavy rain". [[Euphemism]]s and [[baby talk|expressions used between parents and children]] (such as "wee", "pee", and many others) have long existed.

"[[Lant]]" is a word for aged urine, originating from the [[Old English]] word ''land'' referring to urine in general.
