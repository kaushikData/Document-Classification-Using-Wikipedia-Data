The '''Aboriginal Peoples Television Network''' ('''APTN''', stylized '''aptn''') is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[Terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[Category A services|Category A]] [[cable television|cable]] [[television network]]. Established in 1992 with government support to broadcast in Canada's northern territories, since 1999 APTN has had a national broadcast licence. It airs and produces programs made by, for and about [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]] and the United States. Based in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], it is the first network by and for Indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="aptn"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
[[File:TVNC.png|right|thumb|Logo while under the name Television Northern Canada (TVNC)]]
In 1980 the [[Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) issued the ''Therrien Committee Report''. In that report, the committee concluded that northern Indigenous peoples had increasing interest in developing their own media services and that the government has a responsibility to ensure support in broadcasting of Indigenous cultures and languages. The committee recommended measures to enable northern native people to use broadcasting to support their languages and cultures.

The [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] created the ''Northern Broadcasting Policy,'' issued on March 10, 1983. It laid out principles to develop Northern native-produced programming. The policy included support for what was called the ''Northern Native Broadcast Access Program,'' a funded program to produce radio and/or television programs in First Peoples' languages to reflect their cultural perspectives.

Soon after the program's creation, problems were recognized in the planned program distribution via [[satellite]]. In January 1987, Canadian aboriginal and Northern broadcasters met in [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]] to form a non-profit consortium to establish a Pan-Northern television distribution service. In 1988, the Canadian government gave the organizers $10 million to establish the network. The application for the new service, initially known as '''Television Northern Canada''' (TVNC), was approved by the CRTC in 1991. The network officially launched on [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] signals to the [[Canadian territories]] and far northern areas of the provinces on January 21, 1992.

=== National expansion and re-launch ===
After several years broadcasting in the territories, TVNC began lobbying the CRTC to amend their licence to allow TVNC to be broadcast nationally; they promoted the "uniqueness" and "significance" of a national Aboriginal service. On February 22, 1999, the CRTC granted TVNC a licence for a national broadcast network.

On September 1, 1999, the network also re-branded as the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN). It was added to all [[Multichannel television in Canada|specialty television]] services across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/TV/APTN10thside.html|title=Dream Catcher|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; APTN was the first national public television network for indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="aptn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aboriginal People's Television Network|title=About|url=http://www.aptn.ca/corporate/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Budget ==
In 2009, APTN had an annual budget of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]42 million.

== Distribution ==
APTN's service consists of six different feeds: two terrestrial feeds, separate national cable feeds for [[Eastern Canada|Eastern]] (Ontario and east), [[Western Canada]] (Manitoba and west), [[Northern Canada]] as well as a national HD feed.

The terrestrial feed, the successor to the original TVNC, is available over-the-air in Canada's far northern areas.  It consists of flagship station CHTY-TV&lt;ref&gt;{{RecnetCanada|CHTY-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]], semi-satellite CHWT-TV&lt;ref&gt;{{RecnetCanada|CHWT-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Whitehorse, Yukon]], and numerous low-powered [[rebroadcaster]]s across the Northwest Territories, Yukon, [[Nunavut]], [[Alberta]], [[Quebec]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

On August 31, 2011, APTN shut down 39 [[Broadcast relay station|low-power television repeaters]] across the Northwest Territories and Yukon,&lt;ref name="Transmitter-Decommission"&gt;[http://www.aptn.ca/psa/index.php Transmitters slated to shut down on August 31, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826021821/http://www.aptn.ca/psa/index.php |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; representing nearly half of its over-the-air transmitters.  Although this was conducted on the same day as Canada's over-the-air digital conversion deadline in certain mandatory markets, these transmitters were not subject to this deadline. None of the mandatory markets was located the Northwest Territories and Yukon.

In November 2016, CEO Jean La Rose told the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' that APTN was negotiating carriage for a U.S. service. He noted that there was a high level of interest among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for programming relevant to their communities.&lt;ref name="wpfp-aptnus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal TV network seeks U.S. expansion|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/aboriginal-tv-network-seeks-us-expansion-402007995.html|website=Winnipeg Free Press|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Canada cable feed operated as the national feed until the Western Canada feed began service on October 2, 2006.

APTN is licensed as a national network by the CRTC, thus putting it on par with [[CBC Television]], [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé|Radio-Canada]] and [[TVA (Canada)|TVA]].  Since APTN's relaunch as a national network in 1999, all Canadian cable and satellite television providers have been required to include it in their basic service. However, many cable companies outside the [[Arctic]] place it above channel 60 on their systems, rendering it inaccessible to older cable-ready television sets that do not go above channel 60. The CRTC considered requiring cable companies to move APTN to a lower dial position, but decided in 2005 that it would not do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2005/pb2005-89.htm Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2005–89], September 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==
APTN offers a variety of programming related to Aboriginal peoples, including documentaries, news magazines, dramas, entertainment specials, children's series, movies, sports events, educational programs and more. APTN's network programming is c. 56% [[English language|English]], 16% [[French language|French]], and 28% [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Aboriginal languages]].

== High definition ==
In March 2008, APTN launched a [[High-definition television|high definition]] channel known as '''APTN HD'''; initially, the HD feed was a straight simulcast of APTN's Eastern cable feed, complying with the requirement that a specialty channel's HD simulcast must be 95% identical in programming and scheduling to its standard-definition feeds. In May 2017, the CRTC amended APTN's license so that APTN HD's programming would no longer necessarily have to mirror the scheduling of the SD feeds, as long as 95% of its programming had aired at some point on one of APTN's SD feeds. The network argued that this change would allow it more flexibility in scheduling programming on APTN HD to reach a broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2017-139|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2017/2017-139.htm|publisher=CRTC|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elmnt.FM==
On June 14, 2017, a subsidiary of APTN, First Peoples Radio Inc. (FPR), was granted licences by the CRTC to operate radio stations in Toronto and Ottawa aimed at urban Indigenous populations in those cities. The Ottawa station will broadcast on 95.7 FM and the Toronto station will use 106.5 FM. Both frequencies had previously been allocated to [[Aboriginal Voices Radio]] which had its licenses revoked in 2015. FPR had also applied for licenses in Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver but the CRTC granted these to other applicants.&lt;ref&gt;http://theturtleislandnews.com/index.php/2017/06/14/crtc-grants-licences-five-radio-stations-serve-indigenous-people-urban-centres-country-wide/&lt;/ref&gt;

First Peoples Radio Inc had originally announced that its two radio stations, [[CFPT-FM]] in Toronto&lt;ref&gt;https://crtc.gc.ca/ownership/eng/toronto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CFPO-FM]] in Ottawa,&lt;ref&gt;https://crtc.gc.ca/ownership/eng/ott_gat.htm&lt;/ref&gt; were to go on the air by June 2018 but later delayed its soft launch until October 24, 2018. FPR will produce and share programming with the [[Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation]] in Saskatchewan and Native Communications Incorporated in Manitoba and is also in talks with the [[Aboriginal Multi-Media Society]], which has been granted radio licenses in Edmonton and Calgary, and  [[Northern Native Broadcasting (Terrace)]], which operates an Indigenous radio station in [[Terrace, British Columbia]] and has been granted a license to operate a radio station in [[Vancouver]], about potential programming partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaincanada.com/2017/10/26/first-peoples-radio-stations-to-launch-in-ontario/|title=First Peoples Radio stations to launch in Ontario|author=|date=|website=mediaincanada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stations first went on the air on October 24, 2018 at noon, branded as '''Elmnt.FM'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nowtoronto.com/music/elmnt-fm-aptn-radio/ "APTN to launch new Indigenous radio station ELMNT.FM in Toronto"]. ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'', June 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion into the United States==
APTN is working towards launching a similar outlet, tentatively titled All Nations Network, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network has already aired works produced in the United States, such as the full-length documentary film ''Skydancer,'' directed by Katja Esson, about the community of [[Akwesasne]] and its ironworkers. It was aired on both APTN and PBS in the United States in October 2012, after winning awards at film festivals.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had spent twenty years as a police officer, rising to police chief, before beginning a career in law.

Pfeuffer was Chief of the [[Edgewater, Colorado]], Police Department. He focused on advanced narcotics investigation techniques. Pfeuffer retired from the Police Department in 1997.

Pfeuffer works in the [[Columbus, Ohio]], office of the [[Public defender#Federal Public Defender systems|Federal Public Defender]].

==Guantanamo clients==

Pfeuffer's Afghan clients are [[Ahsanallah Pirzai]] and [[Abdul Ahmad]].&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch20070530/&gt;
In October 2005 a [[US District Court]] judge in [[Washington, D.C.]] received hand handwritten notes from Pirzai and Ahmad, asserting their innocence.  He then assigned the two men to Pfeuffer.
But, as of May 30, 2007, Pfeuffer had not been able to visit the men, phone them, or write to them.
Pfeuffer told ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'':{{quotation|I don't know if they even know I exist,}}

Pfeuffer filed a complaint on behalf of the two men on January 4, 2006.&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch20070530/&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] argued that the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] prohibited captives initiating new [[habeas corpus]] appeals.&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch20070530/&gt;

According to the [[Columbus Dispatch]] Pfeuffer then decided to research the information that was available to the public, including cases that dated back to the 18th century, and the thousands of pages of transcripts the DoD released on March 3, 2006.&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch20070530/&gt;  Pfeuffer travelled to [[Afghanistan]] on August 1, 2006, to interview witnesses who knew the two men.

Two men from Ahmad's village were able to confirm that he was a schoolteacher, just as he had testified, who had never had any ties to the Taliban.&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch20070530/&gt;

On August 26, 2006 Pfeuffer received an email from a Department of Justice lawyer, telling him that Pirzai had been released.&lt;ref name=ColumbusDispatch20070530/&gt;  In February 2007 Pfeuffer was told that Ahmad had also been released.
Pfeuffer told the Columbus Dispatch that he didn't know whether the men were released, whether they had been transferred to Afghan custody, or whether they were still in Guantanamo.

'''Big Bill Broonzy''' (born '''Lee Conley Bradley''', June 26, 1903 &lt;ref name="bare"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues: A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger | location= Santa Barbara, California| page=156 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riesman/&gt; – August 14, 1958) was an American [[blues]] singer, songwriter and guitarist. His career began in the 1920s, when he played [[country blues]] to mostly African-American audiences. Through the 1930s and 1940s he successfully navigated a transition in style to a more [[urban blues]] sound popular with working-class African-American audiences. In the 1950s a return to his traditional folk-blues roots made him one of the leading figures of the emerging [[American folk music revival]] and an international star. His long and varied career marks him as one of the key figures in the development of blues music in the 20th century.

Broonzy copyrighted more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including both adaptations of traditional [[folk music|folk songs]] and original blues songs. As a blues composer, he was unique in writing songs that reflected his rural-to-urban experiences.&lt;ref name= barlow&gt;Barlow, William (1989).

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Born '''Lee Conley Bradley''',&lt;ref name=riesman&gt;{{cite book |title=I Feel So Good: The Life and Times of Big Bill Broonzy |last=Riesman |first=Robert |year=2011 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=978-0-226-71745-6 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUir7i3PoVUC&amp;pg=PT33 |accessdate=November 18, 2011 |quote=His full given name was most likely Lee Conley Bradley.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the seventeen children of Frank Broonzy (Bradley) and Mittie Belcher. The date and place of his birth are disputed. Broonzy claimed to have been born in [[Scott, Mississippi]], but a body of emerging research compiled by the blues historian Robert Reisman suggests that he was born in [[Jefferson County, Arkansas]]. Broonzy claimed he was born in 1893, and many sources report that year, but family records discovered after his death suggested that the year was 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Folk, Country &amp; Western Music|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|author2=Landon, Grelun|year=1983 |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-24818-0| page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his birth the family moved to an area near [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], where Bill spent his youth. He began playing music at an early age. At the age of 10 he made himself a [[fiddle]] from a cigar box and learned how to play [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and folk songs from his uncle, Jerry Belcher. He and a friend, Louis Carter, who played a homemade guitar, began performing at social and church functions.&lt;ref name="accessed Jan. 14, 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2489 |title='Big Bill' Broonzy (1893?–1958) |work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early performances included playing at "two-stages": picnics where whites and blacks danced at the same event, but with different stages for blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Blues|last=Davis|first=Francis|year=2003 |publisher=DaCapo Press|isbn=0-306-81296-7| page=186f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the understanding that he was born in 1898 rather than earlier or later, sources suggest that in 1915, 17-year-old Broonzy was married and working as a [[sharecropper]]. He had given up playing the fiddle and had become a preacher. There is a story that he was offered $50 and a new violin if he would play for four days at a local venue. Before he could respond to the offer, his wife took the money and spent it, so he had to play. In 1916 his crop and stock were wiped out by drought. Broonzy went to work locally until he was drafted into the Army in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Country Blues|last=Charters|first=Samual B.|year=1960|publisher=Michael Joseph|location=London|isbn=|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served for two years in Europe during the [[World War I|First World War]]. After his discharge from the Army in 1919, he returned to the Pine Bluff area, where he is reported to have been called a [[racial epithet]] and told by a white man he knew before the war that he needed to "hurry up and get his soldier uniform off and put on some overalls." He immediately left Pine Bluff and moved to the [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] area. A year later, in 1920, he moved north to [[Chicago]] in search of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Stambler, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===
After arriving in Chicago, Broonzy switched from fiddle to guitar. He learned to play the guitar from the veteran [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] and [[medicine show]] performer [[Papa Charlie Jackson]], who began recording for [[Paramount Records]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Bill (2003). Liner notes to the CD ''Blues Is My Business''. Fuel 2000 Records.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1920s Broonzy worked at a string of odd jobs, including [[Pullman porter]], cook, [[foundry]] worker and custodian, to supplement his income, but his main interest was music. He played regularly at [[rent party|rent parties]] and social gatherings, steadily improving his guitar playing. During this time he wrote one of his signature tunes, a solo guitar piece called "Saturday Night Rub".&lt;ref name="Stambler, pg. 74"&gt;Stambler, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to his association with Jackson, Broonzy was able to get an audition with Paramount executive [[J. Mayo Williams]]. His initial test recordings, made with his friend John Thomas on vocals, were rejected, but Broonzy persisted, and his second try, a few months later, was more successful. His first record, "Big Bill's Blues", backed with "House Rent Stomp", credited to Big Bill and Thomps (Paramount 12656), was released in 1927.&lt;ref name="Russell 2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the recording was not well received, Paramount retained its new talent and in the next few years released more records by Big Bill and Thomps. The records sold poorly. Reviewers considered his style immature and derivative.&lt;ref&gt;Charters, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
In 1930, Paramount for the first time used Broonzy's full name on a recording, "Station Blues" – albeit misspelled as "Big Bill Broomsley". Record sales continued to be poor, and Broonzy was working at a grocery store. He was picked up by [[Lester Melrose]], who produced musical acts for various labels, including [[Champion Records]] and [[Gennett Records]]. 
Harum Scarums, a trio comprising Broonzy, [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Georgia Tom]] and [[Mozelle Alderson]], recorded the two-part "Alabama Scratch" in [[Grafton, Wisconsin]], for [[Paramount Records]] (Paramount 13054) in January 1931, and it was reported that it sounded "as if it was a real party."&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/booze-and-blues-go-hand-in-hand-for-broonzy-dorsey-and-alderson |title=Booze, Blues Go Hand in Hand for Broonzy, Dorsey and Alderson |website=Goldminemag.com |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broonzy recorded several sides released in the spring of 1931 under the name Big Bill Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Charters, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1932 he traveled to New York City and began recording for the [[American Record Corporation]] on their line of less expensive [[record label|labels]] ([[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone Records]], [[Perfect Records]] and others).&lt;ref name="Stambler, pg. 74"/&gt; These recordings sold better, and Broonzy was becoming better known. Back in Chicago he was working regularly in [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] clubs, and he toured with [[Memphis Minnie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://centerstage.net/music/whoswho/BigBillBroonzy.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613030754/http://centerstage.net/music/whoswho/BigBillBroonzy.html |date=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Broonzy moved to [[RCA Victor]]'s subsidiary [[Bluebird Records]] and began recording with the pianist Bob "Black Bob" Call. His fortunes soon improved. With Call his music was evolving to a stronger [[Rhythm and Blues|R&amp;B]] sound, and his singing sounded more assured and personal. In 1937, he began playing with the pianist [[Joshua Altheimer]], recording and performing with a small instrumental group, including "traps" (drums), [[double bass]] and one or more melody instruments (horns or harmonica or both). In March 1938 he began recording for [[Vocalion Records]].&lt;ref name="Charters; pg. 120"&gt;Charters, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broonzy's reputation grew. In 1938 he was asked to fill in for the recently deceased [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] at the "[[From Spirituals to Swing]]" concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], produced by [[John H. Hammond]]. He also appeared in the 1939 concert at the same venue.&lt;ref name="accessed Jan. 14, 2008"/&gt; His success led him in the same year to a small role in ''Swingin' the Dream'', [[Gilbert Seldes]]'s jazz adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', set in New Orleans in 1890 and featuring, among others, [[Louis Armstrong]] as [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] and [[Maxine Sullivan]] as [[Titania]], with the [[Benny Goodman]] sextet.

Broonzy's recorded output through the 1930s only partially reflects his importance to Chicago blues. His half-brother, [[Washboard Sam]], and his friends [[Jazz Gillum]] and [[Tampa Red]] also recorded for Bluebird. Broonzy was credited as the composer of many of their most popular recordings of that time. He reportedly played guitar on most of Washboard Sam's tracks. Because of his exclusive arrangements with his record label, Broonzy was careful to allow his name to appear on these artists' records only as a composer.&lt;ref name="Charters; pg. 120"/&gt;

===1940s===
Broonzy expanded his work during the 1940s as he honed his songwriting skills, which showed a knack for appealing to his more sophisticated city audience as well as people that shared his country roots. His work in this period shows he performed across a wider musical spectrum than almost any other bluesman before or since, including in his repertoire [[ragtime]], [[hokum blues]], [[country blues]], [[urban blues]], [[jazz]]-tinged songs, [[folk music|folk songs]] and [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s. After World War II, Broonzy recorded songs that were the bridge that allowed many younger musicians to cross over to the future of the blues: the electric blues of postwar Chicago. His 1945 recordings of "Where the Blues Began", with Big Maceo on piano and Buster Bennett on sax, and "Martha Blues", with Memphis Slim on piano, clearly showed the way forward. One of his best-known songs, "[[Key to the Highway]]", appeared at this time. When the second [[American Federation of Musicians]] strike ended in 1948, Broonzy was signed by [[Mercury Records]].&lt;ref name="Stambler, p. 75"&gt;Stambler, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Broonzy became part of a touring [[folk music]] revue, ''[[I Come for to Sing]]'', formed by [[Win Stracke]], which also included [[Studs Terkel]] and Lawrence Lane. Terkel called him the key figure in the group. The revue had some success thanks to the emerging [[folk revival]]. When the revue played at [[Iowa State University]] in [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]], Broonzy met a local couple, Leonard and Lillian Feinberg, who found him a custodial job at Iowa State when a doctor ordered Broonzy to discontinue touring later that year. He remained in Ames until 1951, when he resumed touring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblionotes.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/big-bill-broonzy-redux/ |title=Big Bill Broonzy Redux |website=Biblionotes.wordpress.com |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===

After his return to performing, the exposure from ''I Come for to Sing'' made it possible for Broonzy to tour Europe in 1951. Here he was greeted with standing ovations and critical praise wherever he played. The tour marked a turning point in his fortunes, and when he returned to the United States he was a featured act with many prominent folk artists, such as [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. From 1953 on, his financial position became more secure, and he was able to live well on his earnings from music. He returned to his solo folk-blues roots and travelled and recorded extensively.&lt;ref name="Stambler, p. 75"/&gt; Broonzy's numerous performances during the 1950s in British folk and jazz clubs were a significant influence on British audiences' understanding of the blues&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bolstered the nascent [[British folk revival#The second British folk revival 1945-69|British folk revival]] and early blues scene. Many British musicians on the folk scene, such as [[Bert Jansch]], cited him as an important influence.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Colin (2006). ''Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival''. Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lennon]], of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], also cited Broonzy as an important early influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/80701887 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018070445/https://vimeo.com/80701887 |date=October 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the [[Netherlands]], Broonzy met and became romantically involved with a Dutch woman, Pim van Isveldt. Together they had a child, Michael, who still lives in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broonzy.com/europe.html |title=Big Bill Broonzy: In Europe |website=Broonzy.com |date=1958-08-15 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to ''Amsterdam Live Concerts 1953'' (2006). Munich Records.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Vera (King) Morkovin and Studs Terkel took Broonzy to [[Circle Pines Center]], a cooperative year-round camp in [[Delton, Michigan]], where he was employed as the summer camp cook. He worked there in the summer from 1953 to 1956. On July 4, 1954, [[Pete Seeger]] travelled to Circle Pines and gave a concert with Broonzy on the farmhouse lawn, which was recorded by Seeger for the new fine-arts radio station in Chicago, [[WFMT-FM]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/guides/Mississippi.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530104604/http://www.loc.gov/folklife/guides/Mississippi.html |date=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, with the assistance of the Belgian writer Yannick Bruynoghe, Broonzy published his autobiography, ''Big Bill Blues''.&lt;ref name="accessed Jan. 14, 2008"/&gt; He toured worldwide, travelling to Africa, South America, the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] region and across Europe into early 1956. In 1957 Broonzy was one of the founding faculty members of the [[Old Town School of Folk Music]]. On the school's opening night, December 1, he taught a class, "The Glory of Love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtownschool.org/history/night.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719044445/http://www.oldtownschool.org/history/night.html |date=July 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
By 1958 Broonzy was suffering from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. He died on August 14 or 15, 1958 (sources vary on the precise date), and is buried in [[Lincoln Cemetery (Blue Island)|Lincoln Cemetery]], in [[Blue Island, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbluesguys.com/dbgtour/broonzy_william.htm |title=Big Bill Broonzy Grave |website=Deadbluesguys.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8675 |title=William "Big Bill" Broonzy (1893–1958) – Find a Grave Memorial |website=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
Broonzy's influences included the [[folk music]], [[spirituals]], [[work songs]], [[ragtime]] music, [[hokum]], and country blues he heard growing up and the styles of his contemporaries, including [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Blind Blake]], [[Son House]], and [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]]. Broonzy combined all these influences into his own style of the blues, which foreshadowed the postwar [[Chicago blues]], later refined and popularized by artists such as [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Willie Dixon]].&lt;ref name="accessed Jan. 14, 2008"/&gt;

Although he had been a pioneer of the Chicago blues style and had employed electric instruments as early as 1942, white audiences in the 1950s wanted to hear him playing his earlier songs accompanied only by his own [[acoustic guitar]], which they considered to be more authentic.

He portrayed the discrimination against black Americans in the 1930s in his song "[[Black, Brown and White]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10480580/Big-Bill-Broonzy-legacy-of-a-musical-pioneer.html|title=Big Bill Broonzy: legacy of a musical pioneer|first=Martin|last=Chilton|date=December 1, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has been used globally in education about racism, but in the late 1990s its inclusion in antiracism education at a school in [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]], led pupils to taunt the school's only black pupil with the song's chorus, "If you're white, that's all right, if you're brown, stick around, but if you're black, oh brother get back, get back, get back". The national media reported that the problem became so bad that the nine-year-old boy was withdrawn from the school by his mother. The song had already been adopted by the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], a far-right British political party which peaked in popularity in the 1970s and opposed nonwhite immigration to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/260025.stm|title=BBC News - Education - Boy withdrawn over 'racist' song|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable part of Broonzy's early ARC/CBS recordings has been reissued in anthologies by CBS-Sony, and other earlier recordings have been collected on blues reissue labels, as have his European and Chicago recordings of the 1950s. The Smithsonian's [[Folkways Records]] has also released several albums featuring Broonzy.

In 1980, he was inducted into the first class of the [[Blues Hall of Fame]], along with 20 other of the world's greatest blues legends. In 2007, he was inducted into the first class of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame, along with 11 other musical greats, including Louis Armstrong, [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Gene Autry]], and [[Lawrence Welk]].

In the September 2007 issue of ''[[Q Magazine]]'', [[Ronnie Wood]], of the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], cited Broonzy's track "Guitar Shuffle" as his favorite guitar music. Wood remarked, "It was one of the first tracks I learnt to play, but even to this day I can't play it exactly right."

[[Eric Clapton]] has cited Broonzy as a major inspiration, commenting that Broonzy "became like a role model for me, in terms of how to play the acoustic guitar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=64412 |title=Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Ray Davies and Others Discuss How Big Bill Broonzy Sparked the British Blues-Rock Explosion in Bob Riesman's New Bio "I Feel So Good" |website=Top40-charts.com |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton featured Broonzy's song "Hey Hey" on his album ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]''. The [[Derek and the Dominos]] album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' includes their recording of "[[Key to the Highway]]".

Another musician heavily influenced by Broonzy was [[Jerry Garcia]], who upon hearing a recording of Broonzy's blues playing decided to exchange an accordion he received on his 15th birthday for an electric guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.relix.com/articles/detail/bluegrass_boy_inside_the_new_box_set_exploring_jerry_garcias_early_acoustic_era|title=Bluegrass Boy: Inside the New Box Set Exploring Jerry Garcia’s Early Acoustic Era|work=Relix|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia would later co-found [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]], who frequently performed a number of songs which Broonzy had recorded decades earlier, including "C.C. Rider" and "Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dead.net/songs|title=Songs {{!}} Grateful Dead|website=Dead.net|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broonzy's influence on the roots rock band the [[The Blasters|Blasters]] is apparent. In 2014, the Blasters' founders [[Dave Alvin]] and [[Phil Alvin]], as a duo, released the album ''[[Common Ground: Dave Alvin &amp; Phil Alvin Play and Sing the Songs of Big Bill Broonzy]]''. Dave Alvin commented, "We're brothers, we argue sometimes, but one thing we never argue about is Big Bill Broonzy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dave-Alvin/e/B000APWA8A/ref=ac_dtp_sa_bio |title=Dave Alvin: Songs, Albums, Pictures, Bios |website=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the benediction at the 2009 inauguration ceremony of President [[Barack Obama]], the [[civil rights]] leader Rev. Dr. [[Joseph Lowery]] paraphrased Broonzy's song "Black, Brown and White Blues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/1/20/13479/4828 |title=Video: Dr. Joseph Lowery's Benediction (Update- Transcript!) |website=Dailykos.com |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the PopUp Archive project, in collaboration with the [[WFMT]] network, the [[Chicago History Museum]], and the [[Library of Congress]], an hour-long interview of Broonzy, recorded on September 13, 1955, by [[Studs Terkel]] was made available on-line. The interview includes reflections on his life and on the blues tradition, a performance of one of his most famous songs, "Albert,"  and performances of "Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad" and other classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.popuparchive.com/collections/938/items/8392 |title=Big Bill Broonzy Talks with Studs Terkel on WFMT: 1955/09/13 |publisher=Pop Up Archive |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216112331/https://www.popuparchive.com/collections/938/items/8392 |archive-date=February 16, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discography==
Between 1927 and 1942, Broonzy recorded 224 songs, which makes him the second most prolific blues recording artist during that period.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  These were released before blues records were tracked by recording industry trade magazines. By the time ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine instituted its "[[race music]]" charts in October 1942, Broonzy's recordings were less popular, and none appeared in the charts.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies''''', is a 2007 book by author [[M. Stanton Evans]], who asserts that [[Joseph McCarthy]] was proper in making accusations of disloyalty, subversion, or treason within the US State Department and the US Army, showing proper regard for evidence (during a period in the late 1940s and 1950s known as [[McCarthyism]] or the second [[Red Scare]]).

==Summary==

The book's premise is that a vast Soviet conspiracy infiltrated the Roosevelt and Truman administrations to create a foreign policy that advanced the spread of world Communism, including the Soviet [[Eastern Bloc#Formation of Eastern Bloc|takeover of Eastern Europe]] and the [[Chinese Civil War|fall of Nationalist China]], which McCarthy exposed, only to have his efforts undermined by political opponents with a vested interest in allowing the conspiracy to continue.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=In the Heart of the Heart of Conspiracy|author=[[David Oshinsky]]|date=2007-01-27|quote=This remarkable fantasy, playing upon the deepest fears of right-wing Republicans, ignores the actual United States foreign policy that gave billions of dollars in aid to Chiang, fought a brutal war in Korea against two Communist nations, propped up an anti-Communist regime in Vietnam at the cost of 58,000 American lives and refused for three decades to recognize the government of Mao. Most historians today view the “loss” of China for what it was: a futile American attempt to aid a corrupt and unpopular regime. And most see Truman — the key bogeyman of the McCarthyites — as a tough anti-Communist who protected constitutional liberties at home and American interests abroad.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/m-stanton-evans/blacklisted-by-history/|title=Kirkus Reviews:BLACKLISTED BY HISTORY|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|quote=A detailed account of McCarthy and of the CPUSA marred by ideological blinders. For true believers only.|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book exhaustively examines, chronicles, and documents the oft-disputed claim that Communist spies, sympathizers and fellow travelers, who were aided and instigated by the Soviet Union and Communist China, infiltrated the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, to aid in the expansion of Communism throughout the world during the Cold War.

The book's footnotes and the references provide links to the documents located in the National Archives and the records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other sources. Evans documents the fact that the National Archives copy of at least one of the most critical documents McCarthy submitted to the Congressional boards has been ripped out of its binder and stolen by persons unknown. Evans was able to track down another copy in the private papers of one of the Congressmen involved in the hearings. Much of the information that is cited by Evans was previously classified and unavailable to researchers, but it has now been declassified and is now available publicly.

Claims of Communist infiltration and spies within the federal government were further verified by the release of the [[Venona decrypts]] and records released by the former Soviet Union's KGB in recent years.

==Reviews==

[[Ronald Radosh]], a historian and expert on the [[Cold War]] spies [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], states that "rather than a biography, Evans has written a defense counsel’s brief for his client, whom he seeks to defend against all the slanders made about McCarthy by his political enemies." He praises Evans' "extensive research", and his exposure of the political agendas of McCarthy's main opponents and their unwillingness to look more closely into Soviet penetration. He also commends Evans for correcting the view that all of McCarthy's "victims" were innocent. Radosh severely criticises McCarthy's failure to distinguish between communists and anti-communist "liberals”, and between those expressing communist or pro communist views and those working as Soviet agents, and criticises Evans for glossing over this. Radosh concludes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronald | last = Radosh | authorlink = Ronald Radosh | title = The Enemy Within | date = 5 December 2007 | url = http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/The%20Enemy%20Within.html | work = [[National Review Online]] | accessdate = 2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Evans’s book falls far short of what it might have done to correct the record about the era. His own exaggerations and unwarranted leaps parallel those made by McCarthy. It is unlikely that his hope to change history’s verdict will become a reality as a result of the publication of this book.}}

Reviewing the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', American historian [[David Oshinsky]] was harshly critical, calling Evans' primary thesis a "remarkable fantasy," asserting that Evans has uncovered no fresh evidence and arguing that the evidence supports the historical consensus that Communist spy networks in the United States had largely been dismantled by the time McCarthy started his campaign and that McCarthy was "a bit player in the battle against Communist subversion, a latecomer who turned a vital crusade into a political mud bath... The fiercely negative judgments of those who lived through the McCarthy era are widely accepted today for good reason: they ring true."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] called the book "[a] [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] biography", which although a "detailed account" is "marred by ideological blinders" and fit "[f]or true believers only",&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] describing Evans as "given to conspiracy thinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4000-8105-9|title=Nonfiction Review - Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy|date=2007-09-17|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reason magazine]] describing it as "revisionist" and "a breathless defense of McCarthy."&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite web|title=Beck U : The excitable Fox News host goes to college|author=[[Michael C. Moynihan]]|url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/07/07/beck-u|publisher=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|date=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 review by Wes Vernon of Accuracy in Media he says, "Generally, the media that trashed the Evans book did so either from a wealth of ignorance or willingness to gloss over the book’s irrefutable documentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/aim-report/mainstream-media-try-to-burn-a-book|title=Mainstream Media Try to Burn a Book|author=Wes Vernon|publisher=[[Accuracy In Media]]|date=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chadong language''' (also called '''Chaodong''', {{zh|茶洞語}}) is a [[Kam–Sui language]] spoken mainly in Chadong Township, [[Lingui County]], [[Guilin]], northeastern [[Guangxi]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Anthony|editor1-last=Diller|editor2-first=Jerold|editor2-last=Edmondson|editor3-first=Yongxian|editor3-last=Luo|year=2008|title=The Tai–Kadai Languages|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-203-64187-6|chapter=Chapter 21: Chadong, a Newly-Discovered Kam–Sui Language in Northern Guangxi|pages=596–620}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-12-22--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is most closely related to the [[Maonan language]]. Chadong has only been recently described by Chinese linguist [[Jinfang Li]] in the 1990s and 2000s.

==History==
According to inscriptions from the [[Ming dynasty]], Chadong speakers originally came from Qingyuanfu, [[Nandan County|Nandan]], [[Guangxi]], which is located further to the west. They were originally sent to the [[Guilin]] area during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] in order to suppress local [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] and [[Yao people|Yao]] rebellions.

==Genetics==
Qiongying Deng and Chuan-Chao Wang et al. have reported that most of the patrilineal and matrilineal gene pools of Chadong are characteristic lineages of southern China. Some ancient Southeast Asian lineages (Y chromosome haplogroups C and D, mtDNA haplogroups M*, M33, M74, and R*) were also identified in Chadong. Chadong shows patterns of the Y chromosome and mtDNA diversities similar to other southern populations, especially Kam-Sui populations, which was actually in accordance with linguistic classification. However, the origin of Chadong seems to be much more complex. Recent gene flow from Sino-Tibetan populations is detected in the patrilineal side of Chadong, such as Y chromosome haplogroups O3a1c-002611, O3a2c1*-M134, and O3a2c1a-M117, probably through the expansion and dispersal of Han Chinese. From the matrilineal aspect, most mtDNA haplogroups of Chadong also clustered together with Hmong-Mien, and obvious gene flow from Tibeto-Burman populations to Chadong was also observed in haplogroup F1a. Taken together, the origin of Chadong are mainly results of an admixture between surrounding populations with the indigenous Kam-Sui populations. Within the Kam-Sui populations, Chadong is more closely related to Mulam than to Maonan, especially from the matrilineal side.&lt;ref&gt;Deng QY*, Wang CC*, Wang XQ*, Wang LX, Wang ZY, Wu WJ, Li H, the Genographic Consortium. Genetic affinity between the Kam-Sui speaking Chadong and Mulam people. J Syst Evol. 2013, 51(3):263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
In Liangjiang, the Chadong language is less conservative due to influences from [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]], [[Pinghua]] (Liangjiang Pinghua 两江平话 dialect), and [[Southwestern Mandarin]] (Diller, et al. 2008). Chadong is spoken by 18,000 people in 98 villages, while there are 104 ethnic Chadong villages with 20,547 people as of 2000 (Li et al. 2012).

The '''Chamber of Deputies of Portugal''', alternatively translatable as the [[House of Commons]] and formally styled the '''Chamber of the Gentlemen Deputies of the Portuguese Nation''' (Portuguese: ''Câmara dos Deputados'' or ''Câmara dos Senhores Deputados da Nação Portuguesa'') was the [[lower house]] of the [[Cortes Gerais]], the legislature of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] during most of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|constitutional monarchy]] period. The Chamber of Deputies directly represented the Portuguese Nation, elected through direct suffrage of the electoral circuits corresponding to the [[districts of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="AR - Monarquia Constitucional"&gt;{{cite |date= |title= A Monarquia Constitucional (1820-1910) |trans-title= |language= Portuguese |author = [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] |location= Lisbon |url= https://www.parlamento.pt/Parlamento/Paginas/AMonarquiaConstitucional5.aspx#1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Portuguese Republic|First Republic]], the Chamber of Deputies was [[Chamber of Deputies of Portugal (1910-1926)|remodeled]] after the [[US House of Representatives]].

A '''commendation ceremony''' (''commendatio'') is a formal [[ceremony]] that evolved during the [[Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] period to create a bond between a [[lord]] and his fighting man, called his [[vassal]]. The first recorded ceremony of ''commendatio'' was in 7th century France, but the relationship of ''vassalage'' was older, and predated even the medieval formulations of a [[Nobility|noble]] class.  The lord's "man", might be born unfree, but the ''commendatio'' freed him.

When two men entered into a [[feudal]] relationship, they underwent a ceremony known as '''commendation ceremony'''. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord. The commendation ceremony is composed of two elements, one to perform the act of [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and the other an oath of [[fealty]]. In some countries, such as the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], the commendation ceremony came to be referred to as [[investiture]].

==Etymology==
The word ultimately comes from the [[PIE]] root *upo "under". Becoming in the [[Proto-Celtic language]] *wasso- "young man, squire," literally "one who stands under," thence into: [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwas'' "youth, servant," [[Breton language|Breton]] ''goaz'' "servant, vassal, man," and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''foss'' "servant." The Celtic word was taken into medieval Latin ''vassallus'' "man-servant, domestic, retainer." In [[Old French]] it became ''vassal'' "subject, subordinate, servant" (12c.), and thus into English with this sense.

==Act of homage==
[[Image:King Charlemagne receiving the Oath of Fidelity and Homage from one of his great Feudatories or High Barons.png|right|thumb|Charlemagne receiving the oath of fidelity and homage from one of his great [[vassal]]s:facsimile of a monochrome miniature in a 14th-century Ms of the "Chronicles of St. Denis." (Library of the Arsenal)]]The would-be vassal appeared bareheaded and weaponless as a sign of his submission to the will of the lord and knelt before him. The vassal would clasp his hands before him in the ultimate sign of submission, the typical Christian prayer pose, and would stretch his clasped hands outward to his lord.

The lord in turn grasped the vassal's hands between his own, showing he was the superior in the relationship, a symbolic act known variously as the '' immixtio manuum'' (Latin), ''Handgang'' (German), or ''håndgang'' (Norwegian).&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Anne (2000). ''Nobles and Nobility in Medieval Europe: Concepts, Origins, Transformations'', Boydell, Woodbridge, p. 211. {{ISBN|0-85115-769-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vassal would announce he wished to become "the man", and the lord would announce his acceptance. The act of homage was complete.

{{quote|text=The vassus thus entered into a new realm of protection and mutual services. Through the touching of hands the warrior chief caused to pass from this own body into the body of the vassal something like a sacred fluid, the ''hail''. Made [[taboo]], as it were, the vassal thereupon fell under the charismatic power, pagan in origin, of the lord: his ''mundeburdium'', or ''mainbour'',  true power, at once possessive and protective.&lt;ref&gt;Rouche 1987 p 429&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The physical position for [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] prayer that is thought of as typical today—kneeling, with hands clasped—originates from the commendation ceremony.{{Citation Needed|date=May 2017}} Before this time, European Christians prayed in the ''[[orans]]'', which is the Latin, or "praying" position that people had used in antiquity: standing, with hands outstretched, a gesture still used today in many Christian rituals.

[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 050.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Papacy and monarchy: Catholic [[Marie de' Medici]] assumes the traditional pose of a vassal in homage at her coronation following [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s assassination, as painted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]

The gesture of homage (though without any feudal significance) survives in the ceremony for conferring degrees at the [[University of Cambridge]].

[[Eginhard]] records the solemn commendation ceremony made to [[Pippin the Younger|Pippin]] by [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo, duke of Bavaria]] in 757, ("commending himself in vassalage between the hands" (''in vasatico se commendans per manus''), he swore&amp;mdash;and the word used is ''"[[sacrament]]a"''&amp;mdash;, placing his hands on the relics of the saints, which had apparently been assembled at Compiègne for the solemn occasion, and promised fidelity to the king and to his sons: the relics touched were those of saint Denis, Saint Rusticus and Saint Éleuthère, Saint Martin and Saint Germain, a daunting array of witnesses. And the men of high birth who accompanied him swore likewise "...and numerous others" Eginhard adds ([https://web.archive.org/web/20091205213132/http://www.noctes-gallicanae.org/Charlemagne/Annales/Pepin_le_Bref.htm Eginhard, Annals 757]).

==Oath of fealty ceremony==
The vassal would then place his hands on a Bible, or a saint's relic, and swear he would never injure the lord in any way and to remain faithful.

An example of an oath of fealty (German ''Lehneid'', Dutch ''leenpligt''): "I promise on my faith that I will in the future be faithful to the lord, never cause him harm and will observe my homage to him completely against all persons in good faith and without deceit."

==Significance of commendation==
Once the vassal had sworn the oath of fealty, the lord and vassal had a feudal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Commendation|volume=6|page=765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copts in Canada''' are Canadian citizens of [[Coptic people|Coptic]] descent or persons of Coptic descent residing in [[Canada]].

==Population and distribution==
According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] there were 3,570 Canadians who claimed Coptic ancestry (this figure combines single and multiple ethnic origin responses).&lt;ref name="2011Census"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=1118296&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0 |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |author=[[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 73,250 Canadians claimed Egyptian ancestry, and some of these are believed to be Copts.&lt;ref name="2011Census"/&gt;

The Canadian Coptic Association estimates that there are 35,000 Copts living in Canada; according to [[CBC News]], "if other sects with strong ties to the Coptic community are included, the figure is possibly higher still."&lt;ref name="CBCNews"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coptic-christians-in-canada-1.1020870 Coptic Christians in Canada], CBC News (January 3, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: There is likely a typo in the CBC article where an extra zero was added, thereby erroneous stating that there are 350,000 Copts in Canada).

[[Toronto]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area|surrounding metropolitan region]] have the largest concentration of Copts in Canada.&lt;ref name="CBCNews"/&gt;

==Immigration history==

[[Image:Saint Mina and Saint Kyrillos Coptic Orthodox Church.jpg|230px|right|thumb|St. Mina and St. Kyrillos Coptic Orthodox Church in Mississauga, Ontario.]]

The immigration of the Copts to Canada might have started as early as the late 1950s. Due to an increasing amount of discrimination towards Copts in Egypt in the 1970s, many decided to emigrate in order to escape the rising racial tensions. Canada has been receiving a greater number of these immigrants, and the number of Coptic immigrants into Canada has been growing ever since.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/world/muslims-fury-falls-on-egypt-s-christians.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Coptic Orthodox Church in Canada==
{{Main|Coptic Orthodox Church in Canada}}

In 1964, St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church was established in Toronto; this was the first Coptic church established in the [[Coptic diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Saad Michael Saad, "Coptic Civilization in the Diaspora" in ''Coptic Civilization: Two Thousand Years of Christianity in Egypt'' (ed. Gawdat Gabra: [[American University in Cairo Press]], 2014), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a survey showed 22 Coptic Orthodox [[parish]]es in Canada, indicating growth.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Smith, "The Egyptian Copts: Nationalism, Ethnicity, and Definition of Identity for a Religious Minority" in ''Nationalism and Minority Identities in Islamic Societies'' (ed. Maya Shatzmiller: [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], 2005), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, there were five Coptic Orthodox churches in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coptic-churches-in-canada-on-alert-1.1080545 Coptic churches in Canada on alert], CBC News (January 4, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crime]]''' in '''[[Egypt]]''' is present in various forms.&lt;ref name="USSTATEEGYPT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consular Information Sheet: Egypt |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1108.html}} ''[[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of crime include [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], [[fraud]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[Black market|black marketeering]] etc.

==Petty crime==
During the 1980s, [[Petty crime]] was a significant problem in the country.&lt;ref name=LOCIC&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+eg0179) Incidence of Crime] ''Federal Research Division'', ''[[Library of Congress]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theft]] and [[pickpocketing]] were widespread in the capital city [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt; [[Motor vehicle theft]], crime by women and juveniles and incidents of kidnappings were increased in Cairo in 1988.&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt; In an interview in 1989, the director of security for Cairo described poor economic conditions, high [[unemployment]], [[population growth]], and changes in social norms as the reasons behind higher crime rates.&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt; [[Bank robbery|Bank robberies]], gang violence, and other [[violent crime]] were less common.&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt; [[White-collar crime]], [[smuggling]], black marketeering, and other economic crimes like [[embezzlement]], [[tax evasion]], [[kickbacks]] and [[bribery]] increased when [[Anwar El Sadat]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] were the [[President of Egypt]].&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt;In 2015, reports of [[sexual harassment]] were highly increasing in tourist attractions in the country including the [[Pyramids of Giza]].

==Corruption==
{{main|Corruption in Egypt}}
Sadat established commissions for investigation of corruption among government officials.&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt; Mubarak replaced many cabinet members for inability in detecting corruption.&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt; Despite such measures, economic crimes continued to be widespread.&lt;ref name=LOCIC/&gt;

[[Law enforcement]] have been reported to be dangerously corrupt, making  affiliations with [[tuktuk]] and taxi drivers to break traffic laws for a charge. Also, making false warrants and unlawful arrests on [[suspect]]s who are filed with cases made by paying rivals.

==Organized crime==
Egypt serves as a transit country for women trafficked from [[Eastern Europe]] to [[Israel]] for commercial sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="CIAEGYPT"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook - Egypt|work=[[CIA World Factbook]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women from countries in sub-Saharan Africa and [[Asia]] are believed to be trafficked through the Sinai Desert to Israel and Europe for labor.&lt;ref name="CIAEGYPT"/&gt; Many Egyptian children from rural areas are trafficked to other areas in Egypt as domestic servants or laborers in the agriculture industry.&lt;ref name="CIAEGYPT"/&gt;

==Terrorism and Religious Violence==
{{main|Terrorism in Egypt}}
Egypt suffers from [[religious violence]] and [[terrorism]], in frequent attacks both on tourist and on religious minorities. Notable examples include the
[[Luxor massacre]] (1997), the [[2004 Sinai bombings]], 2005 attacks  [[April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks|in Cairo]] and [[2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks|in Sharm el-Sheikh]], the [[2006 Dahab bombings]] and the [[2011 Alexandria bombing]].

[[Puerto Rico]] has struggled with [[crime]] for decades since the island became a United States territory in 1898. [[Police corruption|Police]] and [[political corruption]] in particular have posed problems ever since. Throughout that time, analysis have also warned of a [[cycle of violence]] between [[law enforcement]] and [[organized crime]] in the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The significant trade of [[illegal drugs in Puerto Rico]] poses a recurrent problem, with the high prices of substances such as [[cocaine]] on the territory's streets causing large [[Profit (accounting)|profit margins]] for criminals despite government actions.&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;

[[Violent crime]] has also been one of the challenges the island has struggled with for years. For example, in the mid-[[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the territory ranked sixth worldwide in murders per capita.&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; In reaction to those statistics, organizations such as the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Agency]] (DEA) have enhanced efforts with the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] (PRPD) and other local agencies, with the former larger groups having a major presence on the island. The combination of this fortified presence and other local measures has sparked commentary about a fundamental [[militarization of the police]].&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]], for instance,{{how|date=February 2018}} cautioned in 2011 that the PRPD was "broken in a number of critical and fundamental respects."&lt;ref name="Investigation"/&gt;

The island's strategic geographic position further compounds its struggles with crime. As the island finds itself between a highly [[developed country]]&amp;mdash;the [[continental United States]]&amp;mdash;and various [[Developing country|developing nations]] in the [[Caribbean]], a unique economic and political situation arises{{which|date=February 2018}} that heightens the stakes on maintaining both domestic and regional security. Moreover, as the region evolved after the end of the [[Cold War]], issues such as illegal [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] extended beyond local law enforcement to become matters affecting regional stability.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;

To combat all these issues, [[government of Puerto Rico|the Puerto Rican government]] adopted a broad anti-crime policy referred to locally as the "iron fist" ({{lang-es|mano dura contra el crimen}} or simply ''mano dura'').&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"&gt;{{citenews|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Dia]]''|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/seguridad/nota/evidenteelfracasodelamanoduracontraelcrimen-1469568/|title=Evidente el fracaso de la "Mano Dura" contra el crimen|language=Spanish|date=March 14, 2013|accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; In 1993, Governor [[Pedro Rosselló]] summed up government efforts by remarking, "They have incited a war, and they'll get it: let criminals know that our patience is gone" ({{lang-es|Nos han pedido guerra y guerra tendrán. Que lo sepa el criminal: nuestra paciencia se acabó.}}).&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt; Even after adopting multiple measures, however, the territory has still suffered from significantly high per capita rates of violent crime. For example, a total of 736 individuals were murdered in Puerto Rico in 2006.&lt;ref name="Robles"/&gt;

== Background and early history ==

=== Puerto Rican crime before the 1980s ===

[[File:Raising the U.S. flag over San Juan, October 18, 1898.JPG|thumb|right|225px|A public spectacle occurs as the [[flag of the United States]] is raised over [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] on October 18, 1898.]]

The [[history of Puerto Rico]] as a [[colony]] under the [[Spanish Empire]] came to an end near the conclusion of the 19th century. As a part of the [[Spanish–American War]], the U.S. invaded the island with a landing at [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]] on July 25, 1898. The [[Puerto Rican Campaign]] resulted in a total defeat for Spanish armed forces. U.S. troops led by [[Nelson A. Miles]] experienced only seven deaths, yet they took control over the entire island in a matter of weeks. As an outcome of the war and the comprehensive American victory, the nation of [[Spain]] ceded Puerto Rico as well as the territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] held under Spanish sovereignty to the U.S., the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] establishing the peace. Spain gave up all rights to [[Cuba]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain|date=December 10, 1898|work=The Avalon Project at the Yale Law School|publisher=Yale Law School, Lillian Goldman Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invaded"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/puerto-rico-invaded|title=Puerto Rico Invaded - July 25, 1898|publisher=[[History.com]]|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Americanization]] of Puerto Rico started after this abrupt, violent change in government, with initial chaos holding back the [[U.S. military|military-led]] reorganization of [[civil society]].&lt;ref name="Shaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invaded"/&gt; [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Guy V. Henry]], who served as military governor of the island from 1898 to 1899, publicly remarked on the changing situation, "It was an entirely new duty for American Army officers." He added, "There was no precedent in the experience of those so suddenly placed in charge of this our first real colony, upon which their policy could be based." In terms of fighting crime after the transition, Henry commented that the local "police is made up of young men of good family" and praised its decisions that "proves its efficiency". More generally, Henry described the [[Puerto Rican people]] as "an amiable and intelligent" group that were "not disloyal", though labeling them as "childlike" as well and arguing for [[suffrage]] to be restricted to certain [[property]] owners.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{citebook|pages=726-727|title=The American Monthly Review of Reviews (Volume 20)|editor=Shaw, Albert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QhZPcvcMz8C|date=1899|publisher=[[Review of Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island possessed approximately one million residents at that time. The [[Puerto Rican Campaign#Aftermath|aftermath of the Puerto Rican campaign]] notably included a 1917 measure affirming [[Puerto Rican citizenship|Puerto Ricans as legal U.S. citizens]]. Resistance to such [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] on the island failed to significantly slow down the process.&lt;ref name="Invaded"/&gt; As an [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated U.S. territory]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the U.S.]] and edifice of federal law has applied to multiple aspects of life in Puerto Rico from participation in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to use of the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]].&lt;ref name="Debbie"&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/national/are-puerto-ricans-american-citizens-yes-they-are/Q2oS9CRj0SUIAw2cBYjL7H/|title=Are Puerto Ricans American citizens? Yes, they are|date=September 26, 2017|accessdate=January 16, 2018|first=Debbie|last=Lord|publisher=[[AJC.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human migration|Migration]] to and from Puerto Rico initially took place in a social environment known as ''colonia''. Widespread [[industrialization]] spread across the continental U.S. throughout the early part of the 20th century while such development efforts didn't occur on the island in a large scale until the 1940s. That fact, coupled with the [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship status]] granted to Puerto Ricans, caused widespread movement after the island fell under American control, particularly with individuals going to major U.S. metropolises. This unfortunately led to the spread of crime related to immigrant neighborhoods as well. Estimates in 1933 found that over 1,500 criminals had recently purchased false Puerto Rican birth certificates, using them to enter [[New York (State)|New York]]. During the [[Great Depression]], the negative cultural stereotype associating working-class Puerto Ricans with the record highs in [[New York City]]'s crime rates brought out pervasive [[discrimination]] and [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name="Barkan"&gt;{{citebook|title=Immigrants in American History: Arrival, Adaptation, and Integration (Volume 1)|pages=1215-1224|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=2013|ISBN=9781598842197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AP7QCteb0o0C|editor=Barkan, Elliott R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luis_Munoz_Marin_sculpture.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Luis Muñoz Marín]] served as [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] during its 1950s to 1960s period of low crime rates and major development, earning honors such as this public [[sculpture]].]] 

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], a conflict in which [[Puerto Ricans in World War II|many native Puerto Ricans fought]], the [[U.S. federal government]] enacted multiple measures in partnership with local personnel under the title of [[Operation Bootstrap]] to finally transform the island into a [[Developed country|developed economy]]. However, despite considerable advances the territory struggled in fighting deeply-rooted problems. Pervasive [[unemployment]] in multiple areas remained a difficult challenge.&lt;ref name="Barkan"/&gt; Still, the island's general growth took place in an atmosphere of relatively low criminality— especially in terms of violent crime, with police efforts focused more on matters such as clandestine [[rum]] production than the likes of [[Bank robbery|bank robberies]]. The first modern such robbery didn't take place until after the 1950s ended.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;

Enactment of the controversial "[[war on drugs]]" that various agencies at different levels of the U.S. government have put into force, not just on the continental U.S. but elsewhere, has served as a major inflection point in [[History of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican history]]. The [[Government of Puerto Rico|territory's government]] has struggled to combat the illegal drug trade and the resulting crime since the mid-1970s, with increasing law enforcement efforts over multiple decades contributing to a [[cycle of violence]] in which both demand and supply of illegal substances remain considerable.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=On My Mind; Dispatch From the Drug War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/26/opinion/on-my-mind-dispatch-from-the-drug-war.html|accessdate=January 12, 2018|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=March 26, 1996|first=M.|last=Rosenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[recreational drug use]] was uncommon in Puerto Rico in the 1950s, it had markedly increased in the 1960s. By the following decade, said increase in usage, particularly among those under the age of 25, became a major concern in Puerto Rican society. Estimates found that up to seventy thousand islanders were [[Substance-related disorder|substance abusers]].&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt; A number of drug cartels discovered that Puerto Rico functioned as an efficient transfer point while trafficking contraband such as [[cocaine]] to the mainland United States, and that location of opportunity proved a magnet for [[organized crime]] over decade after decade.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt;

A major focus on crime and, specifically, drug-related problems arose in Puerto Rican politics out of those events. A 1975 survey found that 87% of respondents believed that violence had recently increased to a serious extent. Beside mentioning "[[vice]]", however, [[inflation]] and lack of [[employment]] attracted notice as causes of Puerto Rican crime as well.&lt;ref name="Griffith"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Griffith, Ivelaw L.|title=The political economy of drugs in the Caribbean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRSHDAAAQBAJ|year=2000|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|ISBN=9780230288966|pages=162–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puerto Rican crime since the 1980s ===

The existence of apparent '[[no man's land]]' areas, in which all manner of criminal activity could take place without any sort of police control, among particularly lower-class communities caused widespread concern. The use of [[Automatic firearm|automatic weapons]] and other arms to directly fight back against law enforcement became a particular problem as well. From 1993 to 1996, the government confiscated a total of 10,017 illegal firearms during their efforts. As well, the total number of murders in Puerto Rico nearly doubled from 1987 to 1994— increasing from 509 to 995, respectively. These trends received massive interest in the island's [[news media]].&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;

Perceptions about widespread crime triggered political turmoil and sustained pressure for the authorities to change their approaches, often involving a doubling-down of anti-drug crackdowns.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt; In the early 1990s, notably, law enforcement began specifically targeting [[White-collar worker|white collar]] drug users. A government chief of staff remarked that the police had witnessed "housewives who go to these [drug distribution] spots with their children in the car" and vowed to send a strong message.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Puerto Rico Enlists Mail Carriers in Drug  War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8GBVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oT4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2461,5066898&amp;dq=drug-war+puerto-rico&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 12, 2018|publisher=''[[The Beaver County Times]]''|date=June 23, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PedroRossello.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Pedro Rosselló]]'s tenure as [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] involved expanding different anti-crime measures, including targeted intervention of the National Guard in certain places.&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;.]]

The broad, strict approach of the island's government has been known as the "iron fist" ({{lang-es|mano dura contra el crimen}} or simply ''mano dura'').&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; In 1993, Governor [[Pedro Rosselló]] summed up government efforts by remarking, "They have incited a war, and they'll get it: let criminals know that our patience is gone" ({{lang-es|Nos han pedido guerra y guerra tendrán. Que lo sepa el criminal: nuestra paciencia se acabó.}}). During the first month of that year alone, a total of 104 murders took place. Specific changes in the anti-crime efforts have included assigning police officers with more weapons and targeted intervention of the National Guard in certain places.&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;

However, Puerto Rican efforts generally proved inadequate in stopping widespread drug trafficking in the latter part of the 20th century. The government had not just expanded employment levels and general funding for jailing and policing but also undergone a kind of [[militarization]] in its organization. Specific strategies included longer sentences for criminals, increased funding for officer equipment, and the construction of new prisons. From 1992 to 1998, the island's budget for policing approximately doubled. Yet progress remained mostly elusive.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosin"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Eileen, Rosin|editor2=Youngers, Coletta|title=Drugs and democracy in Latin America: The impact of U.S. policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAzNQGZ0AV4C|year=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|ISBN=9781588262547|pages=324–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion viewed the island's law enforcement situation in critical terms. In 1997, a major national poll found that a 68% majority believed that crime had gotten "much worse" over the previous five years.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;

In response to pervasive crime, local law enforcement attempted to integrate their efforts with U.S. federal agencies, especially with fighting trafficking in mind. The [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) both reinforced their presence on the island during the 1990s, setting up connections that remained years later.&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; Nonetheless, challenges such as [[police corruption]] have frequently complicated matters as different groups attempt to work with each other. The [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] (PRPD), the territory's primary law enforcement agency, has been tarnished by multiple scandals over officer misconduct up to and including outright criminal activity.&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

For example, one of the biggest law enforcement corruption busts in U.S. history took place in 2001 on the island. Twenty-nine police officers were caught on videotape drug trafficking thanks to an [[undercover operation]] initiated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Coming after authorities suspected local police of direct involvement in drug dealing, some officers even being bold enough to sell [[heroin]] from their squad cars, the bust additionally aimed to stop the illicit protection provided to certain cocaine dealers who shipped their contraband throughout the island. Known as [[Operation Lost Honor]], a total of thirty-two individuals were arrested in the case.&lt;ref name="Robles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ivan|last=Roman|title=Cops Sold Heroin From Squad Cars, Agents Say|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-08-30/news/0108300306_1_puerto-rico-corruption-heroin|publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''|date=August 30, 2001|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' journalist Ivan Roman stated that the bust "stunned a department already reeling from a series of" previous scandals.&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

As well, four Puerto Rican officers were arrested in 2008 by the FBI, including the director of the island's Extradition Division, for [[extortion]] as well as the distribution of both [[cocaine]] and heroin. The [[EFE World News Service]] stated in a report that the arrested "took advantage of the authority of their uniforms".&lt;ref name="EFE"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://business.highbeam.com/436103/article-1G1-190848842/fbi-arrests-4-puerto-rican-police-corruption|title=FBI arrests 4 Puerto Rican police for corruption|publisher=[[EFE World News Service]]|date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 2000, the PRPD kicked out a full one thousand officers due to a variety of criminal charges. Between 2003 and 2007, a hundred officers had been under investigation, with seventy-five others convicted under the jurisdiction of the [[United States district court|U.S. federal court system]].&lt;ref name="Robles"&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24466909.html|title=Police corruption undermines Puerto Rican drug war|publisher=''[[McClatchyDC]]''|first=Frances|last=Robles|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then [[Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police|Police Superintendent]] [[Pedro Toledo]] said in 2007, "We have had officers using police cars to escort drug dealers, and we have arrested officers selling weapons to undercover agents". He stressed that many officers did their best even while some had chosen to "violate their oath". The previous year, the violent death of trafficking kingpin Jose "Coquito" Lopez Rosario had spawned an investigation into the upper levels of the territory's government. The late kingpin's ties to three local senators extended to the point that one of the officials had brought him along during prison inspections.&lt;ref name="Robles"/&gt;

[[File:PRPD tactical.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Officers of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] (PRPD) using military-type [[firearm]]s outdoors in 2010.]]

The massive bust on Puerto Rican soil as a result of [[Operation Guard Shack]] generated international media coverage, with publications such as the American [[CNN]] and the British ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reporting on it.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/puertorico/8047530/FBI-in-unprecedented-raid-on-Puerto-Rico.html|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|title=FBI in 'unprecedented' raid on Puerto Rico|accessdate=January 18, 2018|date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culmination of a two-year FBI investigation into law enforcement corruption in the territory, the operation came to a head on October 6, 2010 with a series of pre-dawn raids. These led to over a hundred arrests, with those taken in including members of the PRPD, the [[Puerto Rico Corrections Department]] (PRCD), and even [[U.S. Army]] soldiers. The corrupt individuals had gone beyond providing security for drug traffickers to actively taking part in the deals. Officials charged a total of 133 individuals in the operation.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[FBI.gov]]|url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/oct10/sanjuan_100610.html|title=FBI - San Juan (Press Room)|accessdate=January 12, 2018|deadurl=yes|date=October 6, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007064701/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/oct10/sanjuan_100610.html|archivedate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2018|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/10/06/puerto.rico.arrests/index.html|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|title=FBI: Puerto Rico cops protected cocaine dealers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation began at 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. as sixty-five tactical groups spread across the territory, with [[FBI Hostage Rescue Team|Hostage Rescue Teams]] (HRT) and [[FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams|Special Weapons and Tactics Teams]] (SWAT) making the surprise arrests. Over one thousand agents of the FBI, many of them flown into the island secretly, conducted the massive raid. The organization labeled the operation as "likely the largest police corruption case in the FBI's history."&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; "The people of Puerto Rico deserve better," stated then [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]].&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Causes of police corruption include the relatively low [[wage]]s paid to regular officers. Then Police Association President Jose Rodriguez reported in 2007 that Puerto Ricans patrolling the streets made about twenty-six thousand dollars a year. Rodriguez additionally pointed out how local sergeants supervised thirty to thirty-five officers— in contrast to the average of ten in the continental U.S.&lt;ref name="Robles"/&gt;

Puerto Rico's murder rate dropped somewhat from the 1990s into the 2000s, yet violent crime remained significantly higher not just at a regional but also on an international scale. In the mid-2000s, the territory's troubles ranked it sixth worldwide in murders per capita.&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; In 2006, a total of 736 individuals were murdered in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Robles"/&gt;

In terms of the 2010s, the [[cycle of violence]] between criminals and law enforcement remained a severe challenge as conditions on the island evolved.&lt;ref name="Megan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ovalle"/&gt; A 2011 report by the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] into the Puerto Rican police concluded that the department was "broken in a number of critical and fundamental respects". While stating that many "hard working and dedicated" officers "serve the public with distinction under often challenging conditions", the investigators declared that the violations "uncovered are pervasive and plague all levels of" the department.&lt;ref name="Investigation"&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=[[Justice.gov]]|title=Investigation of the Puerto Rico Police Department|date=September 5, 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2018|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2011/09/08/prpd_exec_summ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of that year, Puerto Rico's experienced a spike in violent crime, with over a thousand people having been killed.&lt;ref name="Megan"&gt;{{citenews|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/puerto-rico-faces-surge-slayings-post-maria-article-1.3752263|first=Megan|last=Cerullo|date=January 11, 2018|title=Puerto Rico faces a surge in murders after Hurricane Maria|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ovalle"/&gt;

The [[Puerto Rican debt crisis]] of the mid-2010s has challenged the territory's civil society and resulted in hundreds of thousands of residents becoming unemployed. A subsequent wave of migration to the mainland from the island took place as well. A U.S. federal oversight board agreed to supervise the local government's financial administration in 2016, with some $74 billion of debt on the line. A ''[[Miami Herald]]'' article from 2017 stated that the crisis has left Puerto Rican "institutions in shambles".&lt;ref name="Ovalle"/&gt;

The aftermath of 2017's [[Hurricane Maria]], which devastated the island, created worries of yet another uptick in dangerous crime. [[Scarcity]] of basic resources as multiple areas go without [[electric power]] for days and days, relying on [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] [[Electric generator|generators]] to get by, increased the feelings of fear. In the first eleven days of 2018, thirty-two individuals died after criminal attacks. The extent to which such violence will cycle as the rebuilding takes place remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Megan"/&gt; Police Superintendent Hector Pesquera remarked in 2017 that the territory's crime problem had been mostly "out of sight, out of mind" to mainland Americans before the [[hurricane]] and no longer was.&lt;ref name="Ovalle"/&gt;

Nonetheless, individuals such as former Police Superintendent Miguel Pereira have observed that the large [[Profit (accounting)|profit margins]] associated with [[illegal drugs in Puerto Rico]], the high demand being driven by multiple social problems, will foster criminal acts no matter what law enforcement tries to do. Pereira provided a specific example in 2013 with how cocaine sold for about $15,000 a [[Kilogram|kilo]] on Puerto Rican streets while wholesale producer in areas of [[Colombia]] produced the substance for only $400 per kilo or so. Thus, Pereira publicly lamented, criminals could even lose a full 90% of their supply through anti-drug efforts and still receive significant returns; for instance, a mobster cleaned out of all but 100 of his initial 1,000 kilos could still manage to become a millionaire from those leftovers alone.&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;

== Debates and discussions ==
Commentators that have questioned the effectiveness of government anti-crime policy altogether include Gary Gutierrez, a [[criminal justice]] professor at the [[University of Turabo]],&lt;ref name="Megan"/&gt; and [[Jorge Rodriguez Beruff]],&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt; an academic and historian associated with the [[University of Puerto Rico]] (UPR).

In 2013, the former secretary of the [[Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] [[Zoé Laboy]] remarked publicly that "in general terms we have failed" ({{lang-es|en términos generales hemos fracasado}}) while arguing that some initiatives had resulted in good outcomes.&lt;ref name="NuevoDia"/&gt;

In the aftermath of 2017's [[Hurricane Maria]], ''[[Miami Herald]]'' journalist David Ovalle wrote,

{{quote|[T]he future for law enforcement on the island is bleak. The department has lost about 4,000 officers in the past five years and, because of the island's economic crisis, cannot count on fresh recruits anytime soon. Hundreds of U.S. Army soldiers, outside law-enforcement officers and private security guards are helping— temporarily— but robberies, murders and drug dealing have resumed at levels that would seem outrageous in mainland states but are tragically normal here.&lt;ref name="Ovalle"&gt;{{citenews|title=On the streets of San Juan, police struggle to rein in crime after Hurricane Maria|publisher=''[[Miami Herald]]''|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article179863816.html|first=David|last=Ovalle|date=October 20, 2017|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2018, Puerto Rican social activists began a renewed push for [[Statehood movement in Puerto Rico|statehood status]] in the atmosphere of increased post-hurricane media attention.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/11/15782544/puerto-rico-pushes-for-statehood-explained&lt;/ref&gt; The effects that closer ties and direct governmental integration between the island and the mainland would bring, particularly in terms of crime and social stability in general, are uncertain. Past efforts in favor of statehood by political figures such as [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] have previously amounted to relatively little.

The '''Cyprus Civil Society Awards''' were established in 2008 as part of a [[United Nations]]-funded project aiming to strengthen the role of civil society in Cyprus. One organization from the [[Greek Cypriot]] and one organization from the [[Turkish Cypriot]] community was each presented an award for their contribution to social development in six unique categories:

# education and culture
# environment
# gender issues
# health
# youth
# social inclusion

The awards have been established in order to promote reconciliation and facilitate interactions between the non-governmental organization between the two conflicting communities on the island. The awards are managed and presented by a consortium consisting of [http://www.mc-med.eu/ The Management Centre] from the Turkish Cypriot community, the [http://www.ngo-sc.org/ NGO Support Centre]&lt; from the Greek Cypriot community and INTRAC from the UK.

The '''Digor''' ([[Digor dialect]]: дигорон&lt;ref name=kambolov&gt;{{cite  book|last=Камболов|first=Тамерлан Таймуразович|title=Очерк истории осетинского языка|date=2006|publisher=Ир|location=Владикавказ|page=410|url=http://ironau.ru/kambolov-hist-o4erk62.html}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; - ''digoron'', ''pl.'': дигорæ, дигорæнттæ - ''digoræ'', ''digorænttæ''; [[Iron dialect]]: дыгурон - ''dyguron'', ''pl.'': дыгур, дыгурæттæ - ''dygur'', ''dygurættæ'') are a subgroup of the [[Ossetians]]. They speak the Digor dialect of the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] [[Ossetian language]], which in [[USSR]] was considered a separate language until 1937. Starting from 1932 it is considered just a dialect of Ossetian language. The speakers of the other dialect - [[Iron dialect|Iron]] - do not understand Digor, although the Digor usually understand Iron, as it was the official language of the Ossetian people and officially taught in schools. In the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian Census]] 607 Digors were registered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Census 2002: Population by ethnicity |url=http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/TOM_04_01.xls |accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229073920/http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/TOM_04_01.xls |archivedate=29 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian Census]] their number was only 223.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Census 2010: Population by ethnicity|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-01.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there are 100,000 speakers of the dialect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digor in Russia|url=http://legacy.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=20317&amp;rog3=RS|publisher=Joshua Project|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom declared themselves Ossetians. The Digor mainly live in [[Digorsky District|Digorsky]], [[Irafsky District|Irafsky]], [[Mozdoksky District|Mozdoksky]] districts and [[Vladikavkaz]], [[North Ossetia–Alania]], also in [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]].

== History ==

Among the tribal names given in "[[Ashkharatsuyts]]" there is an [[ethnonym]] ''ashtigor'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ru:Армянская география|url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Kavkaz/VII/Arm_Geogr/text1.phtml?id=2184|chapter=Азиатская Сарматия|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered to be the name of the Digors.&lt;ref name= abaev&gt;{{cite book|last=Абаев|first=Василий И.|title=Историко-этимологический словарь осетинского языка. Том I (А-К)|date=1958|publisher=Издательство Академии наук СССР|location=Москва - Ленинград|pages=379–380|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact, and other linguistic considerations, have led experts to believe that Digor dialect became separated from Proto-Ossetian during the [[Mongol conquests]].

In "[[Ashkharatsuyts]]" ''Ashtigors'' are given separately from ''Alans'' - the ancestors of present-day [[Ossetians]]. Also starting from the 18th century the [[ethnonym]] ''digor'' is widely used by travelers and in Russian official documents. Based on these facts, [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] [[USSR|Soviet]] linguist-[[Iranian studies|Iranist]] [[Vasily Abaev]] suppose that the Digors could be an iranized [[Circassians|Circassian]] tribe and the first part of the name - ''dig-'' can have the same roots with the Circassian [[endonym]] ''Adyge'' and ''-or'' can be just a prefix for [[Grammatical number|plurality]] as in many contemporary [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref name=abaev /&gt;

Digors make the majority of the Ossetians in [[Digoria]] - the western part of the [[North Ossetia–Alania]] ([[Digorsky District|Digorsky]] and [[Irafsky District|Irafsky]] districts) and in [[Kabardino-Balkaria]]. In the beginning of the 19th century some families from [[Digoria]] resettled in  [[Mozdoksky District]] and there are 2 large settlements of them.

[[Digoria]] was annexed to the [[Russian Empire]] quite late compared to the rest of [[Ossetia]].

The Digors were converted to [[Sunni Islam]] in the 17-18th centuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New-York|isbn=1-57958-133-1|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=digor%20people&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=digor%20people&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the influence of the neighboring [[Kabarday]] people who introduced Islam to them.&lt;ref name=ethndict&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=James S.

(see: ''[[Ossetians in Turkey]]'')

During [[World War II]], [[North Ossetia–Alania]] was occupied by German armies in 1942. While under Nazi occupation the Ossetians remained unmoved, after the Germans were forced out of the region the Muslim Digors, like other Muslim peoples, were accused of [[Turkic, Caucasian, Cossack, and Crimean collaborationism with the Axis powers|Collaboration with the Germans]] and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union#Ethnic operations|deported to Central Asia]]. Estimates say 50% of the Digors died during deportation. Their reputation was rehabilitated in the mid 1950s, and they were allowed to return to their homelands.&lt;ref name=ethndict /&gt;&lt;ref name=stateless&gt;{{cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World.

The Digors currently living in the [[Irafsky District]] of [[North Ossetia–Alania]] and in [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] are predominantly Muslim.

'''Distribution''' (or '''place''') is one of the four elements of the [[marketing mix]]. Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for the consumer or business user that needs it. This can be done directly by the producer or service provider, or using indirect channels with distributors or [[intermediaries]]. The other three elements of the [[marketing mix]] are [[Product (business)|product]], [[pricing]], and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].

Decisions about distribution need to be taken in line with a company's overall strategic [[Vision statement|vision]] and [[Mission statement|mission]]. Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of [[strategic planning]]. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall distribution channel should add value to the consumer.

==Definition==

Distribution is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that products reach target customers in the most direct and cost efficient manner. In the case of services, distribution is principally concerned with access.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, J., ''Distribution Channels: Understanding and Managing Channels to Market,'' Kogan Page, 2011, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although distribution, as a concept, is relatively simple, in practice distribution management may involve a diverse range of activities and disciplines including: detailed logistics, transportation, warehousing, storage, inventory management as well as channel management including selection of channel members and rewarding distributors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong,G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Sydney, Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 297-394&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution strategies==
Prior to designing a distribution system, the planner needs to determine what the distribution channel is to achieve in broad terms.  The overall approach to distributing products or services depends on a number of factors including the type of product, especially perishability; the market served; the geographic scope of operations and the firm's overall mission and vision. The process of setting out a broad statement of the aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.

[[File:Target2398.jpg|thumb|In an intensive distribution approach, the marketer relies on chain stores to reach broad markets in a cost efficient manner.]]

Strategically, there are three approaches to distribution:&lt;ref&gt;Wright, R., ''Marketing: Origins, Concepts, Environment,'' Holborn, London, Thomson Learning, 1999, pp 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Mass distribution'' (also known as ''intensive distribution''): When products are destined for a mass market, the marketer will seek out intermediaries that appeal to a broad market base. For example, snack foods and drinks are sold via a wide variety of outlets including supermarkets, [[convenience store]]s, [[vending machine]]s, [[cafeteria]]s and others. The choice of distribution outlet is skewed towards those than can deliver mass markets in a cost efficient manner.

* ''Selective distribution:'' A manufacturer may choose to restrict the number of outlets handling a product. For example, a manufacturer of premium electrical goods may choose to deal with department stores and independent outlets that can provide added value service level required to support the product. Dr Scholl orthopedic sandals, for example, only sell their product through pharmacies because this type of intermediary supports the desired ''therapeutic'' positioning of the product. Some of the prestige brands of cosmetics and skincare, such as Estee Lauder, Jurlique and Clinique, insist that sales staff are trained to use the product range. The manufacturer will only allow trained clinicians to sell their products.

* ''Exclusive distribution:'' In an exclusive distribution approach, a manufacturer chooses to deal with one intermediary or one type of intermediary. The advantage of an exclusive approach is that the manufacturer retains greater control over the distribution process. In exclusive arrangements, the distributor is expected to work closely with the manufacturer and add value to the product through service level, after sales care or client support services. The most common type of exclusive arrangement an agreement between a supplier and a retailer granting the retailer exclusive rights within a specific geographic area to carry the supplier's product.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/exclusive-distribution.html&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Summary of strategic approaches to distribution'''
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Approach
! Definition
|-
| Intensive distribution
| The producer's products are stocked in the majority of outlets.&lt;ref name="kotler" /&gt;  This strategy is common for mass produced products such as basic supplies, snack foods, magazines and soft drink beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/intensive-distribution/ |title=Intensive Distribution: Definition, Strategy &amp; Examples |date=June 26, 2015 |publisher=Inevitable Steps |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Selective distribution
| The producer relies on a few intermediaries to carry their product.&lt;ref name="kotler" /&gt;  This strategy is commonly observed for more specialised goods that are carried through specialist dealers, for example, brands of craft tools, or large appliances.
|-
| Exclusive distribution
|The producer selects only very few intermediaries.&lt;ref name="kotler" /&gt;  Exclusive distribution occurs where the seller agrees to allow a single retailer the right to sell the manufacturer's products.  This strategy is typical of luxury goods retailers such as Gucci.
|}

===Push vs pull strategy ===

In consumer markets, another key strategic level decision is whether to use a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;Varey, E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channels and intermediaries==
[[File:Wholesale fish market at Haikou New Port - 14.jpg|thumb|A wholesale fish market at Haikou, New Port]]

Distribution of products takes place by means of channels to become available on markets, in stores or in webshops. Channels are sets of interdependent organizers (called [[intermediaries]] or distributors) involved in making the product available for consumption to end-user.&lt;ref name=kotler&gt;Kotler, Keller and Burton, 2009. Marketing Management, Pearson Education Australia: Frenchs Forest&lt;/ref&gt; This is mostly accomplished through merchant retailers or wholesalers, or in international context by importers. In certain specialist markets, agents or brokers may become involved in distribution channel.  

Typical intermediaries involved in distribution include:

* '''Wholesaler:''' A merchant intermediary who sells chiefly to retailers, other merchants, or industrial, institutional, and commercial users mainly for resale or business use. Wholesalers typically sell in large quantities. (Wholesalers, by definition, do not deal directly with the public).&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wholesaler&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Retailer:''' A merchant intermediary who sells direct to the public. There are many different types of retail outlet - from hypermarts and supermarkets to small, independent stores.
* '''Agent:''' An intermediary who is authorised to act for a principal in order to facilitate exchange. Unlike merchant wholesalers and retailers, agents do not take title to goods, but simply put buyers and sellers together. Agents are typically paid via commissions by the principal. For example, travel agents are paid a commission of around 15% for each booking made with an airline or hotel operator.
* '''Jobber:''' A special type of wholesaler, typically one who operates on a small scale and sells only to retailers or institutions. For example, rack jobbers are small independent wholesalers who operate from a truck, supplying convenience stores with snack foods and drinks on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam- Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jobber&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channel design==

[[File:Distribution-levels.jpg|thumb|Types of distribution systems]]

A firm can design any number of channels they require to reach customers efficiently and effectively.  Channels can be distinguished by the number of intermediaries between producer and consumer.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt; If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a ''zero-level'' distribution system or [[direct marketing]]. A ''level one'' (sometimes called ''one-tier'') channel has a single intermediary. A ''level two'' (alternatively a ''two-tier'') channel has two intermediaries, and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.

==Channel mix==
In practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; a direct sales force may call on larger customers may be complemented with agents to cover smaller customers and prospects. When a single organisation uses a variety of different channels to reach its markets, this is known as a ''multi-channel'' distribution network. In addition, online retailing or [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] is leading to [[disintermediation]], the removal of intermediaries from a supply chain.  Retailing via smartphone or m-commerce is also a growth area.

==Managing channels==
The firm's marketing department needs to design the most suitable channels for the firm's products, then select appropriate channel members or intermediaries.  An organisation may need to train staff of intermediaries and motivate the intermediary to sell the firm's products.  The firm should monitor the channel's performance over time and modify the channel to enhance performance.

===Channel motivation===
[[File:London, Harrods (2).JPG|thumb|Harrod's food hall, a major retailer in London]]
To motivate intermediaries the firm can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt;  On the other hand, negative actions may be necessary, such as threatening to cut back on margin, or hold back delivery of product. Care must be exercised when considering negative actions as these may fall foul of regulations and can contribute to a public backlash and a public relations disaster.

===Channel conflict===
Channel conflict can arise when one intermediary's actions prevent another intermediary from achieving their objectives.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt; Vertical channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel, and horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, P.E., "George E Brenkert - Marketing Ethics," book review, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,'' 24 May, 2009 http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/marketing-ethics/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends in distribution==

===Channel switching===

[[File:Inside a new officeworks store.jpg|thumb|right|The advent of "category killers", such as Australia's Officeworks, has contributed to an increase in channel switching behaviour.]]

Channel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching from one type of channel intermediary to a different type of intermediary for their purchases. Examples include switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues and e-commerce providers; switching from grocery stores to convenience stores or switching from top tier department stores to mass market discount outlets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/5598/research.pdf|title=Explaining Consumers' Channel-Switching Behavior Using the Theory of Planned Behavior|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of [[Category killer]]s (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal or statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research, "How Vital are Vitamins:, Research Finding No. 5503, Media Release, 14 March 2014 online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5503-how-vital-are-vitamins-201403252241&lt;/ref&gt;

For the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found at cheaper prices, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping).&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, J., McCorkle, D.E. "A Consumer Model for Channel Switching Behavior", ''International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management'', Vol. 30, no. 4, pp.179 - 185&lt;/ref&gt; As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.&lt;ref&gt;Dholakia1, R.R., Zhao, M. and Dholakia, N., "Multichannel retailing: A case study of early experiences.," ''Journal of Interactive Marketing'', vol. 19, March, 2009, pp 63–74, DOI: 10.1002/dir.20035&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer value===

The emergence of a [[service-dominant logic]] perspective has focussed scholarly attention on how distribution networks serve to create customer value and to consider how value is co-created by all the players within the distribution chain, including the value created by customers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, D. J., and Mentzer, J. T., "Striving for Integrated Value Chain Management Given a Service-dominant Logic for Marketing," In R. F. Lusch and S. L. Vargo (Eds.), ''The Service-dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialog, Debate, and Directions,'' Armonk, New York, ME Sharpe, 2006, pp 139–149; Tokman, M., and Beitelspacher, L. S., "Supply Chain Networks and Service-dominant Logic: Suggestions for Future Research," ''International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management,'' Vol. 41, No. 7, pp 717-726; Yazdanparast, A., Manuj, I., and Swartz, S. M., ''Co-creating Logistics Value: A Service-Dominant Logic Perspective," ''International Journal of Logistics Management,'' Vol. 21, no. 3, 2010, pp 375-403.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on value-creation is contributing to a change in terminology surrounding distribution processes; "distribution networks" are often termed ''value-chains'' while "distribution centres" are often termed ''customer fulfillment centres.'' For example, the retail giant Amazon, which utilises both direct online distribution alongside bricks and mortar stores, now calls its despatch centres "customer fulfillment centres".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J., "Amazon is Coming to Australia, and if these Projections are Correct, it’s Arrival is Going to be Massive," ''News.com,'' 29 April, 2017; Pearce, L., “Amazon: Everything You Need to Know about its Plans for Australia,” ''Huffington Post,'' 22 August, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; Although the term, "customer fulfillment centre" has been criticised on the grounds that it is a [[neologism]], its use is becoming increasingly mainstream as it slowly makes its way into introductory marketing textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, "Placement: Customer Value Fulfilment," Chapter 10 in Gary Armstrong, Stewart Adam, Sara Denize, and Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disintermediation===

Disintermediation occurs when manufacturers or service providers eliminate intermediaries from the distribution network and deal directly with purchasers. Disintermediation is found in industries where radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional distributors. The widespread public acceptance of online shopping has been a major trigger for disintermediation in some industries. Certain types of traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 315-316&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doris Marie Payne''' (born October 10, 1930 in [[Slab Fork, West Virginia]]) is an American convicted jewel thief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimspub.riversidesheriff.org/cgi-bin/iisinfo.acu?bkno=201349338G |title=Inmate Information System |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Payne was born in Slab Fork, West Virginia to a coal miner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-85-year-old-jewel-thief-arrested-at-upscale-mall-in-atlanta-2015-10|title=The 85-year old daughter of an illiterate coal miner has been an international jewel thief for more than 6 decades|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
Payne's career as an international jewel thief spans six decades, with a criminal record dating back to 1952. Her ''[[modus operandi]]'' is to enter jewelry stores posing as a well-to-do woman, typically looking for a diamond ring. Using her charm, she would engage the clerk, asking to see an assortment of items. Eventually, she would "cause the clerk to forget" just how many items were outside the case; and, at some point, she would leave with one or two pieces.

Her crimes have spanned six decades. She has been arrested many times; she is a [[career criminal]].&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/10/31/83-year-old-jewel-thief-arrested-again/UPI-28831383255794/ |title=Doris Marie Payne, 83-year-old jewel thief arrested in CA |agency=United Press International |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Angie [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10072306/ "75-year-old jewel thief looks back"] November 20, 2005. MSNBC. Retrieved July 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne is most noted for stealing a 10-carat diamond ring, valued at $500,000 (US), from [[Monte Carlo]] in the 1970s. She fled to [[France]], but was detained in [[Nice]] and later [[Extradition|extradited]] back to Monte Carlo, where she was held for nine months before being released, as the Monégasque authorities were unable to locate the stolen gem.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Goldie [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/23/america-s-best-jewel-thief-is-an-85-year-old-woman.html America’s Best Jewel Thief Is An 85-Year-Old Woman] ''Daily Beast''. January 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne was arrested in [[Ohio]] in the 1980s after she escaped from federal custody during a hospital visit.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gerber |first=Marisa |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-doris-payne-court-20131031,0,1668338.story |title='Notorious' career jewel thief Doris Payne, 83, arrested again |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, January 22, 2010, Payne was arrested in [[Costa Mesa, California]] for removing the tags from a $1,300 [[Burberry]] [[trench coat]] from a [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] store and subsequently leaving the store with the coat.&lt;ref&gt;Blankstein, Andrew.

January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, at the age of 80, Doris was sentenced in a [[San Diego]] court to 16 months in prison for stealing a 1&amp;nbsp;[[Carat (mass)|carat]] diamond ring.

On October 29, 2013, Payne, age 83, was arrested on [[Felony#United States|felony]] [[larceny]] [[Criminal charge|charges]] for stealing a $22,500 diamond-encrusted ring in [[Palm Desert, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-1101-doris-payne-20131101,0,3445776,full.story |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Notorious jewel thief Doris Payne, 83, makes news in Palm Desert |date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jae |first=Kyler |url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/83-Year-Old-Jewel-Thief-Arrested-After-Jewelry-Shop-Heist-230144781.html |title=Jewel Shop Worker: 83-Year-Old Alleged Thief 'Was Excellent at What She Did' |publisher=NBC Los Angeles |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payne pled guilty. On April 30, 2014, she was sentenced to two years in prison, followed by two years on [[parole]], and was ordered to stay away from jewelry stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbco.com/news/030030-woman-83-has-rap-sheet-dating-back-to-1952/ "Woman, 83, has ‘rap sheet’ dating back to 1952"]. ''AM 1540 WBCO''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was released three months later due to [[prison overcrowding]]. In July 2015 she was reportedly stealing again and was believed to have stolen a $33,000 (US) ring, although this has not been proven yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/notorious-84-year-old-jewel-thief-is-at-it-again-1718906749 |title=Notorious 84-Year-Old Jewel Thief Is At It Again |work=Jezebel |first=Marie |last=Lodi |date=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 2015 she was caught on security cameras putting [[Christian Dior]] earrings valued at $690.00 in her pocket at an [[Atlanta, Georgia]] [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] store. She was arrested and charged with shoplifting by Officers from the [[Atlanta Police Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/famous-jewel-thief-doris-payne-arrested-article-1.2412679|title=Famous jewel thief Doris Payne arrested|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne has openly spoken about her crimes and has used at least 20 [[alias name|aliases]], at least ten [[Social Security number|social security numbers]] and at least nine dates of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carey |first=Amanda |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/02/elderly-international-jewel-thief-doris-payne-wants-to-stay-in-jail/ |title=Elderly International Jewel Thief, Doris Payne, Wants to Stay in Jail |publisher=ABC News |date=February 10, 2012 |access-date=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is alleged in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], that on July 11, 2015, Payne visited a jewelry store at [[SouthPark Mall (Charlotte, North Carolina)|SouthPark Mall]]. After she left, store employees realized a diamond ring valued at $33,000 was missing from a showcase. [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department]] did not issue an official statement or [[All-points bulletin|APB]], but local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WSOC-TV]] obtained a copy of an email sent to all area jewelers regarding the alleged crime and alerting them to be on the lookout. An arrest warrant was issued for Payne in August 2015, by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg sheriff's department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/08/03/doris-payne-warrant-charlotte/31075369/ |title=Doris Payne arrest warrant issued in Charlotte |work=Desert Sun |date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Atlanta, Georgia, on December 13, 2016 she was again arrested on [[larceny]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-doris-payne-arrest-20161214-story.html|title=Octogenarian jewelry thief Doris Payne arrested again in Atlanta|last=Branson-Potts|first=Hailey|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2017 she was arrested for stealing $86.22 worth of merchandise from an Atlanta area Wal-Mart, while wearing the ankle bracelet from her previous arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jewel-thief-doris-payne-charged-walmart-theft-n784061|title=Jewel Thief Doris Payne Charged With Walmart Theft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
There is a documentary film about her life, entitled ''The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne'', in which Payne describes in detail many of her crimes, from the earliest thefts in her youth, up to her arrest in 2011, at age 80, for stealing a diamond ring from a Macy's department store. The trial for this crime is chronicled in the documentary, and her last interview in the film takes place in prison, as she was convicted of the crime. However, updates during the credits inform the audience that she had since been released, only to commit, and be convicted of, another jewelry theft soon after at age 83.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/movies/the-life-crimes-of-doris-payne-about-a-real-jewel-thief.htm|title='The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne', About a Real Jewel Thief|work=The New York Times|first=Nicolas|last=Rapold|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorispaynefilm.com/dorispaynefilm.com/The_Film.html|title=The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne|website=DorisPayneFilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hidden-camera scenario on the show ''[[What Would You Do?

A film of Payne's life is being developed by [[Codeblack Films]]. Actress [[Tessa Thompson]] is set to portray Payne in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Tessa Thompson to Star as Doris Payne in Jewelry Heist Movie|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/tessa-thompson-doris-payne-jewelry-heist-movie-1202697523/|work=Variety|date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Cosmos Prize''' was established in 1993, commemorating [[Expo '90]] in [[Osaka]], Japan. The objective of the prize was to develop the basic concept of [[Expo 90]], "The Harmonious Coexistence between Nature and Mankind" and is awarded annually by the Commemorative Foundation for the International Garden and Greenery Exposition, Osaka, Japan, 1990 (Expo '90 Foundation).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/english/index.html|title= Expo '90 Foundation|publisher= Expo '90 Foundation|accessdate = 21 January 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The prize, which may be awarded to an individual or team, consists of a commendation, a [[medallion]] and a monetary reward, currently 40 million [[Japanese yen|yen]]. It is awarded during a ceremony held in each autumn, at which the individual or team delivers a commemorative lecture and takes part in a [[symposium]] held in their honor.

The name of the prize, "Cosmos," refers to the ''[[Cosmos (plant)|Cosmos]]'' flower that bloomed during the Expo and the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''kosmos'' meaning "universe in harmony." The prize was first awarded in 1993, to the then Director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], Sir [[Ghillean Prance]].

== Subject matter ==
The prize shall be awarded for outstanding research work and/or achievement which promote the philosophy, “The Harmonious Coexistence between Nature and Mankind.” The Prize shall also illuminate research and/or achievements that use not only analytical and reductive methods, but also advocate a global outlook and show integrated, long-term vision. The prize recognizes achievements in the natural and social sciences, humanities and the arts.

== Selection procedure ==
The Cosmos Prize Committee [http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/iinkai_e.html] will form the Screening Committee of Experts which will screen
candidates recommended by the designated recommenders. Based on the results of the screening, the Cosmos Prize Committee will decide the Prizewinner.

[[File:Leg rowers on Intha Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Inle Lake]] with its leg-rowing Intha people is a major tourist destination in [[Burma]] (Myanmar).]]

The '''Intha''' ({{MYname|MY=အင်းသားလူမျိုး|MLCTS=ang: sa: lu. myui:}}, {{IPA-my|ɪ́ɴðá lùmjóʊ|IPA}}; lit. "sons of the lake") are members of a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] ethnic group living around [[Inle Lake]].  They speak an archaic dialect of [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and are believed to have come from the [[Dawei]] area for some unnatural reasons and random parts of [[China]] for good reasons.  They often live on [[Inle Lake]] and support themselves through the tending of vegetable farms on floating gardens.  Also, the Intha are known for their leg-rowing techniques and are traditionally [[Burmese Buddhism|Buddhists]]. Some values sources show that unsurprisingly all Inthas have full [[Han Chinese]] DNA and blood genetics.

The people of Inle Lake (called Intha), some 70,000 of them, live in four cities bordering the lake, in numerous small villages along the lake's shores, and on the lake itself. The entire lake area is in [[Nyaung Shwe]] township. The population consists predominantly of Intha, with a mix of other [[Shan people|Shan]], Taungyo, [[Pa-O]] (Taungthu), [[Danu people|Danu]], Kayah, Han Chinese(Highest), Danaw and [[Bamar]] ethnicities. Most are devout [[Buddhists]] and live in simple houses of wood and woven [[bamboo]] on stilts; they  are largely [[Subsistence|self-sufficient]] farmers.

Most transportation on the lake is traditionally by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with 'long-tail' motors that are necessary because of the usual shallowness of the lake. Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved for the reason that the lake is covered by reeds and floating plants making it difficult to see above them while sitting. Standing provides the rower with a view beyond the reeds.  However, the leg rowing style is only practiced by the men. Women row in the customary style, using the oar with their hands, sitting cross legged at the stern.

'''The Itinerant Artist Project''' (IAP) is a [[painting]]-based project with strong public outreach and [[performance art]] dimensions, devised and undertaken by Western NY landscape painter Jim Mott. The IAP is based on the principles of gift exchange discussed in [[Lewis Hyde]]'s seminal work, ''the Gift''. The project involves locating (by various means) a series of voluntary hosts around the USA, touring by car from host to host, and at each stop painting several small location paintings, offering one in exchange for the [[hospitality]] provided (room, board and occasional conversation for 2–5 days).&lt;ref&gt;See Will Paint for Food, by Ray Sikorsky, Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 16, 2007:
[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1016/p20s01-ussc.html?page=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by a concern that the spheres of art and everyday life have become too disconnected, to the impoverishment of both, the IAP experiments with radically resituating the individual artist's painting practice, usually into the households of strangers. In [[collaboration]] with his hosts, Mott sets up a [[non-commercial]] but supportive context within which to operate. Mott sees this as a temporary but valuable break with social and professional convention—on the understanding that money, while ultimately necessary, distorts the relations between art and [[imagination]], artist and public.&lt;ref&gt;The life and times of a cross-country artist, by Melissa F. Pheterson, Rochester Magazine,  
[http://www.rocmen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080423/ROCMEN/80423010]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the project explores the function of art as gift and the effect of a [[gift economy]] on creative productivity.

Since its beginning in the spring of 2000, there have been fifteen IAP tours, covering over 25,000 miles, with stops at approximately 125 locations in 35 states. In a total of thirteen months on the road, the IAP has generated over 550 small [[landscape painting]]s (oil on panel).

The IAP uses painting as a means of promoting, enhancing and celebrating direct human interaction in a virtual age. Although the project's focus is the integration of art into everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jimmott.com&lt;/ref&gt; primarily through situating the artist in other people's households for a sustained period, recent tours have involved spontaneous bartering, including the trading of art for meals, commercial lodging—and a speeding ticket in Missoula, MT.&lt;ref&gt;Cross Country Painter - an American Story with Bob Dotson, NBC Today Show, Jan. 2, 2008: [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/22472628/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kees Boeke (1939).jpg|right|thumb]]
'''Cornelis Boeke''' (25 September 1884, [[Alkmaar]] – 3 July 1966, [[Abcoude]]), usually known as '''Kees Boeke''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] reformist [[educator]], [[Quaker]] [[missionary]] and [[pacifist]]. He is best known for his popular essay/book ''[[Cosmic View]]'' (1957) which presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale, and which inspired several films.

Boeke tried to reform education by allowing  the children to contribute their ideas. He called this process [[sociocracy]] and regarded schools as  workshops, with pupils as workers, and teachers as co-workers.  Based on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] ideas, he wanted the  children  to respect  [[democracy]].  In 1926, he founded a school  in [[Bilthoven]], which he led until 1954. As a child, the later Dutch [[Queen Beatrix]]  attended the school.

==Biography==
Kees Boeke grew up in a [[Mennonite]] family in Alkmaar. He studied [[architecture]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]]. As a student, he spent a year in [[England]], where he met the Quakers. He became a Quaker and attended [[Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre]], a college in [[Selly Oak]], [[Birmingham]]. There, he found inspiration in [[Bournville]], the garden village which the [[Cadbury]] family (owners of the chocolate factory) had built for their workers. He met and married Beatrice (Betty) Cadbury. The couple went to [[Syria]] in 1912 as Quaker missionaries. In 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], they returned to England. They became active in peace work, the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] having come into being in 1914 through [[Henry Hodgkin]]. In 1915 Boeke traveled to [[Berlin]], where he met [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]], with whom Hodgkin had been working at the outbreak of war. Boeke began to speak publicly in England: "The Germans are our brothers; God did not create man that he might kill; the war will find its quickest end when all soldiers lay down their weapons." He was deported from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and returned to the Netherlands. His family followed; there they lived in Bilthoven, near [[Utrecht]]. Their home soon became a pacifist centre. Later in the Second World War Boeke took part in the underground Dutch resistance movement against the same Germans, he called brothers before. This was, however, in line with his ideas of anti-authority and his disapproval of war and prosecution.

After the First World War, Boeke erected a large conference centre in Bilthoven, which he called "Brotherhood House." The first international peace conference took place there between 4 and 11 October 1919. Present at the conference were [[Leon Revoyne]], [[Mathilda Wrede]], [[Leonard Ragaz]], [[Pierre Ceresole]], as well as Hodgkin and Schultze. Boeke and Ceresole became the secretaries of this movement, which initially called itself "Christian International", later the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]]. Together with [[Helene Stöcker]],  and [[Wilfred Wellock]], they founded the [[Service Civil International]] and in 1921 "Paco" (the [[Esperanto]] word for peace), which in 1923 became [[War Resisters' International]] (WRI).

Kees and Betty Boeke considered war to be rooted in the entanglement of the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]]. As Betty was a Cadbury, she inherited large shares in her family's firm. She transferred this money to various charitable organizations such as the Quaker-Help Organisation in Russia in 1920. Later, she gave the shares to a trust for the workers of the Cadbury factory. For a while, the Boekes abstained from using money, so as to avoid contributing to the state — since public funds are also spent on weapons. They never used public transport, nor did they pay postage, tolls, or taxes. As a result, they were imprisoned several times. On one occasion the Dutch tax authorities auctioned off the estate in order to recover taxes. [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] was in attendance at the auction, and purchased Kees' favorite violin, only to return it to him on the spot. Boeke supported his family by working in Utrecht in a building association which he had founded; he did not work as an architect (which was his training), but as a simple worker.
 
In the late 1920s Boeke increasingly withdrew from international peace movements. Believing he could build a better society through educating children, he started a school called "De werkplaats" (the workshop). He founded his school in 1926 when all private schools, including the [[Montessori school]] his children attended, started receiving an equal amount of money per child from the state, to which he objected.
[[File:Kees Boeke (1946).jpg|thumb|Kees Boeke with [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] (right) in 1946]]
His school, which uses [[Montessori method|Maria Montessori's methods]], extended by Boeke's own educational ideas, became nationally known; even the Dutch queen Juliana sent her daughters there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/40041487/ (Dutch) De school van Beatrix.] [[Andere Tijden]], 25 september 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been hugely influential for its creative way of making the students co-responsible for their own curriculum, together with the teachers; many students who failed in regular schools have blossomed at "De werkplaats", but on the other hand many talented children could not reach a high level in this school.

Co-responsibility in school did not mean a freewheeling life at "the Werkplaats". Children had to perform tasks such as cleaning the school, growing vegetables and fruits, and helping with lunch cooking. Boeke's notion of sociocracy was, in effect, a secular implementation of the Quaker ideals applied to education in such a way that children were treated as adults, and were on  first-name terms with their teachers.

Boeke wrote a major book on education[what is its title, etc.?!]. One of his last works was [[Cosmic View]] (New York 1957). He died in 1966 in the company of his family.

==Legacy==
Boeke's system of [[sociocracy]] survives today and was expanded upon in the work of a well-known student of the school, Dr. [[Gerard Endenburg]], who in the 1960s and '70s developed a governance and decision-making methodology by the same name while directing the [[Endenburg Electrotechniek]] company.

Boeke's essay/book [[Cosmic View]] (1957) presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale. It inspired several films:

* ''[[Cosmic Zoom]]'' (1968) produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] 
* ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' (1968; new version in 1977) by [[Charles and Ray Eames]] 
* The [[IMAX]] film ''[[Cosmic Voyage]]'' (1996) produced for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].
* "Superpowers of Ten" (2013), a theater piece produced by [[Andrés Jaque]] and performed at the Lisbon Triennial, the Chicago Architectural Biennial, [[Museo Jumex]] in Mexico and [[ZKM]] in Karlsruhe 
''Cosmic View'' is mentioned as an inspiration by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of a [[video game]], ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/14/games Cosmic view, inspiration for a video game.] The Guardian, 14 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Texto del Monumento a La Raza en Sevilla.jpg|thumb|upright|Text by [[Rubén Darío]] ("{{lang|es|Salutación del optimista}}", 1905) inscribed on the {{lang|es|[[:commons:Category:Monumento a La Raza, Sevilla|Monumento a la Raza]]}} in [[Sevilla]] (1929). Translation: 'Illustrious, most fruitful races, fecund blood of [[Hispania]], fraternal spirits, lumious souls, greetings!'&lt;!--Inclitas razas ubérrimas, sangre de Hispania fecunda,/espíritus fraternos, luminosas almas, salve !--&gt;]] 
[[File:Biblioteca del Senado de la Provincia - 52 - Por una raza fuerte, laboriosa, pacifista y soberana.jpg|thumb|upright|Propaganda poster by the Argentine government (1947) advocating a "strong, industrious, peaceful and sovereign race".]]
The term was, in origin, short for {{lang|es|la raza española}}&lt;!--Do not capitalize there. Spanish doesn't work that way.--&gt; ('the [[wikt:español#Spanish|Spanish]] race'), introduced by [[Faustino Rodríguez-San Pedro y Díaz-Argüelles]] in 1913 with his proposal for a secular {{lang|es|[[Fiesta de la raza española]]}} ('Spanish-race Festival') on October 12.

Beginning in the 1920s, the term {{lang|es|raza española}} was criticized, and the alternative term {{lang|es|Hispanidad}} ('Hispanicity')  was proposed by [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], based on a suggestion by Zacarías de Vizcarra.
Alternatively  [[Mexico|Mexican]] writer [[José Vasconcelos]] proposed the term {{lang|es|[[la raza cósmica]]}} ('the Cosmic Race'), in an essay by the same title, as describing the {{lang|es|raza iberoamericana}} ('[[Ibero-America|Ibero-American]] race') in 1925. He described this "Cosmic Race" as the end product of gradual [[racial mixing]] that was already underway in the former Spanish Empire. Vasconcelos thus replaced the designator {{lang|es|española}} with {{lang|es|cosmica}} in order to imply that racial miscegenation in the former Spanish Empire would lead to the emergence of a completely new "Ibero-American" race.

The shortened name of {{lang|es|Día de la Raza}} (now often, though not always, with a capitalized ''R'') was used in 1939, when the feast day was celebrated in Zaragoza in combination with a special devotion to the {{lang|es|Virgen del Pilar}} ([[Our Lady of the Pillar]]).  Chilean foreign vice-secretary Germán Vergara Donoso commented that the "profound significance of the celebration was the intimate inter-penetration of the homage to the Race and the devotion to Our Lady of the Pillar, i.e. the symbol of the ever more extensive union between America and Spain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=es |first=Gustavo |last=Bueno Sánchez |url=http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a224.htm |title=Día de la Hispanidad |work=Filosofia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Franco]] wrote a novel under the [[pen name]] "Jaime de Andrade" which was turned into the film [[Raza (film)|''Raza'']] of 1944. It celebrates idealized "Spanish national qualities", and exemplifies this usage of {{lang|es|raza española}} as referring specifically to Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] heritage. In [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]], {{lang|es|la Raza}} emphasizes an [[Amerindian]] or {{lang|es|[[mestizo]]}} heritage, or it may express [[Latino]] identity{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ({{lang|es|la Raza}} being taken as short for {{lang|es|la raza iberoamericana}}, following Vasconcelos). A {{lang|es|Monumento a la Raza}} ('Monument to the Race') was inaugurated in [[Mexico City]] in 1940. [[La Raza station]] station in Mexico City was inaugurated in 1978.

The term {{lang|es|[[Chicano]]}} (feminine {{lang|es|Chicana}}) likewise arose in the early 20th century as a designation of [[Mexicans]]. In the 1960s to 1970s, the term became associated with [[Chicano Movement|a movement]] of [[Mexican-American]] [[identity politics]] activism.
In the United States, the terms {{lang|es|la Raza}} and {{lang|es|Chicano}} subsequently became closely associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alaniz |first1=Yolanda |last2=Cornish |first2=Megan |title=''Viva La Raza'': A History of Chicano Identity and Resistance |location=Seattle |publisher=Red Letter Press |date=2008 |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Hispanic groups in the United States still use the term.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"&gt;{{cite web |last=Romero |first=Dennis |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/dear-trump-fans-la-raza-is-not-a-racist-term-7003572 |title=Dear Trump Fans: La Raza Is Not a Racist Term |date=June 7, 2016 |work=Los Angeles Weekly |access-date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Raza Unida Party]] was active as a political party representing Mexican-American racial identity politics in the 1970s. The Hispanic advocacy organization [[National Council of La Raza]] was formed in 1968 (renamed to [[UnidosUS]] in 2017).

''[[La Raza (newspaper)|La Raza]]'' was the name of a Chicano community newspaper edited by Eliezer Risco in 1968.  Risco was one of the "LA Thirteen", a group of young Mexican-American men who were political activists identified by the government as being leaders of a Brown Power movement in Los Angeles.  Raul Ruiz joined the staff of ''La Raza'' while a student at California State University Los Angeles. Other community newspapers of the time were ''Inside Eastside'' and ''Chicano Student Movement''. Ruiz, a key journalist in the movement, eventually became the editor of ''La Raza''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904133300 |title=The Chicano Generation: Testimonios of the Movement |last=García |first=Mario T. |publisher=University of California Press |date=2015 |isbn=9780520286023 |location=Berkeley, California |page= |oclc=904133300}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the most influential Chicano-movement publication in Southern California. The publications filled a void: for the most part, there had heretofore been no media coverage of any type for the Brown Power movement and its activities. The movement's own print-media publications were really the only forum that the Brown Power movement had to keep party members informed about what was going on in the movement across the Los Angeles area. The lack of the mainstream media coverage contributed to silencing the movement and its activities, unlike with the [[Black Power]] movement; the latter received much more coverage, which contributed to that movement's success in spreading their message and growing their movement (despite not all of the coverage being positive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124026434 |title=Youth, Identity, Power: The Chicano Movement |last=Muñoz |first=Carlos |date=2007 |publisher=Verso |isbn=9781844671427 |edition=rev. and expanded |location=London |page= |oclc=124026434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Trivale Forest in [[Pitești]]''' - There is a legend about a maiden, daughter of a rich landowner, who loved a poor servant of her father. Her father found an old rich man for her to marry, but during the wedding day, she ran with the servant in the forest. Her father found them and killed her lover and then dacapitated her. It is generally accepted that the two scary things about the forest are: the decapitated ghost of the bride and the people going in the forest to do satanic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;http://adevarul.ro/locale/pitesti/legendele-mireselor-moarte-casabantuita-padurea-trivale-1_5513ca91448e03c0fdec20a5/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mongolian Amateur Radio Society''' ('''MARS''') (in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], '''Монголын радио сонирхогчдын холбоо''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Mongolia]].  Key membership benefits of MARS include the sponsorship of [[amateur radio operating award]]s and radio [[contesting|contests]].&lt;ref name="mars"&gt;Mongolian Amateur Radio Society (2008). [http://www.qsl.net/jt1kaa/ Mongolian Amateur Radio Society] official web site.  Retrieved Aug. 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the spring of 2008, MARS purported to be a successor organization to the [[Mongolian Radio Sport Federation]], and supplied the [[International Amateur Radio Union]] with documentation regarding a name change and updated organizational constitution.  The name change from Mongolian Radio Sports Federation to Mongolian Amateur Radio Society was recognized by the IARU Region I Executive Committee at its April, 2008 meeting.&lt;ref name="iaru_april_2008"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union Region 1 (2008). [http://www.crk.cz/FILES/EC2008.PDF Executive Committee Meeting 5-7 April 2008]. ¶7. Member Society Issues: Mongolia.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to that meeting, the IARU determined that the name change documentation was not authorized by the Mongolian Radio Sport Federation, which had in fact not changed its name or constitution, and continued to exist as a separate organization.  The IARU currently recognizes the MRSF as the IARU member society representing Mongolia.&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008).

The '''National Core for Neuroethics''' at the [[University of British Columbia]] was established in August 2007, with support from the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], the Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, the [[Canada Research Chair]]s program, the UBC Brain Research Centre and the UBC Institute of Mental Health.&lt;ref name="neuroethics.ubc.ca"&gt;http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founded by [[Judy Illes]] and [[Peter Reiner]], the Core studies [[neuroethics]], with particular focus on ethics in [[neurodegenerative disease]] and [[regenerative medicine]], international and cross-cultural challenges in brain research, [[neuroimaging]] and [[ethics]], the neuroethics of [[Human enhancement|enhancement]], and [[personalized medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/research.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Core's major research projects are focused on the use of drugs and devices for [[neuroenhancement]], ethics in neurodegenerative disease and regenerative medicine research, brain research, neuroimaging in the private sector, and the ethics of personalized medicine, among others.  Members of the Core also lead initiatives aside from their research projects.

Considerable attention has been given to the Core by both the scholarly and non-academic media, with the Core featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/world/asia/15brainscan.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "India's novel use of brain scans in courts is debated]. New York Times, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=October 2009}} the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Illes, J. [http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=b663ac5e-c773-4d64-afd5-9c9c8ecbb7ec "The perilous pursuit of perfection: Neuroscience has been used to provide athletes a mental edge, but it raises ethical issues."] The Vancouver Sun, 8 September 2008. [an editorial by the Core's leader]&lt;/ref&gt; on the ''[[Canwest]] Global Newshour'',&lt;ref&gt;Post-traumatic stress drug. The News Hour, Global BC, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Retention's the thing. Science, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others. As an effort to engage the public in neuroethics discussion, the Core has recently started an online blog.&lt;ref&gt;http://neuroethicscanada.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-conceptual art''' describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the [[conceptual art]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  These subsequent initiatives have included the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], United States neo-conceptualists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and the [[Young British Artists]], notably [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is also a [[Stuckism]] counter-movement and criticism from the 1970s conceptual art group [[Art and Language]].

==History==

[[File:Neon-bolognini.JPG|thumb|right|170 px|[[Maurizio Bolognini]]'s ''Programmed Machines'' (''Sealed'')  hundreds of computers are programmed to generate endless flows of random images which nobody would see. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many of the concerns of the "conceptual art" movement proper have been taken up by many contemporary artists since the initial wave of conceptual artists. While many of these artists may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, [[digital art]], and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[computer art]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art]]. Many critics and artists may speak of conceptual aspects of a given artist or art work, reflecting the enduring influence that many of the original conceptual artists have had on the art world.

==New York City==
The idea of neo-conceptual art (sometimes later termed [[post-conceptual art]]) in the United States was clearly articulated by [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] (working as a team called: Collins &amp; Milazzo) in the early 1980s in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/arts/art-now-on-view-new-work-by-freelance-curators.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ART; Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators]&lt;/ref&gt; when they brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists through their copious writings and curatorial activity. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of neo (or post) conceptual art; one that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DAN+CAMERON+ON+Collins+%26+Milazzo.-a057475774] DAN CAMERON ON Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what some of the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together: artists such as [[Ross Bleckner]], [[James Welling]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jonathan Lasker]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Robert Gober]] and [[Saint Clair Cemin]].

==Moscow==
The [[Moscow Conceptualists]], in the 1970s and 80s, attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]]. The central figures were [[Ilya Kabakov]] and [[Komar and Melamid]]. The group also included [[Eric Bulatov]] and [[Viktor Pivovarov]].

==London==
The [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work was described at the time as neo-conceptual,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lash and Celia Lury, ''Global Culture Industries: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p211. {{ISBN|0-7456-2483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression. Charles Harrison, a member of the conceptual art group [[Art and Language]] in the 1970s, criticizes the neo-conceptual art of the 1990s as conceptual art "without threat or awkwardness"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p29. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "vacant" prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p241. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists associated with neo-conceptualism in the UK include [[Martin Creed]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Bethan Huws]], [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]], [[Simon Starling]] and [[Douglas Gordon]].

==Notable events==
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the UK==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the rise to prominence of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs) after the 1988 ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'' show, curated by Damien Hirst, and subsequent promotion of the group by the [[Saatchi Gallery]] during the 1990s, generated a media backlash, where the phrases "conceptual art" and "neo-conceptual" came to be terms of derision applied to much [[contemporary art]]. This was amplified  by the [[Turner Prize]] whose more extreme nominees (most notably Hirst and Emin) caused a controversy annually.

[[File:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo (3).jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "Death of Conceptual Art" coffin demonstration, 2002]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002 deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube Demo 2002"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 19 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They staged yearly demonstrations outside the Turner Prize.

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]] (an art school graduate) denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/01/nart01.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed  April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA collection.

'''Paul Fillunger''' (June 25, 1883 in Vienna &amp;ndash; March 7, 1937 in Vienna) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical engineer]].

Raised in a family of engineers, he studied at the [[Technical University of Vienna|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Vienna]] and took a position in the [[Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways|state-owned railway company]] in 1906. In 1908 he completed a PhD and then went to teach mathematics, [[machine industry]] and then mechanics at the [[University of Vienna]].

Fillunger pioneered the study of saturated ground and was made famous by an article published in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wl52330244074778/ |title=Development of porous media theories — A brief historical review
|first=R. |last=De Boer |journal=Transport in Porous Media | date=October  1992 |volume=9 |number=1-2 |pages=155–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Der Auftrieb in Talsperren |journal=Österreichische Wochenschrift für den öffentlichen Baudienst |volume=19 |year=1913 |pages=532, 567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neuere Grundlagen für die statische Berechnung von Talsperren |journal=Zeitschrift des Österreichischen Ingenieur - und Architektenvereins |volume=23 |year=1914 |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He discovered the difference in behaviors of the effective and general stresses in samples of ground, opening the way for further research. He is considered to be a pioneer of the theory of liquid-saturated [[Porous medium|porous solids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boer|first=Reint|title=The Engineer And The Scandal: A Piece Of Science History|edition=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9783540231110|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fillunger's theories put him in heated conflict with [[Karl von Terzaghi]], who is often referred to as "father of [[soil mechanics]]", whom Fillunger was accused of slandering. The University blamed Fillunger, who then committed suicide by opening the gas jets in the bathroom&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WQDXM5pgx-AC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Paul+Fillunger%22+suicide&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WYlqxihv4s&amp;sig=3PFL6e-fnmU_vUV7hzZlPzjn-Rc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=19_-UNWrCKf00QGg54DwDQ&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAg Dimitrios Kolymbas - ''Constitutive Modelling of Granular Materials'' p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; with his wife.

[[File:World Gold Production 1900-2014.png|thumb|World mined gold production, 1900-2014. Data from USGS]]

{{update|date=June 2010}}
'''Peak gold''' is the date at which the maximum rate of global [[gold]] extraction is reached. According to [[Hubbert peak]] theory, after the peak, the rate of production [[resource depletion|declines]] until it approaches zero. Unlike [[petroleum]], which is destroyed in use, gold can be reused and recycled.

==Supply and demand==
World gold [[supply and demand|demand]] (defined in terms of total consumption excluding central banks) in 2007 was 3,519 tonnes.&lt;ref name=gwc0811301&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.research.gold.org/supply_demand/
|title=Supply and Demand Statistics
|publisher=[[World Gold Council]]
|date=November 2008
|accessdate=2009-02-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold demand is subdivided into central bank reserve increases, jewellery production, industrial consumption (including dental), and investment (bars, coins, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, etc.)

The supply of gold is provided by mining, official sales (typically gold by central banks), de-hedging (physical delivery of metal sold months before by mining companies on terminal markets) and old gold scraps. The total world supply of gold in 2007 was 3,497 tonnes.&lt;ref name=gwc0811302&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold production (mining) does not need to make up for gold demand because gold is a reusable resource. Currently, yearly [[gold mining]] produces 2% of the existing above-ground gold which is 158,000 tonnes (as of 2006).&lt;ref name=gfms070415&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, gold mining produced 2,400 tonnes of gold, official gold sales close to 300 tonnes, and dehedging (physical delivery of metal sold months before by mining companies on terminal markets)  close to 500 tonnes.&lt;ref name=gfms090115&gt;

==Timing of peak production==
World mined gold production has peaked four times since 1900: in 1912, 1940, 1971, and 2001, each peak being higher than previous peaks. The latest peak was in 2001, when production reached 2,600 metric tons, then declined for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Chaise, [http://news.goldseek.com/Dani/1273767071.php World gold production 2010], 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Production started to increase again in 2009, spurred by high [[gold price]]s, and achieved record new highs each year from 2011 through 2015, when production reached 3,100 tonnes. Early estimates of 2016 gold production indicate that it was flat to 2015 production, at 3,100 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;US Geological Survey,  [https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/ Gold], Mineral commodity summaries, Jan. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Barrick Gold|Barrick]] CEO Aaron Regent claimed that global production had peaked in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/6546579/Barrick-shuts-hedge-book-as-world-gold-supply-runs-out.html Barrick shuts hedge book as world gold supply runs out]; Telegraph Media Group, November 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrick's production costs have been "trending down" despite this peak, reaching $465 per ounce. In 2006, with gold at $650 per ounce, [[Roland Watson]] claimed that gold production had peaked in 2001 due to falling exploration in the 1990s, when gold prices were low.  He predicted that higher prices and new technologies would boost gold production to higher levels in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seekingalpha.com/article/16607-in-defense-of-peak-gold-evidence-gold-production-peaked-in-2001 In Defense of Peak Gold: Evidence Gold Production Peaked in 2001]; Seeking Alpha, September 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2012, [[Natural Resource Holdings]] CEO [[Roy Sebag]] wrote a report entitled "2012 World Gold Deposit Ranking"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrh.co.il/i/pdf/NRH_Research_2012%20World_Gold_Deposits.pdf 2012 World Gold Deposit Ranking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429122247/http://www.nrh.co.il/i/pdf/NRH_Research_2012%20World_Gold_Deposits.pdf |date=April 29, 2013 }}; NRH Research, July 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that gold production would peak between 2022-2025 due to the markedly lower grades and remote locations of the remaining known undeveloped deposits. "Consequently, the guaranteed depletion in the existing production mix coupled with a more realistic introduction of new mines into the mix (as opposed to our theoretical 
tomorrow scenario) makes it clear that barring multiple high-grade, multi-million ounce 
discoveries each year, a significant increase in gold production is unlikely. Moreover our 
calculations point towards gold production peaking at some point 
between 2022 and 2025 assuming the 90mm ounce per year figure is maintained."

Charles Jeannes, the CEO of [[Goldcorp]], the world's largest gold miner by market capitalization, stated in September 2014 that Peak Gold would be reached in either 2014 or 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining.com/goldcorp-we-have-hit-peak-gold-48704/ Goldcorp: We have hit PEAK gold]; Mining.com, September 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Whether it is this year or next year, I don't think we will ever see the gold production reach these levels again," he claimed. "There are just not that many new mines being found and developed."

'''Dominicans''' ({{lang-es|Dominicanos|links=no}}) are people who are ethnically associated with the [[Dominican Republic]]. ''Dominican'' was historically the [[demonym|name]] for the inhabitants of the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]], and was retained after the nation's independence. The majority of Dominicans reside in the Dominican Republic, although there is also a large Dominican diaspora, mainly in the [[United States]] and [[Spain]]. The population of the Dominican Republic in 2016 was estimated at 10.2 million by the National Bureau of Statistics of the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name=ENI-2017/&gt;. Most Dominicans are a [[Mulatto]]&lt;ref name=CIAFB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Field Listing - Ethnic groups |accessdate=2008-06-15 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the mix between European settlers; mainly from [[Spain]]; and African slaves brought through the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. The original [[Taino]] population of the island was absorbed quickly into the general population and represents a small fraction of the general genetic composition.

==Name==
Historically the [[Dominican Republic]] was known as [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], the name of its [[Santo Domingo|present capital]] and its patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]]. Hence the residents were called "Dominicanos" (Dominicans), which is the adjective form of "Domingo", and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country "La República Dominicana". It was often referred to as the "Republic of San Domingo" in English language 19th Century publications.

The first recorded use of the word "Dominican" is found in a letter written by [[Philip IV of Spain|King Phillip IV]] of [[Spain]] in 1625 to the inhabitants of the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]]. In this letter, which was written before the arrival of [[France|French]] settlers on the Western side of the island, the King congratulates the ''Dominicans'' for their heroic efforts in defending the territory from an attack by a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fleet. This letter can be found today in the "Archivo General de Indias" in [[Seville|Seville, Spain]].

Another name that's been commonly used is "Quisqueyans". In the [[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|national anthem of the Dominican Republic]] the author uses the poetic term ''Quisqueyans'' instead of ''Dominicans''. The word "Quisqueya" is a derivative from a native tongue of the [[Taino]] Indians which means, "Mother of the Lands." It is often used in songs as another name for the country.

== Overview==
The Dominican Republic was the site of the first European settlement in the Western Hemisphere. The culture held in common by most Dominicans is referred to as mainstream [[Culture of the Dominican Republic|Dominican culture]], a mixture of different influences and customs having origins predominately in a European cultural basis, largely derived from the traditions of Spain, especially from [[Andalusia]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. The country has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as [[France]] and [[Portugal]]. The [[Dominican Republic]] has also been highly influenced by [[Afro-Dominicans|African culture]], and [[Taino|Native Taino]] being a significant minority. Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that the Dominican gene pool is on average predominantly [[Europe|European]], with a significant Sub-Saharan African, Guanche and Indigenous American substrate, the latter two originating in the indigenous people of the Canary Islands and Dominican's pre-Hispanic Taíno inhabitants, respectively.

=== Pre-European history ===
{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}
Prior to European colonization the inhabitants of the island where the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan-speaking]] [[Taíno]], a seafaring people who moved into Hispaniola from the north-east region of South America, displacing earlier inhabitants,&lt;ref name=LunaC&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Luna Calderón|first=Fernando|url=http://www.kacike.org/CalderonEspanol.pdf|title=ADN Mitocondrial Taíno en la República Dominicana|trans-title=Taíno Mitochondrial DNA in the Dominican Republic|language=es|date=December 2002|issn=1562-5028|issue=Special|journal=Kacike|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001151311/http://www.kacike.org/CalderonEspanol.pdf|archivedate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; c. AD 650. The native Tainos divided the island into several chiefdoms and engaged in farming, fishing,&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563569_7/Dominican_Republic.html |title=Dominican Republic |encyclopedia=Encarta |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114170306/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563569_7/Dominican_Republic.html |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;as well as hunting, and gathering.&lt;ref name=LunaC/&gt; 

The Spaniards arrived in 1492. Columbus and his crew were the first [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] to encounter the Taíno people. Columbus described the native Taínos as a physically tall, and well-proportioned people, with a noble character. After initially amicable relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief [[Anacaona]] of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs [[Guacanagaríx]], [[Guamá]], [[Hatuey]], and [[Enriquillo]]. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492 the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to warfare and intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that at least 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Ferbel Azcarate|first=Pedro J.|url=http://www.kacike.org/FerbelEnglish.pdf|title=Not Everyone Who Speaks Spanish is from Spain: Taíno Survival in the 21st Century Dominican Republic|journal=KACIKE: The Journal of Caribbean Amerindian History and Anthropology|date=December 2002|issue=Special|issn=1562-5028|accessdate=September 24, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040617195321/http://www.kacike.org/FerbelEnglish.pdf|archivedate=June 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many present-day Dominicans have significant Taíno ancestry.&lt;ref name=Guitar&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Guitar|first=Lynne|url=https://archive.org/details/KacikeJournal|title=Documenting the Myth of Taíno Extinction|date=December 2012|journal=Kacike|issn=1562-5028|issue=Special|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Martínez Cruzado|first=Juan Carlos|url=https://consortia.si.edu/sites/default/files/MartinezCruzado2002_0.pdf|title=The Use of Mitochondrial DNA to Discover Pre-Columbian Migrations to the Caribbean: Results for Puerto Rico and Expectations for the Dominican Republic|journal=Kacike|date=December 2002|issn=1562-5028|issue=Special|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European colonization ===
[[File:Juan pablo duarte diez.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Juan Pablo Duarte, founding father of the Dominican Republic, leader of the ''Trinitarios'' and propeller of the war for Dominican independence.]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived on the island in December 5, 1492, during the first of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it ''La Española'' due to its diverse climate and terrain which reminded him of the [[Spain|Spanish landscape]]. In 1496 [[Bartholomew Columbus]], Christopher's brother, built the city of [[Santo Domingo]], Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the "[[New World]]." The colony thus became the springboard for the further [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of America]] and for decades the [[captaincy general of santo domingo|headquarters]] of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere.

The southern city of Santo Domingo served as a hub for military expeditions pushing across to the American mainland. In 1501, the colony also began to import African slaves. By the mid-17th century the French sent colonists and [[privateers]] to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to it's strategic position in the region. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. 

On April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambushed and sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back. The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.

By the middle of the 18th century, the population was bolstered by European emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. After 1700, with the arrival of new Spanish colonists, the African slave trade resumed. However, as industry moved from sugar to cattle ranching, racial and caste divisions became less important, eventually leading to a blend of cultures—Spanish, African, and indigenous—which would form the basis of national identity for Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=P.

==Genetics and ethnicities==
The genetic makeup of the Dominican Republic's population is estimated to be approximately 60% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], 30% [[Sub-Saharan African|Black African]], and 10% [[Taino|Native American]] on average according to recent genealogical DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Montinaro, Francesco |displayauthors=etal |title=Unravelling the hidden ancestry of American admixed populations |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pmc=4374169 |doi=10.1038/ncomms7596 |pmid=25803618 |date=24 March 2015 |at=See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4374169/bin/ncomms7596-s2.xlsx Supplementary Data]}}&lt;/ref&gt; European and native components are highest in the north-central region ([[Cibao]]), while the African input is higher in the southeastern plain, and generally in coastal areas.

[[File:Dominican-people-cibao-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Dominican Republic people in the town of [[Moca, Espaillat|Moca]].]]
Most Dominicans fall within three major ethnic racial groups. The last census conducted in the country estimated the population as 73% [[mixed race]] (mulatto and mestizo), 16% [[White Dominicans|white]], and 11% [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|black]]. Other groups in the country include the descendants of [[Western Asia|West Asia]]ns—mostly [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]. A smaller, yet significant presence of [[East Asia]]ns (primarily [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) can also be found throughout the population. Dominicans are also composed of [[Sephardic Jews]] that were exiled from [[Spain]] and the Mediterranean area in 1492 and 1497,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Inquisition.html |title=The Exile of the Jews due to the Spanish Inquisition|accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with other migrations dating the 1700s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0005_0_05317.html |title=Jews migration in the 1700's|accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the [[second world war]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/sosua.html |title=Jews migration to the Dominican Republic to seek refuge from the Holocaust|accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; contribute to Dominican ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschichteinchronologie.ch/am-M/santo-domingo/EncJud_juden-in-Santo-Domingo-ENGL.html|title=A partial, brief summary of Jews in the Dominican Republic|accessdate=2013-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626162005/http://www.geschichteinchronologie.ch/am-M/santo-domingo/EncJud_juden-in-Santo-Domingo-ENGL.html|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblediscovered.com/jewish-hebrew-people-in-the-world/dominican-republic-jews-2/|title=Dominican Republic-Jews|accessdate=2013-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001221327/https://www.biblediscovered.com/jewish-hebrew-people-in-the-world/dominican-republic-jews-2/|archivedate=2013-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Sephardic Jews still presently reside in [[Sosúa]] while others are dispersed throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ancestry_of_Dominican_Republic.PNG|title=Municipal Map of the Dominican Republic showing the Historical Ancestry|accessdate=2013-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819155046/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ancestry_of_Dominican_Republic.PNG|archivedate=2013-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of known Jews (or those with genetic proof of Jewish ancestry and/or practiced Jewish customs/religion throughout generations) are close to 3,000; the exact number of Dominicans with Jewish lineages aren't known, however, because of the inter-mixing of the Jews and Dominicans over a period of more than five centuries.

===Immigration in the 20th and 21st centuries===
In the twentieth century, many [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Arab]]s (primarily from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]), [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and to a lesser degree [[Koreans]] settled in the country, working as agricultural laborers and merchants. Waves of Chinese immigrants, the latter ones fleeing the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese Communist]] [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), arrived and worked in mines and building railroads. The current [[Ethnic Chinese in the Dominican Republic|Chinese Dominican]] population totals 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dr1.com/articles/chinese.shtml |title=The Chinese Community and Santo Domingo's Barrio Chino |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab]] community is also rising at an increasing rate.

In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Dominica]], [[Antigua]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Montserrat]], [[Tortola]], [[St. Croix]], [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[Martinique]], and [[Guadeloupe]]. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of [[San Pedro de Macorís]] and [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]], they have a population of 28,000. There is an increasing number of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] immigrants in and around [[Santo Domingo]]; they are believed to number at about 10,000. Before and during World War II 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican Republic, and many of their descendants live in the town of [[Sosúa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CCNY Jewish Studies Class to Visit Dominican Village that Provided Refuge to European Jews During World War II | publisher=City College of New York | url=http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/pr/Sosua-Jewish-Studies.cfm | accessdate=2007-05-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510103344/http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/pr/Sosua-Jewish-Studies.cfm | archivedate=2011-05-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide, there are an estimated 100 [[Jews]] left.&lt;ref name="jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php |title=Joshua Project People-in-Country Profile |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration from Europe and the United States is at an all-time high.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} 82,000 [[United States|Americans]] (in 1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aca.ch/amabroad.pdf |title=American Citizens Living Abroad by Country |accessdate=2008-10-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019014426/http://www.aca.ch/amabroad.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 40,000 Italians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mclink.it/com/inform/art/08n01933.htm |title=* INFORM *; Giovani italiani nel Centro America e Caraibi |accessdate=2008-10-20 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804163550/http://www.mclink.it/com/inform/art/08n01933.htm |archive-date=2012-08-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,900 French,&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; 1,400 [[British people|Britons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/caribbean.stm |title=Special Reports: Brits Abroad |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=BBC News |date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 800 Germans.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

In the second half of 2017, a second survey of foreign population was conducted in the Dominican Republic. The total population in the Dominican Republic was estimated at 10,189,895, of which 9,341,916 were Dominicans with no foreign background. According to the survey, the majority of the people with foreign background were of Haitian origin (751,080 out of 847,979, or 88.6%), breaking down as follows: 497,825 were Haitians born in Haiti, 171,859 Haitians born in the Dominican Republic and 81,590 Dominicans with a Haitian parent. Other main sources of foreign-born population were Venezuela (25,872), the United States (10,016), Spain (7,592), Italy (3,713), [[Two Chinas|China]] (3,069), Colombia (2,642), Puerto Rico (2,356), and Cuba (2,024).&lt;ref name=ENI-2017/&gt;

==Emigration==

===United States===

{{Main|Dominican American}}
The first recorded person of Dominican descent to migrate to what is now known as the [[United States]] was sailor-turned-merchant [[Juan (Jan) Rodriguez|Juan Rodriguez]]. He arrived on [[Manhattan]] in 1613 from his home in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], which makes him the first non-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] person to spend substantial time in the island. He also became the first Dominican, the first [[Latino]] and the first person with [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] (specifically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ancestry to settle in what is present day [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voicesofny.org/tag/juan-rodriguez/|title=– Juan Rodriguez|website=www.voicesofny.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominican emigration to the United States continued throughout the centuries. Recent research from the [[CUNY|CUNY Dominican Studies Institute]] has documented some 5,000 Dominican emigrants who were processed through [[Ellis Island]] between 1892 and 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cunydsi.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/preview-of-research-findings-october-22-dominican-immigration-through-ellis-island.html|title=Preview of Research Findings October 22: Dominican Immigration Through Ellis Island|website=CUNY Dominican Studies Institute News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the twentieth century there were three significant waves of immigration to the [[United States]]. The first period began in 1961, when a coalition of high-ranking Dominicans, with assistance from the [[CIA]], assassinated General [[Rafael Trujillo]], the nation's military dictator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf |title=Justice Department Memo, 1975 |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of his death, fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies, and political uncertainty in general, spurred migration from the island. In 1965, the United States began a military [[Operation Power Pack|occupation of the Dominican Republic]] and eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain American visas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2546161 International Migration in the Dominican Republic]; Thomas K. Morrison, Richard Sinkin; International Migration Review, Vol. 16, No. 4, Special Issue: International Migration and Development (Winter, 1982), pp. 819-836; {{doi|10.2307/2546161}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals. In the early 1980s, unemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to the third and largest wave of emigration from the island nation, this time mostly from the lower-class. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high, facilitated by the social networks of now-established Dominican communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/channel/libraries/socialstudies/9_12/weir/background.html|title=Social Studies In Action: Migration From Latin America|website=www.learner.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the United States, significant numbers of Dominicans have also settled in [[Spain]] and in the nearby U.S. territory of [[Puerto Rico]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Spanish}}
The culture of the Dominican Republic, like its Caribbean neighbors, is a blend of the cultures of the European colonists, African slaves, and Taíno natives. Spanish is the official language. Other languages, such as English, French, German, Italian, and Chinese are also spoken to varying degrees. European, African, and Taíno cultural elements are most prominent in food, family structure, religion, and music. Many Arawak/Taíno names and words are used in daily conversation and for many foods native to the Dominican Republic.

===Language===
Spanish is the predominant language in the [[Dominican Republic]]; the local dialect is called [[Dominican Spanish]], it closely resembles [[Canarian Spanish]], and borrowed vocabularies from the Arawak language.&lt;ref name=HenriquezUrenna&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henríquez Ureña|first1=Pedro|authorlink1=Pedro Henríquez Ureña|title=El Español en Santo Domingo|date=1940|publisher=Instituto de Filología de la Universidad de Buenos Aires|location=Buenos Aires|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools are based on a Spanish educational model, with English and French being taught as secondary languages in both private and public schools. [[Haitian Creole]] is spoken by the population of Haitian descent. There is a community of about 8,000 speakers of Samaná English in the Samaná Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly-enslaved [[African Americans]] who arrived in the 19th century. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country's economic ties with the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in the Dominican Republic}}

The Dominican Republic is 80% Christian, including 57% [[Roman Catholic]] and 23% [[Protestantism|Protestant]],&lt;ref name="PewResearch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion in Latin America: Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/11/Religion-in-Latin-America-11-12-PM-full-PDF.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2018|language=en|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Recent but small+scale immigration, as well as proselytizing, has brought other religions, with the following shares of the population: [[Spiritist]]: 1.2%,&lt;ref name=religiousfreedom/&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]: 1.1%,&lt;ref name="ldsnewsroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/dominican-republic |title=Country Profiles &gt; Dominican Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017060008/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/dominican-republic |archivedate=October 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist: 0.10%, [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]: 0.1%,&lt;ref name=religiousfreedom/&gt; Islam: 0.02%, Judaism: 0.01%, [[Chinese folk religion]]: 0.1%,.&lt;ref name="religiousfreedom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/nationprofiles/Dominican_Republic/rbodies.html |title=Religious Freedom Page |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617175719/http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/nationprofiles/Dominican_Republic/rbodies.html |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholicism was introduced by Columbus and Spanish missionaries. Religion wasn't really the foundation of their entire society, as it was in other parts of the world at the time, and most of the population didn’t attend church on a regular basis. Nonetheless, most of the education in the country was based upon the Catholic religion, as the [[Bible]] was required in the curricula of all public schools. Children would use religious-based dialogue when greeting a relative or parent. For example: a child would say "Bless me, mother", and the mother would reply "May God bless you" &lt;sup&gt;{es}ven diga&lt;/sup&gt;.
The nation has two patroness saints: ''Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia'' (Our Lady Of High Grace) is the patroness of the Dominican people, and ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' (Our Lady Of Mercy) is the patroness of the Dominican Republic.
The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late nineteenth century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of support programs. During the same time, the Protestant [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement began to gain support. Religious tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has been rare.

There has always been religious freedom throughout the entire country. Not until the 1950s were restrictions placed upon churches by Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was even put into place, with his assassination.

Judaism appeared in the Dominican Republic in the late 1930s. During World War II, a group of Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of [[Sosúa]]. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haggerty |first=Richard |title=Dominican Republic - Religion |website=Dominican Republic: A Country Study |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |year= 1989 |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/33.htm |accessdate=2006-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}
Dominican cuisine is predominantly made up of a combination of Spanish and African influences over the last few centuries. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries, but many of the names of dishes are different. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and ''mangú'' (mashed, boiled plantain). For heartier versions, these are accompanied by deep-fried meat (typically Dominican salami) and/or cheese. Similarly to Spain, lunch is generally the largest and most important meal of the day. Lunch usually consists of rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, pork, or fish), beans, plantains, and a side portion of salad. "La Bandera" (literally, The Flag), the most popular lunch dish, consists of meat and red beans on white rice. There is a famous soup "Sancocho" a typical national soup made with seven kind of variety of meats.

Dominican cuisine usually accommodates all the food groups, incorporating meat or seafood; rice, potatoes, or plantains; and is accompanied by some other type of vegetable or salad. However, meals usually heavily favor starches and meats over dairy products and vegetables.&lt;!--no mention of fruits--&gt; Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs and spices sautéed to bring out all of the dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad).

It includes the use of the ''tambora'' (Dominican drum), accordion, and ''[[güira]]''. Its [[Syncopation|syncopated beats]] use [[Latin percussion]], [[brass instruments]], [[Bass guitar|bass]], and [[piano]] or [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]]. Between 1937 and 1950 the merengue music was promoted internationally, by some Dominicans groups like, Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron Los Reyes del Merengue, Joseito Mateo and others. Later on it was more popularized via television, radio and international media, well-known merengue singers include singer/songwriter [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Milly Quezada]] and Chichí Peralta. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 90s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', c along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and [[Florida]] have contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness", or "bitter music", or blues music), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.

[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the Fania All Stars, played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.

Particularly among the young, a genre that has been growing in popularity in recent years in the Dominican Republic is Dominican rap. Also known as ''Rap del Patio'' ("yard rap") it is rap music created by Dominican crews and solo artists. Originating in the early 2000s with crews such as [[Charles Family]], successful rappers such as [[Lapiz Conciente]], Vakero, [[Toxic Crow]], and [[R-1 (singer)|R-1]] emerged. The youth have embraced the music, sometimes over merengue, merengue típico, bachata, as well as [[salsa music|salsa]], and, most recently, [[reggaeton]]. Dominican rap differs from reggaeton in the fact that Dominican rap does not use the traditional [[Dem Bow]] rhythm frequently used in reggaeton, instead using more hip hop-influenced beats. As well, Dominican rap focuses on urban themes such as money, women, and poverty, similarly to American rap.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Fashion===
In only seven years, the [[Dominican Republic]]'s [[fashion week]] has become the most important event of its kind in all of the Caribbean and one of the fastest growing fashion events in the entire Latin American fashion world. The country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Diseño de Altos de Chavón, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design.

World-famous fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] and then worked with the house of [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] in Paris. Then by 1963, de la Renta had designs carrying his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcax.com/story/7036793/fashion-oscar-de-la-renta-dominican-republic Fashion: Oscar de la Renta (Dominican Republic)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116205803/http://www.wcax.com/story/7036793/fashion-oscar-de-la-renta-dominican-republic |date=2013-01-16 }} WCAX.com – Retrieved October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica de la renta"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/764644/Oscar-de-la-Renta Oscar de la Renta].

'''Private press''' is a term used in the field of [[book collecting]] to describe a [[printing press]] operated as an artistic or craft-based endeavor, rather than as a purely commercial venture. The term is also used in the [[Gramophone record|record]] collecting field to describe records released in small runs by individuals, as opposed to records released by record labels.

== Private press movement ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The term "private press" is often used to refer to a movement in book production which flourished around the turn of the 20th century under the influence of the scholar-artisans [[William Morris]], Sir [[Emery Walker]] and their followers. The movement is often considered to have begun with the founding of Morris' [[Kelmscott Press]] in 1890, following a lecture on printing given by Walker at the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in November 1888. Those involved in the movement created books by traditional printing and binding methods, with an emphasis on the book as a work of art and manual skill, as well as a medium for the transmission of information. Morris was greatly influenced by medieval printed books and the 'Kelmscott style' had a great, and not always positive, influence on later private presses and commercial book-design. The movement was an offshoot of the Arts and Crafts movement, and represented a rejection of the cheap mechanised book-production methods which developed in the Victorian era. The books were made with high-quality materials (handmade paper, traditional inks and, in some cases, specially designed typefaces), and were often bound by hand. Careful consideration was given to format, page design, type, illustration and binding, in order to produce a unified whole. The movement dwindled during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, as the market for luxury goods evaporated. Since the 1950s, there has been a resurgence of interest, especially among artists, in the experimental use of [[letterpress printing]], paper-making and hand-bookbinding in producing small editions of 'artists' books', and among amateur (and a few professional) enthusiasts for traditional printing methods and for the production 'values' of the private press movement.

In [[New Zealand]] university private presses have been significant in the private press movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vangioni|first1=Peter|title=Pressed Letters: Fine Printing in New Zealand since 1975, 30 August – 24 September 2012|date=2012|publisher=Christchurch Art Gallery|location=Christchurch, NZ |url= http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2012_11/Pressed_Letters_booklet.pdf |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private presses are active at three New Zealand universities: Auckland ([[Holloway Press]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Holloway Press|url=http://www.hollowaypress.auckland.ac.nz/|website=The University of Auckland |publisher=The University of Auckland|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victoria (Wai-te-ata Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wai-te-Ata Press|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/wtapress/|website=Victoria University of Wellington |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Otago (Otakou Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Otakou Press|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/exhibitions/burns/otakou.html|website=University of Otago Library, Special Collections Exhibitions|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Riddu Riđđu''' is an annual [[Sami people|Sami]] music and culture festival held in Olmmáivággi (Manndalen) in the [[Gáivuotna]] (Kåfjord) municipality in [[Norway]]. The goal of the festival is to bring forward both Sami culture and that of other [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] peoples. Translated to English, the name of the festival is "small storm at the coast". The festival has permanent support from the [[Ministry of Culture (Norway)|Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]], the [[Sami Parliament of Norway|Sami parliament]], [[Troms County Municipality|Troms county]] and Kåfjord municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitnorway.com/en/media-and-press/events/riddu-riddu |title=Riddu Riddu International |publisher=VisitNorway.com |accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mari Boine Riddu.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Mari Boine]] performing at the festival in 2006]]
Riddu Riđđu includes concerts, seminars, performances, youth camp, stage art, literature, children's program, Northern People's program, youth camp, film program, courses (workshops),  art exhibition, market (bazaar), indigenous houses and much more.  
The festival had its 20th anniversary in 2011. 

The 24th festival will be held between 8 and 12 July 2015.

==History==
The festival was launched by a group of young Sami on New Year's Eve 1991 at Olmmáivággi ({{lang-no|Manndalen}}). This was a decade after the Sami cultural revitalization started. Before that time, the Norwegian government attempted to assimilate the indigenous Sami into the Norwegian majority population. In Olmmáivággi almost all of the previously majority Sami population now considered themselves as Norwegian.

During the 1990s, the anti-Sami sentiment was especially strong in the area with Sami road-signs being shot to pieces and families being split. A group of youth started to ask questions such as: "Why did they [the Norwegian government] take away from us the Sami language? Why do we hide our sea-Sami identity and culture? Why are we ashamed [of being Sami]?" This started a Sami youth organization that among other things organized the Riddu Riđđu festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://norwayfestivals.com/en/festivals/riddu-riddu |title=Riddu Riđđu |publisher=NorwayFestivals.com |accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://riddu.no/nb/om-festivalen |title=Om festivalen |language=Norwegian |publisher=Riddu.no |accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first festival was arranged in 1991 and has since been arranged annually. In 1998, the ''Riddu Riđđu Searvi'' organization was established and has since been responsible for arranging the festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">[[Queen Dowager]] '''Rosalie Gicanda''' (1928&lt;ref name=dob&gt;[https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-image-queen-rosalie-gicanda-grave-image20274161 Queen Rosalie Gicanda Grave Editorial Photo - Image: 20274161], Dreamstime, Retrieved 21 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; – 20 April 1994) was the wife of Rwandan ''[[Mwami]]'' ([[Monarch|King]] in the [[Kinyarwanda language]]) [[Mutara III of Rwanda]]. After her husband died in mysterious circumstances in 1959, the [[Rwandan monarchy]] lasted only two more years, under the leadership of ''[[Mwami]]'' [[Kigeli V of Rwanda]] and then coming to an end in 1961. However, the Queen continued to live in [[Butare]] in [[Butare Province]], [[Rwanda]], along with her mother and several [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]].

== Death ==
On 20 April 1994, as the [[Rwandan Genocide]] began in earnest in Butare, a detachment of soldiers commanded by Lt. [[Pierre Bizimana]], acting under the orders of Capt. [[Idelphonse Nizeyimana]], [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the former Queen along with others from her house. They then took the captives behind the [[National Museum of Rwanda|National Museum]] and shot them.  Only a younger girl survived to tell the story of the murders. Two days later, the Queen's mother was also murdered. At the request of a priest, Butare [[mayor]] [[Kanyabashi]] recovered Queen Gicanda’s body and had it buried in the yard next to her house.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18512292 Rwanda genocide: Nizeyimana convicted of killing Queen Gicanda], 19 June 2012, BBC, Retrieved 2 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public reaction ==
The Queen was a living symbol for [[Tutsi]]s, and her murder shocked many. It effectively signaled the beginning of the mass killing in the Butare area, which saw some of the worst atrocities committed during the fighting.

After the genocide, a Rwandan [[military court]] found Bizimana and Private 1st Class Aloys Mazimpaka guilty of genocide and the murder of Queen Gicanda and her family. (''Chambre Specialisée du Conseil de Guerre de Butare, case no. LMD 187, LP 0001-PS 97'', Judgment pronounced July 27, 1998.) Bizimana was sentenced to death, Mazimpaka to life in prison.

On 6 October 2009, former intelligence chief [[Idelphonse Nizeyimana]] was arrested in [[Kampala]], Uganda. Nizeyimana was one of the most wanted suspects in the Rwandan genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8292252.stm BBC: Rwanda queen-killing suspect held]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 19 June 2012, he was convicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] of ordering the killing of the former Tutsi queen, as well as other murders, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18512292 BBC: Rwanda genocide: Nizeyimana convicted of killing Queen Gicanda]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanumá''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|n|ʊ|m|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Yanomaman languages|Yanomaman language]] spoken in [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]].  It is also known as Sanema, Sanima, Tsanuma, Guaika, Samatari, Samatali, Xamatari and Chirichano. Most of its speakers in Venezuela also speak [[Ye'kuana language|Ye'kuana]], also known as Maquiritare, the language of the [[Ye'kuana people]] the Sanumá live alongside in the [[Caura River (Venezuela)|Caura River]] basin. 
Some linguists identify dialects such as ''Yanoma, Cobari, Caura,'' and ''Ervato-Ventuari'' in Venezuela and ''Auaris'' in Brazil. All the dialects are mutually intelligible.  In Venezuela, Sanumá is spoken in the vicinity of the [[Caura River (Venezuela)|Caura]] and [[Ventuari River|Ervato-Ventuari River]]s in Venezuela, and the [[Auari River]] and [[Roraima]] region in Brazil.

Sanumá is an [[isolating language]].

A '''shift-share analysis''', used in [[regional science]], [[political economy]], and [[urban studies]], determines what portions of regional economic growth or decline can be attributed to national, economic [[industry]], and [[regional]] factors.  The analysis helps identify industries where a regional economy has [[competitive advantage]]s over the larger economy.  A shift-share analysis takes the change over time of an economic variable, such as [[employment]], within industries of a regional economy, and divides that change into various components.  A traditional shift-share analysis splits regional changes into just three components, but other models have evolved that expand the decomposition into additional components.

== Overview ==
A shift-share analysis attempts to identify the sources of regional economic changes.  The region can be a town, city, country, [[statistical area]], state, or any other region of the country.  The analysis examines changes in an economic variable, such as migration, a [[demographics|demographic statistic]], firm growth, or firm formations, although [[employment]] is most commonly used.&lt;ref name=Cheng&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Shaoming|title=Business cycle, industrial composition, or regional advantage? A decomposition analysis of new firm formation in the United States|journal=The Annals of Regional Science|date=2 February 2010|volume=47|issue=1|pages=147–167|doi=10.1007/s00168-009-0361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shi|first=Chun-Yun|author2=Yang Yang |title=A Review of Shift-Share Analysis and its Application in Tourism|journal=International Journal of Management Perspectives|year=2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shift-share analysis is performed on a set of economic industries, like those defined by the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]]. The analysis separates the regional economic changes within each industry into different categories.  Although there are different versions of a shift-share analysis, they all identify national, industry, and regional factors that influence the variable changes.

== Traditional model ==
The traditional form of the shift-share analysis was developed by Daniel Creamer in the early 1940s, and was later formalized by Edgar S. Dunn in 1960.&lt;ref name=Shi /&gt; Also known as the ''comparative static model'', it examines changes in the economic variable between two years.  Changes are calculated for each industry in the analysis, both regionally and nationally.  Each regional change is decomposed into three components.&lt;ref name=Leigh&gt;{{cite book|last=Leigh|first=Nancey Green|title=Planning Local Economic Development|year=2013|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=9781452242590|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''National growth effect'' is the portion of the change attributed to the total growth of the national economy.  It equals the theoretical change in the regional variable had it increased by the same percentage as the national economy.  
# ''Industry mix effect'' is the portion of the change attributed to the performance of the specific economic industry. It equals the theoretical change in the regional variable had it increased by the same percentage as the industry nationwide, minus the national growth effect.
# ''Local share effect'' is the portion of the change attributed to regional influences, and is the component of primary concern to regional analysts.&lt;ref name=Leigh /&gt;  It equals the actual change in the regional variable, minus the previous two effects.

===Formula===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the three shift-share effects: national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IM&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and local share effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Benjamin|author2=Craig Moore |title=A critical review of the literature on shift-share as a forecasting technique|journal=Journal of Regional Science|year=1980|volume=20|issue=4|page=419|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9787.1980.tb00660.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NS_i + IM_i + RS_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The beginning and ending values of the economic variable within a particular industry are {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t+n&lt;/sup&gt;}}, respectively.  Each of the three effects is defined as a percentage of the beginning value of the economic variable.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = e_i^t \left( G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = e_i^t \left( G_i-G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = e_i^t \left( g_i-G_i \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The total percent change in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}}, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively.

=== Example ===
As an example, a shift-share analysis might be utilized to examine changes in the construction industry of a state's economy over the past decade, using employment as the economic variable studied.  Total national employment may have increased 5% over the decade, while national construction employment increased 8%.  However, state construction employment decreased 2%, from 100,000 to 98,000 employees, for a net loss of 2,000 employees.

The national growth effect is equal to the beginning 100,000 employees, times the total national growth rate of 5%, for an increase in 5,000 employees.  The shift-share analysis implies that state construction would have increased by 5,000 employees, had it followed the same trend as the overall national economy.

The industry mix effect is equal to the original 100,000 employees times the growth in the industry nationwide, which was 8%, minus the total national growth of 5%.  This results in an increase in 3,000 employees (100,000 employees times 3%, which is the 8% industry growth minus the 5% total growth).  The analysis implies that the state construction would have increased by another 3,000 employees had it followed the industry trends, because the construction industry nationwide performed better than the national economy overall.

The local share effect in this example is equal to the beginning 100,000 employees times the state construction employment growth rate of −2% (it is ''negative'' because of the loss of employees), minus the national construction growth rate of 8%.  This results in 100,000 employees times -10%, for a loss of 10,000 employees.  However, the actual employment loss was only 2,000 employees, but that equals the sum of the three effects (5,000 gain + 3,000 gain + 10,000 loss).  The analysis implies that local factors lead to a decrease in 10,000 employees in the state construction industry, because the growth in both the national economy and the construction industry should have increased state construction employment by 8,000 employees (the 5,000 national share effect plus the 3,000 industry mix effect).

===Names and regions===

Shift-share analysts sometimes use different labels for the three effects, although the calculations are the same.  National growth effect may be referred to as ''national share''.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knudesn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudesn|first=Daniel C.|title=Shift-share analysis: further examination of models for the description of economic change|journal=Socio-Economic Planning Sciences|year=2000|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industry mix effect may be referred to as ''proportional shift''.&lt;ref name=Knudesn /&gt;  Local share effect may be referred to as ''differential shift'',&lt;ref name=Leigh /&gt; ''regional shift'',&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt; or ''competitive share''.&lt;ref name=UGA&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Statistics System|url=http://georgiastats.uga.edu/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most shift-share analyses, the regional economy is compared to the national economy.  However, the techniques may be used to compare any two regions (e.g., comparing a county to its state).&lt;ref name=Mackinac&gt;{{cite web|title=The Michigan Economic Development Corporation: A Review and Analysis|url=http://www.mackinac.org/10896|publisher=Mackinac Center|accessdate=5 December 2013|author=Michael LaFaive|author2=James M. Hohman |date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic model ==

In 1988, Richard Barff and Prentice Knight, III, published the dynamic model shift-share analysis.&lt;ref name=Barff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barff|first=Richard|author2=Prentice L. Knight III |title=Dynamic Shift-Share Analysis|journal=Growth and Change|date=April 1988|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–10|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1988.tb00465.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the comparative static model, which only considers two years in its analysis (the beginning and ending years), the dynamic model utilizes every year in the study period.  Although it requires much more data to perform the calculations, the dynamic model takes into account continuous changes in the three shift-share effects, so the results are less affected by the choice of starting and ending years.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;  The dynamic model is most useful when there are large differences between regional and national growth rates, or large changes in the regional industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

The dynamic model uses the same techniques as the comparative static model, including the same three shift-share effects.  However, in the dynamic model, a [[time-series]] of traditional shift-share calculations are performed, comparing each year to the previous year.  The annual shift-share effects are then totaled together for the entire study period, resulting in the dynamic model's shift-share effects.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the three shift-share effects: national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IM&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and local share effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NS_i + IM_i + RS_i
&lt;/math&gt;

If the study period ranges from year {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} to year {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}, then traditional shift-share effects are calculated for every year {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}}, where {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}} spans from {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+1}} to {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;  The dynamic model shift-share effects are then calculated as the sum of the annual effects.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n} \left[ e_i^{k-1} \left( G^k \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n} \left[ e_i^{k-1} \left( G_i^k - G^k \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n} \left[ e_i^{k-1} \left( g_i^k - G_i^k \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The growth rates used in the calculations are annual rates, not growth from the beginning year in the study period, so the percent change from year {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;-1}} to {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}} in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;}}, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

== Esteban-Marquillas Model ==

In 1972, J.M. Esteban-Marquillas extended the traditional model to address criticism that the regional share effect is correlated to the regional industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Esteban&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esteban-Marquillas|first=J.M.|title=A reinterpretation of shift-share analysis|journal=Regional and Urban Economics|year=1972|volume=2|issue=3|pages=249–261|doi=10.1016/0034-3331(72)90033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Esteban-Marquillas model, the regional share effect itself is decomposed into two components, isolating a regional shift component that is not correlated to the industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;  The model introduced a then-new concept to shift-share analyses, a [[Homothetic preferences|homothetic]] level of the economic variable within an industry.  This is the theoretical value of the variable within an industry assuming the region has the same industrial mix as the nation.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;

In the Esteban-Marquillas model, the calculations of the national share and industrial mix effects are unchanged.  However, the regional share effect in the traditional model is separated into two effects: a new regional share effect that is not dependent on the industrial mix, and an allocation effect that is.  The allocation effect indicates the extent to which the region is specialized in those industries where it enjoys a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the four shift-share effects: national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IM&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), regional share effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and allocation effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;AL&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NS_i + IM_i + RS_i + AL_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The beginning and ending values of the economic variable within a particular industry are {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t+n&lt;/sup&gt;}}, respectively.  The beginning value of the regional homothetic variable within a particular industry is {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;  It is based on the regional and national values of the economic variable across all industries, {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} respectively, and the industry-specific national value {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
h_i^t = e^t \times { E_i^t \over E^t } 
&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the four shift-share effects is defined as a percentage of either the beginning value of the economic variable, the homothetic variable, or the difference of the two.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = e_i^t \left( G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = e_i^t \left( G_i-G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = h_i^t \left( g_i-G_i \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
AL_i = \left( e_i^t-h_i^t \right) \left( g_i-G_i \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The total percent change in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}}, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively.

== Arcelus Model ==
In 1984, Francisco Arcelus built upon Esteban-Marquillas' use of the homothetic variables and extended the traditional model even further.&lt;ref name=Arcelus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arcelus|first=Francisco|title=An extension of shift-share analysis|journal=Growth and Change|date=January 1984|volume=15|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this method to decompose the national share and industrial mix effects into ''expected'' and ''differential'' components.  The expected component is based on the homothetic level of the variable, and is the effect not attributed to the regional specializations.  The differential component is the remaining effect, which is attributable to the regional industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt; 
 
Arcelus claimed that, even with the Esteban-Marquillas extension, the regional share effect is still related to the regional industry mix, and that the static model assumes all regional industries operate on a national market basis, focusing too heavily on the export markets and ignoring the local markets.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt; In order to address these issues, Arcelus used a different method for separating the regional share effect, resulting in a ''regional growth effect'' and a ''regional industry mix effect''.  Both of these are decomposed into expected and differential components using the homothetic variable.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the eight shift-share effects: expected national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NSE&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), differential national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NSD&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), expected industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IME&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), differential industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IMD&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), expected regional growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RGE&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), differential regional growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RGD&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), expected regional industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RIE&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and differential regional industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RID&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NSE_i + NSD_i + IME_i + IMD_i + RGE_i + RGD_i + RIE_i + RID_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The eight effects are related to the three traditional shift-share effects from the comparative static model.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = NSE_i + NSD_i
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = IME_i + IMD_i
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = RGE_i + RGD_i + RIE_i + RID_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The homothetic variable is calculated the same as in the Esteban-Marquillas model.  The beginning value of the regional homothetic variable within a particular industry is {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  It is based on the regional and national values of the economic variable across all industries, {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} respectively, and the industry-specific national value {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_i^t = e^t \times { E_i^t \over E^t } 
&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the eight shift-share effects is defined as a percentage of either the beginning value of the economic variable, the homothetic variable, or the difference of the two.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt;
NSE_i = h_i^t \times G 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NSD_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times G
&lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;
IME_i = h_i^t \times \left( G_i - G \right) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IMD_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times \left( G_i - G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RGE_i = h_i^t \times \left( g - G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RGD_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times \left( g - G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RIE_i = h_i^t \times \left( g_i - g - G_i + G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RID_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times \left( g_i - g - G_i + G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The total percent changes in the economic variable nationally and regionally for all industries combined are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}} respectively, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3337">'''Sophy Sanger''' (1881–1950) was an internationalist and [[labour law]] reformer.

==Early life and education==
Sophy Sanger was born on 3 January 1881 in [[Westcott, Surrey|Westcott]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophy Sanger: A pioneer in internationalism|date=1958|publisher=University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Glasgow|pages=|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=2x7RAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=westcott|last1=Allen|first1=A.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} She was the youngest daughter of the wealthy London businessman Charles Sanger and Jessie Alice Pulford.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37934|title=Sanger, Sophy (1881–1950)|last=Oldfield|first=Sybil|date=2004|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15, she was sent to Dr. Elizabeth Dawes' school in [[Weybridge]], where she was the only pupil to be taught mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She went up to [[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in autumn 1899. Sophy began by studying the [[Mathematical Tripos]] from 1899 to 1902 and went on to read [[Human science|moral sciences]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was in Cambridge at a debate in the Newnham Parliament that Sophy first became interested in politics; listening to a speech by the [[Quaker]] [[Dr Hilda Clark|Hilda Clark]] sparked in her a commitment to [[pacifism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

== Work ==
Sophy Sanger worked for the [[Women's Trade Union League (United Kingdom)|Women's Trade Union League]] from 1903 to 1909, setting up its legal advice bureau whilst learning labour law at University College London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work on insurance regulations for workplace compensation meant she was called to give evidence before a parliamentary commission in the [[House of Lords]] and she helped Labour MPs prepare their case for the Shops Bill.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1905, Sanger founded a British section of the International Association for Labour Legislation, publishing an English version of its French and German ''Bulletins''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between 1909 and 1919, she wrote for and edited ''World's Labour Laws'', a quarterly publication which campaigned on issues such as the abolition of child labour, the prohibition of the use of [[White phosphorus munitions|white phosphorus]] and [[lead]] and the prevention of [[anthrax]]. She believed that international cooperation and action on specific, practical reforms could effectively combat many worker's rights issues, for example: [[sweated labour]], [[occupational disease]] and workplace injury.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sophy Sanger was appointed chief of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s legislative section, a post she held from its formation in 1919 until 1924.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She returned to Britain in 1924 and read for the bar at [[Gray's Inn]], publishing an authoritative article on labour law for the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|259}}

Sanger died of illness on 7 December 1950 in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;{{rp|291}}

A '''trainera''' is a traditional boat of the [[Cantabrian sea]] coast at the southern end of the [[Bay of Biscay]], propelled by [[oar]]s, and formerly [[sailing]]. It is a boat of fine lines, raised [[prow]] and rounded [[stern]], that very well resist the waves of the Cantabrian sea. Traineras were formerly dedicated to bring in the day’s catch of [[anchovie]]s and [[sardine]]s from sea to market, usually competing to sell their caught fish before. Today, this historical tradition have become a major sport of racing.

==Other languages and etymology==
Its name, '''trainera''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), '''traineru''' (also '''treineru, treñero''' or '''triñero''' in [[Basque language|Basque]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_oeh&amp;Itemid=413&amp;lang=eu&amp;sarrera=trein&amp;view=frontpage&amp;xeh=5 |title=traineru |author= |date= |work=Orotariko Euskal Hiztegia |publisher=[[Euskaltzaindia]] |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), '''traînière'''  ([[French language|French]]) and '''traiñeira''' or '''traíña'''&lt;ref name=gal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ligalgt.com/ |title= Liga Galega de Traiñeiras |publisher = |year= 2012 |accessdate= 2012-08-25 |language= Spanish, Galician}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Galician language|Galician]]) is derived from the word ''traína'', a closely woven [[fishing net|net]] used in the fishing of sardines and anchovies,&lt;ref name=Real&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/drae/?type=3&amp;val=a&amp;val_aux=&amp;origen=REDRAE |title=Diccionario de la lengua española |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Real Academia Española |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_oeh&amp;Itemid=413&amp;lang=eu&amp;sarrera=trein&amp;view=frontpage&amp;xeh=0 |title=treina |author= |date= |work=Orotariko Euskal Hiztegia |publisher=[[Euskaltzaindia]] |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself derived from [[Latin]] ''tragināre'', from ''trahĕre'' "to pull, drag".&lt;ref name=Real/&gt;

==Distribution==

The historic trainera regattas, ''estropadak'' in Basque, are a popular sport held all along the [[Bay of Biscay]], all the way through the coast of [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], [[Cantabria]], [[Asturias]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] between July and October. Numerous competitions are held each year such as the oldest regatta ''[[Bandera de Santander]]'' or the most famous ''[[Kontxako Bandera]]'',&lt;ref name=concha&gt;http://www.donostiasansebastian.com/regatas/&lt;/ref&gt; and there are various trainera leagues such as the premier league [[Liga San Miguel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ligasanmiguel.com |title= Liga San Miguel |publisher = Asociación de Clubes de Traineras |year= 2012 |accessdate= 2012-08-25 |language= English, Spanish, Galician, Basque, French}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the second divisions [[Liga Asociación de Remo del Cantábrico]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liga-arc.com |title= Liga ARC |publisher = Asociación de Remo del Cantábrico |year= 2012 |accessdate= 2012-08-25 |language= Spanish, Basque}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liga Galega de Traiñeiras]].&lt;ref name=gal /&gt;

==Boats and rules==

Today they are manned by a crew of 13 oarsmen sitting in pairs of two (except for the thirteenth, who sits alone in the bows) and a [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] standing up facing them in the stern. The bowman or bow-woman also has a 15th oar which is used for helping with the steering in tight turns. As is common in other such events, the cox is responsible for steering the boat and keeping up the morale of the team. Each boat flies a particular flag and wears a team strip and often the boat is painted in the team's colours as well.

The manufacturing process takes at least a month or month and a half. The boats themselves are 12m long, 1.72m wide (at midship), 95&amp;nbsp;cm. bow, 75&amp;nbsp;cm. stern and 60.5&amp;nbsp;cm. in depth. The total weight of the boat including baton, bench, and hitters have to be 210–230&amp;nbsp;kg but may not weigh less than 200&amp;nbsp;kg (excluding oars and equipment). The material used for years was entirely of [[wood]], cedar and beech. Currently, material is [[carbon fiber]] and [[kevlar]] to make traineras with aeronautical techniques similar to those applied in the construction of the plane Airbus 380,&lt;ref name="trainera"&gt;[http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/20080731/deportes/remo/traineras-construyen-avanzadas-tecnicas-20080731.html Las traineras se construyen con avanzadas técnicas de la aeronáutica] ''[[El Diario Montañés]]'' (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt; which amongst other things are fitted with [[GPS]] systems, creating better boats but also pushing up the prices for them. The life of a boat at a top club is usually two or three years. In the 1970s a ''trainera'' cost around 45,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]], 2008 prices start at around [[Euro|€]]25,000.&lt;ref name="trainera" /&gt;

A race normally covers a distance of 5.5&amp;nbsp;km with either a single trip to a buoy and back two return trips. Each boat has its own lane and may not cross into another boat's lane and the oars (and boats) of different boats may not touch. A race is normally restarted if something irregular happens within the first 20 seconds of a race. Apart from the prize money for each race, the winning team is awarded a ''bandera'' (flag) of the town or [[autonomous community]]. The winning team traditionally holds all oars vertically into the air, the so-called ''remos arriba'' or ''arraunak gora'', "oars up".

==Women and traineras==

Although most rowing teams were male, evidence from the historical [[bertso]]s tells us that female rowers existed, referred to as ''batelerak'' in Basque. The name derives from ''batel'', a name for a smaller type of boat with 4 rowers and a cox. Evidence can also be seen in the traditional ''[[batelera dantza]]'' (batelera dance) which is performed by women with oars.

More recently, female teams have also begun to take plains in the trainera regattas proper.

==History==

The origins of the various kinds of trainera reggata lie in [[fishing]] and [[whaling]], both highly important sources of income in earlier periods. Traditionally, the first boat back at the quay got the best price for their fish. As the boat and all equipment was usually owned by the skipper and the crew hired by oral contract, the skipper would first deduct the boat and net share (25%) from the earnings, then deduct any further expenses for bait and provisions. Only then would the remained be shared in equal parts so it was in everybody's interest to get back as fast as possible to get the best price possible.

Similarly, when whaling was at its height in along the [[Bay of Biscay]] teams would race to be the first to reach a sighted whale.

The boats used in the regattas were originally working [[fishing boat]]s, the frame made from [[oak]] and the hull from [[pine]]. There were three main categories:
* The ''trainera'' which has and elevated prow and rounded stern, ideally suited for navigating the choppy waters off the coast at speed needed to catch [[anchovy]] and [[sardine]]s. The crew consists of 13 rowers and one cox. The rowers are divided into two rows of six, plus the bow rower, who is alone on his bench.
* The ''trainerilla'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'little trainera') has a crew of 6 rowers and one cox, all sitting in a row.
* The ''batel'' is a smaller boat used close to the coast for a variety of fish, with 4 rowers and a cox.

Since the year 1850, there was evidence of challenges in the Cantabrian village of [[Castro Urdiales]] between local crews and sometimes with the [[Biscay]]ans who were manning the Coast Guard cutters.&lt;ref name=cantu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cantusantana.org/Documentos%20pdf/Libros%20Electronicos%20Ramon%20Ojeda/Regata%20del%20anio1861.pdf
|author= Ramón Ojeda San Miguel
|title= La regata de la "Jota del Regateo": año 1861
|publisher = Cantu Santa Ana
|location = Castro Urdiales
|year= 2010
|accessdate= 2012-08-17
|language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented regatta which was held as a sporting event was in 1859 in the [[Bay of Santander]] between the people of Castro Urdiales and some Biscayan crews. The Castro Urdiales team won the race and regattas have been held as sporting event ever since.&lt;ref name=cantu /&gt;

Much more important was the race held in [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] two years later, in 1861, in the presence of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]] on official visit to the capital of Cantabria. The [[Cantabria]]ns beat back to the Biscayans and the local press echoed the news and even a famous folk song known as the ''Jota del Regateo'' was composed.&lt;ref name=cantu /&gt; The ''Flag of Santander'' is still held today,  making it the oldest rowing competition that is still celebrated in Spain.

The first documented ''estropada'' in Basque Country was twelve years later, in 1871, between the people of [[Hondarribia]] and [[Pasaia]], involving a bet about who could reach [[San Sebastián]] first setting our from Hondarribia. The Pasaia team won the 13 mile race. Originally the teams would race from one particular seaside town to another but today most races are held locally.

In 1916 a man from [[Mutriku]] called Bizente Ormazabal built a new, sleek type of boat for a group from [[Getaria (Spain)|Getaria]] called ''Golondrina'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'swallow'). At the same time motors were introduced to the fishing industry so the commercial use of rowing boats quickly disappeared and more and more were used for the ''estropadak''. Over time the design changed, building more for speed than fishing, reducing the weight and the width.

As rowing turned from a profession into a sport, fewer and fewer fishermen competed and more and more teams were put together from non-seafaring backgrounds as they could train more regularly than fishermen.

The most famous of all trainera regattas today is the ''Kontxako Estropadak'', ''[[Kontxako Bandera]]'' o ''Bandera de la Concha'', ''Kontxako Badia / Bahía de la Concha'' being the name of the main bay of [[Donostia-San_Sebastián|Donostia]]. It was first organised by the city's council in 1879&lt;ref name=concha /&gt; and is said to have drawn a crowd of some 12,000 spectators.

'''Trümmerfrau''' (literally translated as ''ruins woman'' or ''rubble woman'') is the German-language name for women who, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], helped clear and reconstruct the bombed cities of [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. With hundreds of cities having suffered significant bombing and [[firestorm]] damage [[Strategic bombing during World War II|through aerial attacks]] (and in some cases, ground fighting), and with many men dead or prisoners of war, this monumental task fell to a large degree on women.&lt;ref name="RECONSTITUTING"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/subpage.cfm?subpage_id=163|title=German History in Documents and Images|work=Occupation and the Emergence of Two States (1945-1961) - 3. Reconstituting German Society|publisher=German Historical Institute|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree of damage==
3.6 million out of the sixteen million homes in 62 cities &lt;ref&gt;https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-bombing-campaign-of-world-war-two/bombing-and-world-war-two/&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany were destroyed during Allied bombings in World War II, with another four million damaged. Half of all school buildings, forty percent of the infrastructure, and many factories were either damaged or destroyed. According to estimates, there were about 400 million cubic metres of ruins and 7.5 million people were made homeless.

==Removal of ruins==
[[Image:Trümmerfrau Dresden 1.JPG|left|thumb|Trümmerfrauen memorial, [[Dresden]].]]
[[Image:Stuttgart gruener heiner 02.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Grüner Heiner]], a [[schuttberg]] in [[Stuttgart-Weilimdorf]]]]

Between 1945 and 1946, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], in both [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], ordered all women between 15 and 50 years of age to participate in the postwar cleanup. For this purpose, previous restrictive measures protecting women in the labor force were removed in July 1946. Recruitment of women was especially useful since at that time, because of the loss of men in the war, there were seven million more women than men in Germany.

Usually, private enterprises were given assignments to remove the ruins, together with a permit to employ the women for that purpose. The main work was to tear down those parts of buildings that had survived the bombings, but were unsafe and unsuitable for reconstruction. Usually, no heavy machinery was used. The main tools were picks and hand-winches. After tearing down the ruins, the remnants had to be further demolished, down to single bricks that could later be used in rebuilding. A chain of women would transfer the bricks to the street, where they were cleaned and stacked. Wood and steel beams, fireplaces, [[wash basin]]s, toilets, pipes and other household items were collected to be reused. The remaining debris was then removed by barrows, wagons and lorries. It was later reused to fill up holes in the streets or to make new bricks. In some German cities, [[schuttberg]]e (debris mountains) were created from leftover debris and exist today in a number of German cities.

''Trümmerfrauen'', both volunteers and regular workers, worked in all weather. They were organised in ''Kolonnen'' (columns) of ten to twenty people.

=== Pay ===
The average workday of a Trümmerfrau was nine hours long with one 20-30 minute lunch break. The women were paid at a rate of 72 [[Reichsmark|Reichspfennige]] (Pfennig) per hour along with one food ration card. This card could only feed one person a day. The issue was not in what one could do once they had the food, but dealt with the fact that the ration card gave very little food.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berlin's Culturescape in the 20th Century - Fashion Among Ruins: From Trümmerfrau to Modefrau--Fashion in Berlin 1945-46|last=Sark|first=Katrina|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Center|year=2008|isbn=978-0889772243|location=Regina|pages=113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Trümmerfrau finished her day with roughly 9 food ration cards and 6 [[Reichsmark|Reichmarks]] (Marks) and 48 [[Pfennig]]e.

For comparison (1945):

One loaf of bread = 80 Marks

One pound of butter = 600 Marks

One cigarette = 10 Marks {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Later works and recognition==

In the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], the ''Nationales Aufbauwerk'' (National Reconstruction Works) was founded, in order to coordinate the efforts of the ''Trümmerfrauen''.

In [[West Germany]], the removal works continued as ''Notstandsarbeiten'' (State-of-emergency Works), until the cities were cleaned and the reconstruction could begin.

In both parts of Germany, as well as in Austria, the efforts of the ''Trümmerfrauen'' were recognised with numerous ceremonies, memorials, awards and exhibitions.&lt;ref name="RECONSTITUTING"/&gt;

Their role was also considered important in changing post-war gender roles in [[Germany]], though the concept of women as independent workers was taken up more eagerly in the official views of East Germany than in West Germany, where, once peace and economic prosperity was restored, a tendency reemerged in some parts of society to return women to their traditional family role only.&lt;ref name="RECONSTITUTING"/&gt;

==Across Germany==
===Aachen===

On 4 October 2006, a weekly newspaper published the memoirs of the Trümmerfrau Elisabeth Stock (83) of which the following passage is cited:

"...it were mostly women who shoveled their way through the rubble of Aachen's inner city that was totally destroyed; just for one bowl of soup from the Americans, we hammered and dragged debris all day long, even the pickaxe was part of our equipment, ...that's probably one reason why they put a memorial plaque for Aachen's Trümmerfrauen at the back of the townhall."

===Berlin===

Within the four occupied sectors of [[Berlin]] approximately 10 per cent of the buildings were irreparably destroyed. In the central districts  of [[Berlin Mitte]], [[Kreuzberg]], [[Friedrichshain]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]] up to 30 per cent were destroyed. For this reason, the Trümmerfrauen had to work hard and their commitment gained widespread recognition:

In 1946, the Allied headquarters published a series of stamps, the so-called "Bärenmarken", for  the whole of Berlin. The graphic designers  Alfred Goldhammer and Heinz Schwalbe created four images with symbols of the reconstruction, e.g. a bear with a brick, a bear with a shovel, a bear with a beam and a young oak tree in front of the ruins at Belle-Alliance square.

On 13 October 1950 the mayor of [[East-Berlin]] [[Friedrich Ebert (junior)|Friedrich Ebert]] offered a newly built flat to a former Trümmerfrau in honour of her commitment. The flat was located in one of the terraces in the street which was formerly called [[Stalinallee]] and had been designed by [[Hans Scharoun]].

Erika Heß, mayor of the district of Wedding, initiated the founding of a club for the Trümmerfrauen. Its members were invited for coffee and cake once a year and also received assistance when they needed to complete official business. In addition, excursions were organised.

===Bremen===

In May 2005, the Bremen organisation ''Friedensforum'' initiated a two-hour meeting under the motto ''Mother's Day&amp;nbsp;– in a different way''. Additionally to various activities like music performances or discussion groups etc., a Trümmerfrau and a pupil met for public discussion.

===Chemnitz===

In 2001, due to an initiative of the 1998-founded club ''Verein figürliches Glockenspiel im Alten Rathaus-Turm zu Chemnitz e.V'' together with the support of numerous donors, a carillon with a total number of 25 bells was installed. Three times a day the six figures, each one metre tall, come out of the tower. One of them is shaped like a Trümmerfrau. The rubble woman has a brick on her knee which she holds with her left hand; in her right hand she has a hammer. The figures were designed by the sculptor Johannes (Hannes) Schulze from [[Plauen]] and forged by the bell foundry ''Rudolf Perner Karlsruhe und Passau''.

== Fashion ==
In the years of 1945 to 1946, fashion in [[Berlin]] began to change at a very quick rate, so fast that it was shortly thereafter labeled the fashion capital. During the war, women sold just about everything they owned for food. This includes the very stockings on their legs and carpets in their homes could be exchanged for a sack of potatoes. Once the Allied soldiers arrived and the long process of clearing the rubble began, the Trümmerfrauen realized that they could continue to sell the objects they found in other buildings during this time. A large number of rags were pulled out from beneath the debris. A few of the old shop owners pulled out their sewing machines and began to stitch the rags together into dresses. The dresses, were titled, "Lumpenkleider", meaning "rag dresses".

There were three reasons for the creation of the dresses. First, to give a sense of normalcy and hope that things would one day go back to how they were. Second, dresses immediately after the war served the important purpose of increasing aesthetic, in other words, making the women more appealing to the Allied soldiers. Third, dresses were worth 10,000-20,000 [[Reichsmark|Reichmarks]] each.

The German word "Fraulein" (at the time) defined a woman that fraternized with a soldier, an act that was strictly forbidden during the war. Upon the war's end, the women had run out of items to barter for food, so they resorted to trading themselves. If a woman could attract the attention of an Allied soldier, she was likely to receive payment in the form of food or in some cases, protection from other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Woman in Berlin|last=Anonymous|first=|publisher=Virago|year=1945|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunate women possessed rag dresses that made them much better at attracting Allied soldiers. The strategy was so beneficial that people began to make many garments out of "mitgebrachten stoffen" - "salvaged material". Eventually, many women attained dresses and used prostitution, then respected, as a night job while clearing rubble during the day. The busy nights led to a growing entertainment industry where cabarets and bars found themselves populating [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Negative ===
A large increase in prostitution between the German women and Allied soldiers led to many contracting venereal diseases. The U.S. government created Veronika Dankeschön, a diseased cartoon seductress starring as the role of a media campaign designed to scare U.S. soldiers into ending sexual relations with German women. As German men returned home they began to call these women prostitutes. Raingard Esser, a doctorate of medieval and modern history, believes the men acted so in order to express their anger and strife over the knowledge that their women had to sell themselves to survive, while they, the men, were now also dependent on the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esser|first=Raingard|date=2003|title=‘Language no obstacle’: war brides in the German press, 1945-49|url=|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|volume=12|pages=577–603|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
Historian, Leonie Treber, recognizes that many cities and people look to the Trümmerfrauen as a large movement of heroism and strength. However, she disagrees with the size that people have made it out to be. [[Berlin]] mobilized 60,000 women to remove the rubble leftover from the war, yet this number was only five percent of the female population. In areas like Berlin's British sector, Treber reports that the percentage of women who joined in the difficult job had decreased to only a third of one percent.

According to the Historian, many saw the job as punishment or beneath them. The reason being that the Nazis made the Hitler Youth, POWs, and concentration camp prisoners remove the debris from the bombed-out cities. Immediately after the war, the members of the Nazi Party were forced to take the place of the forced laborers. Unfortunately, they were insufficient and women stepped up to the task in exchange for an hourly wage and food ration cards.

The later use of the Trümmerfrauen as media campaign representing a large unified movement was very successful in [[East Germany]]. The same idea did not travel far in West Germany until the 1980s. Treber states that the reason for this was that the independent tireless woman did not resonate with the "conservative female-image".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/dismantling-the-german-myth-of-tr%C3%BCmmerfrauen/a-18083725|title=Dismantling the German myth of 'Trümmerfrauen' {{!}} Germany {{!}} DW {{!}} 24.11.2014|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Underwriters Salvage Corps''' is a historic building in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  Located on Eighth Street in the city's [[downtown Cincinnati|downtown]], it has historically been the home of a firm that worked together with both the [[Cincinnati Fire Department]] and local [[Property insurance|fire insurance]] companies.&lt;ref name=dohp&gt;Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 1.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 681-682.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local insurance companies formed the Underwriters Salvage Corps in 1886 at the end of a four-year-long process of negotiations.  As a [[Salvage Corps|salvage corps]], their goal was largely to assist firefighters in danger zones: employees rushed to burning buildings to try to save both lives and property, and they were accorded the same status as official firefighters while at fire zones.&lt;ref name=dohp /&gt;

The present building was erected in 1897 under the direction of local contractor William Schuberth; its purpose was the storage of equipment and the housing of the Salvage Corps' employees who were on duty at any given point.&lt;ref name=dohp /&gt;  A brick building with a stone [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]],&lt;ref name=ohs&gt;{{OHC NRHP|82003589|Underwriters Salvage Corps}}, [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.

[[File:Villam2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Villa 31 in Buenos Aires]]
[[Image:Villa miseria 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Houses in a ''villa miseria'' in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]]]]
A '''''villa miseria''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈbiʎa miˈseɾja}}), or just ''villa'', is a type of [[shanty town]] or [[slum]] found in [[Argentina]], mostly around the largest urban settlements. The term is a [[noun phrase]] made up of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''villa'' (''village'', ''small town'') and ''miseria'' (''misery'', ''dejection''), and was adopted from [[Bernardo Verbitsky]]'s 1957 novel ''Villa Miseria también es América'' ("Villa Miseria is also [a part of] the Americas").

These settlements consist of small houses or shacks made of tin, wood and other scrap material. Generally, the streets are not [[pavement (roads)|paved]] and narrow internal passages connect the different parts. The villas miseria have no [[sanitation]] system, though there may be water pipes passing through the settlement. Electric power is sometimes taken directly from the grid using illegal connections, which are {{linktext|perforce}} accepted by suppliers.

The villas range from small groups of precarious houses to larger, more organized communities with thousands of residents. In rural areas, the houses in the ''villas miserias'' might be made of mud and wood. Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], among others. The villas draw people from several backgrounds. Some are local citizens who have fallen from an already precarious [[economy of Argentina|economic]] position. In most cases, a villa miseria is populated by the children and grandchildren of the original settlers, who have been unable to improve their economic status.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

Villas miseria are known to house criminals, from minor thieves to drug dealers, because the houses are typically safe from police and they are really cheap and easy to acquire.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

These shantytowns are [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called ''asentamientos'' ("settlements") or ''villas de emergencia'' ("emergency villages"). In most parts of Argentina, the non-modified word ''villa'' usually refers to a ''villa miseria''.

Argentinian painter [[Antonio Berni]] dealt with the hardships of living in a villa miseria through his series ''Juanito Laguna'', a slum child, and ''Ramona Montiel'', a prostitute.

The Argentinian writer Hugo Pezzini, in his book, The Latin American Literature of the Neoliberal Crisis: The Emergence of a Postmodern Post-hegemonic Heterotopy (Amsterdam: Universiteit van Amsterdam - Cultural Analysis Summer Academy, 2013), commenting on writer César Aira's 2001 novel La Villa says the following: 
"The apparent absurdity of César Aira's novel La Villa provides an instance of resourceful mediation to semantically reorganize a situation of emergency and locate it within its particular rationale. In Argentina, a slum is popularly called 'villa miseria,' or simply 'la villa.' In politically correct language, that is, officially, is called 'villa de emergencia.'” 
The slum of Aria's La Villa is an organized-organic post-hegemonic microcosm whose symbols and rational design are only understood by its post-hegemonic inhabitants, who are also its architects and engineers. To them their semantics are perfectly logical and knowable."

==Statistics and programs==
[[Image:Potrero (2).jpg|thumb|right|240px|Improvised football match in a FONAVI development in [[Villa Lugano]], [[Buenos Aires]]. The agency has put up over a million housing units since 1972.]]
According to July 2004 estimates, there are about 640 "precarious neighborhoods" in suburban Buenos Aires, comprising 690,000 residents and 111,000 households. The population of the villas miseria in the city of Buenos Aires doubled during the 1990s, reaching about 120,000 as of 2005.

Attempting to address this problem, ''de facto'' President [[Alejandro Lanusse]] established the National Housing Fund (FONAVI) in 1972. An amalgam of long-standing national housing programs and lending facilities previously managed by the National Mortgage Bank, the FONAVI helped coordinate [[slum clearance]] efforts and, since then, has put up over 25,000 housing units a year (both single-family and multi-family types).&lt;ref name=wb&gt;Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth. World Bank, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Granting deeds on a lease-to-own basis, the fund mostly provides for households in Argentina's lowest income bracket and, thus, has historically had a collection rate of less than five per cent. The fund, one of the most important in [[Latin America]], is largely underwritten by national fuel and other [[excise tax]]es.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt;
