      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9215">The '''100 Year Starship''' ('''100YSS''') is a joint U.S. [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) grant project to a private entity.  The goal of the study is not to have the government fund the actual building of spacecraft, but rather to create a business plan that can last 100 years in order to help foster the research needed for [[interstellar travel]].&lt;ref name="NYT-Aug-2011"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/science/space/18starship.html?pagewanted=all |title=Offering Funds, U.S. Agency Dreams of Sending Humans to Stars |first=Dennis |last=Overbye |date=August 18, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chang2011&gt;{{Cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/science/space/18starship.html |title=Not Such a Stretch to Reach for the Stars |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belfiore 2011"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Michael |last=Belfiore |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/deep/to-infinity-and-beyond-at-darpas-100-year-starship-symposium |title=To Infinity and Beyond at DARPA’s 100-Year Starship Symposium |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The 100 Year Starship effort was announced by NASA [[Ames Research Center]] director [[Pete Worden]] in a talk at San Francisco's Long Conversation conference in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brandon|first1=John|title=Is NASA Covering Up the 100-Year Starship?|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/10/29/nasa-cover-up-hundred-year-starship/|accessdate=18 June 2014|publisher=[[FoxNews.com]]|date=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a DARPA press release officially announcing the effort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DARPA/NASA Seek to Inspire Multigenerational Research and Development|url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1799|publisher=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|accessdate=18 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810105006/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1799|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; program manager [[Paul Eremenko]], who served as the study coordinator, explained that the endeavor was meant to excite several generations to commit to the research and development of breakthrough technologies to advance the eventual goal of interstellar space travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Page|first1=Lewis|title=DARPA, NASA team on '100-Year Starship' project: plan to invent Heinlein style miracle nonprofit first|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/03/100_year_starship/|accessdate=18 June 2014|publisher=[[The Register]]|date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The 100 Year Starship study was the name of a one-year project to assess the attributes of and lay the groundwork for an organization that can carry forward the 100 Year Starship vision.&lt;ref name= "2012symposium"&gt;{{cite web|title= 100 Year Starship Study™ 2012 Public Symposium |url=http://www.100yss.org/pdf/100YSSAgenda_0902.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227203817/http://www.100yss.org/pdf/100YSSAgenda_0902.pdf | archivedate=February 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "january"&gt;{{cite web|title= The 100-Year Starship Study |url=http://www.100yss.org/pdf/100YSS_January_Synopsis.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203110443/http://www.100yss.org/pdf/100YSS_January_Synopsis.pdf | archivedate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning bid to spearhead the 100 Year Starship effort was the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, partnering with [[Icarus Interstellar]] and the [[Foundation for Enterprise Development]], led by the American physician and former NASA astronaut [[Mae Jemison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2199247/The-100-year-Starship-project-plans-transport-humans-solar-system.html|title=The 100-year Starship project that plans to transport humans beyond the solar system|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|language=English|author=Mark Prigg|date=6 September 2012|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=Former astronaut to lead starship effort| first=Sharon |last=Weinberger| date=5 January 2012| work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=21 May 2014| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16427876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=21212 |first=Paul |last=Gilster |title=100 Year Starship Winner Announced |date=6 January 2012 |work=Centauri Dreams |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the consortium was awarded a $500,000 grant for further work. The new organization maintains the organizational name 100 Year Starship.&lt;ref name=atlantic201202&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/project-icarus-laying-the-plans-for-interstellar-travel/253335/ |title=Project Icarus: Laying the Plans for Interstellar Travel |first=Ross |last=Andersen |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |date=February 2012 |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Icarus Interstellar nor the Foundation for Enterprise Development are any longer involved{{since when|date=November 2018}} in 100 Year Starship although initial grant negotiations took place.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==100 Year Starship Symposia==
Before the solicitation for the foundation, the 100 Year Starship project was preceded by a conference held in [[Orlando, Florida]], from September 30 to October 2, 2011, co-sponsored by DARPA and NASA, organized by DARPA's Tactical Technology Office director, David Neyland.&lt;ref name=Chang2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Belfiore 2011"/&gt; The conference included presentations on the technology, biology, physics, philosophy, sociology, and economics of interstellar flight.&lt;ref name= "2012symposium"/&gt; Selected papers from the conference were published in the [[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]].{{clarify|date=November 2018}}&lt;!-- a source link to the journal issue that had these would be appropriate here --&gt;

After the Jemison Foundation was named as winner of the grant, a second symposium was held in 2012 in [[Houston]]. Papers on a number of subjects related to interstellar flight and organization of the foundation were presented.&lt;ref name= "2012symposium" /&gt; 2013 and 2014 Symposia were held in Houston,&lt;ref name=100yss2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://100yss.org/symposium/2014 |title=100 Year Simposium 2014 |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fifth on September 2015.{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{update after|2018|11|26}}

== Canopus Awards ==
In 2015, the 100 Year Starship project hosted its first annual Canopus Awards for excellence in interstellar writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://100yss.org/news/press |title=100 Year Starship Celebrates Halloween Eve Awarding First Interstellar Writing Prize During Science Fiction Stories Night |date=20 October 2015 |work=100yss.org |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winners were announced October 30, 2015 at the symposium:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Locus Online News » Canopus Award Winners| url = http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/11/canopus-award-winners/| website = www.locusmag.com| accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The 100 Year Starship was named in 2012 by U.S. [[Senator Tom Coburn]] as one of the 100 most wasteful government spending projects. Coburn specifically cited a 100 Year Starship workshop that included one session, entitled “Did Jesus die for [[Klingons]] too?” that debated the implications for Christian philosophy should life be found on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/nov/15/pentagon-wants-know-did-jesus-die-klingons-too/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/id/49844670&lt;/ref&gt; The original meetings were hard science; not so for the ones that followed under Jemison's leadership.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A.3.1 pg 341, AMPAC|isbn=978-0-471-33368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed originally by [[Michael J. S. Dewar|Michael Dewar]] and his group.

The first version of AMPAC (2.1) was made available in 1985 through the Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080515221811/http://qcpe.chem.indiana.edu/ QCPE]).  Subsequent versions were released through the same source, representing minor updates and optimized versions for other platforms.

In 1992, [http://www.semichem.com Semichem, Inc.] was formed at Professor Dewar's urging to maintain and market the program.  '''''AMPAC 4.0 with Graphical User Interface''''' was released in August of that year.  Semichem's current version of AMPAC is 9.2.

AMPAC current implements the [[SAM1]], [[Austin Model 1|AM1]], [[MNDO]], [[MNDO|MNDO/d]], [[PM3 (chemistry)|PM3]], [[MNDO]]C [[MINDO|MINDO/3]], RM1 and [[PM6]] semi-empirical methods.  See [http://www.semichem.com/ampac/default.php this page] for a detailed description of AMPAC's current capabilities.

'''App Academy''' is a twelve-week intensive [[computer programming]] school founded by Ned Ruggeri and Kush Patel.

==Overview==
Introduced in 2012, App Academy’s "job-guaranteed"&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2013/03/free-learn-to-code-boot-camp/]&lt;/ref&gt; financing model demonstrates a tuition-free structure that promises individuals a career at the conclusion of the program.

App Academy, as of 2014, reported an acceptance rate of about 5%.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/03/13/have-liberal-arts-degree-will-code/]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who applied for the program ranged from "top Ivy League graduates to someone who used to be a night janitor."&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/24/learn-to-code-boot-camps-open-doors-for-talented-graduates/]&lt;/ref&gt; During the admissions process, students are required to complete introductory level coding work to show programmer potential, however, applicants do not need to have prior coding experience to apply.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; Once accepted, students can expect to allocate 90–100 hours per week for coding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/22/app_academy_s_innovative_financial_model_commission_based_education.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum covers the full stack of web development, but primarily focuses on [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Javascript]] while spending substantial time on [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], Flux, [[JQuery]] and [[SQL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appacademy.io/#p-curriculum]&lt;/ref&gt; App Academy also provides job assistance for life, allowing students to learn new languages although they have graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/course/finding-a-job#3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130012324/http://www.appacademy.io/course/finding-a-job |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

App Academy’s 12-week program is broken into 3 sections with over 500 hours of instructional time for every student who attends the course;

Weeks 1-5: Begins with introductory level programming concepts, and results in a deeper understanding of [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[SQL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/1-5#1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129222424/http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/1-5 |archivedate=2016-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks 6-9: Introduces [[Javascript]], [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], and Flux, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/6-9#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129185604/http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/6-9 |archivedate=2016-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks 10-12: Focuses on advanced algorithms and the job search. The job search curriculum focuses on resume help, [[whiteboarding]], technical interview training, salary negotiation and culminates in a hiring day for graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/10-12#3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130005408/http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum/weeks/10-12 |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout a day at App Academy, students are given a lecture at the beginning of every session, with the majority of the time being allocated to projects and [[pair programming]].&lt;ref name="appacademy.io"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/course/day-in-the-life#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130055335/http://www.appacademy.io/course/day-in-the-life |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 9:00am–12:00pm, students start off the day with introductory lectures for the concepts to be learned that day. From 12:00pm–1:00pm, students are given a break to relax and connect with their colleagues. Afterwards, students begin pair-programming and work on collaborative projects together until the end of the working day, allowing individuals to talk through problems together to find collective solutions.&lt;ref name="appacademy.io"/&gt;

Additionally, App Academy offers tutoring for potential applicants who seek assistance during the admissions process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.appacademy.io/students/tutoring]&lt;/ref&gt; Tutors are instructors from the App Academy Staff and tutoring can range from teaching coding fundamentals to advanced concepts within the full-time program.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Some of App Academy’s graduates have reportedly found a job within 3 weeks of interviewing.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/&gt; After finding a job as a software engineer, App Academy collects a fee of 18% of the graduate’s first year’s salary.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/&gt;

==Location==
In 2015, App Academy was located in the [[South of Market]] district of [[San Francisco]] and near [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] in [[Manhattan]], New York.

As of January 2016, App Academy's San Francisco Location has moved to 160 Spear Street inside the [[Financial District]].

==Founding==
[[File:Kushatwork.jpg|thumb|Kush interviewing an applicant]]
Ned Ruggeri and Kush Patel met at the [[University Of Chicago]], where Ruggeri studied Mathematics and Patel majored in Economics. Prior to App Academy, Ruggeri worked for [[Google]] on the [[search engine indexing]] team and Patel worked at a [[hedge fund]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appacademy.io/#p-staff|title=Apps Academy - Staff|publisher=Appacademy.io|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they started App Academy in an effort to allow programming education "while making it affordable and accessible to everyone." In an interview with Patel, he explains the initial structure of App Academy, stating the need to teach "as much language and framework agnostic software development as we can."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coursereport.com/schools/app-academy#/news/interview-with-kush-patel-founder-of-app-academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2012, App Academy has been featured in sources such as [[Slate magazine]] and [[VentureBeat]], reflecting Ruggeri and Patel’s mission of "finding the most cost-effective way possible of providing credible training."&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2014/01/30/california-bootcamp-will-work-with-regulator-whatever-the-cost-its-worth-it-to-satisfy-the-state-interview/]&lt;/ref&gt; Kush reported to Yahoo News stating the need to "give [students] real-world skills they can use and actually get them a job."&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt; "If they can’t find a job, we’ve screwed up somehow." says Patel.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;

Through an interview with ''[[Financial Times]]'', Joshua Penman, a graduate of App Academy, explained that the boot camp model "is attractive because it is so short and provides people with real skills."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ac5afa80-3ce6-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152.html#axzz3yfAAcdMF]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, many individuals who enrolled in the first class at App Academy did not have enough capital to "invest in themselves."&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; However, since then, applicants are seen to come from diverse backgrounds, whether it be individuals who have followed traditional college endeavors or individuals wanting a mid-career change.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;

{{Science|applied}}
'''Applied science''' is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like [[technology]] or inventions.

Within [[natural science]], disciplines that are [[basic science]], also called '''pure science''', develop basic ''[[information]]'' to 
predict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields from [[engineering]], [[business]], [[medicine]] to [[early childhood education]].

Applied science can also apply [[formal science]], such as [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], as in [[epidemiology]]. [[Genetic epidemiology]] is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.

==Applied research==
Applied research is the practical application of [[science]]. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, [[State (polity)|state-]], [[Commerce|business-]], or [[customer|client-]]driven purpose.  Applied research is contrasted with [[pure research]] (basic research) in discussion about research ideals, methodologies, programs, and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last = Roll-Hansen|first = Nils|url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62f0/dced123c24c7bc89b7d0d72bfcf885634a43.pdf|title = Why the distinction between basic (theoretical) and applied (practical) research is important in the politics of science|date=April 2009|accessdate = September 13, 2018|format = PDF|publisher = The London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Applied research deals with solving practical problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a definition of applied research |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/research-main.html |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818065432/http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/research-main.html |archivedate=August 18, 2011 }}{{Link note|note = The site appears to be available, but returns a 'forbidden' response, suggesting that only certain IP ranges or recognized accounts might have access.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally employs [[empirical]] methodologies. Because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it may be impossible to use a [[random sample]]. Thus, transparency in the [[methodology]] is crucial. Implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional [[conceptual framework]] such as [[working hypotheses]] or pillar questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M.

==Branches of applied science==
{{Outline|Outline of applied science#Branches of applied science}}

Engineering fields include [[thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[mechanics of materials]], [[kinematics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[materials science]], [[earth sciences]], [[engineering physics]].

[[Medical sciences]], for instance [[medical microbiology]] and [[clinical virology]], are applied sciences that apply [[biology]] toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessarily medical technology, whose development is more specifically [[biomedicine]] or [[biomedical engineering]].

==In education==
In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (BASc) is equivalent to the [[Bachelor of Engineering]], and is classified as a professional degree.  The BASc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences.  In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree.

In [[Education in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom's educational system]], Applied Science refers to a suite of "vocational" science qualifications that run alongside "traditional" [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] or [[A-Level]] Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/An%20invisible%20revolution_Applied%20Science%20in%20the%2014_19%20curriculum.pdf|format=pdf |title=Applied Science - an invisible revolution? |first=Jim |last=Donnelly |publisher=[[Nuffield Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Science courses generally contain more coursework (also known as portfolio or internally assessed work) compared to their traditional counterparts. These are an evolution of the GNVQ qualifications that were offered up to 2005.
These courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the Wolf Report 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011 |title=Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report|first=Alison|last=Wolf |date=March 2011 |docket=DFE-00031-2011|publisher=Department for Education and Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however, their merits are argued elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Jacqueline|last=Bell|first2=Jim|last2=Donnelly|title=Positioning Applied Science In Schools: Uncertainty, Opportunity and Risk in Curriculum Reform |url=http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003001238/http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf|format=pdf|archive-date=3 October 2011|agency=Centre for Studies in Science &amp; Mathematics Education |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2007 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] offers an [[Minor (academic)|undergraduate minor]] as well as [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in "applied science." Courses and research cover varied fields including [[neuroscience]], [[optics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[nondestructive testing]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/ |publisher=William &amp; Mary |title=Applied Science |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the Bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of Cornell-Technion $100 million in City capital to construct the universities' proposed Applied Sciences campus on Roosevelt Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Mayor Bloomberg, Cornell President Skorton and Technion President Lavie announce historic partnership to build a new applied sciences campus on Roosevelt Island |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr444-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |location= |publisher=The City of New York |agency=Office of the Mayor |date=19 December 2011 |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">The '''Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness''' ('''ASSC''') is a professional membership organization that aims to encourage research on [[consciousness]] in [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], and other relevant disciplines in the sciences and humanities, directed toward understanding the nature, function, and underlying mechanisms of consciousness.

==History==
The organization was created in 1994 in Berkeley immediately after the first Tucson meeting by [[Patrick Wilken]]. The original aim of the organization was to act as a framework by which the international academic community could generate meetings devoted to the academic study of consciousness. The original founding members included [[Bernard Baars]], William Banks, George Buckner, [[David Chalmers]], Stanley Klein, Bruce Mangan, Thomas Metzinger, David Rosenthal, and Patrick Wilken. Since 1994 the organization has put on eleven meetings and assumed many other activities, including an e-print archive and the online journal ''Psyche''.

In 2008 the executive committee of the association was composed as follows: [[Michael Gazzaniga]] (Past-President), David Rosenthal (President), [[Giulio Tononi]] (President-Elect); and six Members-at-Large, [[Christof Koch]], Paula Droege, [[John-Dylan Haynes]], Susana Martinez-Conde, and Alva Noë. In 2007 Christof Koch took over as Director and Chair of the Board from Patrick Wilken.

==Activities==
Since 1997, the ASSC has organised annual conferences to promote interaction and spread knowledge of scientific and philosophical advances in the field of consciousness research. The 2008 meeting was organized by Allen Houng and Ralph Adolphs, and held between the 19th and 22 June at the Gis Convention Center, National Taiwan University in Taipei. The June 2009 meeting was held in Berlin, and organized by Patrick Wilken and Michael Pauen.

In addition to organizing annual meetings, the association promotes the academic study of consciousness in a number of other ways:

* The official journal of the society is the open-access journal [http://nc.oxfordjournals.org/ Neuroscience of Consciousness].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience of Consciousness|url=http://nc.oxfordjournals.org/|website=nc.oxfordjournals.org/|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 January 2015|ref=NCONSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The association published the open-access journal [[Psyche (consciousness journal)|''Psyche'']] until 2010.

'''Balchen Glacier''' ({{Coord|76|23|S|145|10|W|source:GNIS}}) is a crevassed [[glacier]] in [[Antarctica]], flowing west to [[Block Bay]] between the [[Phillips Mountains]] and the [[Fosdick Mountains]] in [[Marie Byrd Land]]. It was discovered on December 5, 1929, by the [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition]] and named by [[Richard E. Byrd]] for [[Bernt Balchen]], chief pilot of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://geographic.org/geographic_names/antname.php?uni=884&amp;fid=antgeo_102 | title = Balchen Glacier | website = Geographical names | accessdate = 16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brief Answers to the Big Questions''''' is a [[Popular science|popular-science]] [[book]] written by [[physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]], and published by [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] ([[Hardcover]]) and [[Bantam Books]] ([[Paperback]]) on 16 October 2018. The book examines some of the [[universe]]{{’s}} greatest mysteries, and promotes the view that [[science]] is very important in helping to solve problems on planet [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20181015"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[AP News]] |title=In Posthumous Message, Hawking Says Science Under Threat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/10/15/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-stephen-hawking.html |date=15 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP-20181015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stanley-Becker |first=Isaac |title=Stephen Hawking feared race of ‘superhumans’ able to manipulate their own DNA |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/15/stephen-hawking-feared-race-of-superhumans-able-to-manipulate-their-own-dna/ |date=15 October 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Millard |first=Robin |title=Hawking's final book offers brief answers to big questions |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-10-hawking-big.html |date=15 October 2018 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QZ-20181014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Haldevang |first=Max de |title=Stephen Hawking left us bold predictions on AI, superhumans, and aliens |url=https://qz.com/1423685/stephen-hawking-says-superhumans-will-take-over-ai-is-a-threat-and-humans-will-conquer-space/ |date=14 October 2018 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IND-20180516"&gt;{{cite news |last=Griffin |first=Andrew |title=Stephen Hawking's final work will try to answer some of the biggest questions in the universe - Book will collect the late professor's most profound and celebrated writings |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-book-final-death-latest-big-questions-universe-discovery-a8354301.html |date=16 May 2018 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher describes the book as "a selection of [Hawking's] most profound, accessible, and timely reflections from his personal archive",&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IND-20180516" /&gt; and included, according to a book reviewer, drawing upon "half a million or so words" from his essays, lectures and keynote speeches.&lt;ref name="TG-20181019" /&gt; The book was incomplete at the time of the author's passing in March 2018, but was completed with “his academic colleagues, his family and the Stephen Hawking Estate”.&lt;ref name="PW-0181016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Durrani |first=Matin |title=Stephen Hawking’s final book: a review of Brief Answers to the Big Questions |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/stephen-hawkings-final-book-a-review-of-brief-answers-to-the-big-questions/ |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Physics World]]  |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A foreword to the book was written by [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar-winning actor]] who portrayed Stephen Hawking in the 2014 film, [[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|''The Theory of Everything'']]; an introduction by [[Kip Thorne]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel-prize winning physicist]]; and an afterword by [[Lucy Hawking]], the author's daughter.&lt;ref name="AMZ-2018"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Brief Answers to the Big Questions – Hardcover – October 16, 2018 by Stephen Hawking |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984819194 |date=2018 |work=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the royalties from the book are to go to the [[Motor Neurone Disease Association]] and the Stephen Hawking Foundation.&lt;ref name="PW-0181016" /&gt;

==Contents==
The book is divided into four sections: "Why Are We Here? Will We Survive? Will [[Technology]] Save Us or Destroy Us? How Can We Thrive?".&lt;ref name="IND-20180516" /&gt; 
[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]]&lt;br&gt;(1980s)&lt;/center&gt;]]
The ten big questions that are considered include: Is there a [[God]]? How did it all [[Big Bang|begin]]? What is inside a [[black hole]]? Can we predict the [[future]]? Is [[time travel]] possible? Will we [[History of Earth|survive on Earth]]? Is there other [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent life]] in the universe? Should we [[Space colonization|colonise space]]? Will [[artificial intelligence]] outsmart us? How do we shape the [[Future of Earth|future]]?&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181015" /&gt; 

The book discusses many of today's challenges, including the [[Global catastrophic risk|biggest threat]] to the planet (an "[[Asteroid impact avoidance|asteroid collision]]", like the one that [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago]] ... "[[Asteroid impact avoidance|we have no defense]]” against that),&lt;ref name="WP-20181015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QZ-20181014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180618"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bogdan |first=Dennis |title=Comment - Better Way To Avoid Devastating Asteroids Needed? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/science/asteroids-nasa-nathan-myhrvold.html#permid=27500228:27506217 |date=18 June 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=19 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[climate change]] (“a rise in [[ocean]] temperature would melt the ice caps and cause the release of large amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] ... [making] our [[climate]] like that of [[Venus]] with a temperature of {{convert|250|C|F|abbr=on}}"), the threat of [[nuclear war]] ("at some point in the next 1,000 years, nuclear war or environmental calamity will 'cripple Earth'"), [[nuclear power]] ("that would give us [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]] with no [[pollution]] or [[global warming]]"), the development of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI)  (“in the future AI could develop a will of its own, a will that is in conflict with ours”) and [[human]]s ("a genetically-modified race of [[superhuman]]s, say with greater [[memory]] and [[disease]] resistance, would imperil the others").&lt;ref name="AMZ-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QZ-20181014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-20181016" /&gt; 

The book also discusses the "big questions", including [[life]] ("in the next 50 years, we will come to understand [[Abiogenesis|how life began]] and possibly discover whether [[Extraterrestrial life|life exists elsewhere]] in the universe"), [[time]] (“You can’t get to a time before the Big Bang [because] there was no time before the Big Bang ... If the concept of time only exists within our universe and the universe came to be spontaneously ... and with it, brought time into existence, there’s simply no 'before' to consider. Further, Hawking believed the universe could reach an end point, either through an eventual cosmic "crunch or an expansion" ... "In the interim ... We are all time travelers, journeying together into the future. But let us make that future a place we want to visit”),&lt;ref name="QZ-20181116" /&gt; the possibility of [[time travel]] (“asking if time travel is possible is a 'very serious question' that our current understanding cannot rule out"),&lt;ref name="TC-20181109"&gt;{{cite web |last=Millington |first=Peter |title=Stephen Hawking’s final book suggests time travel may one day be possible – here’s what to make of it |url=https://theconversation.com/stephen-hawkings-final-book-suggests-time-travel-may-one-day-be-possible-heres-what-to-make-of-it-106566 |date=9 November 2018 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |accessdate=10 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[God]] (“knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature ... My prediction is that we will know the mind of God by the end of this century”&lt;ref name="QZ-20181116"&gt;{{cite news |last=Livni |first=Ephrat |title=Please allow Stephen Hawking to explain time, history, and God |url=https://qz.com/1464626/please-allow-stephen-hawking-to-explain-time-history-and-god/ |date=17 November 2018 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=16 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; further, "if you like, you can call the [[Scientific law|laws of science]] ‘God,’ but it wouldn’t be a [[personal God]] that you would meet and put questions to ... [nevertheless] the simplest explanation is that [[Existence of God|God does not exist]] and there is no reliable evidence for an [[afterlife]], though people could live on through their [[Social influence|influence]] and [[Heredity|gene]]s").&lt;ref name="AMZ-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QZ-20181014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Picheta |first=Rob |title='There is no God,' says Stephen Hawking in final book |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/16/health/stephen-hawking-final-book-intl/index.html |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[CNN News]] |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Hawking in the book, [[education]] and [[science]] are "in danger now more than ever before", and urged [[Youth|young people]] "to look up at the [[star]]s and not down at your feet ... Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist ... It matters that you don't give up. Unleash your [[imagination]]. [[Timeline of the near future|Shape the future]]."&lt;ref name="NYT-20181015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-20181016" /&gt;

[[Physicist]] [[Marcelo Gleiser]], reviewing the book for [[NPR]], writes: "Stephen Hawking is one of those rare luminaries whose life symbolizes the best humanity has to offer ... [his book is one] every thinking person worried about humanity's future should read ... If there is a unifying theme across the book, it is Hawking's deep faith in science's ability to solve humanity's biggest problems ... His answers to the big questions illustrate his belief in the rationality of nature and on our ability to uncover all its secrets. His optimism permeates every page ... Although Hawking touches on the origin of the universe, the physics of black holes and some of his other favorite topics, his main concern in this book is not physics. It's humanity and its collective future ... Focusing his attention in the book on three related questions — the future of our planet, colonization of other planets, and the rise of artificial intelligence — he charts his strategy to save us from ourselves ... Only science, Hawking argues, can save us from our mistakes ... Hawking believes that humanity's evolutionary mission is to spread through the galaxy as a sort of cosmic gardener, sowing life along the way. He believes ... that we will develop a positive relation with intelligent machines and that, together, we will redesign the current fate of the world and of our species."&lt;ref name="NPR-20181016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleiser |first=Marcelo |title='Brief Answers To The Big Questions' Is Stephen Hawking's Parting Gift To Humanity |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/16/657526628/brief-answers-to-the-big-questions-is-stephen-hawkings-parting-gift-to-humanity |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to award-winning science editor [[Tim Radford]], writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Hawking's book is "effortlessly instructive, absorbing, up to the minute and – where it matters – witty." Radford quotes Hawking, “If the universe adds up to nothing, then you don’t need a God to create it. The universe is the ultimate free lunch"; "our worst mistake ever" [if we are dismissive about artificial intelligence]; “Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins." and "If humanity is to continue for another million years, our future lies in going boldly [with more manned space exploration] where no one else has gone before.” Radford writes, "People who argue for good education for all, a decently funded NHS ([[National Health Service]]) and serious investment in research will rediscover him as a friend."&lt;ref name="TG-20181019"&gt;{{cite news |last=Radford |first=Tim |title=Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking review – God, space, AI, Brexit - This absorbing posthumous book draws on essays, lectures, speeches and the questions the physicist was so often asked |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/19/brief-answers-to-the-big-questions-stephen-hawking-review |date=19 October 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=21 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Abigail Higgins, writing for ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', notes that author Hawking, in the book, is "funny and optimistic, even as he warns us that artificial intelligence is likely to outsmart us, that the wealthy are bound to develop into a superhuman species, and that the planet is hurtling toward total inhabitability ...  [the] book is ultimately a verdict on humanity’s future. At first blush, the verdict is that we’re doomed. But dig deeper and there’s something else here too, a faith that human wisdom and innovation will thwart our own destruction, even when we seem hellbent on bringing it about."&lt;ref name="VX-20181016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Higgins |first=Abigail |title=Stephen Hawking’s final warning for humanity: AI is coming for us - His posthumously published book about our future offers fear and surprising optimism. |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17978596/stephen-hawking-ai-climate-change-robots-future-universe-earth |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a book review by [[Science journalism|science journalist]] Matin Durraniin, current editor of ''[[Physics World]]'': "Hawking ticks off all the big ideas you’d expect from one of his books. [[General relativity]]. [[Big Bang|The Big Bang]]. [[Inflation (cosmology)|Inflation]]. [[Galaxy formation and evolution|Galaxy formation]]. [[Gravitational waves]] ... This book will stand as Hawking’s manifesto. Optimistic, upbeat and visionary, it sees science – and scientific understanding – as vital for the [[Global catastrophic risk|future of humanity]]."&lt;ref name="PW-0181016" /&gt;

==Criticism==
According to [[John Horgan (journalist)|John Horgan]], science journalist writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Hawking, in his book, prefers [[string theory]] as a way of explaining the "[[theory of everything]]" (which Hawking predicts to be solved  by "the end of this century") and, based on [[quantum mechanics]], considers [[Vacuum state|empty space]] as filled with [[virtual particles]], "popping into and out of existence", suggesting our entire universe began as one of those particles, and additionally, that our [[cosmos]] is "just a miniscule bubble in an infinite ocean, or '[[multiverse]]'". In this regard, Horgan refers to the concern of German physicist [[Sabine Hossenfelder]], in her 2018 book ''"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray"'', that "physicists working on strings and multiverses are not really practicing physics," and quotes Hossenfelder, “I’m not sure anymore that what we do here, in the foundations of physics, is science”.&lt;ref name="WSJ-20181018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Horgan |first=John |title=‘Brief Answers to the Big Questions’ and ‘On the Future’ Review: Serious Doubt on Serious Earth - We’re still waiting to solve the riddle of existence—with no sign today’s physicists are on the right track |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brief-answers-to-the-big-questions-and-on-the-future-review-serious-doubt-on-serious-earth-1539909146 |date=18 October 2018 |accessdate=21 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to [[Ephrat Livni]] writing for [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]], Hawking believed "The law of nature itself tell us that not only could the universe have popped into existence without any assistance, like a proton, and have required nothing in terms of energy, but also it is possible that nothing caused the Big Bang. Nothing."&lt;ref name="QZ-20181116" /&gt;

Jon Christian, writing for ''Futurism'' and published in ''Science Alert'', notes that Hawking, in his book, makes several predictions, including predictions about [[CRISPR|gene editing]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[religion]], with which some experts may not fully agree.&lt;ref name="SA-20181021"&gt;{{cite web |last=Christian |first=Jon |title=From Beyond The Grave, Hawking Issues His Final Predictions on God And Superhumans.

However, it does show us the importance of our future, the 'Big Questions' and the growing necessity of looking after our planet."&lt;ref name="EL-20181018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Guedim |first=Zayan |title=Stephen Hawking’s “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” |url=https://edgylabs.com/10-big-questions-in-stephen-hawkings-latest-book |date=18 October 2018 |work=EdgyLabs.com |accessdate=21 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

See below the section "In fiction".--&gt; is the fringe of [[astronomy]] and branch of [[cartography]] concerned with mapping [[star]]s, [[galaxies]], and other [[astronomical object]]s on the [[celestial sphere]]. Measuring the position and light of charted objects requires a variety of instruments and techniques. These techniques have developed from angle measurements with [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s and the [[naked-eye|unaided eye]], through [[sextant]]s combined with lenses for light magnification, up to current methods which include computer-automated [[space telescope]]s. Uranographers have historically produced [[ephemeris|planetary position tables]], star tables, and [[star chart|star maps]] for use by both [[amateur astronomy|amateur]] and professional astronomers. More recently computerized star maps have been compiled, and [[GoTo telescope|automated positioning]] of [[telescope]]s is accomplished using databases of stars and other astronomical objects.

==Etymology==
The word "uranography" derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "ουρανογραφια" ([[Koine Greek]] ''ουρανος'' "sky, heaven" + ''γραφειν'' "to write") through the [[Latin]] ''"uranographia"''.  In Renaissance times, ''Uranographia'' was used as the book title of various [[Star cartography#Star atlases|celestial atlases]].&lt;ref&gt;1690: Hevelius J., ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive &lt;u&gt;Uranographia&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c. 1750: [[John Bevis|Bevis J.]], ''&lt;u&gt;Uranographia&lt;/u&gt; Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1801: Bode. J. E., ''&lt;u&gt;Uranographia&lt;/u&gt; sive Astrorum Descriptio''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, "uranography" was defined as the "description of the heavens". Elijah H. Burritt re-defined it as the "geography of the heavens".&lt;ref&gt;Burritt, E. H., ''The Geography of the Heavens'', 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; The German word for uranography is "''Uranographie''", the French is "''uranographie''" and the Italian is "''uranografia''".

A determining fact source for drawing star charts is naturally a star table. This is apparent when comparing the imaginative "star maps" of ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' – illustrations beside a narrative text from the antiquity – to the star maps of [[Johann Bayer]], based on precise star-position measurements from the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' by [[Tycho Brahe]].

===Important historical star tables===
* c:AD 150, ''[[Almagest]]'' – contains the last known star table from antiquity, prepared by [[Ptolemy]], 1,028 stars.
* c.964, ''[[Book of Fixed Stars|Book of the Fixed Stars]]'', Arabic version of the ''Almagest'' by [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi|al-Sufi]].
* 1627, ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' – contains the first West Enlightenment star table, based on measurements of [[Tycho Brahe]], 1,005 stars.
* 1690, ''[[Prodromus Astronomiae]]'' – by [[Johannes Hevelius]] for his ''Firmamentum Sobiescanum'', 1,564 stars.
* 1729, ''Britannic Catalogue'' – by [[John Flamsteed]] for his [[Atlas Coelestis]], position of more than 3,000 stars by accuracy of 10".
* 1903, ''[[Bonner Durchmusterung]]'' – by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander]] and collaborators, circa 460,000 stars.

A '''communal garden''' (often used in the plural as '''communal gardens''') is a (normally formal) [[garden]] for shared use by a number of local residents, typically in an urban setting. The term is especially used in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Business/Environment/Communalgardens/ Communal gardens], [[Glasgow]], UK {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712062559/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Business/Environment/Communalgardens/ |date=July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of many city squares and crescents (especially in [[London]], for example) are maintained as communal gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensquares.org/detail/index.html?../detail/ArundelElgin.html Arundel &amp; Elgin Communal Gardens]{{dead link|date= August 2017 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, and the fact that they typically look like small [[public park]]s, such gardens are normally privately or jointly owned, with sharing of maintenance costs. Access may be restricted by locked gates, with keys available for residents, or only unlocked during daytime. They are often surrounded by tall railings designed{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to keep people out.

One of the scenes in the 1999 film [[Notting Hill (film)| ''Notting Hill'']] involves the two main characters, Anna ([[Julia Roberts]]) and William ([[Hugh Grant]]), breaking into private and locked communal gardens by climbing over the wall at night after a dinner party. The communal gardens used were [[Rosmead Gardens]] in Rosmead Road, [[Notting Hill]], London.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Continental shelf.png|thumb|Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise]]
The '''continental margin''' is of the three major zones of the ocean floor, the other two being [[ocean basin|deep-ocean basins]] and [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. The continental margin is the shallow water area found in proximity to continent.&lt;ref name="pjccc"&gt;P. J. Cook, Chris Carleton (2000) "Continental Shelf Limits: The Scientific and Legal Interface", {{ISBN|0-19-511782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The continental margin consists of three different features: the [[continental rise]], the [[continental slope]], and the [[continental shelf]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/815043823|title=Essentials of oceanography|last=V.|first=Thurman, Harold|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780321668127|oclc=815043823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.[[Continental margin#cite note-pjccc-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The continental shelf is the portion of the continental margin that transitions from the shore out towards to ocean. They are believed to make up 7 percent of the sea floor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continental margins : geological and geophysical research needs and problems|last=Board.|first=National Research Council (U.S.). Ocean Sciences|date=1979-01-01|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|isbn=0309027934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of continental shelves worldwide varies from a 30 meters to 1500 kilometers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Earth|last=Grotzinger|first=Jordan|publisher=W H Freeman|year=2007|isbn=978-0716766827|location=|pages=491–496}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally flat, and ends at the [[shelf break]], where there is a drastic increase in slope angle. The mean slope of continental shelves worldwide is 0'''°''' 07’ degrees, and typically steeper closer to the coastline than it is near the shelf break.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coastal and Submarine Morphology|last=Gulicher|first=Andre|publisher=Butler &amp; Tanner Ltd|year=1958|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=205–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the shelf break begins the continental slope, which can be one to five kilometers above the deep-ocean floor. The continental slope often exhibits features called [[submarine canyon]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Submarine canyons often cut into the continental shelves deeply, with near vertical slopes, and continue to cut the morphology to the [[abyssal plain]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The valleys are often V-shaped, and can sometime enlarge onto the continental shelf. At the base of the continental slope, there is a sudden decrease in slope, and the sea floor begins to level out towards the abyssal plain. This portion of the seafloor is called the [[continental rise]], and marks the end of the continental margin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==

There are two types of continental margins: ''[[Active margin|active]]'' and [[Passive margin|''passive'' margins]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Active margins are typically associated with [[Lithospheric plates|lithospheric plate]] boundaries. These active margins can be [[Convergent boundary|convergent]] or [[Transform margin|transform]] margins, and are also places of high tectonic activity, including [[volcano]]es and [[earthquake]]s. The West Coast of North America and South America is considered an active margin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Active continental margins are typically narrow from coast to shelf break, with steep descents into [[Oceanic trench|trenches]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Convergent active margins occur where oceanic plates meet continental plates. The denser oceanic plate [[Subduction|subducts]] below the less dense continental plate. Convergent active margins are the most common type of active margin. Transform active margins are more rare, and occur when an oceanic plate and a continental plate are moving parallel to each other in opposite directions. These transform margins are often characterized by many offshore [[Fault (seismology)|faults]], which causes high degree of relief offshore, marked by [[island]]s, shallow banks, and [[Oceanic basin|deep basins]]. This is known as the [[continental borderland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Passive margins are often located in the interior of lithospheric plates, away from the plate boundaries, and lack major tectonic activity. They often face [[mid-ocean ridge]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The East Coast of the United States is an example of a passive margin. These margins are much wider and less sloped than active margins.

== Sediment accumulation ==

As continental crust weathers and erodes, it degrades into mainly [[sand]]s and [[clay]]s. Many of these particles end up in streams and rivers that then dump into the ocean. Of all the sediment in the stream load, 80% is then trapped and dispersed on continental margins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While modern river sediment is often still preserved closer to shore, continental shelves show high levels of  glacial and relict sediments, deposited when sea level was lower.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often found on passive margins are several kilometers of sediment, consisting of [[Terrigenous sediment|terrigenous]] and carbonate ([[Biogenic substance|biogenous]]) deposits. These sediment reservoirs are often useful in the study of [[paleoceanography]] and the original formation of ocean basins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These deposits are often not well preserved on active margin shelves due to tectonic activity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Economic significance ==
Economically, the continental shelf is the most economically valuable part of the ocean. It often is the most productive portion of the continental margin, as well as the most studied portion, due to its relatively shallow, accessible depths.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the rise of [[offshore drilling]], mining and the limitations of [[Fishery|fisheries]] off the continental shelf, the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|United Nations Convention]] on “Law of the Sea” was established. The edge of the continental margin is one criterion for the boundary of the internationally recognized claims to underwater resources by countries in the definition of the "[[continental shelf]]" by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (although in the UN definition the "legal continental shelf" may extend beyond the geomorphological continental shelf and vice versa).&lt;ref name="pjccc" /&gt; Such resources include fishing grounds, oil and gas accumulations, sand, gravel, and some heavy minerals in the shallower areas of the margin. Metallic minerals resources are thought to also be associated with certain active margins, and of great value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Corbett's electrostatic machine''' is a high voltage [[Electrostatic generator|static electricity generating device]] that was used by [[Shakers|Shaker]] doctors for medical treatment in the early nineteenth century. Corbett's machine is in the collection of the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Village]] in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] USA.

== Thomas Corbett ==
{{main|Thomas Corbett (Shaker doctor)}}

This electrostatic machine was made by a Shaker pharmacist named [[Thomas Corbett (Shaker doctor)|Thomas Corbett]] in 1810 for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=inventions&gt;
{{Citation |last= |first= |year= 1976 |title= Inventions of theShakers|publisher=Popular Mechanics  |publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett was the first physician [[botanist]] for the Shakers and was known for his herbal medicines and unorthodox medical "cures".{{sfn|Swank|1999|page=82}}

== Description ==
[[File:Close-up of metal rake.jpg|thumb|Close-up of metal rake + glass tumbler. Leyden jar storage battery is to the right.]]
Corbett's electrostatic machine consists of a {{convert|0.5|in|adj=on}} wooden base platform sitting on a {{convert|2|in|adj=on}} frame, forming a box. The wooden platform is about {{convert|12|in}} wide and about {{convert|9|in}} deep. To one side of the wooden platform is mounted a small axle on pivots, which holds a rotating glass jar cylinder about the size of a [[Mason jar]]. This glass jar is attached to a crank wheel of about {{convert|5|in}} with a leather belt. The crank wheel can be turned by hand. The wooden platform also contains a [[Leyden jar]]-style battery in one corner, standing some {{convert|9|in}} high. The Leyden jar is a glass receptacle with a metal rod in the center, covered by a metal ball on top which collects and releases a high voltage electrical charge.{{r|Perfection}}

== Operation ==
The crank wheel was turned by an operator using the knob handle and then the glass cylinder would rotate by an attached belt. The glass jar rubbed against a layered silk cloth pad or a textile cloth pad, developing a high-voltage positive electrical charge.&lt;ref name=Niagara&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niagarasciencemuseum.org/franklinWistar.htm |title=Franklin-Wistar Friction Machine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website= |publisher=Niagara Science Museum |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This static electricity charge was taken off the glass cylinder through a small metal rake and transferred by wire to the Leyden jar storage battery for later use (see close-up illustration).&lt;ref name=Perfection&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=860 |title=Thomas Corbett electrostatic machine |author=Sharon Duane Koomler|date=2015 |website=Seeking Perfect – the Shaker's material world |publisher=Antiques and Fine Art|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high voltage stored electrostatic charge kept in the Leyden jar was on the metal ball on top of the high voltage storage battery. It would produce a spark visible to the eye when the set of small metal globes attached to the battery were brought close enough to each other as a test experiment in a discharge.{{sfn|Williams|1971|page=31}}

== Treatment technique ==
The high voltage static charge on top of the Leyden jar storage battery was applied to a patient as he or she sat on a chair or stool atop a special platform. The four glass legs of the chair insulated the platform from the ground. The operator channeled the stored charge from the Leyden jar to the patient using metal attachments that were connected to the patient. The electrical charge produced a shock that was similar to "touching a doorknob after walking across carpet in dry weather".&lt;ref name=Perfection/&gt;

The electrical treatment from Corbett's electrostatic machine supposedly "cured" the sufferer of a variety of illnesses, or at least had some [[Electrotherapeutics|electrotherapeutic]] value.{{sfn|Cohen|1998|page=98}} It was especially designed to treat [[rheumatism]].{{sfn|Cohen|1998|page=98}} More likely, however, the electrical shock temporarily diverted the sufferer's mind from his or her aches and pains.{{sfn|Sprigg|1990|page=121}} Shaker Elizabeth Lovegrove recorded in a journal of 1837 that an Elder Sister was being treated by the Corbett machine. She reported that she felt better after each treatment, at least temporarily.{{sfn|Sprigg|1990|page=121}}

== Electrical principles ==

Corbett's experiments with electricity and its principles shows his interest in science and medicine.{{sfn|Miller|1999|page=45}} The electrostatic machine and his electrical experiments in the early 1800s took place between [[Benjamin Franklin#Electricity|Benjamin Franklin's electrical experiments]] of the mid-1700s and that of [[List of Edison patents|Thomas Edison's electrical inventions]].{{sfn|Williams|1971|page=31}} The electrical principles of Corbett's electrostatic machine were later used by Edison.{{sfn|Shea|1992|page=22}}

'''Donald Kent "Deke" Slayton''' (March 1, 1924 – June 13, 1993), ([[Major (United States)|Major]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]]) was an American [[World War II]] [[Aviator|pilot]], [[aeronautical engineer]], and [[test pilot]] who was selected as one of the original [[NASA]] [[Mercury Seven]] [[astronaut]]s, and became NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]].&lt;ref name=nasajsc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/slayton.html |date=June 1993 |title=Astronaut Bio: Deke Slayton 6/93 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining NASA, Slayton was selected to pilot the second U.S. manned [[orbital spaceflight]], but was grounded in 1962 by [[atrial fibrillation]], an irregular heart rhythm. He then served as NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, making him responsible for crew assignments at NASA from November 1963 until March 1972. At that time he was granted medical clearance to fly, and was assigned as the docking module pilot of the 1975 [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]], at age 51 becoming the oldest person to fly in space at the time. This record was surpassed in 1983 by 54-year-old [[William E. Thornton]], 59-year-old (and fellow ASTP crew member) [[Vance Brand]] in 1990, 61-year-old [[Story Musgrave]] in 1996, and in 1998 by Slayton's fellow [[Project Mercury]] astronaut [[John Glenn]], who at the age of 77 flew on [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-95]].

Slayton died at the age of 69 on June 13, 1993, from a malignant [[brain tumor]].

== Early life and education==
[[File:Donald K. Slayton (WW II).jpg|thumb|left|Deke Slayton as a bomber pilot during [[World War II]]]]
[[File:Astronaut Deke Slayton during World War II - GPN-2004-00028.jpg|thumb|right|Deke Slayton (right) beside a [[Douglas A-26 Invader|Douglas A-26]] bomber]]

Slayton was born on March 1, 1924, on a farm near [[Sparta, Wisconsin]], to parents Charles Sherman Slayton (1887–1972) and Victoria Adelia Slayton ({{nee|Larson}}; 1895–1970).&lt;ref name=nasahist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/slayton.htm|title=Donald K. "Deke" Slayton 
|last1=Gray|first1=Tara|access-date=October 6, 2016|website=NASA History Program Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[English people|English]] and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] descent. In 1929, a childhood farm equipment accident left him with a severed left ring finger. He attended elementary school in [[Leon, Monroe County, Wisconsin|Leon, Wisconsin]], and graduated from Sparta High School in 1942.

He entered the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a cadet in 1942, training as a [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] bomber pilot and received his [[Aviator badge#World War II|wings]] in April 1943 (Class 43E) after completing flight training at [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]] and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]]. He flew 56 [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]] with the [[340th Flying Training Group#World War II|340th Bombardment Group]] over [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]] during [[World War II]] and later flew seven combat missions over [[Japan]] in a [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] as part of the [[319th Operations Group|319th Bombardment Group]]. In the meantime, he returned to the United States in mid-1944 as a B-25 [[flight instructor|instructor pilot]] at [[Columbia, South Carolina]], and later served with a unit responsible for checking pilot proficiency on the A-26 light bomber.&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt; Slayton served again as a B-25 instructor for one year following the end of the war.&lt;ref name=nmspace /&gt;

After the war, Slayton graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace engineering|Aeronautical Engineering]] from the [[University of Minnesota]], in 1949. Following graduation, he worked for two years as an engineer with the [[Boeing|Boeing Aircraft Corporation]] at [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] before being recalled to active duty in 1951 with the [[Minnesota Air National Guard]].&lt;ref name=nasajsc /&gt;

Upon reporting for duty, Slayton was a maintenance flight test officer of an [[North American P-51 Mustang|F-51]] squadron located in [[Minneapolis]], then served eighteen months as a technical inspector at Headquarters [[Twelfth Air Force]] in [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Army Airfield]], West Germany, and a tour as [[fighter pilot]] and maintenance officer with the [[36th Wing|36th Fighter Day Wing]] at [[Bitburg Air Base]], [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=nmspace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=106|title=Flew on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission|access-date=October 6, 2016|website=New Mexico Museum of Space History}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Squadron Officer School]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Alabama]] in 1952, at that time an arm of [[Air Command and Staff College]].

==Test pilot==
Returning to the United States in June 1955, Slayton attended and graduated from [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] (Class 55C) to become a [[test pilot]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]]. He tested supersonic Air Force fighters, including the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|F-101]], [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]], [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105]], and [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinaviationhalloffame.org/inductees/slayton.htm |title=Donald K "Deke" Slayton |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |publisher=Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame |quote=While at Edwards, Deke Slayton flew test flight missions on the F-101, F-102, F-105 and the F-106.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was responsible for determining stall-spin characteristics for the large F-105, which became the principal fighter bomber used by the Air Force over [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond |last=Kranz |first=Gene |authorlink=Gene Kranz |year=2000 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-0079-9 |lccn=00027720 |oclc=43590801 |quote=...[H]e was one of the hot test pilots at Edwards Air Force Base, pushing the F-105 to its limits.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he was one of two USAF test pilots given the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the English Electric [[English Electric Lightning|P1B]] Lightning in England. Slayton subsequently commented:

{{quote frame|width=22em|quote=
The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104. Its only drawback was that it had no range at all. . . Looking back, however, I'd have to say that the P.1 was my favourite all-time plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|title=Deke!

In his Air Force career, he logged 6,600 hours flying time including more than 5,100 hours in [[jet aircraft]].&lt;ref name=nasajsc /&gt;

== NASA career ==

=== Mercury Seven ===

[[File:Mercury Seven astronauts.jpg|thumb|left|Deke Slayton (sitting front row, left) with fellow Mercury astronauts]]
In 1959, Slayton was one of 110 military test pilots selected by their commanding officers as candidates for the newly formed [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Project Mercury]], the first U.S. manned space flight program. Following a series of physical and psychological tests, NASA selected Slayton to be one of the original group of seven Mercury astronauts.&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt;

Slayton was scheduled to fly in May 1962 on the program's second orbital flight ([[Mercury-Atlas 7]]), which he would have named ''Delta 7''. However, during the summer of 1961, Slayton was diagnosed with an erratic heart rate ([[idiopathic]] [[atrial fibrillation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.orbitalatk.com/news-room/feature-stories/OA4-Mission-Page/Documents/D14_03749_OA_Deke_Slayton_Bio.pdf |title=Deke Slayton at Orbital ATK |access-date=2017-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125040308/http://www.orbitalatk.com/news-room/feature-stories/OA4-Mission-Page/Documents/D14_03749_OA_Deke_Slayton_Bio.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA doctors did not see the condition as disqualifying, but he was grounded by other officials because they were unsure how his heart would perform under weightlessness.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/27/archives/deke-slayton-studies-russian-and-dreams-of-space.html |title=Deke Slayton Studies Russian and Dreams of Space |author=LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN|date=27 April 1972 |accessdate=14 June 2018|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight was given to [[Scott Carpenter]] instead and Slayton was grounded from flights completely the following September.&lt;ref name=nmspace /&gt; He ended up as the only one of the Mercury Seven to not fly a Mercury mission.

After his diagnosis, he started exercising and making lifestyle changes, including quitting smoking, coffee and cocktails in an effort discover the cause. Flight doctors recommended a [[cardiac catheterization]] to rule out a congenital condition, but NASA considered it too risky, given that he was already grounded. In a 1972 interview, Slayton said; "It was a political, not a medical decision".&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

=== Gemini and Apollo crew selection ===
{{Quote box|align=right|quote=You're it.|source= —Slayton, informing the crew of [[Apollo 11]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=106 Donald K. Slayton at New Mexico Museum of Space History]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When NASA grounded Slayton, the Air Force followed suit. From September 1, 1962 until November 1963, he obtained the unofficial title of "chief astronaut" when he was assigned as [[Coordinator of Astronaut Activities]], a position later re-designated as [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]]. Despite forfeiting a pension that he would have earned following twenty combined years of active duty, Air Guard and Reserve service in 1964, Slayton resigned his Air Force commission in 1963 and continued to work for NASA as a civilian executive, first as Assistant Director of Flight Crew Operations until 1966, and then as Director of Flight Crew Operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4214/ch5-4.html&lt;/ref&gt; As Director, he oversaw the activities of the astronaut office (managed by Chief of the Astronaut Office [[Alan Shepard]], also grounded due to [[Ménière's disease]]), the aircraft operations office, the flight crew integration division, the crew training and simulation division, and the crew procedures division. He had the decisive role in choosing the crews for the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs, including the decision of who would be the first person on the Moon.

In 1972, Slayton was awarded the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]] [[James H. Doolittle Award]].&lt;ref name=nasajsc /&gt;

=== Restored to full flight status ===

While grounded, Slayton took several measures to attempt to be restored to flight status, including a daily exercise program, quitting cigarette smoking and coffee, and drastically reducing consumption of alcoholic beverages. He also took massive doses of vitamins.

In 1970 his palpitations became more frequent and he started taking experimental daily doses of [[quinidine]], a crystalline alkaloid. This treatment was successful, but concerned that taking medication would still disqualify him from solo flying, Slayton stopped taking it against doctors orders. The fibrillation did not return.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

A comprehensive review of his medical status by NASA's director of life sciences and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Agency]], including a heart catheterization,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; resulted in the full restoration of his flight status in March 1972. Slayton celebrated with an hour of [[aerobatic maneuver]]s in a NASA [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 jet trainer]].&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt;

=== Apollo–Soyuz flight ===

{{Main|Apollo–Soyuz Test Project}}
[[File:Astronaut Donald K. Slayton and cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov in the Soyuz Orbital Module.jpg|thumb|right|Deke Slayton (right) with cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov]] in the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]]]]

After he was restored to flight status, Slayton was selected in February 1973 as docking module pilot for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), a docking between an American [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo spacecraft]] and a Soviet [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]]. The American crew immediately began an intensive two-year training program, which included learning the Russian language and making frequent trips to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], where astronauts trained for weeks at [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center|Star City]], the cosmonaut training center near [[Moscow]]. Slayton resigned as Director of Flight Crew Operations in February 1974.&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt;

On July 17, 1975, the two craft joined up in orbit, and astronauts Slayton, [[Thomas P. Stafford]] and [[Vance D. Brand]] conducted crew transfers with cosmonauts [[Alexey Leonov]] and [[Valeri Kubasov]]. At the end of the flight, an erroneous switch setting led to noxious [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fumes from the command module's RCS thrusters being sucked into the cabin during landing, and the crew was hospitalized as a precaution in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], for two weeks. During hospitalization, a [[lesion]] was discovered on Slayton's lung and removed. It was determined to be benign, but he would have almost certainly been grounded from ASTP if this had been discovered before the flight.

During his first and only spaceflight, he spent 217 hours in [[Outer space|space]].

===Space Shuttle program===
{{Main|Space Shuttle}}
[[File:B 747 SCA airplane with Columbia on board before touchdown at KSC.jpg|thumb|right|Deke Slayton flying [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] (far left) during Orbital Flight Test, March 1979]]

After the Apollo–Soyuz flight, he became head of the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] (ALT) of NASA's Space Shuttle.&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt;

Following the ALT program, Slayton served as Manager for Orbital Flight Test, directing orbital flight mission preparations and conducting mission operations. He was responsible for OFT operations scheduling, mission configuration control, preflight stack configuration control, as well as conducting planning reviews, mission readiness reviews, and postflight mission evaluations. He was also responsible for the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] program.&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt;

Although Slayton expressed his hope of flying on a Shuttle mission, new NASA management did not favor him, making it clear that they considered him part of the past and that they planned to recruit a new young group of astronauts for the Shuttle era.

==Later years==
Slayton retired from NASA in 1980, but retained unofficial ties as a consultant until 1982. After retirement, he served as president of [[Space Services Inc.]], a Houston-based company earlier founded to develop rockets for small commercial payloads. He served as mission director for a rocket called the [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga]], which was successfully launched on September 9, 1982, and was the world's first privately funded rocket to reach space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/09/dayintech0909privaterocket/ |title=September 9, 1982: 3-2-1 … Liftoff! The First Private Rocket Launch |last=Abell |first=John C. |date=September 9, 2009 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired.com]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slayton also became interested in [[Air racing|aviation racing]]. In addition to serving as a [[consultant]] to some [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace corporations]], he was President of International Formula One Pylon Air Racing and [[Director (business)|Director]] of Columbia Astronautics. He also served on the [[COMSTAC|Department of Transportation's Commercial Space Advisory Committee]].&lt;ref name=nasahist /&gt;

Slayton penned an autobiography with space historian [[Michael Cassutt]] entitled ''Deke!: U.S. Manned Space from Mercury to the Shuttle''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994|Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as Slayton's own astronaut experiences, the book describes how he made crew choice selections, including choosing the first person to walk on the Moon. Numerous astronauts have noted that only when reading this book did they learn why they had been selected for certain flights decades earlier.

Slayton's name also appears with three other co-authors, including fellow astronaut [[Alan Shepard]], on the book ''[[Moon Shot|Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon]]'', published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shepard &amp; Slayton|Shepard &amp; Slayton 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also made into a documentary film of the same name. Slayton died before either ''Moon Shot'' project was finished or released, and the book did not receive any input from him. However, the film was narrated from Slayton's point of view (voiced by [[Barry Corbin]]) and includes a brief tribute to him at the end.

==Personal life==
Slayton married Marjorie "Marge" Lunney (1921–1989) in May 1955, and they had one son, Kent Sherman, born April 8, 1957.&lt;ref name=burgess2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgess |first=Colin |title=Selecting the Mercury Seven: The Search for America's First Astronauts |year=2011 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4419-8404-3 |oclc=747105631 |lccn=2011925650 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-8405-0 |ref=Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} They eventually divorced, and Slayton later married Bobbie Belle Jones (1945–2010) in 1983. They remained married until his death.&lt;ref name=burgess2011 /&gt;{{rp|350}} His hobbies were hunting, fishing, shooting, and [[Air racing|airplane racing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceacts.com/STARSHIP/seh/slayton.htm Slayton's hobbies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slayton was a close friend of fellow astronaut [[Gus Grissom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1995|Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1995]], p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he moved to [[League City, Texas]], in 1992, Slayton was diagnosed with a malignant [[brain tumor]]. He died from the illness, at the age of 69, on June 13, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Today in history |date= June 13, 2014 |url= http://nyti.ms/Uv1YKC |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |agency= [[Associated Press]] |accessdate= June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated and his ashes scattered over his family farm in Wisconsin.

==Organizations==
Slayton was a member of numerous organizations. He was a [[fellow]] of the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]] and the [[American Astronautical Society]]; associate fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]; member of the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]], the Space Pioneers, and the [[Confederate Air Force]]; life member of the [[Order of Daedalians]], the [[National Rifle Association of America]], the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], and the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]]; honorary member of the American Fighter Aces Association, the National WWII Glider Pilots Association and the [[Association of Space Explorers]].&lt;ref&gt;Association of Space Explorers.

'''Depuration''' of [[seafood]] is the process by which marine or freshwater animals are placed into a clean water environment for a period of time to allow purging of biological contaminants (such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'') and physical impurities (such as sand and silt).   The most common subjects of depuration are such [[bivalve]]s as [[oysters]], [[clam]]s, and [[mussel]]s.

==History==
[[File:Oysters in depuration tank (8535757902).jpg|thumb|Oysters in a depuration tank at a laboratory]]
Most research and publications focus primarily on the depuration of seafood rather than freshwater animals. The commonly defined depuration process has been practiced since the 1800s originating as a method to prevent typhoid fever (via [[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. ''enterica'', serovar Typhi]]'')'' and other illnesses attributed to polluted shellfish being consumed.&lt;ref&gt;1. Belding and Lane 1909, A Report Upon the Mollusk Fisheries of Massachusetts. Wright &amp; Potter, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; As coastal seawater became increasingly contaminated with sewage-borne bacteria, early research investigated the use of disgorging tanks.&lt;ref&gt;2. Herdman and Boyce 1899, Oysters and disease. Lancashire Sea Fisheries Memoir No.1 London&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern seafood depuration is performed in segregated physical tanks using treated seawater that is sterilised either by way of chlorine, ultraviolet, or ozone.

Seafood depuration is legislated or regulated in many countries, including the United States, such [[EEU]] members as France, Ireland, and Italy, and Japan. Oversight is managed by internationally recognised agencies, for example, in the United States, the [[National Shellfish Sanitation Program]] (NSSP) administered by the [[Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference]] sets guidelines on depuration and is recognised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) actively compile the manual for the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP). The Codex Alimentarius, which is overseen by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), both recognises and encourages the application of seafood depuration.&lt;ref&gt;3. Code of Practice for fish and fishery products (first edition) Rome 2009. WHO and FAO {{ISBN|978-92-5-105914-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FAO in December 2006, France had 1422 depuration facilities, Italy had 144, Japan had over 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;4. Bivalve Depuration: fundamental and practical aspects. FAO Fisheries Technical paper. No 511. Rome FAO 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The long history of the depuration process which expands across many countries and is recognised by international agencies is contrasted by the scarce or nonexistent data in the commercial space of the seafood industry. In a majority formal research, publications and governmental regulations, depuration is approached in the form of "public protection" and not in the form of "public awareness". One research study attempts to link the benefits of consumer awareness of shellfish depuration and found that surveyed restaurants were reluctant to sell depurated seafood. Whereas in the same study, consumers surveyed indicated they were prepared to pay a premium for depurated [[Oyster#Depuration|oysters]]. However, the willingness to pay a premium was expressed after the consumer was informed about depuration and depurated seafood indicating the average consumer was unaware about the depuration process.&lt;ref&gt;5. Exploring the Supply of Safer Foods: A case Study of Oyster Depuration in Dixie and Levy counties Florida, 1996 by Food Marketing Policy Center, University of Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dollar roll''' is similar to a reverse [[repurchase agreement]] and provides a form of collateralized short-term financing with [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] comprising the collateral.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', §5:5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[investor]] sells a [[mortgage-backed security]] for settlement on one date and buys it back for settlement at a later date. The investor gives up the principal and interest payments during the roll period, but can invest the proceeds and usually is able to buy back the [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] for a lower price than the sale price. The difference in the prices is called the drop.  The value of the drop plus interest earned on the proceeds of the sale less the forgone interest and principal payments on the mortgage is considered the roll specialness or financing advantage.  With repurchase agreements exactly the same security is returned to the investor, while with dollar rolls the investor buys a substantially similar—but not necessarily identical—security.  This difference produces complex results under certain areas of the United States [[Internal Revenue Code]].

Dollar rolls help investors achieve various objectives, such as staying invested in mortgages while earning a trading spread.  Likewise, if an investor faces operational or delivery obstacles with respect to a certain mortgage-backed security, a dollar roll may help the investor retain the economic exposure while avoiding the operational difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', §5:5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacture of a conventional spherical [[lens (optics)|lens]] typically begins with the generation of the optic's rough shape by [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] a glass blank.&lt;ref name=OPN&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface finishing of complex optics |first=Aric B. |last=Shorey |author2=Golini, Don |author3=Kordonski, William  |journal=Optics and Photonics News |publisher=Optical Society of America |volume=18 |issue=10 |date=October 2007 |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done, for example, with ring tools. Next, the lens surface is [[polishing|polished]] to its final form. Typically this is done by [[lapping]]—rotating and rubbing the rough lens surface against a tool with the desired surface shape, with a mixture of abrasives and fluid in between. 
Typically a carved pitch tool is used to polish the surface of a lens.  The mixture of abrasive is called slurry and it is typically made from cerium or zirconium oxide in water with lubricants added to facilitate pitch tool movement without sticking to the lens. The particle size in the slurry is adjusted to get the desired shape and finish.  

During polishing, the lens may be tested to confirm that the desired shape is being produced, and to ensure that the final shape has the correct form to within the allowed precision. The deviation of an optical surface from the correct shape is typically expressed in fractions of a [[wavelength]], for some convenient wavelength of light (perhaps the wavelength at which the lens is to be used, or a visible wavelength for which a source is available). Inexpensive lenses may have deviations of form as large as several wavelengths (λ, 2λ, etc.). More typical industrial lenses would have deviations no larger than a quarter wavelength (λ/4). Precision lenses for use in applications such as [[laser]]s, [[interferometer]]s, and [[holography]] have surfaces with a tenth of a wavelength (λ/10) tolerance or better. In addition to surface profile, a lens must meet requirements for surface quality (scratches, pits, specks, etc.) and accuracy of dimensions.

In 2011, the [[OPERA experiment]] mistakenly observed [[neutrino]]s appearing to travel [[faster-than-light|faster than light]]. Even before the mistake was discovered, the result was considered anomalous because speeds higher than that of light in a vacuum are generally thought to [[Special relativity#Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light|violate]] special relativity, a cornerstone of the modern understanding of physics for over a century.{{sfnp|Reich|2011b}}{{refn| Many sources describe faster-than-light (FTL) as violating special relativity (SR): ({{harvtxt|Reich|2011c}}; {{harvtxt|Cho|2011a}}; {{harvtxt|Choi|2011}}). Other reliable sources disagree, though; for FTL not necessarily violating SR, see {{harvtxt|"Tachyon"|2011}}. }}

OPERA scientists announced the results of the experiment in {{nowrap | September 2011}} with the stated intent of promoting further inquiry and debate. Later the team reported two flaws in their equipment set-up that had caused errors far outside their original [[confidence interval]]: a [[fiber optic cable]] attached improperly, which caused the apparently faster-than-light measurements, and a clock oscillator ticking too fast.&lt;ref&gt;Strassler, M. (2012) [http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/ "OPERA: What Went Wrong"] ''profmattstrassler.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The errors were first confirmed by OPERA after a [[ScienceInsider]] report;{{refn|{{harvtxt|Cartlidge|2012a}}; {{harvtxt|Cartlidge|2012b}}}} accounting for these two sources of error eliminated the faster-than-light results.&lt;ref name=nature1204/&gt;{{sfnp|Reich|2012c}}

In March 2012, the collocated [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS experiment]] reported neutrino velocities consistent with the speed of light in the same short-pulse beam OPERA had measured in November 2011. ICARUS used a partly different timing system from OPERA and measured seven different neutrinos.{{sfnp|ICARUS|2012b}} In addition, the Gran Sasso experiments [[BOREXINO]], ICARUS, [[Large Volume Detector|LVD]] and OPERA all measured neutrino velocity with a short-pulsed beam in May, and obtained agreement with the speed of light.&lt;ref name = cernrelease/&gt;

On June 8, 2012 CERN research director Sergio Bertolucci declared on behalf of the four Gran Sasso teams, including OPERA, that the speed of neutrinos is consistent with that of light. The press release, made from the 25th International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics in Kyoto, states that the original OPERA results were wrong, due to equipment failures.&lt;ref name=cernrelease /&gt;

On July 12, 2012 OPERA updated their paper by including the new sources of errors in their calculations. They found agreement of neutrino speed with the speed of light.{{sfnp|OPERA|2012}}

Neutrino speeds "consistent" with the speed of light are expected given the limited accuracy of experiments to date. Neutrinos have [[neutrino mass|small but nonzero mass]], and so special relativity predicts that they must propagate at speeds slower than light. Nonetheless, known neutrino production processes impart energies far higher than the neutrino mass scale, and so almost all neutrinos are [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic]], propagating at speeds very close to that of light.

== Detection ==
The experiment created a form of neutrinos, [[muon neutrino]]s, at [[CERN]]'s older [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] accelerator, on the Franco–Swiss border, and detected them at the LNGS lab in Gran Sasso, Italy. OPERA researchers used [[Time transfer#Common view|common-view GPS]], derived from standard GPS, to measure the times and place coordinates at which the neutrinos were created and detected. As computed, the neutrinos' average [[time of flight]] turned out to be less than what light would need to travel the same distance in a vacuum. In a two-week span up to {{nowrap | November 6}}, the OPERA team repeated the measurement with a different way of generating neutrinos, which helped measure travel time of each detected neutrino separately. This eliminated some possible errors related to matching detected neutrinos to their creation time.{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2011b}}
The OPERA collaboration stated in their initial press release that further scrutiny and independent tests were necessary to definitely confirm or refute the results.&lt;ref name=cernrelease&gt;{{harvtxt|"OPERA experiment reports anomaly in flight time of neutrinos from CERN to Gran Sasso"|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First results===
In a {{nowrap | March 2011}} analysis of their data, scientists of the OPERA collaboration reported evidence that neutrinos they produced at CERN in Geneva and recorded at the OPERA detector at Gran Sasso, Italy, had traveled faster than light. The neutrinos were calculated to have arrived approximately 60.7&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds (60.7&amp;nbsp;billionths of a second) sooner than light would have if traversing the same distance in a vacuum. After six months of cross checking, on {{nowrap | September 23, 2011}}, the researchers announced that neutrinos had been observed traveling at faster-than-light speed.{{sfnp|Reich|2011a}} Similar results were obtained using higher-energy (28&amp;nbsp;GeV) neutrinos, which were observed to check if neutrinos' velocity depended on their energy. The particles were measured arriving at the detector faster than light by approximately one part per 40,000, with a 0.2-in-a-million chance of the result being a false positive, ''assuming'' the error were entirely due to random effects ([[Statistical significance#Use as "s" (sigma)|significance of six sigma]]). This measure included estimates for both errors in measuring and errors from the statistical procedure used. It was, however, a measure of precision, not [[accuracy]], which could be influenced by elements such as incorrect computations or wrong readouts of instruments.{{sfnp|Brunetti|2011}}{{sfnp|OPERA|2011a}} For particle physics experiments involving collision data, the standard for a discovery announcement is a five-sigma error limit, looser than the observed six-sigma limit.{{sfnp|Seife|2000}}

The preprint of the research stated "[the observed] deviation of the neutrino velocity from ''c'' [speed of light in vacuum] would be a striking result pointing to new physics in the neutrino sector" and referred to the "early arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos" as an "anomaly".{{sfnp|OPERA|2011a|p=29}} OPERA spokesperson Antonio Ereditato explained that the OPERA team had "not found any instrumental effect that could explain the result of the measurement".&lt;ref name=cernrelease /&gt; James Gillies, a spokesperson for CERN, said on September 22 that the scientists were "inviting the broader physics community to look at what they [had] done and really scrutinize it in great detail, and ideally for someone elsewhere in the world to repeat the measurements".{{sfnp|Jordans|Borenstein|2011a}}

===Internal replication===

Distribution of the early-arrival values for each detected neutrino with bunched-beam rerun. The mean value is indicated by the red line and the blue band.]]{{Anchor|Figure2}}
In November, OPERA published refined results where they noted their chances of being wrong as even less, thus tightening their error bounds. Neutrinos arrived approximately 57.8&amp;nbsp;ns earlier than if they had traveled at light-speed, giving a relative speed difference of approximately one part per 42,000 against that of light. The new significance level became 6.2&amp;nbsp;sigma.{{sfnp|OPERA|2011b}} The collaboration submitted its results for peer-reviewed publication to the [[Journal of High Energy Physics]].{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2011c}}{{sfnp|Jha|2011}}

In the same paper, the OPERA collaboration also published the results of a repeat experiment running from {{nowrap|October 21, 2011}} to {{nowrap|November 7, 2011}}. They detected twenty neutrinos consistently indicating an early neutrino arrival of approximately 62.1&amp;nbsp;ns, in agreement with the result of the main analysis.{{refn | {{harvtxt|"A new proton spill from CERN to Gran Sasso"|2011}}; {{harvtxt|OPERA|2011b}}}}

=== Measurement errors ===
In February 2012, the OPERA collaboration announced two possible sources of error that could have significantly influenced the results.&lt;ref name=cernrelease /&gt;

*A link from a GPS receiver to the OPERA master clock was loose, which increased the delay through the fiber. The glitch's effect was to decrease the reported flight time of the neutrinos by 73&amp;nbsp;ns, making them seem faster than light.{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2012c}}{{sfnp|Lindinger|Hagner|2012}}
*A clock on an electronic board ticked faster than its expected 10&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency, lengthening the reported flight-time of neutrinos, thereby somewhat reducing the seeming faster-than-light effect. OPERA stated the component had been operating outside its specifications.{{refn |name=scaction| {{harvtxt|"Science in action"|2012}} }}

In March 2012 an [[LNGS]] seminar was held, confirming the fiber cable was not fully screwed in during data gathering.&lt;ref name=nature1204&gt;{{Citation |title=Embattled neutrino project leaders step down |journal=[[Nature News]] |author= Eugenie Samuel Reich |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2012| doi=10.1038/nature.2012.10371 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/embattled-neutrino-project-leaders-step-down-1.10371}}&lt;/ref&gt; LVD researchers compared the timing data for cosmic high-energy muons hitting both the OPERA and the nearby LVD detector between 2007–2008, 2008–2011, and 2011–2012. The shift obtained for the 2008–2011 period agreed with the OPERA anomaly.{{sfnp|LVD and OPERA|2012}} The researchers also found photographs showing the cable had been loose by October 13, 2011.

Correcting for the two newly found sources of error, results for neutrino speed appear to be consistent with the speed of light.&lt;ref name=nature1204 /&gt;

=== End results ===
On July 12, 2012 the OPERA collaboration published the end results of their measurements between 2009–2011. The difference between the measured and expected arrival time of neutrinos (compared to the speed of light) was approximately {{nowrap|6.5 ± 15 ns}}. This is consistent with no difference at all, thus the speed of neutrinos is consistent with the speed of light within the margin of error. Also the re-analysis of the 2011 bunched beam rerun gave a similar result.{{sfnp|OPERA|2012}}

== Independent replication ==
{{Main|Measurements of neutrino speed}}

In March 2012, the co-located [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS experiment]] refuted the OPERA results by measuring neutrino velocity to be that of light.{{sfnp|ICARUS|2012b}} ICARUS measured speed for seven neutrinos in the same short-pulse beam OPERA had checked in November 2011, and found them, on average, traveling at the speed of light. The results were from a trial run of neutrino-velocity measurements slated for May.{{sfnp|Jordans|2012}}

In May 2012, a new bunched beam rerun was initiated by CERN. Then in June 2012, it was announced by CERN that the four Gran Sasso experiments OPERA, ICARUS, LVD, and BOREXINO measured neutrino speeds consistent with the speed of light, indicating that the initial OPERA result was due to equipment errors.&lt;ref name = cernrelease/&gt;

In addition, Fermilab stated that the detectors for the MINOS project were being upgraded,{{sfnp|Hooker|2011}}. Fermilab scientists closely analyzed and placed bounds on the errors in their timing system.{{sfnp|Pease|2011}} In June 8, 2012 MINOS announced that according to preliminary results, the neutrino speed is consistent with the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MINOS reports new measurement of neutrino velocity |work=Fermilab Today |url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive_2012/today12-06-08.html|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate= June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The measurement ==
The OPERA experiment was designed to capture how neutrinos switch between different identities, but Autiero realized the equipment could be used to precisely measure neutrino speed too.{{refn|name=nosengo|{{harvtxt|Nosengo|2011}} }} An earlier result from the [[MINOS]] experiment at [[Fermilab]] demonstrated that the measurement was technically feasible.{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2011a}} The principle of the OPERA neutrino velocity experiment was to compare travel time of neutrinos against travel time of light. The neutrinos in the experiment emerged at CERN and flew to the OPERA detector. The researchers divided this distance by the speed of light in vacuum to predict what the neutrino travel time should be. They compared this expected value to the measured travel time.{{sfnp|Cho|2011b}}

=== Overview ===
The OPERA team used an already existing beam of neutrinos traveling continuously from CERN to LNGS, the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso beam, for the measurement. Measuring speed meant measuring the distance traveled by the neutrinos from their source to where they were detected, and the time taken by them to travel this length. The source at CERN was more than {{convert|730| km}} away from the detector at LNGS (Gran Sasso). The experiment was tricky because there was no way to time an individual neutrino, necessitating more complex steps. As shown in [[#Figure1|Fig.&amp;nbsp;1]], CERN generates neutrinos by slamming protons, in pulses of length 10.5&amp;nbsp;[[microsecond]]s (10.5&amp;nbsp;millionths of a second), into a graphite target to produce intermediate particles, which decay into neutrinos. OPERA researchers measured the protons as they passed a section called the beam current transducer (BCT) and took the transducer's position as the neutrinos' starting point. The protons did not actually create neutrinos for another kilometer, but because both protons and the intermediate particles moved almost at [[light speed]], the error from the assumption was acceptably low.

The clocks at CERN and LNGS had to be in sync, and for this the researchers used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement ([[#Figure3|Fig.&amp;nbsp;3]]). The delay of this equipment was 10,085&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds and this value had to be added to the time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. [[#Figure4|Fig.&amp;nbsp;4]] shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.

Since neutrinos could not be accurately tracked to the specific protons producing them, an averaging method had to be used. The researchers added up the measured proton pulses to get an average distribution in time of the individual protons in a pulse. The time at which neutrinos were detected at Gran Sasso was plotted to produce another distribution. The two distributions were expected to have similar shapes, but be separated by 2.4&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]]s, the time it takes to travel the distance at light speed. The experimenters used an algorithm, [[maximum likelihood]], to search for the time shift that best made the two distributions to coincide. The shift so calculated, the statistically measured neutrino arrival time, was approximately 60&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds shorter than the 2.4&amp;nbsp;milliseconds neutrinos would have taken if they traveled just at light speed. In a later experiment, the proton pulse width was shortened to 3&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds, and this helped the scientists to narrow the generation time of each detected neutrino to that range.{{refn | The CERN-neutrino-to-Gran-Sasso beam citation is from {{harvtxt|"Upstream from OPERA: extreme attention to detail"|2011}}; the rest of the description draws heavily on the article by {{harvtxt|Cho|2011b}}, and, to some extent, by {{harvtxt|Cartlidge|2011b}}.}}

=== Measuring distance ===
Distance was measured by accurately fixing the source and detector points on a global coordinate system ([[European Terrestrial Reference System 1989|ETRF2000]]). CERN surveyors used GPS to measure the source location. On the detector side, the OPERA team worked with a geodesy group from the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] to locate the detector's center with GPS and standard map-making techniques. To link the surface GPS location to the coordinates of the underground detector, traffic had to be partially stopped on the access road to the lab. Combining the two location measurements, the researchers calculated the distance,{{refn|name=upstream|{{harvtxt|"Upstream from OPERA: extreme attention to detail"|2011}} }} to an accuracy of 20&amp;nbsp;cm within the 730&amp;nbsp;km path.{{sfnp|Colosimo|Crespi|Mazzoni|Riguzzi|2011}}

=== Measuring trip time ===

The travel time of the neutrinos had to be measured by tracking the time they were created, and the time they were detected, and using a common clock to ensure the times were in sync. As [[#Figure1|Fig.&amp;nbsp;1]] shows, the time measuring system included the neutrino source at CERN, the detector at LNGS (Gran Sasso), and a satellite element common to both. The common clock was the time signal from multiple GPS satellites visible from both CERN and LNGS. CERN's beams-department engineers worked with the OPERA team to provide a travel time measurement between the source at CERN and a point just before the OPERA detector's electronics, using accurate GPS receivers. This included timing the proton beams' interactions at CERN, and timing the creation of intermediate particles eventually decaying into neutrinos (see [[#Figure3|Fig.&amp;nbsp;3]]).

Researchers from OPERA measured the remaining delays and calibrations not included in the CERN calculation: those shown in [[#Figure4|Fig.&amp;nbsp;4]]. The neutrinos were detected in an underground lab, but the common clock from the GPS satellites was visible only above ground level. The clock value noted above-ground had to be transmitted to the underground detector with an 8&amp;nbsp;km fiber cable. The delays associated with this transfer of time had to be accounted for in the calculation. How much the error could vary (the [[standard deviation]] of the errors) mattered to the analysis, and had to be calculated for each part of the timing chain separately. Special techniques were used to measure the length of the fiber and its consequent delay, required as part of the overall calculation.&lt;ref name=upstream /&gt;

In addition, to sharpen resolution from the standard GPS 100&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds to the 1&amp;nbsp;nanosecond range [[metrology]] labs achieve, OPERA researchers used [[Septentrio| Septentrio’s]] precise PolaRx2eTR GPS timing receiver,{{sfnp|"Knocking Einstein: Septentrio in CERN experiment"|2011}} along with consistency checks across clocks (time calibration procedures) which allowed for [[time transfer|common-view time transfer]]. The PolaRx2eTR allowed measurement of the time offset between an atomic clock and each of the [[Global Navigation Satellite System]] satellite clocks. For calibration, the equipment was taken to the [[Federal administration of Switzerland|Swiss Metrology Institute]] (METAS).&lt;ref name=upstream /&gt; In addition, highly stable cesium clocks were installed both at LNGS and CERN to cross-check GPS timing and to increase its precision. After OPERA found the [[superluminal]] result, the time calibration was rechecked both by a CERN engineer and the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|German Institute of Metrology]] (PTB).&lt;ref name=upstream /&gt; Time-of-flight was eventually measured to an accuracy of 10&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds.&lt;ref name=cernrelease /&gt;{{refn|{{harvtxt|Feldmann|2011}}; {{harvtxt|Komatsu|2011}} }} The final error bound was derived by combining the variance of the error for the individual parts.

== The analysis ==
The OPERA team analyzed the results in different ways and using different experimental methods. Following the initial main analysis released in September, three further analyses were made public in November. In the main November analysis, all the existing data were reanalyzed to allow adjustments for other factors, such as the [[Sagnac effect]] in which the Earth's rotation affects the distance traveled by the neutrinos. Then an alternative analysis adopted a different model for the matching of the neutrinos to their creation time. The third analysis of November focused on a different experimental setup ('the rerun') which changed the way the neutrinos were created.

In the initial setup, every detected neutrino would have been produced sometime in a 10,500&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds (10.5&amp;nbsp;microseconds) range, since this was the duration of the proton beam spill generating the neutrinos. It was not possible to isolate neutrino production time further within the spill. Therefore, in their main statistical analyses, the OPERA group generated a model of the proton waveforms at CERN, took the various waveforms together, and plotted the chance of neutrinos being emitted at various times (the global [[probability density function]] of the neutrino emission times). They then compared this plot against a plot of the arrival times of the 15,223 detected neutrinos. This comparison indicated neutrinos had arrived at the detector 57.8&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds faster than if they had been traveling at the speed of light in vacuum. An alternative analysis in which each detected neutrino was checked against the waveform of its associated proton spill (instead of against the global probability density function) led to a compatible result of approximately 54.5&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds.{{sfnp|OPERA|2011|pp=14, 16–21}}

The November main analysis, which showed an early arrival time of 57.8&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds, was conducted blind to avoid [[observer bias]], whereby those running the analysis might inadvertently fine-tune the result toward expected values. To this end, old and incomplete values for distances and delays from the year 2006 were initially adopted. With the final correction needed not yet known, the intermediate expected result was also an unknown. Analysis of the measurement data under those 'blind' conditions gave an early neutrino arrival of 1043.4&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds. Afterward, the data were analyzed again taking into consideration the complete and actual sources of errors. If neutrino and light speed were the same, a subtraction value of 1043.4&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds should have been obtained for the correction. However, the actual subtraction value amounted to only 985.6&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds, corresponding to an arrival time 57.8&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds earlier than expected.{{sfnp|OPERA|2011b}}

Two facets of the result came under particular scrutiny within the neutrino community: the GPS synchronization system, and the profile of the proton beam spill that generated neutrinos.{{sfnp|Reich|2011a}} The second concern was addressed in the November rerun: for this analysis, OPERA scientists repeated the measurement over the same baseline using a new CERN proton beam which circumvented the need to make any assumptions about the details of neutrino production during the beam activation, such as energy distribution or production rate. This beam provided proton pulses of 3&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds each with up to 524 nanosecond gaps. This meant a detected neutrino could be tracked uniquely to its generating 3 nanoseconds pulse, and hence its start and end travel times could be directly noted. Thus, the neutrino's speed could now be calculated without having to resort to statistical inference.&lt;ref name=cernrelease /&gt;

In addition to the four analyses mentioned earlier&amp;mdash;September main analysis, November main analysis, alternative analysis, and the rerun analysis&amp;mdash;the OPERA team also split the data by neutrino energy and reported the results for each set of the September and November main analyses. The rerun analysis had too few neutrinos to consider splitting the set further.

== Reception by the physics community ==
After the initial report of apparent superluminal velocities of neutrinos, most physicists in the field were quietly skeptical of the results, but prepared to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Experimental experts were aware of the complexity and difficulty of the measurement, so an extra unrecognized measurement error was still a real possibility, despite the care taken by the OPERA team.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} However, because of the widespread interest, several well-known experts did make public comments. [[Nobel laureates]] [[Steven Weinberg]],{{sfnp|Matson|2011}} [[George Smoot]] III, and [[Carlo Rubbia]],{{sfnp|Padala|2011}} and other physicists not affiliated with the experiment, including [[Michio Kaku]],{{sfnp|Jordans|Borenstein|2011b}} expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the experiment on the basis that the results challenged a long-held theory consistent with the results of many other [[tests of special relativity]].{{refn | {{harvtxt|Reich|2011c}}; {{harvtxt|Cho|2011b}}; {{harvtxt|Overbye|2011}}; {{harvtxt|Gary|2011}} }} Nevertheless, Ereditato, the OPERA spokesperson, stated that no one had an explanation that invalidated the experiment's results.{{sfnp|Palmer|2011}}

Previous experiments of neutrino speed played a role in the reception of the OPERA result by the physics community. Those experiments did not detect statistically significant deviations of neutrino speeds from the speed of light. For instance, [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Martin Rees]] and theoretical physicists [[Lawrence Krauss]]{{sfnp|Matson|2011}} and [[Stephen Hawking]]{{sfnp|"Hawking on the future of mankind"|2012}} stated neutrinos from the [[SN 1987A]] supernova explosion arrived almost at the same time as light, indicating no faster-than-light neutrino speed. [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]], theoretical physicist at CERN, believed it difficult to reconcile the OPERA results with the SN 1987A observations.{{sfnp|Brumfiel|2011}} Observations of this supernova restricted 10 MeV anti-neutrino speed to less than 20 [[parts per billion]] (ppb) over lightspeed. This was one of the reasons most physicists suspected the OPERA team had made an error.{{sfnp|Cho|2011b}}

Physicists affiliated with the experiment had refrained from interpreting the result, stating in their paper: {{quote|Despite the large significance of the measurement reported here and the stability of the analysis, the potentially great impact of the result motivates the continuation of our studies in order to investigate possible still unknown systematic effects that could explain the observed anomaly. We deliberately do not attempt any theoretical or phenomenological interpretation of the results.{{sfnp|OPERA|2011a|p=29}} }}

Theoretical physicists [[Gian Giudice]], Sergey Sibiryakov, and Alessandro Strumia showed that superluminal neutrinos would imply some anomalies in the velocities of electrons and muons, as a result of quantum-mechanical effects.{{refn|name=giudice|{{harvtxt|Giudice|Sibiryakov|Strumia|2011}} }}  Such anomalies could be already ruled out from existing data on cosmic rays, thus contradicting the OPERA results.
Andrew Cohen and [[Sheldon Glashow]] predicted that superluminal neutrinos would radiate electrons and positrons and lose energy through [[Modern searches for Lorentz violation#Vacuum Cherenkov radiation|vacuum Cherenkov effects]], where a particle traveling faster than light decays continuously into other slower particles.{{refn|name=cohen|{{harvtxt|Cohen|Glashow|2011}} }} However, this energy attrition was absent both in the OPERA experiment and in the colocated [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS experiment]], which uses the same CNGS beam as OPERA.{{sfnp|Reich|2011b}}{{sfnp|ICARUS|2012a}} This discrepancy was seen by Cohen and [[Sheldon Glashow|Glashow]] to present "a significant challenge to the superluminal interpretation of the OPERA data".{{refn|name=cohen|{{harvtxt|Cohen|Glashow|2011}} }}

Many other scientific papers on the anomaly were published as [[arXiv]] preprints or in [[peer review]]ed journals. Some of them criticized the result, while others tried to find theoretical explanations, replacing or extending [[special relativity]] and the [[standard model]].&lt;ref&gt;Resource list at INFN [https://web.archive.org/web/20120902041440/http://www.nu.to.infn.it/SuperLuminal_Neutrino/#9 SuperLuminal Neutrino], archived from [http://www.nu.to.infn.it/SuperLuminal_Neutrino/#9 the original] on September 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussions within the OPERA collaboration ==
In the months after the initial announcement, tensions emerged in the OPERA collaboration.{{sfnp|Grossman|2011a}}{{sfnp|Grossman|2011b}}{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2011c}}{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2012c}} A vote of no confidence among the more than thirty group team leaders failed, but spokesperson Ereditato and physics coordinator Autiero resigned their leadership positions anyway on March 30, 2012.&lt;ref name=nature1204 /&gt;{{sfnp|Cartlidge|2012d}}{{sfnp|Grossman|2012b}} In a resignation letter, Ereditato claimed that their results were "excessively sensationalized and portrayed with not always justified simplification" and defended the collaboration, stating, "The OPERA Collaboration has always acted in full compliance with scientific rigor: both when it announced the results and when it provided an explanation for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Antonio Ereditato |title=OPERA: Ereditato’s Point of View |publisher=Le Scienze |publication-date= March 30, 2012 |url=http://www.lescienze.it/news/2012/03/30/news/opera_ereditatos_point_of_view-938232/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Ws''' (sometimes referred to as '''Five Ws and How''', '''5W1H''', or '''Six Ws''')&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; are questions whose answers are considered basic in information gathering or problem solving. They are often mentioned in [[journalism]] (''cf.'' [[news style]]), [[research]] and  [[police]] [[Crimianal procedure|investigation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = December 4, 2012|url = http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/lesson-plans/lesson_deconstructing_web_pages.pdf|title=Deconstructing Web Pages of Cyberspace|work=MediaSmarts}}&lt;/ref&gt; They constitute a formula for getting the complete story on a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/media-tips/writing-a-press-release|website=owenspencer-thomas.com |title=Press release: getting the facts straight|first=Owen|last=Spencer-Thomas |authorlink=Owen Spencer-Thomas| &lt;!-- D.Litt. ???--&gt; |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the principle of the Five Ws, a report can only be considered complete if it answers these questions starting with an [[interrogative word]]:&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 30, 2012|url=http://www.geoff-hart.com/articles/2002/fivew.htm|title=The Five Ws of Online Help|work=by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Who'' was involved?
* ''What'' happened?
* ''Where'' did it take place?
* ''When'' did it take place?
* ''Why'' did that happen?
 
Some authors add a sixth question, ''how'', to the list:&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; 
 
* ''How'' did it happen?

Each question should have a factual answer — facts necessary to include for a report to be considered complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=September 12, 2008|url=http://www.inlandpress.org/archives/article_1ddd4a01-b7a6-5f95-a33b-ba585bc80344.html|title=Five More Ws for Good Journalism|work=Copy Editing, InlandPress}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple [[yes and no|"yes" or "no"]].

In the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland), the Five Ws are used in [[Key Stage 2]] and [[Key Stage 3]] lessons.&lt;ref name="5ws-in-ks3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/The-Five-W-s-of-Drama-6001931/ |title= The Five Ws of Drama |date= 4 Sep 2008 |publisher= [[Times Educational Supplement]] |accessdate= 10 Mar 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
The Five Ws and How were long attributed to [[Hermagoras of Temnos]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=D.W.|date=1946|title=A Note on the Classical Origin of ' Circumstances ' in the Medieval Confessional|url=|journal=Studies in Philology|volume=43|issue=1|page=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2010, Sloan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=M.C.|date=2010|title=Aristotle 's Nicomachean Ethics as the Original Locus for the Septem Circumstantiae|url=|journal=Classical Philology|volume=105|pages=236–251|doi=10.1086/656196|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] as the source of the elements of circumstance or ''Septem Circumstantiae''. [[Thomas Aquinas]] had much earlier acknowledged Aristotle as the originator of the elements of circumstances, providing a detailed commentary on Aristotle 's system in his “Treatise on human acts” and specifically in part one of two Q7 “Of the Circumstances of Human Acts”. Thomas Aquinas examines the concept of Aristotle's voluntary and involuntary action in his ''[[Summa Theologia]]'' as well as a further set of questions about the elements of circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Summa Theologica|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|work=Great Books of the Western World|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=1952|isbn=|editor-last=Sullivan|editor-first=Daniel J.|volume=19|location=|pages=Q7. Art. 3. Obj. 3.|translator-last=Fathers of the English Dominican Province}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily he asks "Whether a circumstance is an accident of a human act" (Article 1), "Whether Theologians should take note of the circumstances of human acts?" (Article 2), "Whether the circumstances are properly set forth (in Aristotle's) third book of Ethics" (Article 3) and "Whether the most important circumstances are 'Why' and 'In What the act consists'? (Article 4). &lt;blockquote&gt;For in acts we must take note of ''who'' did it, by what aids or instruments he did it (''with''), ''what'' he did, ''where'' he did it, ''why'' he did it, ''how'' and ''when'' he did it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Aristotle, the elements are used in order to distinguish voluntary or involuntary action. &lt;blockquote&gt;Because Aristotle employs this schema as a primordial crucible for defining the difference between voluntary and involuntary agents (a topic of incalculable importance in the works of Aristotle), the benefits of locating this schema within Aristotle, and ultimately providing clarification of the passage, ''may prove helpful to a number of disciplines''(Sloan 2010, 236).&lt;/blockquote&gt;These elements of circumstances are used by Aristotle as a framework to describe and evaluate moral action in terms of What was/should be done, Who did it, How it was done, Where it happened, and most importantly for what reason (Why), and so on for all the other elements. He outlines them as follows in the Ethics as translated by Sloan.&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore it is not a pointless endeavor to divide these circumstances by kind and number; (1) the ''Who'', (2) the ''What'', (3) around what place (''Where'') or (4) in which time something happens (''When''), and sometimes (5) with what, such as an instrument (''With''), (6) for the sake of what (''Why''), such as saving a life, and (7) the (''How''), such as gently or violently…And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the ''Why''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Aristotle (in Sloan), ignorance of any of these elements can imply involuntary action.&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, with ignorance as a possibility concerning all these things, that is, ''the circumstances of the act'', the one who acts in ignorance of any of them seems to act involuntarily, and especially regarding the most important ones. And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the ''Why''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]], Aristotle illustrates why the elements are important in terms of human (moral) action.&lt;blockquote&gt;I mean, for instance (a particular circumstance or movement or action), How could we advise the Athenians whether they should go to war or not, if we did not know their strength (''How much''), whether it was naval or military or both (''What kind''), and how great it is (''How many''), what their revenues amount to (''With''), Who their friends and enemies are (''Who''), what wars, too they have waged (''What''), and with what success; and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politica|last=Aristotle|first=|work=The Works of Aristotle|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1921|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=X|location=|publication-place=Oxford|pages=1396a7-11|translator-last=Jowett|translator-first=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Essentially, these elements of circumstances provide a theoretical framework that can be used to particularize, explain or predict ''any'' given set of circumstances of action. [[Hermagoras of Temnos|Hermagoras]] went so far as to claim that ''all'' [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]  are derived from these seven circumstances.&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, no hypothetical question, or question involving particular persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances, and no demonstration of such a question can be made without using them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In any particular act or situation, one needs to interrogate these questions in order to determine the actual circumstances of the action.&lt;blockquote&gt;It is necessary for students of virtue to differentiate between the Voluntary and Involuntary; such a distinction should even prove useful to the lawmaker for assigning honors and punishments. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This aspect is encapsulated by Aristotle in Rhetoric as ''forensic speech'' and is used to determine ''"The characters and circumstances which lead men to commit wrong, or make them the victims of wrong”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetoric|last=Aristotle|first=|work=The Works of Aristotle|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1920|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=XI|location=Oxford|pages=Bk I.12 1372a4-1373a35|translator-last=Roberts|translator-first=W.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to accuse or defend. It is this application of the elements of circumstances that was emphasised by latter rhetoricians.

==Rhetoric==
Even though the classical origin of these questions as situated in ethics had long been lost, they have been a standard way of formulating or analyzing rhetorical questions since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;For more general discussion of the theory of circumstances, see ''e.g.'' Rita Copeland, ''Rhetoric, Hermeneutics, and Translation in the Middle Ages: Academic Traditions and Vernacular Texts'', 1995. {{ISBN|0-521-48365-4}}, p. 66''ff'', as well as Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor [[Hermagoras of Temnos]], as quoted in [[pseudo-Augustine]]'s ''De Rhetorica'',&lt;ref&gt;Although attributed to [[Augustine of Hippo]], modern scholarship considers the authorship doubtful, and calls him pseudo-Augustine: Edwin Carawan, "What the Laws have Prejudged: Παραγραφή and Early Issue Theory" ''in'' Cecil W. Wooten, George Alexander Kennedy, eds., ''The orator in action and theory in Greece and Rome'', 2001. {{ISBN|90-04-12213-3}}, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; applied Aristotle's "elements of circumstances" (μόρια περιστάσεως)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:(Who, what, when, where, why, in what way, by what means)

[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; also refers to the elements as used by [[Cicero]] in De Inventione (Chap. 24 DD1, 104) as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Similarly, [[Quintilian]] discussed ''loci argumentorum'', but did not put them in the form of questions.&lt;ref name="circ" /&gt;

[[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] explained [[Cicero]]'s application of the elements of circumstances by putting them into correspondence with Hermagoras's questions:&lt;ref name="circ" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Victorinus.gif|quis=persona; quid=factum; cur=causa; ubi=locus; quando=tempus; quemadmodum = modus; quib/adminiculis=facultas]]&lt;/center&gt;

[[Julius Victor]] also lists circumstances as questions.&lt;ref name="circ"/&gt;

[[Boethius]] "made the seven circumstances fundamental to the arts of prosecution and defense":
:''Quis, quid, cur, quomodo, ubi, quando, quibus auxiliis''.&lt;ref name="circ"/&gt;
:(Who, what, why, how, where, when, with what)

The question form was taken up again in the 12th century by [[Thierry de Chartres]] and [[John of Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="circ"/&gt;

To administer suitable [[penance]] to [[sin]]ners, the 21st canon of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) enjoined confessors to investigate both sins and the circumstances of the sins. The question form was popular for guiding confessors, and it appeared in several different forms:&lt;ref&gt;Citations below taken from Robertson and not independently checked.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Quis, quid, ubi, per quos, quoties, cur, quomodo, quando.''&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, ''Concilium Trevirense Provinciale'' (1227), Mansi, ''Concilia'', XXIII, c. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Quid, ubi, quare, quantum, conditio, quomodo, quando: adiuncto quoties.''&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Petrus Coelestinus]], ''Opuscula'', ''MBP'' XXV:828&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of questions was also used for the systematic [[exegesis]] of a text.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Soulen, R. Kendall Soulen, ''Handbook of Biblical Criticism'', (Louisville, 2001, {{ISBN|0-664-22314-1}}) ''s.v.'' Locus, p. 107; Hartmut Schröder, ''Subject-Oriented Texts'', p. 176ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]] wrote in English verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Who, what, and where, by what helpe, and by whose:&lt;br&gt;
Why, how, and when, doe&lt;!--spelling in the original--&gt; many things disclose.&lt;ref name="Thomas Wilson"&gt;Thomas Wilson, ''The Arte of Rhetorique'' Book I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[United States]] in the [[19th century]], Prof. [[William Cleaver Wilkinson]] popularized the "Three Ws" – What? Why? What of it? – as a method of Bible study in the 1880s, although he did not claim originality. This would also became the "Five Ws", but the application was rather different from that in journalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What? Why? What of it?" is a plan of study of alliterative methods
for the teacher emphasized by Professor W.C. Wilkinson not as original
with himself but as of venerable authority. "It is, in fact," he says,
"an almost immemorial orator's analysis. First the facts, next the
proof of the facts, then the consequences of the facts. This analysis
has often been expanded into one known as "The Five Ws:" "When? Where? Who?
What? Why?" Hereby attention is called, in the study of any lesson: to the
date of its incidents; to their place or locality; to the person
speaking or spoken to, or to the persons introduced, in the narrative; to
the incidents or statements of the text; and, finally, to the
applications and uses of the lesson teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Clay Trumbull,
''Teaching and Teachers'', Philadelphia, 1888, p. 120 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAYCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120#PPA120,M1 text at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikisource|The Elephant's Child}}
The "Five Ws" (and one H) were memorialized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his "[[Just So Stories]]" ([[1902 in literature|1902]]), in which a poem, accompanying the tale of "The Elephant's Child",&lt;ref&gt;The poem compares Kipling's own day-to-day situation as a writer/journalist, with that of [[Queen Victoria]] ("a person small") who "keeps ten million serving men", and, unlike Kipling, "gets no rest at all".&lt;/ref&gt; opens with:
:{|
''I keep six honest serving-men''&lt;br&gt;
''(They taught me all I knew);''&lt;br&gt;
''Their names are What and Why and When''&lt;br&gt;
''And How and Where and Who.&lt;br&gt;''
|}

By 1917, the "Five Ws" were being taught in high-school journalism classes,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Nelson Flint, ''Newspaper Writing in High Schools, Containing an Outline for the Use of Teachers'', University of Kansas, 1917, p. 47 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=86tDAAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3#PPA47,M1 at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1940, the tendency of journalists to address all of the "Five Ws" within the [[lead paragraph]] of an article was being characterized as old-fashioned and fallacious:

{{quote|The old-fashioned lead of the five Ws and the H, crystallized largely by Pulitzer's "new journalism" and sanctified by the schools, is widely giving way to the much more supple and interesting feature lead, even on straight news stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Starting in the 2000s, the Five W's were sometimes misattributed to Kipling, especially in the management and quality literature,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Burtonshaw-Gunn, ''The Essential Management Toolbox'', 2009, {{ISBN|0470687436}}, pp. 55, 68, 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' in E. Kim and S. Helal, "Revisiting Human Activity Networks", in ''Sensor Systems and Software: Second International ICST Conference'', Miami 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lf2qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223 p. 223]&lt;/ref&gt; and contrasted with the [[5 Whys]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Smith, ''et al.'', ''The Effective Change Manager's Handbook, 2014, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of English and Latin, most of the interrogative words begin with the same sound, ''wh'' in English, "qu" in Latin. This is not a coincidence, as they both come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''[[Proto-Indo-European pronouns#Interrogative/indefinite pronoun|k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;o-]]'', reflected in [[Proto-Germanic]] as ''χ&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;a-'' or ''kh&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;a-'' and in [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''qu-''.

'''GRB 070125''' is a [[gamma-ray burst]] that occurred on 2007 January 25. It is unique in that it did not occur in a galaxy, but in [[intergalactic space]]. This is unusual, since GRBs are caused by [[hypernovae]] of young massive [[star]]s, which usually means having to reside in a galaxy, as almost all stars are formed in galaxies, particularly high mass ones. It has a redshift of 1.55, which equals to a light travel distance of 9.5 billion years.

It is theorized that the star formed in the tidal tail resulting from the [[interacting galaxies|interaction]] of two nearby [[galaxies]], deep in intergalactic space. 

A month after it was detected, the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] observed a 26th magnitude optical afterglow from the gamma ray burst&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~lumen/2007_04/FirstsciencefromtheLargeBinocularTelescope.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502024118/http://www.nd.edu/~lumen/2007_04/FirstsciencefromtheLargeBinocularTelescope.shtml |archivedate=2009-05-02 |df= }} "First science from the Large Binocular Telescope: Notre Dame astrophysicist reports gamma ray finding" By: William G.

'''Grindavik''' is an [[impact crater]] in the [[Oxia Palus quadrangle]] of [[Mars]], located at 25.39° North and 39.07° West.  It is 12&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after a town in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;
Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits.  As craters get larger (greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/&lt;/ref&gt; The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H. Kieffer|title=Mars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoDvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=1992|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punsk Crater belongs to the class of craters called "[[Rampart crater]]s" of the single-ejecta variety.  Single-layered ejecta craters are one type of rampart carter.  They have one ejecta lobe that extends 1 to 1.5 crater radii from the rim of the crater.  They have an average diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;km.  Although present at all latitudes, they are most common near the equator.  There average size increases the more distant from the equator.  It has been suggested that these types of craters are produced by impact into icy ground.  Specifically, it is an impact that does not go entirely through the icy layer.  The increase in size away from the equator is explained by a possible greater thickness in the icy layer away from the equator.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J., D. Weiss.   2017.

'''Hans K. Ziegler''' (March 1, 1911, [[Munich]], [[Germany]] &amp;ndash; December 11, 1999 [[Colts Neck Township, New Jersey]], [[United States]]) was a pioneer in the field of communication satellites and the use of [[photovoltaic]] [[solar cells]] as a power source for [[satellites]].

==Life==
Hans Ziegler was born in Munich, [[Germany]]. There, he studied at the ''Technische Hochschule'', which is today the ''[[Technische Universität München]]'' (TUM), and began his career as ''Wissenschaftlicher Assistant'' (Scientific Assistant), which corresponds to a "professor" at US universities. Following that, he was a researcher in German industry for ten years. During the [[Second World War]], he worked for the company Rosental Selb in Bavaria on high tension porcelain.

In 1947, he came to the USA with [[Wernher von Braun]] under [[Operation Paperclip]], by means of which the USA gained German engineers and scientists. He went to the U. S. Army Signal Corps' Laboratories in [[Fort Monmouth]], [[New Jersey]], and became a U.S. citizen in 1954.

Dr. Hans K. Ziegler's work in the USA was very influential in the development of military electronics, especially in the electronics for the early phases of the U.S. space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(from 1947 to 1976), he held the top position of Chief Scientist for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/publications/sources1/archival_collectionsz.html IEEE Archival Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; In Fort Monmouth, he worked as a Scientific Consultant, Assistant Director of Research, Director of the Astro-Electronics Division and Chief Scientist (1959). After the Army was restructured, he became Deputy for Science and Chief Scientist of the US Army Electronics Command in 1963 and Director of the US Army Electronics Technology &amp; Devices Laboratory from 1971 until his retirement.

In May 1954, after examining the solar cells of [[Daryl Chapin]], [[Calvin Fuller]] and [[Gerald Pearson]] at [[Bell Laboratories]], Ziegler wrote, "''Future development [of the silicon solar cell] may well render it into an important source of electrical power [as] the roofs of all our buildings in cities and towns equipped with solar [cells] would be sufficient to produce this country's entire demand for electrical power.''"&lt;ref name="Perlin"&gt;John Perlin, ''From Space to Earth; The Story of Solar Electricity'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1999, {{ISBN|0-674-01013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to silicon solar cells, he said to the head of the U. S. Signal Corps, General [[James Dunne O'Connell|James O'Connell]], at a meeting in September 1955, "''In fact, in the long run, mankind has no choice but to turn to the sun if it wants to survive.''"&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt;

He and his team produced a report on the prospects for application of this technique in the field of communication and they named the supply of energy for artificial satellites as the most important application. He knew that he was not the first to suggest this application. For example, the science fiction author, [[Arthur C. Clarke]] had already made this suggestion in 1945, but without having a concrete technology for it at that time.

Ziegler participated in the development of the first planned satellites. The first satellite,
[[Explorer 1]], still went into space without solar cells, since it was a quick, less-than-ideal solution after the start of the [[Sputnik]] to show the American public that America's scientists could also start a satellite. The actual scheduled satellite project, [[Project Vanguard]], successfully put a satellite named [[Vanguard I]] in orbit around Earth on March 17, 1958.

Over the objections of the [[Navy]], which still thought that solar cells were not a [[mature technology]], this satellite had four solar cells on its outer hull, due to the persistent work of Hans Ziegler, which powered the instruments and performed their duties reliably for more than seven years. After this success, solar cells were established as the energy supply for satellites. He was also involved with the development of the first communication satellite in the world, [[Project SCORE|SCORE]], which was started in 1958.

He was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in 1963 as a "'' world pioneer in communications satellites and solar energy systems to power satellites''". When he retired in 1977, he was decorated with the highest award of the Army for "''exceptional civilian service''".

Dr. Hans K. Ziegler was the author of many technical papers, a member of the [[IEEE]], and represented the USA, in military and civilian matters, in many national and international committees. In 1958, he was a member of the US delegation to the [[International Geophysical Year]] in [[Moscow]], [[USSR]], and in 1964, he gave advice on the scientific activities in [[Antarctica]] and at the [[South Pole]], under the direction of the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].

Hans Ziegler's wife Friederike died in 1996. He last lived in [[Colts Neck Township, New Jersey]] and died at the age of 88 on December 11, 1999. He was survived by his daughters, Christine Griffith and Friederike Meindl, and his son, Hans.

'''Herman Haga''' ([[Oldeboorn]], 24 January 1852 – [[Zeist]], 11 September 1936) was a Dutch physicist.

==Career==
Haga studied physics from 1871 to 1876 at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klaas van Berkel| authorlink = Klaas van Berkel| title=''De onbekende Herman Haga, medeoprichter van de NNV'' (The unknown Herman Haga, founder of the NNV (Nederlandse Natuurkundige Vereniging) Dutch Physics Association)|journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Natuurkunde|date=August 2011|volume=77|issue=8|pages=296–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his PhD with thesis ''Over de absorptie van stralende warmte door waterdamp'' (On the absorption of radiant heat by water vapor)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herman Haga |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Haga_1876.pdf |title=Over de absorptie van stralende warmte door waterdamp  |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[Pieter Rijke|Pieter L. Rijke]]. From 1886 to 1921 Haga was professor of physics at the [[University of Groningen]], where he designed and oversaw the building of a new physics laboratory, opened in 1892. From 1900 Haga was also the rector of the University of Gronigen. He performed experiments on the voltage of the [[Weston cell]]; these experiments lead to the modern definition of the [[volt]]. With Cornelis Wind, Haga passed X-rays through a 15-micrometer slit as a source with a V-shaped narrowing slit as a target. The target slit was 27 micrometers at the opening and nearly 0 micrometers at the output. Haga and Wind interpreted a diffuse broadening of the X-rays emitted at the narrower end of the slit as a diffraction pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haga, Herman|author2=Wind, Cornelis|title=De buiging der Röntgenstralen|journal=Versl. Kon. Ak.

Haga was one of the founders of the ''Nederlandse Natuurkundige Vereniging'' (Dutch Physics Association). In addition to Cornelis Harm Wind (1867–1911),&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Wind held the chair of theoretical physics at the [[University of Utrecht]], and, when he died at the age of 43, he was succeeded by [[Peter Debye]].&lt;/ref&gt; Haga's doctoral students include the crystallographer Pieter Terpstra (1886–1973)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86-861526 Terpstra, P. b. 1886 (Pieter) WorldCat Identities]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ekko Oosterhuis (1886–1966), who was the second scientist to join the ''[[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/Oosterhuis.html Dr. Ekko Oosterhuis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 Haga became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00000619 |title=Herman Haga (1852 - 1936) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Steam engine}}[[File:Savery-engine.jpg|upright|thumb|The 1698 ''Savery Steam Pump'' - the first commercially successful steam powered device, built by [[Thomas Savery]]]]

The first recorded rudimentary [[steam engine]] was the [[aeolipile]] described by [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] in 1st-century [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;"turbine." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 July&lt;/ref&gt; Several steam-powered devices were later experimented with or proposed, such as [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[steam jack]], a [[steam turbine]] in 16th-century [[Ottoman Egypt]], and [[Thomas Savery]]'s steam [[pump]] in 17th-century England. In 1712, [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[atmospheric engine]] became the first commercially successful engine using the principle of the piston and cylinder, which was the fundamental type steam engine used until the early 20th century. The steam engine was used to pump water out of coal mines

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[steam engine]]s started to replace water and wind power, and eventually became the dominant source of power in the late 19th century and remaining so into the early decades of the 20th century, when the more efficient steam turbine and the [[internal combustion engine]] resulted in the rapid replacement of the steam engines.  The [[steam turbine]] has become the most common method by which electrical power generators are driven.&lt;ref Name="Wiser"&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|last= Wiser |first= Wendell H. |year= 2000 |publisher= Birkhäuser |isbn= 978-0-387-98744-6 |page= 190 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent#v=onepage&amp;q=steam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations are being made into the practicalities of reviving the reciprocating steam engine as the basis for the new wave of [[advanced steam technology]].

The earliest known rudimentary steam engine and reaction [[steam turbine]], the [[aeolipile]], is described by a mathematician and engineer named [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] (Heron) in 1st century [[Ægyptus|Roman Egypt]], as recorded in his manuscript ''Spiritalia seu Pneumatica''.&lt;ref&gt;Heron Alexandrinus (Hero of Alexandria) (c. 62 [[Common Era|CE]]): ''Spiritalia seu Pneumatica''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam ejected tangentially from nozzles caused a pivoted ball to rotate.  Its thermal efficiency was low. This suggests that the conversion of steam pressure into mechanical movement was known in Roman Egypt in the 1st century. Heron also devised a machine that used air heated in an altar fire to displace a quantity of water from a closed vessel. The weight of the water was made to pull a hidden rope to operate temple doors.&lt;ref name="Dayton1925" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have conflated the two inventions to assert, incorrectly, that the aeolipile was capable of useful work.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

According to [[William of Malmesbury]], in 1125, [[Reims]] was home to a church that had an [[organ (music)|organ]] powered by air escaping from compression ''"by heated water"'', apparently designed and constructed by professor Gerbertus.&lt;ref name="Dayton1925" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970629015211/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-06-29 |title=Thurston, Robert (1878), "A history of the growth of the steam engine" |publisher=History.rochester.edu |date=1996-12-16 |accessdate=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the papers of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] dating to the late 15th century is the design for a steam-powered cannon called the [[Architonnerre]] which works by the sudden influx of hot water into a sealed red hot cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurston|first= Robert Henry|title=A History of the Growth of the Steam-Engine|year=1996|edition=reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCMUmXV1C1gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thurston|publisher=Elibron|isbn=1-4021-6205-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rudimentary impact [[steam turbine]] was described in 1551 by [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]], a [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] and [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineer]] in 16th century [[Ottoman Egypt]], who described a method for rotating a [[Rotisserie|spit]] by means of a jet of steam playing on rotary vanes around the periphery of a wheel. A similar device for rotating a spit was also later described by [[John Wilkins]] in 1648.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;[http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%201.htm Taqi al-Din and the First Steam Turbine, 1551 A.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171045/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%201.htm |date=2008-02-18 }}, web page, accessed on line October 23, 2009; this web page refers to [[Ahmad Y Hassan]] (1976), ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', pp. 34-5, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, [[University of Aleppo]].&lt;/ref&gt; These devices were then called "mills" but are now known as [[steam jack]]s. Another similar rudimentary steam turbine is shown by [[Giovanni Branca]], an [[Italy|Italian]] engineer, in 1629 for turning a cylindrical [[escapement]] device that alternately lifted and let fall a pair of pestles working in mortars.&lt;ref name=Giovanni&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html |title=University of Rochester, NY, '&amp;#39;The growth of the steam engine'&amp;#39; online history resource, chapter one |publisher=History.rochester.edu |accessdate=2012-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034636/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The steam flow of these early steam turbines, however, was not concentrated and most of its energy was dissipated in all directions. This would have led to a great waste of energy and so they were never seriously considered for industrial use.

In 1605 French mathematician [[Florence Rivault]] in his treatise on artillery wrote on his discovery that water, if confined in a bombshell and heated, would explode the shells.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Henry Thurston, ''A history of the growth of the steam-engine'', D. Appleton and company, 1903, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uc8WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22florence+rivault%22&amp;ei=rsx5S43-JI6ezATU3OnvCA&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22florence%20rivault%22&amp;f=false Google Print, p.15-16] (public domain)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1606, the [[Spaniard]], [[Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont]] demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump. The pump was successfully used to drain the inundated mines of [[Guadalcanal, Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garcia|first=Nicolas|title=Mas alla de la Leyenda Negra|year=2007|publisher=Universidad de Valencia|location=Valencia|isbn=9788437067919|pages=443–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the commercial steam engine==

*The concept of a vacuum (i.e. a reduction in pressure below ambient)
*The concept of pressure
*Techniques for creating a vacuum
*A means for generating steam
*The piston and cylinder
In 1643 [[Evangelista Torricelli]] conducted experiments on suction lift water pumps to test their limits, which was about 32 feet (Atmospheric pressure is 32.9 feet or 10.03 meters. Vapor pressure of water lowers theoretical lift height.). He devised an experiment using a tube filled with mercury and inverted  in a bowl of mercury (a [[barometer]]) and observed an empty space above the column of mercury, which he theorized contained nothing, that is, a vacuum.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"&gt;{{cite book

Influenced by Torricelli, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented a vacuum pump by modifying an [[air pump]] used for pressurizing an [[air gun]].  Guericke put on a demonstration in 1654 in Magdeburg, Germany, where he was mayor.  Two copper hemispheres were fitted together and air was pumped out.  Weights strapped to the hemispheres could not pull them apart until the air valve was opened.  The experiment was repeated in 1656 using two teams of 8 horses each, which could not separate the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]].&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

[[Gaspar Schott]] was the first to describe the hemisphere experiment in his ''Mechanica Hydraulico-Pneumatica'' (1657).&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

After reading Schott’s book, [[Robert Boyle]] built an improved vacuum pump and conducted related experiments.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

[[Denis Papin]] became interested in using a vacuum to generate motive power while working with [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in Paris in 1663.  Papin worked for Robert Boyle from 1676 to 1679, publishing an account of his work in ''Continuation of New Experiments'' (1680) and gave a presentation to Royal Society in 1689.  From 1690 on Papin began experimenting with a piston to produce power with steam, building model steam engines.  He experimented with atmospheric and pressure steam engines, publishing his results in 1707.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

In 1663 [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions which described a method for raising water between floors employing a similar principle to that of a [[coffee percolator]]. His system was the first to separate the boiler (a heated cannon barrel) from the pumping action. Water was admitted into a reinforced barrel from a cistern, and then a valve was opened to admit steam from a separate boiler. The pressure built over the top of the water, driving it up a pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Tredgold, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He installed his steam-powered device on the wall of the Great Tower at [[Raglan Castle]] to supply water through the tower. The grooves in the wall where the engine was installed were still to be seen in the 19th century. However, no one was prepared to risk money for such a revolutionary concept, and without backers the machine remained undeveloped.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read.  In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure.  These were used for low horsepower service for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

[[Thomas Newcomen]] was a merchant who dealt in cast iron goods.  Newcomen’s engine was based on the piston and cylinder design proposed by Papin.  In Newcomen's engine steam was condensed by water sprayed inside the cylinder, causing atmospheric pressure to move the piston.  Newcomen’s first engine installed for pumping in a mine in 1712 at Dudley Castle in Staffordshire.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

===Cylinders===

[[File:Papinengine.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Denis Papin's design for a piston-and-cylinder engine, 1680.]]
[[Denis Papin]] (22 August 1647 – c. 1712) was a French physicist, mathematician and inventor, best known for his pioneering invention of the [[steam digester]], the forerunner of the pressure cooker. In the mid-1670s Papin collaborated with the Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]] on an engine which drove out the air from a cylinder by exploding [[gunpowder]] inside it. Realising the incompleteness of the vacuum produced by this means and on moving to England in 1680, Papin devised a version of the same cylinder that obtained a more complete vacuum from boiling water and then allowing the steam to condense; in this way he was able to raise weights by attaching the end of the piston to a rope passing over a pulley. As a demonstration model the system worked, but in order to repeat the process the whole apparatus had to be dismantled and reassembled. Papin quickly saw that to make an automatic cycle the steam would have to be generated separately in a boiler; however, he did not take the project further. Papin also designed a paddle boat driven by a jet playing on a mill-wheel in a combination of Taqi al Din and Savery's conceptions and he is also credited with a number of significant devices such as the [[safety valve]]. Papin's years of research into the problems of harnessing steam was to play a key part in the development of the first successful industrial engines that soon followed his death.

The first steam engine to be applied industrially was the "fire-engine" or "Miner's Friend", designed by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. This was a pistonless steam pump, similar to the one developed by Worcester. Savery made two key contributions that greatly improved the practicality of the design. First, in order to allow the water supply to be placed below the engine, he used condensed steam to produce a partial vacuum in the pumping reservoir  (the barrel in Worcester's example), and using that to pull the water upward. Secondly, in order to rapidly cool the steam to produce the vacuum, he ran cold water over the reservoir.

Operation required several valves; when the reservoir was empty at the start of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet.&lt;ref name="Tredgold, pg. 6"&gt;Tredgold, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.&lt;ref name="Tredgold, pg. 6"/&gt;

Savery's engine solved a problem that had only recently become a serious one; raising water out of the mines in southern England as they reached greater depths.  Savery's engine was somewhat less efficient than Newcomen's, but this was compensated for by the fact that the separate pump used by the Newcomen engine was inefficient, giving the two engines roughly the same efficiency of 6 million foot pounds per bushel of coal (less than 1%).&lt;ref name="Landes"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor was the Savery engine very safe because part of its cycle required steam under pressure supplied by a boiler, and given the technology of the period the [[pressure vessel]] could not be made strong enough and so was prone to explosion.&lt;ref name="Rolt-Allen"/&gt; The explosion of one of his pumps at Broad Waters (near [[Wednesbury]]), about 1705, probably marks the end of attempts to exploit his invention.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal |author=P.

The Savery engine was less expensive than Newcomen's and was produced in smaller sizes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Atmospheric condensing engines==

===Newcomen "atmospheric" engine===
[[File:Newcomen Figuier.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Engraving of Newcomen engine. This appears to be copied from a drawing in Desaguliers' 1744 work: "A course of experimental philosophy", itself believed to have been a reversed copy of Henry Beighton's engraving dated 1717, that may represent what is probably the second Newcomen engine erected around 1714 at Griff colliery, Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;Hulse David K (1999): "The early development of the steam engine"; TEE Publishing, Leamington Spa, UK, ISBN, 85761 107 1&lt;/ref&gt;]]

It was [[Thomas Newcomen]] with his "[[Newcomen steam engine|atmospheric-engine]]" of 1712 who can be said to have brought together most of the essential elements established by Papin in order to develop the first practical steam engine for which there could be a commercial demand. This took the shape of a reciprocating beam engine installed at surface level driving a succession of pumps at one end of the beam. The engine, attached by chains from other end of the beam, worked on the atmospheric, or vacuum principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6r29q3kz/?order=1&amp;brand=oac |title=Paxton Engineering Division Report (2 of 3) |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newcomen's design used some elements of earlier concepts. Like the Savery design, Newcomen's engine used steam, cooled with water, to create a vacuum. Unlike Savery's pump, however, Newcomen used the vacuum to pull on a piston instead of pulling on water directly. The upper end of the cylinder was open to the atmospheric pressure, and when the vacuum formed, the atmospheric pressure above the piston pushed it down into the cylinder. The piston was lubricated and sealed by a trickle of water from the same cistern that supplied the cooling water. Further, to improve the cooling effect, he sprayed water directly into the cylinder. 
[[File:Newcomen atmospheric engine animation.gif|right|Animation of a Newcomen atmospheric engine in action]]

The piston was attached by a chain to a large pivoted beam. When the piston pulled the beam, the other side of the beam was pulled upward. This end was attached to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.

Using the piston and beam allowed the Newcomen engine to power pumps at different levels throughout the mine, as well as eliminating the need for any high-pressure steam. The entire system was isolated to a single building on the surface. Although inefficient and extremely heavy on coal (compared to later engines), these engines raised far greater volumes of water and from greater depths than had previously been possible.&lt;ref name="Rolt-Allen"&gt;L. T. C. Rolt and J. S. Allen, ''The Steam Engine of Thomas Newcomen'' (Landmark Publishing, Ashbourne 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 Newcomen engines were installed around England by 1735, and it is estimated that as many as 2,000 were in operation by 1800 (including Watt versions).

[[John Smeaton]] made numerous improvements to the Newcomen engine, notably the seals, and by improving these was able to almost triple their efficiency. He also preferred to use wheels instead of beams for transferring power from the cylinder, which made his engines more compact. Smeaton was the first to develop a rigorous theory of steam engine design of operation. He worked backward from the intended role to calculate the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] that would be needed for the task, the size and speed of a cylinder that would provide it, the size of boiler needed to feed it, and the amount of fuel it would consume. These were developed empirically after studying dozens of Newcomen engines in Cornwall and Newcastle, and building an experimental engine of his own at his home in [[Austhorpe]] in 1770. By the time the Watt engine was introduced only a few years later, Smeaton had built dozens of ever-larger engines into the 100&amp;nbsp;hp range.&lt;ref&gt;Tredgold, pg. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watt's separate condenser===
[[File:Watt steam pumping engine.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Early Watt pumping engine.]]

While working at the [[University of Glasgow]] as an instrument maker and repairman in 1759, [[James Watt]] was introduced to the power of steam by Professor [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]]. Fascinated, Watt took to reading everything he could on the subject, and independently developed the concept of [[latent heat]], only recently published by [[Joseph Black]] at the same university. When Watt learned that the University owned a small working model of a Newcomen engine, he pressed to have it returned from [[London]] where it was being unsuccessfully repaired. Watt repaired the machine, but found it was barely functional even when fully repaired.

After working with the design, Watt concluded that 80% of the steam used by the engine was wasted. Instead of providing motive force, it was instead being used to heat the cylinder. In the Newcomen design, every power stroke was started with a spray of cold water, which not only condensed the steam, but also cooled the walls of the cylinder. This heat had to be replaced before the cylinder would accept steam again. In the Newcomen engine the heat was supplied only by the steam, so when the steam valve was opened again the vast majority condensed on the cold walls as soon as it was admitted to the cylinder. It took a considerable amount of time and steam before the cylinder warmed back up and the steam started to fill it up.

Watt solved the problem of the water spray by removing the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the power cylinder. Once the induction stroke was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and  so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the power cylinder remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765.

Convinced that this was a great advance, Watt entered into partnerships to provide [[venture capital]] while he worked on the design. Not content with this single improvement, Watt worked tirelessly on a series of other improvements to practically every part of the engine.  Watt further improved the system by adding a small vacuum pump to pull the steam out of the cylinder into the condenser, further improving cycle times. A more radical change from the Newcomen design was closing off the top of the cylinder and introducing low-pressure steam above the piston. Now the power was not due to the difference of atmospheric pressure and the vacuum, but the pressure of the steam and the vacuum, a somewhat higher value. On the upward return stroke, the steam on top was transferred through a pipe to the underside of the piston ready to be condensed for the downward stroke. Sealing of the piston on a [[Newcomen engine]] had been achieved by maintaining a small quantity of water on its upper side. This was no longer possible in Watt's engine due to the presence of the steam. Watt spent considerable effort to find a seal that worked, eventually obtained by using a mixture of tallow and oil. The piston rod also passed through a [[Gland (engineering)|gland]] on the top cylinder cover sealed in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page19.asp |title=Energy Hall &amp;#124; See 'Old Bess' at work |publisher=Science Museum |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piston sealing problem was due to having no way to produce a sufficiently round cylinder.  Watt tried having cylinders bored from cast iron, but they were too out of round.  Watt was forced to use a hammered iron cylinder.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt; The following quotation is from Roe (1916):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When [John] [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]] first saw the engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that 'neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision' "&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Watt finally considered the design good enough to release in 1774, and the [[Watt engine]] was released to the market. As portions of the design could be easily fitted to existing Newcomen engines, there was no need to build an entirely new engine at the mines. Instead, Watt and his business partner [[Matthew Boulton]] licensed the improvements to engine operators, charging them a portion of the money they would save in reduced fuel costs. The design was wildly successful, and the [[Boulton and Watt]] company was formed to license the design and help new manufacturers build the engines. The two would later open the [[Soho Foundry]] to produce engines of their own.

In 1774 [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a boring machine with the shaft holding the boring tool supported on both ends, extending through the cylinder, unlike the then used cantilevered borers.  With this machine he was able to successfully bore the cylinder for [[Boulton and Watt]]'s first commercial engine in 1776.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Watt never ceased improving his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, automatic valves, double-acting pistons, a variety of rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements.  Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, David. (1965), ''Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715-1783'' Fontana History of Europe, (pp. 117 &amp; 283)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humphrey Gainsborough]] produced a model [[Condensation|condensing]] steam engine in the 1760s, which he showed to [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]], a member of the [[Lunar Society]]. Gainsborough believed that Watt had used his ideas for the invention;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, David (2004): ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; however James Watt was not a member of the Lunar Society at this period and his many accounts explaining the succession of thought processes leading to the final design would tend to belie this story.

Power was still limited by the low pressure, the displacement of the cylinder, combustion and evaporation rates and condenser capacity. Maximum theoretical efficiency was limited by the relatively low temperature differential on either side of the piston; this meant that for a Watt engine to provide a usable amount of power, the first production engines had to be very large, and were thus expensive to build and install.

===Watt double-acting and rotative engines===
{{details|Rotative beam engine}}

Watt developed a double-acting engine in which steam drove the piston in both directions, thereby increasing the engine speed and efficiency.  The double-acting principle also significantly increased the output of a given physical sized engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Boulton &amp; Watt]] developed the reciprocating engine into the [[rotative beam engine|rotative type]]. Unlike the Newcomen engine, the Watt engine could operate smoothly enough to be connected to a drive shaft – via [[sun and planet gear]]s – to provide rotary power along with double-acting condensing cylinders. The earliest example was built as a demonstrator and was installed in Boulton's factory to work machines for lapping (polishing) buttons or similar. For this reason it was always known as the ''[[Lap Engine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/motive_power/1861-46.aspx |title=The "Lap engine" at Science Museum, London (picture) |publisher=Sciencemuseum.org.uk |date=2007-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulse, David K., The development of rotary motion by steam power (TEE Publishing Ltd., Leamington, UK., 2001) {{ISBN|1-85761-119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early steam engines the piston is usually connected by a rod to a balanced beam, rather than directly to a flywheel, and these engines are therefore known as [[beam engine]]s.

Early steam engines did not provide constant enough speed for critical operations such as cotton spinning. To control speed the engine was used to pump water for a water wheel, which powered the machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==High-pressure engines==

As the 18th century advanced, the call was for higher pressures; this was strongly resisted by Watt who used the monopoly his patent gave him to prevent others from building high-pressure engines and using them in vehicles. He mistrusted the boiler technology of the day, the way they were constructed and the strength of the materials used.

The important advantages of high-pressure engines were: 
#They could be made much smaller than previously for a given power output. There was thus the potential for steam engines to be developed that were small and powerful enough to propel themselves and other objects. As a result, steam power for transportation now became a practicality in the form of ships and land vehicles, which revolutionised cargo businesses, travel, military strategy, and essentially every aspect of society.  
# Because of their smaller size, they were much less expensive.  
# They did not require the significant quantities of condenser cooling water needed by atmospheric engines.  
# They could be designed to run at higher speeds, making them more suitable for powering machinery.

The disadvantages were: 
# In the low-pressure range they were less efficient than condensing engines, especially if steam was not used expansively.  
# They were more susceptible to boiler explosions.

The main difference between how high-pressure and low-pressure steam engines work is the source of the force that moves the piston. In the engines of Newcomen and Watt, it is the condensation of the steam that creates most of the pressure difference, causing atmospheric pressure (Newcomen) and low-pressure steam, seldom more than 7 psi boiler pressure,&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cu31924004249532#page/n45/mode/2up p.21&lt;/ref&gt; plus condenser vacuum&lt;ref&gt;"The Steam Engine a brief history of the reciprocating engine, R.J.Law, Science Museum, Her Majesty's Stationery Office London, {{ISBN|0 11 290016 X}}, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; (Watt), to move the piston. In a high-pressure engine, most of the pressure difference is provided by the high-pressure steam from the boiler; the low-pressure side of the piston may be at atmospheric pressure or connected to the condenser pressure. Newcomen's [[indicator diagram]], almost all below the atmospheric line, would see a revival nearly 200 years later with the low pressure cylinder of triple expansion engines contributing about 20% of the engine power, again almost completely below the atmospheric line.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Special:MemberUsers?file=images%2F6%2F69%2FEr19010125.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known advocate of "strong steam" was [[Jacob Leupold]] in his scheme for an engine that appeared in encyclopaedic works from around 1725. Various projects for steam propelled boats and vehicles also appeared throughout the century one of the most promising being [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]]'s who demonstrated his "fardier" (steam wagon), in 1769. Whilst the working pressure used for this vehicle is unknown, the small size of the boiler gave insufficient steam production rate to allow the fardier to advance more than a few hundred metres at a time before having to stop to raise steam. Other projects and models were proposed, but as with [[William Murdoch]]'s model of 1784, many were blocked by Boulton and Watt.

This did not apply in the US, and in 1788 a steamboat built by [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] operated in regular commercial service along the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, and Burlington, New Jersey, carrying as many as 30 passengers. This boat could typically make 7 to 8 miles per hour, and traveled more than {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} during its short length of service. The Fitch steamboat was not a commercial success, as this route was adequately covered by relatively good wagon roads. In 1802 [[William Symington]] built a practical steamboat, and in 1807 [[Robert Fulton]] used a Watt steam engine to power the first commercially successful [[steamboat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Oliver Evans]] in his turn was in favour of "strong steam" which he applied to boat engines and to stationary uses. He was a pioneer of cylindrical boilers; however Evans' boilers did suffer several serious boiler explosions, which tended to lend weight to Watt's qualms. He founded the [[Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company]] in 1811 in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The company introduced high-pressure steam engines to the riverboat trade in the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi watershed]].

The first high-pressure steam engine was invented in 1800 by [[Richard Trevithick]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Trevithick_R/trevithickRichard4.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of raising steam under pressure (from a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] standpoint) is that it attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus became the basis for most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, "high pressure" amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the exhausting steam into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston.

On 21 February 1804, at the [[Penydarren]] ironworks at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in South Wales, the first self-propelled railway steam engine or steam locomotive, built by [[Richard Trevithick]], was demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert: "Timothy Hackworth and the Locomotive"; the Book guild Ltd, Lewes, U.K. (2000) (reprint of 1923 ed.) pp.18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornish engine and compounding===
{{Main article|Cornish steam engine|Compound engine}}
[[File:Cornish Figuier.JPG|thumb|left|Trevithick pumping engine (Cornish system).]]

Around 1811 [[Richard Trevithick]] was required to update a Watt pumping engine in order to adapt it to one of his new large cylindrical [[Cornish boiler]]s. When Trevithick left for South America in 1816, his improvements were continued by [[William Sims (engineer)|William Sims]]. In a parallel, [[Arthur Woolf]] developed a [[compound engine]] with two cylinders, so that steam expanded in a high-pressure cylinder before being released into a low-pressure one. Efficiency was further improved by [[Samuel Groase]], who insulated the boiler, engine, and pipes.&lt;ref name="Nuvolari &amp; Verspagen, 2007" &gt;{{cite journal

Steam pressure above the piston was increased eventually reaching {{convert|40|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} or even {{convert|50|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} and now provided much of the power for the downward stroke; at the same time condensing was improved. This considerably raised efficiency and further pumping engines on the Cornish system (often known as [[Cornish engine]]s) continued to be built new throughout the 19th century. Older [[Watt engine]]s were updated to conform.

The take-up of these Cornish improvements was slow in textile manufacturing areas where coal was cheap, due to the higher capital cost of the engines and the greater wear that they suffered. The change only began in the 1830s, usually by compounding through adding another (high-pressure) cylinder.&lt;ref name="Nuvolari &amp; Verspagen, 2009" &gt;{{cite journal

Another limitation of early steam engines was speed variability, which made them unsuitable for many textile applications, especially spinning.  In order to obtain steady speeds, early steam powered textile mills used the steam engine to pump water to a water wheel, which drove the machinery.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book

Many of these engines were supplied worldwide and gave reliable and efficient service over a great many years with greatly reduced coal consumption. Some of them were very large and the type continued to be built right down to the 1890s.

==Corliss engine==

The [[Corliss steam engine]] (patented 1849) was called the greatest improvement since James Watt.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009 p83"&gt;Thomson, p. 83-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss engine]] had greatly improved speed control and better efficiency, making it suitable to all sorts of industrial applications, including spinning.

Corliss used separate ports for steam supply and exhaust, which prevented the exhaust from cooling the passage used by the hot steam.  Corliss also used partially rotating valves that provided quick action, helping to reduce pressure losses.  The valves themselves were also a source of reduced friction, especially compared to the slide valve, which typically used 10% of an engine's power.&lt;ref name="Hunter and Bryant"/&gt;

Corliss used automatic variable cut off. The valve gear controlled engine speed by using the governor to vary the timing of the cut off.  This was partly responsible for the efficiency improvement in addition to the better speed control.

The high speed engine ran at piston speeds from three to five times the speed of ordinary engines.  It also had low speed variability. The high speed engine was  widely used in sawmills to power circular saws.  Later it was used for electrical generation.

The engine had several advantages. It could, in some cases, be directly coupled.  If gears or belts and drums were used, they could be much smaller sizes.  The engine itself was also small for the amount of power it developed.&lt;ref name="Hunter and Bryant"/&gt;

Porter greatly improved the fly-ball governor by reducing the rotating weight and adding a weight around the shaft.  This significantly improved speed control. Porter's governor became the leading type by 1880.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The efficiency of the Porter-Allen engine was good, but not equal to the Corliss engine.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Uniflow (or unaflow) engine===
{{Main article|Uniflow steam engine}}

The uniflow engine was the most efficient type of high-pressure engine. It was invented in 1911 and was used in ships, but was displaced by [[steam turbine]]s and later [[marine diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415147921 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Marc Levinson | title = The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger | publisher = Princeton Univ.

[[File:CISLab.jpg |thumb |393px |A lab in which ''computer and information science'' (CIS) is studied.]]
'''Information and computer science''' ('''ICS''') or '''computer and information science''' ('''CIS''') (plural forms, i.e., ''sciences'', may also be used) is a field that emphasizes ''both'' [[computing]] and [[informatics]], upholding the strong association between the fields of [[information science]]s and [[computer science]]s and treating [[computer]]s as a tool rather than a field.

''Information science'' is one with a [[Information science#Early beginnings|long history]], unlike the relatively [[History of computer science|very young]] field of computer science, and is primarily concerned with gathering, storing, disseminating, sharing and protecting any and all forms of information. It is a broad field, covering a myriad of different areas but is often referenced alongside computer science because of the incredibly useful nature of computers and computer programs in helping those studying and doing research in the field – particularly in helping to analyse data&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/jason.frand/teacher/technologies/palace/datamining.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and in spotting patterns too broad for a human to intuitively perceive. While information science is sometimes confused with information theory, the two have vastly different subject matter. Information theory focuses on one particular mathematical concept of information while information science is focused on all aspects of the processes and techniques of information.

''Computer science'', in contrast, is less focused on information and its different states, but more, in a very broad sense, on the use of computers – both in theory and practice – to design and implement [[algorithm]]s in order to aid the processing of information during the different states described above. It has strong foundations in the field of mathematics, as the very first recognised practitioners of the field were renowned mathematicians such as [[Alan Turing]].

Information science and computing began to converge in the 1950s and 1960s, as information scientists started to realize the many ways computers would improve information storage and retrieval.

==Terminology==
Due to the distinction between computers and computing, some research groups refer to ''computing'' or ''datalogy''. The French refer to computer science as ''[[:fr:Informatique |informatique]]''. The term ''information and communications technology'' (ICT), refers to how humans communicate with using machines and computers, making a distinction from ''information and computer science'', which is how computers use and gain information.

Informatics is also distinct from ''computer science'', which encompasses the study of logic and low-level computing issues.

==Education==
Universities may confer degrees of ICS and CIS, not to be confused with a more specific [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] or respective graduate computer science degrees.

The QS World University Rankings is one of the most widely recognised and distinguished university comparisons. They ranked the top 10 universities for ''computer science'' and ''[[information system]]s'' in 2015. 

They are:
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
* Stanford University
* University of Oxford
* Carnegie Mellon University
* Harvard University
* University of California, Berkeley (UCB)
* University of Cambridge
* The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
* Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich)
* Princeton University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/computer-science-information-systems#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search= |title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2015 – Computer Science &amp; Information Systems |date= |access-date= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Computer Information Science degree gives students both network and computing knowledge which is needed to design, develop, and assist information systems which helps to solve business problems and to support business problems and to support business operations and decision making at a managerial level also.

==Areas of information and computer science==
Due the nature of this field, many topics are also shared with [[computer science]] and [[information system]]s.

The discipline of ''Information and Computer Science'' spans a vast range of areas from basic computer science theory (algorithms and computational logic)  to in depth analysis of data manipulation and use within technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cs.mtu.edu/~john/whatiscs.html |title=What is Computer Science? |date= |access-date= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming theory===
The process of taking a given algorithm and encoding it into a language that can be understood and executed by a computer. There are many different types of programming languages and various different types of computers, however, they all have the same goal: to turn algorithms into machine code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What Is Programming? – Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures |url=http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsProgramming.html |website=interactivepython.org |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular programming languages used within the academic study of CIS include, but are not limited to;
* Java
* Python
* C#
* C++
* Perl
* Ruby
* Pascal
* Swift
* Visual Basic

===Information and information systems===
The academic study of software and hardware systems that process large quantities and data, support large scale data management and how data can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=information system |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/information-system |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where the field is unique from the standard study of computer science. The area of information systems focuses on the networks of hardware and software that are required to process, manipulate and distribute such data.

===Computer systems and organisations===
The process of analysing computer architecture and various logic circuits. This involves looking at low level computer processes at bit level computation. This is an in-depth look into the hardware processing of a computational system, involving looking at the basic structure of a computer and designing such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is Computer Architecture? – Definition from Techopedia |url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26757/computer-architecture |website=Techopedia.com |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also involve evaluating complex circuit diagrams, and being able to construct these to solve a main problem.

The main purpose behind this area of study is to achieve an understanding of how computers function on a basic level, often through tracing machine operations.

===Machines, languages, and computation===
This is the study into fundamental computer algorithms, which are the basis to computer programs. Without algorithms, no computer programs would exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is a computer algorithm? |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question717.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also involves the process of looking into various mathematical functions behind computational algorithms, basic theory and functional (low level) programming.

In an academic setting, this area would introduce the fundamental mathematical theorems and functions behind theoretical computer science which are the building blocks for other areas in the field. Complex topics such as; proofs, algebraic functions and sets will be introduced during studies of CIS.

== Developments ==
Information and computer science is a field that is rapidly developing with job prospects for students being extremely promising with 75.7% of graduates gaining employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What can I do With My Degree? |url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/options_computer_science.htm |website=Prospects |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the IT industry employs one in twenty of the workforce with it predicted to increase nearly five times faster than the average of the UK and between 2012 and 2017 more than half a million people will be needed within the industry and the fact that nine out of ten tech firms are suffering from candidate shortages which is having a negative impact on their business as it delays the creation and development of new products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Computer science graduates: why do they top unemployment tables? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/16/computer-science-graduates-unemployment-bme |website=The Guardian |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it’s predicted in the US that in the next decade there will be more than one million jobs in the technology sector than computer science graduates to fill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Push to Boost Computer Science Learning Even at an Early Age |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/02/17/271151462/a-push-to-boost-computer-science-learning-even-at-an-early-age |website=NPR |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this programming is now being taught at an earlier age with an aim to interest students from a young age into computer and information science hopefully leading more children to study this at a higher level. For example, children in England will now be exposed to computer programming at the age of 5 due to an updated national curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Teaching our children to code: a quiet revolution |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10410036/Teaching-our-children-to-code-a-quiet-revolution.html |website=The Telegraph |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
Due to the wide variety of jobs that now involve computer and information science related tasks, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of possible jobs in this area, but some of the key areas are artificial intelligence, software engineering and computer networking and communication. Work in this area also tends to require sufficient understanding of mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is Computer Science |url=https://www.cs.mtu.edu/~john/whatiscs.html |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, jobs that having a CIS degree can lead to, include: systems analyst, network administrator, system architect, information systems developer, web programmer, or software developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The 10 Best Online Bachelor in Computer Information Systems Degree Program |url =http://www.thebestschools.org/rankings/10-best-online-bachelor-computer-information-systems-degree-programs/ |website=The Best Schools |access-date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earning potential for CIS graduates is quite promising. A 2013 survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) found that the average starting salary for graduates who earned a degree in a computer related field was $59,977, up 4.3% from the prior year. This is higher than other popular degrees such as business ($54,234), education ($40,480) and math and sciences ($42,724).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Starting Salaries for New College Graduates |url=http://www.naceweb.org/uploadedFiles/NACEWeb/Research/Salary_Survey/Reports/salary-survey-april-2013-executive-summary.pdf |access-date=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Payscale ranked 129 college degrees based on their graduates earning potential with engineering, math, science, and technology fields dominating the ranking. With eight computer related degrees appearing among the top 30. With the lowest starting salary for these jobs being $49,900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Computer science major ranks No. 8 for salary potential

The IMP software and the ARPA network communications protocol running on the IMPs was discussed in RFC 1, the first of a [[Request for Comments|series of standardization documents]] published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).

==History==
[[File:IMP Team.jpg|thumb|300px|IMP Team (Left to Right): Truett Thatch, Bill Bartell (Honeywell), Dave Walden, Jim Geisman, Robert Kahn, Frank Heart, Ben Barker, Marty Thorpe, Will Crowther, Severo Ornstein Not pictured: Bernie Cosell]]
The idea of an "Interface computer" was first developed in 1966 by [[Donald Davies]] for the [[NPL network]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Dr. Lawrence G.|title=The ARPANET &amp; Computer Networks|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/arpanet-computernet.html|accessdate=13 April 2016|date=May 1995|quote=Then in June 1966, Davies wrote a second internal paper, "Proposal for a Digital Communication Network" In which he coined the word packet,- a small sub part of the message the user wants to send, and also introduced the concept of an "Interface computer" to sit between the user equipment and the packet network.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea was independently developed in early 1967 at a meeting of principal investigators for the Department of Defense's [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) to discuss interconnecting machines across the country. [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]], who led the ARPANET implementation, initially proposed a network of host computers. [[Wesley A. Clark|Wes Clark]] suggested inserting "a small computer between each host computer and the network of transmission lines",&lt;ref name="Hafner"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hafner|first1=K.|last2=Lyon|first2=M.|title=Where Wizards Stay Up Late|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=1996|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=0-684-83267-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. making the IMP a separate computer.

The IMPs were built by the Massachusetts-based company [[BBN Technologies|Bolt Beranek and Newman]] (BBN) in 1969.  BBN was contracted to build four IMPs, the first being due at UCLA by Labor Day; the remaining three were to be delivered in one-month intervals thereafter, completing the entire network in a total of twelve months. When Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy learned of BBN's accomplishment in signing this million-dollar agreement, he sent a telegram congratulating the company for being contracted to build the "Interfaith Message Processor".&lt;ref name="Hafner" /&gt;

The team working on the IMP called themselves the "IMP Guys":&lt;ref name="Hafner" /&gt;

* Team Leader: Frank Heart
* Software: [[William Crowther (programmer)|Willy Crowther]], [[Dave Walden]], Bernie Cosell and Paul Wexelblat
* Hardware: [[Severo Ornstein]], Ben Barker
* Theory and collaboration with the above on the overall system design: [[Bob Kahn]]
* Other: Hawley Rising
* Added to IMP team later: Marty Thrope (hardware), Jim Geisman, Truett Thach (installation), Bill Bertell (Honeywell)
 
BBN began programming work in February 1969 on modified Honeywell DDP-516s. The completed code was six thousand words long, and was written in the Honeywell 516 assembly language. The IMP software was produced primarily on a PDP-1, where the IMP code was written and edited, then run on the Honeywell.

BBN designed the IMP simply as "a messenger" that would only "store-and-forward".&lt;ref name="Hafner" /&gt; BBN designed only the host-to-IMP specification, leaving host sites to build individual host-to-host interfaces. The IMP had an error-control mechanism that discarded packets with errors without acknowledging receipt; the source IMP, upon not receiving an acknowledging receipt, would subsequently re-send a duplicate packet. Based on the requirements of ARPA's [[request for proposal]], the IMP used a 24-bit [[checksum]] for error correction. BBN chose to make the IMP hardware calculate the checksum, because it was a faster option than using a software calculation. The IMP was initially conceived as being connected to one host computer per site, but at the insistence of researchers and students from the host sites, each IMP was ultimately designed to connect to multiple host computers.

The first IMP was delivered to [[Leonard Kleinrock]]'s group at UCLA on August 30, 1969. It used an SDS Sigma-7 host computer. [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s group at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) received the second IMP on October 1, 1969. It was attached to an [[SDS 940|SDS-940]] host. The third IMP was installed in University of California, Santa Barbara on November 1, 1969. The fourth and final IMP was installed in the University of Utah in December 1969. The first communication test between two systems (UCLA and SRI) took place on October 29, 1969, when a ''login'' to the SRI machine was attempted, but only the first two letters could be transmitted.

BBN developed a program to test the performance of the communication circuits. According to a report filed by Heart, a preliminary test in late 1969 based on a 27-hour period of activity on the UCSB-SRI line found "approximately one packet per 20,000 in error;" subsequent tests "uncovered a 100% variation in this number - apparently due to many unusually long periods of time (on the order of hours) with no detected errors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A variant of the IMP existed, called the TIP, which connected terminals as well as computers to the network; it was based on the Honeywell 316, a later version of the 516. Later, some Honeywell-based IMPs were replaced with multiprocessing BBN [[Pluribus]] IMPs, but ultimately BBN developed a [[microcode|microprogrammed]] clone of the Honeywell machine.

IMPs were at the heart of the ARPANET until DARPA decommissioned the ARPANET in 1989. Most IMPs were either taken apart, junked or transferred to [[MILNET]]. Some became artifacts in museums; Kleinrock placed IMP Number One on public view at UCLA.&lt;ref name="Hafner" /&gt; The last IMP on the ARPANET was the one at the University of Maryland.

==BBN Report 1822==
''BBN Report 1822'' specifies the method for connecting a host computer to an IMP. This connection and protocol is generally referred to as ''1822'', the report number.

The initial version of the 1822 protocol was developed in 1969: since it predates the [[OSI model]] by a decade, 1822 does not map cleanly into the OSI layers. However, it is accurate to say that the 1822 protocol incorporates the [[physical layer]], the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]]. The interface visible to the host system passes network layer addresses directly to a physical layer device.

To transmit data, the host constructs a message containing the numeric address of another host on the network (similar to an [[IP address]] on the [[Internet]]) and a data field, and transmits the message across the 1822 interface to the IMP. The IMP routes the message to the destination host using protocols that were eventually adopted by [[Internet]] [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Messages could store a total length of 8159 Bits, of which the first 96 were reserved for the header (“leader”).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/bbn/imp/BBN1822_Jan1976.pdf BBN Report 1822, ''Specifications for the interconnection of a host and a IMP'']&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] transmitted across the Internet are assumed to be unreliable, 1822 messages were guaranteed to be transmitted reliably to the addressed destination. If the message could not be delivered, the IMP sent to the originating host a message indicating that the delivery failed. In practice, however, there were (rare) conditions under which the host could miss a report of a message being lost, or under which the IMP could report a message as lost when it had in fact been received.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}
'''Internet research''' is the practice of using [[Internet]] information, especially free information on the [[World Wide Web]], or Internet-based resources (like Internet [[discussion forum]]) in [[research]].

Internet research has had a profound impact on the way [[idea]]s are formed and [[knowledge]] is created. Common applications of Internet research include personal research on a particular subject (something mentioned on the news, a health problem, etc.), [[student]]s doing research for academic projects and papers, and [[journalist]]s and other [[writer]]s researching stories.

''Research'' is a broad term. Here, it is used to mean "looking something up (on the Web)". It includes any activity where a topic is identified, and an effort is made to actively gather information for the purpose of furthering [[understanding]]. It may include some post-collection analysis like a concern for quality or synthesis.

Through searches on the Internet hundreds or thousands of [[Web page|page]]s can often be quickly found with some relation to a given topic. In addition, [[email]] (including [[mailing lists]]), online [[discussion forum]]s (aka [[message board]]s, [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]'s), and other personal communication facilities ([[instant messaging]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[newsgroup]]s, etc.) can provide direct access to [[expert]]s and other individuals with relevant interests and knowledge.

Internet research is distinct from library research (focusing on library-bound resources) and commercial database research (focusing on commercial databases). While many commercial databases are delivered through the Internet, and some libraries purchase access to library databases on behalf of their patrons, searching such databases is generally not considered part of “Internet research”. It should also be distinguished from [[scientific research]] (research following a defined and rigorous process) carried out on the Internet, from straightforward retrieving of details like a name or phone number, and from research ''about'' the Internet.

Internet research can provide quick, immediate, and worldwide access to information, although results may be affected by unrecognized bias, difficulties in verifying a writer's [[credentials]] (and therefore the accuracy or pertinence of the information obtained) and whether the searcher has sufficient skill to draw meaningful results from the abundance of material typically available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hargittai, E. |date=April 2002 |title=Second-Level Digital Divide: Differences in People’s Online Skills |journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |url= http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/942/864 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first resources retrieved may not be the most suitable resources to answer a particular question. Popularity is often a factor used in structuring Internet search results but popular information is not always most correct or representative of the breadth of knowledge and opinion on a topic.

While conducting commercial research fosters a deep concern with costs, and library research fosters a concern with access, Internet research fosters a deep concern for quality, managing the abundance of information and with avoiding unintended bias. This is partly because Internet research occurs in a less mature information environment: an environment with less sophisticated / poorly communicated search skills and much less effort in organizing information. Library and commercial research has many search tactics and strategies unavailable on the Internet and the library and commercial environments invest more deeply in organizing and vetting their information.

==Search tools==

The most popular search tools for finding information on the Internet include [[Web search engine|Web search engines]], [[Metasearch engine|meta search engines]], [[Web directory|Web directories]], and specialty search services. A Web search engine uses software known as a [[Web crawler]] to follow the hyperlinks connecting the pages on the World Wide Web. The information on these Web pages is indexed and stored by the search engine. To access this information, a user enters keywords in a search form and the search engine queries its algorithms, which take into consideration the location and frequency of keywords on a Web page, along with the quality and number of external hyperlinks pointing at the Web page.

A Meta search engine enables users to enter a search query once and it runs against multiple search engines simultaneously, creating a list of aggregated search results. Since no single search engine covers the entire web, a meta search engine can produce a more comprehensive search of the web. Most meta search engines automatically eliminate duplicate search results. However, meta search engines have a significant limitation because the most popular search engines, such as [[Google Search|Google]], are not included because of legal restrictions.

A Web directory organizes subjects in a hierarchical fashion that lets users investigate the breadth of a specific topic and drill down to find relevant links and content. Web directories can be assembled automatically by algorithms or handcrafted. Human-edited Web directories have the distinct advantage of higher quality and reliability, while those produced by algorithms can offer more comprehensive coverage. The scope of Web directories are generally broad, such as DOZ, [[Yahoo!]] and [[World Wide Web Virtual Library|The WWW Virtual Library]], covering a wide range of subjects, while others focus on specific topics.

Specialty search tools enable users to find information that conventional search engines and meta search engines cannot access because the content is stored in databases. In fact, the vast majority of information on the web is stored in databases that require users to go to a specific site and access it through a search form. Often, the content is generated dynamically. As a consequence, Web crawlers are unable to index this information. In a sense, this content is "hidden" from search engines, leading to the term invisible or deep Web. Specialty search tools have evolved to provide users with the means to quickly and easily find deep Web content. These specialty tools rely on advanced bot and intelligent agent technologies to search the deep Web and automatically generate specialty Web directories, such as the Virtual Private Library.

== Website authorship ==

When using the Internet for research, countless websites appear for whatever search query is entered. Each of these sites has one or more authors or associated organizations. Who authored or sponsored a website is very important to the accuracy and reliability of the information presented on the website.

While it is very imperative that the authorship be determined for every website during Internet research, who authored or sponsored a website is essential culture when one cares about the accuracy and reliability of the information, bias, and/or web safety. For example, a website about civil rights that is authored by a member of an extremist group most likely will not contain accurate or unbiased information.

The author or sponsoring organization of a website may be found in several ways. Sometimes the author or organization can be found at the bottom of the website home page. Another way is by looking in the ‘Contact Us’ section of the website. It may be directly listed, determined from the email address, or by emailing and asking. If the author’s name or sponsoring organization cannot be determined, one should question the trustworthiness of the website. If the author’s name or sponsoring organization is found, a simple Internet search can provide information that can be used to determine if the website is reliable and unbiased.

== Internet research software ==

Internet research software captures information while performing Internet research. This information can then be organized in various ways included tagging and hierarchical trees. The goal is to collect information relevant to a specific research project in one place, so that it can be found and accessed again quickly.

These tools also allow captured content to be edited and annotated and some allow the ability to export to other formats. Other features common to [[outliner]]s include the ability to use full text search which aids in quickly locating information and filters enable you to drill down to see only information relevant to a specific query. Captured and kept information also provides an additional backup, in case web pages and sites disappear or are inaccessible later.

'''Johannes Theodor Reinhardt''' (3 December 1816, in [[Copenhagen]] – 23 October 1882, in [[Frederiksberg]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[zoologist]] and [[herpetologist]]. He was the son of [[Johan Reinhardt|Johannes Christopher Hagemann Reinhardt]].

He participated as botanist in the first [[Galathea Expedition]] (1845—1847). In 1848 he became a [[curator]] at the ''Kongelige Naturhistoriske Museum'' in Copenhagen (now [[University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum]]). He taught classes in [[zoology]] at the ''[[Technical University of Denmark|Danmarks Tekniske Universitet]]'' (1856–1878) and at the [[University of Copenhagen]] (1861–1878). In 1854 he received the title of professor.&lt;ref name=DA&gt;[http://www.darwinarkivet.dk/en/responses/danish-responses/biographies/johannes-theodor-reinhardt/ Darwinarkivet] Biographies; Johannes Theodor Reinhardt.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1840s and 1850s he periodically worked in [[Brazil]] as an assistant to [[palaeontologist]] [[Peter Wilhelm Lund]] (1801–1880). He was an early supporter of [[Charles Darwin]]’s theory of evolution, and from his research of extinct species, was critical of [[George Cuvier]]'s concept of "anti-evolutionary catastrophism".&lt;ref name=DA/&gt;

With [[Christian Frederik Lütken]] (1827–1901), he was co-author of ''Bidrag til Kundskab om Brasiliens Padder og Krybdyr'' (Contributions to the knowledge of Brazilian [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1670/211-02A Journal of Herpetology] by: The Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

He described 25 new species of reptiles, some with Lütken.&lt;ref&gt;"Reinhardt". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, [[Hermann Schlegel]] named the [[Calabar python|Calabar "python"]], ''Calabaria reinhardtii'', in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Calabaria&amp;species=reinhardtii The Reptile Database] ''Calabaria reinhardtii''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The '''King City weather radar station''' ([[ICAO]] site identifier '''CWKR''') is a [[weather radar]] located in [[King City, Ontario|King City]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is operated by [[Environment Canada]] and is part of the [[Canadian weather radar network]], for which it is the primary [[research station]].

The 16.45 hectare{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}} site is listed at an elevation of 360&amp;nbsp;m, and the tower is 27&amp;nbsp;m tall.{{sfn|Environment Canada|2002}}

Mounted on the tower is a 5&amp;nbsp;cm weather radar, and a [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] dual-polarization radar system was installed at the site in 2004.{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}}

==Research==
The station serves a number of research roles, and collects data to fulfill those observational needs. It is "responsible for providing national leadership on radar meteorology research applications".{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}}

In 1984, the Research Directorate of the [[Atmospheric Environment Service]] established the first Canadian [[weather radar]] with [[Weather radar#Velocity|Doppler capability]] in King City.{{sfn|Crozier|Joe|Scott|Herscovitch|1991}} In 2004, a dual-polarization radar was installed for further research.{{sfn|Sills|2004}} These systems are used for predictive purposes, and the data collected is used for weather forecasts for the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and the [[Golden Horseshoe (Ontario)|Golden Horseshoe]].

Further, under the auspices of the Cloud Physics and Severe Weather Research Section of Environment Canada, the King Doppler Weather Radar Research Facility collects data for research.

The C-band radar can be useful for observing [[bird migration]] patterns, especially when data is taken in aggregate with that of other radar stations.  Current active research in dual-polarization radar includes winter precipitation, detection and short-term forecasting of high-impact weather events,{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}} quantitative precipitation estimation,{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}} satellite validation,{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}} and particle type identification.

==Equipment==
The WSR82D radar installed in 1982 had a fiberglass laminate radome, and a parabolic reflector with a diameter of 6.1m and linear horizontal polarisation.{{sfn|Raghavan|2003|p=45}} Its [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] was 48 dB.{{sfn|Raghavan|2003|p=45}} The radar emitted a 260kW beam with a [[frequency]] of 5625 MHz and [[wavelength]] of 5.33cm having a [[beam width]] of 0.65 degrees.{{sfn|Raghavan|2003|p=45}} In conventional operation, it had a [[pulse duration]] of 2µs, [[pulse repetition frequency]] of 250 pulses per second, and performed 6.0 scanning rotations per minute.{{sfn|Raghavan|2003|p=45}} In [[Weather radar#Velocity|Doppler]] operation, it had a pulse duration of 0.5µs, pulse repetition frequency of 892 or 1190 pulses per second, and a scan rate of 0.75 rotations per minute. {{sfn|Raghavan|2003|p=45}} In long-range Doppler operation, a pulse repetition frequency of 650 pulses per second and a scan rate of 2 rotations per minute were used.{{sfn|Raghavan|2003|p=45}}

It was replaced in 2004 by a similar radar but with [[dual polarization]] capabilities.{{sfn|Environment Canada|2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">The following is a '''list of centroids''' of various [[two-dimensional]] objects.  The [[centroid]] of an object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|space]] is the intersection of all [[hyperplane]]s that divide &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into two parts of equal [[moment (physics)|moment]] about the hyperplane. Informally, it is the "[[average]]" of all points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. For an object of uniform composition (mass, density, etc.) the centroid of a body is also its [[Center of mass|center of mass]]. In the case of two-dimensional objects shown below, the hyperplanes are simply lines.

|quote=The distinction between primary and secondary constraints is not a very fundamental one. It depends very much on the original Lagrangian which we start off with. Once we have gone over to the Hamiltonian formalism, we can really forget about the distinction between primary and secondary constraints.
|source={{harvtxt|Dirac|1964|loc=p.43}}}}
In Hamiltonian mechanics, a '''primary constraint''' is a relation between the coordinates and momenta that holds without using the equations of motion {{harv|Dirac|1964|loc=p.8}}. A '''secondary constraint''' is one that is not primary, in other words it holds when the equations of motion are satisfied, but need not hold if they are not satisfied {{harv|Dirac|1964|loc=p.14}}. The secondary constraints arise from the condition that the primary constraints should be preserved in time. (A few authors use more refined terminology, where the non-primary constraints are divided into secondary, tertiary, quaternary,... constraints: the secondary constraints arise directly from the condition that the primary constraints are preserved by time, the tertiary constraints arise from the condition that the secondary ones are also preserved by time, and so on.) Primary and secondary constraints were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last1=Anderson|last2=Bergmann|author2-link=Peter Bergmann|year=1951|loc=p.1019}} and developed by {{harvs|txt|last=Dirac|year1=1950|year2=1958|year3=1958b|year4=1964}}.

The terminology of primary and secondary constraints is confusingly similar to that of [[first class constraint|first and second class constraints]]. These divisions are independent: both first and second class constraints can be either primary or secondary, so this gives altogether four different classes of constraints.

'''Project Vela''' was a project undertaken by the [[United States Department of Defense]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense. Advanced Research Projects Agency. (1961, July 20). ADDENDUM to: Proceedings of Symposium: Project Vela (1st ed.) (263145). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. Retrieved May 24, 2017 from the World Wide Web: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/263145.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop and implement methods to monitor compliance with the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], which banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Underwater, effectively meaning nuclear tests were only to be permitted underground. The Vela Project started off as a small budget research program within the [[Advanced Research Projects Administration|DARPA]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Projects Agencies until around 1961, when it was granted greater funding and resources through the authority of the [[Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; likely prompted by the same increased caution over Domestic Nuclear Affairs that was the effect of the [[1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash]], as well as in anticipation of the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|PTB Treaty]].

The initial project was limited to the development of the Vela Satellites, but was then expanded and reorganized into three distinct levels of monitoring: [[Vela Uniform]], which was the portion of the project dedicated towards monitoring seismic signals, in order to detect underground and underwater nuclear testing, [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Hotel]], which was a continuation of the satellite program to detect nuclear testing solely beyond the atmosphere at an extended range, and [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Sierra]], which was a set of advanced satellites that were designed to detect testing both in the close reaches of outer space and within the atmosphere of the planet itself. The project’s space and atmospheric divisions ran until around the emplacement of satellites in the [[Defense Support Program]] (DSP), and were eventually integrated into the [[Global Positioning System]] set of satellites. Currently, all satellites under Project Vela are under the management of [[Nuclear MASINT|IONDS]]. The seismic division of Project Vela remains in activity today.

== Vela Hotel and the Initial Vela Project ==
[[File:Vela-1 satellite.jpg|thumb|A bird's eye view of the Vela 1 satellite from the Vela Hotel series.]]
Though there is little to no actual documentation that directly concerns the issue of the Initial Vela Project, due to its low funding, staffing, resources and status of priority. However, it is known that the majority of the work done on the initial Vela Project was implemented into [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Hotel]], which monitored outer space for nuclear tests. The [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Hotel]] satellite program was mostly developed at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]], under the supervision of the [[United States Air Force]]. The method through which they ended up monitoring for nuclear testing beyond the atmosphere utilized a system of [[X-ray]] detection, as well as [[Neutron radiation|Neutron]] and [[Gamma ray|Gamma-Ray]] detection.

The Satellites’ actual instrumentation count&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wade, M. (Ed.). (2016, July 11). Vela. Retrieved May 24, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.astronautix.com/v/vela.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is 12 X-ray detectors, 18 internal Neutron and Gamma-ray detectors, transmission gear to send the information back down to Earth, and a set of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|Solar Panels]] which generated a net power of 90 watts for the use of all instrumentation on each Satellite. Of the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Hotel]] series, which was launched a week after the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|PTB]] Treaty on October 17, 1963, 6 total satellites were manufactured and launched, each with a design life of six months. After deployment, they remained operational and online for 5 years before being shut down.

The [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Hotel]] series of satellites never actually did detect any weapons being tested in outer space, but it did bring the scientific community valuable knowledge regarding the mechanics of the [[Solar System|solar system]], namely, this series of satellites was the set responsible for discovering [[Gamma-ray burst|Gamma-Ray Bursts]]&lt;ref&gt;Klebesadel R.W.; Strong I.B. &amp; Olson R.A.

The discovery of [[Gamma-ray burst|Gamma-Ray Bursts]] has allowed scientists to be able to [[Space exploration|map the universe]] to a heretofore unparalleled degree, as sensors no longer have to rely on light alone to determine things far off in deep space.

== Vela Sierra and the Advanced Vela Series ==
[[File:Vela5b.jpg|thumb|An Advanced Vela series satellite in the Vela Sierra subset]]
After the completion of development on the first set of Vela Satellites in the Hotel series, DARPA began work on the next phase of the Vela satellite program, namely, on [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Sierra]], which was intended to monitor the atmosphere for covert nuclear tests. Following the deployment of the Hotel series, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] resumed development on the satellites, this time working towards the Advanced Vela series. These new satellites were created with the intention that they would replace the Hotel Series, as well as function as the satellites that would complete the objectives of the Vela Sierra subset.

The new set of Advanced Vela satellites were equipped with the same detection equipment as the Hotel series&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, those being the 12 X-ray detectors and 18 internal Neutron and Gamma-Ray detectors, but were also equipped with a new set of instruments. The Advanced Vela series came equipped with two non-imaging [[photodiode]] sensors called [[Bhangmeter|bhangmeters]]. These measured light levels over sub-millisecond intervals, and could detect a nuclear explosion to within 3,000 miles. This addition was necessary due to the singular effects that atmospheric nuclear explosions produce, called either the “Double Flash” or the “Double-Humped Curve,” which is a pair of flashes of light caused by an explosion, one lasting a millisecond which is quite intense and bright, the other far more prolonged and less intense. This “Double Flash” is what distinguishes atmospheric nuclear explosions from other kinds of explosions in the atmosphere, along with radiation, since the only feasible event that could theoretically produce a double event like an atmospheric nuclear explosion would be something incredibly rare like a [[meteoroid]] generated [[lightning|lightning superbolt]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4190|number=190|date=26 January 2010|title=The Bell Island Boom|accessdate=22 June 2017}} N.B. quote (emphasis added): ''"They also picked up large lightning flashes, and it was in part from the Vela satellites that we learned about lightning superbolts. About five of every ten million bolts of lightning is classified as a superbolt, which is just what it sounds like: An unusually large bolt of lightning, lasting an unusually long time: About a thousandth of a second. Superbolts are almost always in the upper atmosphere, and usually over the oceans."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt; [http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf001/sf001p10.htm Lightning Superbolts Detected By Satellites], Science Frontiers, September 1977, No. 1, which in turn cites:

Retrieved from Science-Frontiers.com website May 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, radiation in the atmosphere is far less easy to calculate, as the [[Van Allen radiation belt|Van Allen radiation belts]] can mask radioactive wavelengths and signatures. The Advanced Vela satellites were additionally fitted with larger [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]], since the new design required 120 watts as opposed to the Hotel series’ 90 watts, as well as [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic sensors]] for detecting an [[electromagnetic pulse]] from an in-atmosphere detonation. The new set of satellites had a design life of 18 months, but instead lasted on average 7 years, with the longest lasting of the set (Vehicle 9) being shut down in 1984, lasting around 15 years before being shut down.

Vela Sierra’s most famous actual event was the “[[Vela Incident|Double Flash]]” detected on September 22, 1979 by Vela satellite 6911 near the [[Prince Edward Islands]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Conner JP, Evans WD, Belian RD (Sep 1969).

However, due to the lack of any corroborating evidence that a bomb ever went off in the area other than the readings the satellite provided, it is widely regarded as either a malfunction or a [[Magnetosphere|magnetospheric event]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; affecting the instruments aboard the satellite.

[[Vela Uniform]] was the second half of Project Vela that began its development soon after the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|PTB Treaty]] was put into effect. Vela Uniform was created with the intention of monitoring [[Earthquake|seismic activity]] in order to determine the [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] and location of any covert nuclear weapons tests beneath the surface of the earth, or underwater at any point on the Earth’s surface. The methods [[DARPA]] used to create a system with which they could determine the difference between a regular [[Earthquake|seismic event]] and an underground covert nuclear test was through the rigorous measurement of seven nuclear tests in the [[Contiguous United States|Continental United States]] and [[Alaska]], as well as numerous smaller experiments using conventional [[Explosive material|high explosives]] rather than nukes.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Nuclear Tests, July 1945 to 31 December 1992" (NWD 94-1), Robert Standish Norris and Thomas B.

Over time, [[Vela Uniform]]’s methods and techniques for measuring [[Earthquake|seismic activity]] to determine the existence and location of covert underground nuclear tests (which have been illegal under [[international law]] since the widespread ratification of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] or CTBT) and stations of seismographical monitoring exist all around the world. This has had the effect of giving more nations the ability to better understand their own country’s seismic activities, and has given more and more countries fundamentally more access to aid in situations of [[Earthquake|Earthquakes]], [[Tsunami|Tsunamis]], and other such events, as well as ensuring the detection of any future covert underground nuclear tests.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''quantum nonlocality''' most commonly refers to the phenomenon by which measurements made at a microscopic level contradict a collection of notions known as ''[[Principle of locality#Local realism|local realism]]'' that are regarded as intuitively true in [[classical mechanics]]. However, some [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] predictions of multi-system measurement statistics on [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] quantum states cannot be simulated by any [[local hidden variable theory]].  An explicit example is demonstrated by [[Bell's theorem]], which has been verified by experiment.&lt;ref name="Hensen"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hensen, B etal | title = Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres |date=October 2015 | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=526 | pages=682–686 | doi= 10.1038/nature15759 |issue=7575 | pmid=26503041|bibcode=2015Natur.526..682H |arxiv=1508.05949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments have generally favoured quantum mechanics as a description of nature, over local hidden variable theories.&lt;ref name="aspect"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aspect  | first = Alain |author2=Dalibard, Jean |author3=Roger, Gérard   | title = Experimental Test of Bell's Inequalities Using Time- Varying Analyzers |date=December 1982  | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]  | volume = 49  | issue = 25  | pages = 1804–1807 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.1804 |bibcode = 1982PhRvL..49.1804A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rowe2001"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rowe MA, etal | title = Experimental violation of a Bell's Inequality with efficient detection |date=February 2001 | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=409 | pages=791–794 | doi=10.1038/35057215 |bibcode = 2001Natur.409..791K | issue=6822 | pmid=11236986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any physical theory that supersedes or replaces quantum theory must make similar experimental predictions and must therefore also be nonlocal in this sense; quantum nonlocality is a property of the universe that is independent of our description of nature.

Quantum nonlocality does not allow for [[superluminal communication|faster-than-light communication]],&lt;ref name="ghirardi1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ghirardi  | first = G.C. |author2=Rimini, A. |author3=Weber, T.   | title = A general argument against superluminal transmission through the quantum mechanical measurement process |date=March 1980  | journal = [[Nuovo Cimento|Lettere al Nuovo Cimento]]  | volume = 27  | issue = 10  | pages = 293–298 | doi = 10.1007/BF02817189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence is compatible with [[special relativity]].

== History ==

===Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen===
{{Main|EPR paradox}}

In 1935, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]] published a [[thought experiment]] with which they hoped to expose the incompleteness of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in relation to the violation of [[Principle of locality|local causality]] at the microscopic scale that it described.&lt;ref name="epr"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein| first = Albert |author2=Podolsky, Boris |author3=Rosen, Nathan   | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?  |date=May 1935  | journal = [[Physical Review]]  | volume = 47  | issue = 10  | pages = 777–780 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Einstein presented a variant of these ideas in a letter to [[Erwin Schrödinger]],&lt;ref name="Einstein"&gt;{{cite archive |first= Albert |last= Einstein |item = Letter to E. Schrödinger|type = Letter|item-id =Call Number 22-47  |collection = Einstein Archives|institution= Hebrew University of Jerusalem|urlref= http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000024019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the version that is presented here. The state and notation used here are more modern, and akin to Bohm's take on EPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author= Jevtic, S.|author2= Rudolph, T|year=2015|issue=4|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B|pages= 50–55|volume= 32|title=How Einstein and/or Schrödinger should have discovered Bell's theorem in 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum state of the two particles prior to measurement can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\psi_{AB}\right\rang =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(\left|0\right\rang_A \left|1\right\rang_B -
\left|1\right\rang_A  \left|0\right\rang_B \bigg)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(\left|+\right\rang_A \left|-\right\rang_B -
\left|-\right\rang_A  \left|+\right\rang_B \bigg)  &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\left|\pm\right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0\right\rangle\pm\left|1\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=nielchuang&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, subscripts ''A'' and ''B'' distinguish the two particles, though it is more convenient and usual to refer to these particles as being in the possession of two experimentalists called Alice and Bob. The rules of quantum theory give predictions for the outcomes of measurements performed by the experimentalists.  Alice, for example, will measure her particle to be spin-up in an average of fifty percent of measurements.  However, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, Alice's measurement causes the state of the two particles to [[Wave function collapse|collapse]], so that if Alice performs a measurement of spin in the z-direction, that is with respect to the basis &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rang_A, \left|1\right\rang_A\} &lt;/math&gt;, then Bob's system will be left in one of the states &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rang_B, \left|1\right\rang_B\} &lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, if Alice performs a measurement of spin in the x-direction, that is with respect to the basis &lt;math&gt;\{\left|+\right\rang_A, \left|-\right\rang_A\} &lt;/math&gt;, then Bob's system will be left in one of the states &lt;math&gt;\{\left|+\right\rang_B, \left|-\right\rang_B\} &lt;/math&gt;. Schrödinger referred to this phenomenon as "steering".&lt;ref name=Wise2007&gt;{{cite journal | first1=H.M. |last1= Wiseman|  first2=S.J. |last2= Jones|  first3=A.C. |last3= Doherty| title= Steering, Entanglement, Nonlocality, and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox| journal= Physical Review Letters | date = April 2007| volume = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This steering occurs in such a way that no signal can be sent by performing such a state update; quantum nonlocality cannot be used to send messages instantaneously and is therefore not in direct conflict with causality concerns in Special Relativity.&lt;ref name=nielchuang/&gt;

In the Copenhagen view of this experiment, Alice's measurement—and particularly her measurement choice—have a direct effect on Bob's state. However, under the assumption of locality, actions on Alice's system do not affect the "true", or "ontic" state of Bob's system. We see that the ontic state of Bob's system must be compatible with one of the quantum states &lt;math&gt;\left|\uparrow\right\rang_B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left|\downarrow\right\rang_B &lt;/math&gt;, since Alice can make a measurement that concludes with one of those states being the quantum description of his system. At the same time, it must also be compatible with one of the quantum states &lt;math&gt;\left|\leftarrow\right\rang_B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left|\rightarrow\right\rang_B &lt;/math&gt; for the same reason. Therefore, the ontic state of Bob's system must be compatible with at least two quantum states; the quantum state is therefore not a complete descriptor of his system.  Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen saw this as evidence of the incompleteness of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, since the wavefunction is explicitly not a complete description of a quantum system under this assumption of locality. Their paper concludes:&lt;ref name="epr" /&gt;

{{quote|While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.}}

Although various authors (most notably [[Niels Bohr]]) criticised the ambiguous terminology of the EPR paper,&lt;ref name="bohr35"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bohr| first = N | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?  |date=July 1935  | journal = [[Physical Review]]  | volume = 48  | issue = 8  | pages = 696–702 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48..696B | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Furry| first = W.H. | title = Remarks on Measurements in Quantum Theory  |date=March 1936  | journal = [[Physical Review]]  | volume = 49  | issue = 6  | pages = 476 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.49.476|bibcode = 1936PhRv...49..476F }}&lt;/ref&gt; the thought experiment nevertheless generated a great deal of interest. Their notion of a "complete description" was later formalised by the suggestion of hidden variables that determine the statistics of measurement results, but to which an observer does not have access.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1932/1955). In ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik'', Springer, Berlin, translated into English by Beyer, R.T., Princeton University Press, Princeton, cited by Baggott, J. (2004) ''Beyond Measure: Modern physics, philosophy, and the meaning of quantum theory'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-852927-9}}, pages 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian mechanics]] provides such a completion of quantum mechanics, with introduction of hidden variables; however the theory is explicitly nonlocal.&lt;ref&gt;Maudlin, T., 1994, Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity: Metaphysical Intimations of Modern Physics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation therefore does not give an answer to Einstein's question, which was whether or not a complete description of quantum mechanics could be given in terms of ''local'' hidden variables in keeping with the [[Principle of locality|"Principle of Local Action"]].&lt;ref&gt;"Quantum Mechanics and Reality" ("Quanten-Mechanik und Wirklichkeit", ''Dialectica'' 2:320–324, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic Nonlocality ===
{{See also|Bell test experiments}}
In 1964 [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] answered Einstein's question by showing that such local hidden variables can never reproduce the full range of statistical outcomes predicted by quantum theory.&lt;ref name="bell64"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bell| first = John | title = On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox | journal = Physics | volume = 1 | pages = 195  | year = 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell showed that a local hidden variable hypothesis leads to [[Bell's theorem|restrictions]] on the strength of correlations of measurement results.  If the Bell inequalities are violated experimentally as predicted by quantum mechanics, then reality cannot be described by local hidden variables and the mystery of quantum nonlocal causation remains. According to Bell:&lt;ref name="bell64"/&gt;

{{quote|This [grossly nonlocal structure] is characteristic&amp;nbsp;... of any such theory which reproduces exactly the quantum mechanical predictions.}}

[[John Clauser|Clauser]], Horne, [[Abner Shimony|Shimony]] and Holt (CHSH) reformulated these inequalities in a manner that was more conducive to experimental testing (see [[CHSH inequality]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clauser| first1 = John F.  | last2 = Horne | first2 = Michael A. | last3 = Shimony | first3= Abner | last4= Holt | first4= Richard A. | title = Proposed Experiment to Test Local Hidden-Variable Theories  |date=October 1969  | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]  | volume = 23 | issue = 15 | pages = 880–884 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.23.880|bibcode = 1969PhRvL..23..880C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They proposed a scheme whereby two experimentalists, Alice and Bob, make separate measurements of [[photon polarization]] in two carefully chosen directions, and derived a simple inequality that is obeyed by all local hidden variable theories, but violated by certain measurements on quantum states.

Bell formalized the idea of a hidden variable by introducing the parameter ''λ'' to locally characterize measurement results on each system:&lt;ref name="bell64"/&gt; "It is a matter of indifference&amp;nbsp;... whether ''λ'' denotes a single variable or a set&amp;nbsp;... and whether the variables are discrete or continuous". However, it is equivalent (and more intuitive) to think of ''λ'' as a local "strategy" or "message" that occurs with some probability ''ρ(&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;)'' when an entangled pair of states is created. EPR's criteria of local separability then stipulates that each local strategy defines the distributions of ''[[Independence (probability theory)|independent]]'' outcomes if Alice measures in direction ''A'' and Bob measures in direction ''B'':&lt;ref name="bell64"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P \left ( {a, b}{|}{A, B, \lambda } \right ) = P \left ( {a}{|}{A, \lambda } \right ) P \left ( {b}{|}{B, \lambda } \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where, for instance, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \left ( {a}{|}{A, \lambda } \right )&lt;/math&gt; denotes the probability of Alice getting the outcome ''a'' given ''λ'', and that she measured ''A''.

Suppose that ''λ'' can take values from some set &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, where 1 ≤ i ≤ k. If each &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; has an associated probability ρ(&lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;) of being selected (such that the probabilities sum to unity) we can average over this distribution to obtain a formula for the joint probability of each measurement result:

:&lt;math&gt; P \left ( {a, b}{|}{A, B} \right ) = \sum_{i=1}^k P \left ( {a, b} {|} {A, B, \lambda_i } \right ) \rho \left (\lambda_i \right ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the CHSH scheme, the measurement result for the polarization of a photon can take one of two values (informally, whether the photon is polarized in that direction, or in the orthogonal direction). We encode this by allowing ''a'' and ''b'' to take on values ±1. For arbitrary measurements ''A'' and ''B'', their correlator ''E''(''A'', ''B'') is then defined as

:&lt;math&gt; E \left ( {A, B} \right ) = \sum_{a,b} ab P\left ( {a, b}{|}{A, B} \right ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the product ''ab'' is equal to 1 if Alice and Bob get the same outcome, and −1 if they get different outcomes.  The correlator ''E''(''A'',''B'') can therefore be seen as the [[Expected value|expectation]] that Alice's and Bob's outcomes are ''correlated''. In the case that Alice chooses from one of two measurements &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, and Bob chooses from &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, the CHSH value for this joint probability distribution is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; S_{CHSH} = E \left ( {A_0, B_0} \right ) + E \left ( {A_0, B_1} \right ) + E \left ( {A_1, B_0} \right ) - E \left ( {A_1, B_1} \right ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Compare this with the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x \oplus y = XY&lt;/math&gt; and the discussion in the above [[Quantum nonlocality#Two-way events|example]]. The CHSH value &lt;math&gt;S_{CHSH}&lt;/math&gt; includes a ''negative'' contribution of the correlator whenever &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; are chosen (&lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;XY=1&lt;/math&gt;), and a ''positive'' contribution in all other cases (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;≠&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;XY=0&lt;/math&gt;). If the joint probability distribution can be described with local strategies as above, it can be shown that the correlation function always obeys the following CHSH inequality:&lt;ref name =nielchuang /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; -2 \le S_{CHSH} \le 2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, if instead of local hidden variables we adopt the rules of quantum theory, it is possible to construct an entangled pair of particles (one each for Alice and Bob) and a set of measurements &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A_0, A_1, B_0, B_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S_{CHSH} \;=\; 2\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This demonstrates an explicit way in which a theory with ontological states that are local, with local measurements and only local actions cannot match the probabilistic predictions of quantum theory, disproving Einstein's hypothesis. Experimentalists such as [[Alain Aspect]] have verified the quantum violation of the CHSH inequality,&lt;ref name="aspect" /&gt; as well as other formulations of Bell's inequality, to invalidate the local hidden variables hypothesis and confirm that reality is indeed nonlocal in the EPR sense.

===Possibilistic Nonlocality===
The demonstration of nonlocality due to Bell is ''probabilistic'' in the sense that it shows that the precise probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics for some entangled scenarios cannot be met by a local theory. (For short, here and henceforth "local theory" means "local hidden variables theory".) However, quantum mechanics permits an even stronger violation of local theories: a ''possibilistic'' one, in which we find that local theories cannot agree with quantum mechanics on which events are possible or impossible in an entangled scenario. The first proof of this kind was due to [[Daniel Greenberger|Greenberger]], Horne and [[Anton Zeilinger|Zeilinger]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Daniel M. Greenberger |author2=Michael A. Horne |author3=Anton Zeilinger |year=2007 |title=Going beyond Bell's Theorem |arxiv=0712.0921|bibcode = 2007arXiv0712.0921G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state involved is often called the [[Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state|GHZ state]].

In 1993, [[Lucien Hardy]] demonstrated a logical proof of quantum nonlocality that, like the GHZ proof  is a ''possibilistic'' proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hardy| first = Lucien | title = Nonlocality for two particles without inequalities for almost all entangled states  |date=1993  | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]  | volume = 71  | issue =11  | pages = 1665–1668|bibcode = 1993PhRvL..71.1665H |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1665 | pmid=10054467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Braun, D.|author2=Choi, M.-S.|journal=Phys.

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\psi\right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\left|00\right\rangle+\left|01\right\rangle+\left|10\right\rangle\right)=
\frac{1}\sqrt{3}\left(\sqrt{2}\left|+0\right\rangle+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|+1\right\rangle+\left|-1\right\rangle\right)\right)=
\frac{1}\sqrt{3}\left(\sqrt{2}\left|0+\right\rangle+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|1+\right\rangle+\left|1-\right\rangle\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where, as above, &lt;math&gt;|\pm\rangle=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\left|0\right\rangle\pm\left|1\right\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.

The experiment consists of this entangled state being shared between two experimenters, each of whom has the ability to measure either with respect to the basis &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rangle,\left|1\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{\left|+\right\rangle,\left|-\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;. We see that If they each measure with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rangle,\left|1\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, then they never see the outcome &lt;math&gt;\left|11\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If one measures with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rangle,\left|1\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; and the other &lt;math&gt;\{\left|+\right\rangle,\left|-\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, they never see the outcomes &lt;math&gt;\left|-0\right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left|0-\right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; However, sometimes they see the outcome &lt;math&gt;\left|--\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; when measuring with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{\left|+\right\rangle,\left|-\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\langle--|\psi\rangle = -\tfrac1{2\sqrt3} \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This leads us to the paradox: having the outcome &lt;math&gt;|--\rangle&lt;/math&gt; we conclude that if one of the experimenters had measured with respect to the &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rangle,\left|1\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; basis instead, the outcome must have been &lt;math&gt;|{-}1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|1-\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;|{-}0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|0-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are impossible. But then, if they had both measured with respect to the &lt;math&gt;\{\left|0\right\rangle,\left|1\right\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; basis, by locality the result must have been &lt;math&gt;\left|11\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which is also impossible.

==Differences between nonlocality and entanglement==
{{See also|Quantum entanglement}}

In the media and popular science, quantum nonlocality is often portrayed as being equivalent to entanglement. While it is true that a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce nonlocal correlations, there exist entangled (mixed) states which do not produce such correlations,&lt;ref name=werner1989/&gt; and there exist non-entangled (namely, separable) states that do produce some type of non-local behavior.&lt;ref name=nonentangled&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bennett | first = C.H. |author2=DiVincenzo, D.P. |author3=Fuchs, C.A. |author4=Mor, T. |author5=Rains, E. |author6=Shor, P.W. |author7=Smolin, J.A. |author8=Wootters, W.K. | title = Quantum nonlocality without entanglement | journal = [[Physical Review A]] | volume = 59| pages = 1070–1091 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.59.1070 | issue = 2 |arxiv = quant-ph/9804053 |bibcode=1999PhRvA..59.1070B }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the former, a well-known example is constituted by a subset of [[Werner state]]s that are entangled but whose correlations can always be described using local hidden variables. On the other hand, reasonably simple examples of Bell inequalities have been found for which the quantum state giving the largest violation is ''never'' a [[maximally entangled state]], showing that entanglement is, in some sense, not even proportional to nonlocality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Marius Junge | author2 = Carlos Palazuelos |title =  Large violation of Bell inequalities with low entanglement | journal = Communications in Mathematical Physics | volume = 306 | issue = 3 | pages = 695–746 |arxiv=1007.3043v2 | year = 2010| doi = 10.1007/s00220-011-1296-8 |bibcode = 2011CMaPh.306..695J |citeseerx=10.1.1.752.4896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Thomas Vidick | author2 = Stephanie Wehner |title =  More Non-locality with less Entanglement | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 83 | issue = 5 |arxiv=1011.5206v2 | year = 2010| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.83.052310 |bibcode = 2011PhRvA..83e2310V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Yeong-Cherng Liang | author2 = Tamas Vertesi | author3= Nicolas Brunner |title =  Semi-device-independent bounds on entanglement | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 83 | issue = 2 |arxiv=1012.1513v2 | year = 2010| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.83.022108 |bibcode = 2011PhRvA..83b2108L | url = http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:36417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be nonlocal. It is important to recognise that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to nonlocality as well as [[quantum teleportation]] and [[superdense coding]], whereas nonlocality is interpreted according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the [[Quantum foundations|foundations]] and [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of quantum mechanics.

==Superquantum nonlocality==
Whilst the CHSH inequality gives restrictions on the CHSH value attainable by local hidden variable theories, the rules of quantum theory do not allow us to violate [[Tsirelson's bound]] of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2 \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, even if we exploit measurements of entangled particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cirel'son| first = B. S. | title = Quantum generalizations of Bell's inequality  | journal = [[Letters in Mathematical Physics]] | volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 93–100 | year = 1980 | doi = 10.1007/BF00417500 |bibcode = 1980LMaPh...4...93C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question remained whether this was the maximum CHSH value that can be attained without explicitly allowing instantaneous signaling. In 1994 two physicists, [[Sandu Popescu]] and Daniel Rohrlich, formulated an explicit set of correlated measurements that respect the "non-signalling" principle, yet give &lt;math&gt;S_{CHSH} = 4&lt;/math&gt;: the algebraic maximum.&lt;ref name="popescu1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Popescu | first = Sandu |author2=Rohrlich, Daniel  | title = Nonlocality as an axiom | journal = [[Foundations of Physics]] | volume = 24| pages = 379–385 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.1007/BF02058098 | issue = 3 |bibcode = 1994FoPh...24..379P |citeseerx=10.1.1.508.4193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximal violation of CHSH consistent with no signalling was also found, earlier, by Rastall and Khalfin and Tsirelson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rastall | first = Peter | title = Locality, Bell's theorem, and quantum mechanics | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 963–972 | year = 1985 | doi=10.1007/bf00739036| bibcode = 1985FoPh...15..963R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  |title=Quantum and quasi-classical analogs of Bell inequalities |author=Khalfin, L.A. |author2= Tsirelson, B.S. |year=1985 |conference=Symposium on the Foundations of Modern Physics |editor=Lahti et al. |publisher=World Sci. Publ. |location= |pages=441–460  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrated that there exist formulatable theories that are "non-signalling", yet drastically violate the joint probability constraints of quantum theory.  The attempt to understand what distinguishes quantum theory from such general theories motivated an abstraction from physical measurements of nonlocality, to the study of ''nonlocal boxes''.&lt;ref name=nonlocalbox&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barrett| first = J. |author2=Linden, N. |author3=Massar, S. |author4=Pironio, S. |author5=Popescu, S. |author6=Roberts, D. | title = Non-local correlations as an information theoretic resource | journal = [[Physical Review A]] | volume = 71| pages = 022101  | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.71.022101 | issue = 2 |arxiv = quant-ph/0404097 |bibcode = 2005PhRvA..71b2101B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonlocal boxes generalize the concept of experimentalists making joint measurements from separate locations. As in the discussion above, the choice of measurement is encoded by the input to the box. A two-party nonlocal box takes an input ''A'' from Alice and an input ''B'' from Bob, and outputs two values ''a'' and ''b'' for Alice and Bob respectively and separately, where ''a, b, A'' and ''B'' take values from some finite alphabet (normally &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;). The box is characterized by the probability of outputting pair ''a, b'', given the inputs ''A, B''.  This probability is denoted &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \left ( { {a, b}{|}{A, B} } \right )&lt;/math&gt; and obeys the normal [[Probability|probabilistic]] conditions of positivity and normalisation:&lt;ref name="nonlocalbox"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P \left ( { {a, b}{|}{A, B} } \right ) \ge 0 \quad \forall {a,b,A,B}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a,b} P \left ( { {a, b}{|}{A, B} } \right ) = 1 \quad \forall {A,B}&lt;/math&gt;

A box is ''local'', or ''admits a local hidden variable model'', if its output probabilities can be characterized in the following way:&lt;ref name=werner1989&gt;{{cite journal | last = Werner| first = R.F. | title = Quantum States with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations admitting a hidden-variable model | journal = [[Physical Review A]] | volume = 40| pages = 4277–4281  | year = 1989 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.40.4277|bibcode = 1989PhRvA..40.4277W | pmid=9902666 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P \left ( { {a,b}{|}{A,B} } \right ) = \sum_{\lambda} p(\lambda) \; P \left ( { {a}{|}{A,\lambda} } \right ) \; P \left ( { {b}{|}{B,\lambda} } \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \left ( { {a}{|}{A,\lambda} } \right )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \left ( { {b}{|}{B,\lambda} } \right )&lt;/math&gt; describe single input/output probabilities at Alice's or Bob's system alone, and the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random according to some fixed probability distribution given by &lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a hidden variable, or to a shared randomness between Alice and Bob. If a box violates this condition, it is explicitly called ''nonlocal''. However, the study of nonlocal boxes often encompasses both local and nonlocal boxes.

The set of nonlocal boxes most commonly studied are the so-called ''non-signalling boxes'',&lt;ref name=nonlocalbox /&gt; for which neither Alice nor Bob can signal their choice of input to the other.  Physically, this is a reasonable restriction: setting the input is physically analogous to making a measurement, which should effectively provide a result immediately.  Since there may be a large spatial separation between the parties, signalling to Bob would potentially require considerable time to elapse between measurement and result, which is a physically unrealistic scenario.

The non-signalling requirement imposes further conditions on the joint probability, in that the probability of a particular output ''a'' or ''b'' should depend only on its associated input.  This allows for the notion of a reduced or [[marginal probability|marginal]] probability on both Alice and Bob's measurements, and is formalised by the conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{b} P \left ( {a,b}{|}{A,B} \right ) = \sum_{b} P \left ( {a,b}{|}{A,B'} \right ) \equiv P \left ( {a}{|}{A} \right ) \quad \forall {a,A,B,B'}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a} P \left ( {a,b}{|}{A,B} \right ) = \sum_{a} P \left ( {a,b}{|}{A',B} \right ) \equiv P \left ( {b}{|}{B} \right ) \quad \forall {b,B,A,A'}&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints above are all linear, and so define a polytope representing the set of all non-signalling boxes with a given number of inputs and outputs.  Moreover, the polytope is convex because any two boxes that exist in the polytope can be mixed (as above, according to some variable &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; with probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;) to produce another box that also exists within the polytope.

Local boxes are clearly non-signalling, however nonlocal boxes may or may not be non-signalling. Since this polytope contains all possible non-signalling boxes of a given number of inputs and outputs, it has as subsets both local boxes and those boxes which can achieve Tsirelson's bound in accord with quantum mechanical correlations. Indeed, the set of local boxes form a convex sub-polytope of the non-signalling polytope.

Popescu and Rohrlich's maximum algebraic violation of the CHSH inequality can be reached by a non-signalling box, referred to as a standard PR box after these authors, with joint probability given by:

:&lt;math&gt; P \left ( {a,b}{|}{A,B} \right ) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}, &amp; \mbox{if } a \oplus b = AB \\
0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denotes addition modulo two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barrett| first = Jonathan |author2=Pironio, Stefano  | title =  Popescu-Rohrlich Correlations as a Unit of Nonlocality | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 95  | issue = 14 | pages = 140401 |date=September 2005 | doi =  10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.140401 | pmid = 16241631 |arxiv = quant-ph/0506180 |bibcode = 2005PhRvL..95n0401B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to argue why Nature does not (or should not) allow for stronger nonlocality than quantum theory is already known to permit. For example, in recent publications it was found that quantum mechanics cannot be more nonlocal without violating the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael M.

Nevertheless, the PR-box is ruled out by a plausible postulate of information theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1210.0194|last1=Pfister|first1=Corsin|title=If no information gain implies no disturbance, then any discrete physical theory is classical|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|issue=1851|last2=Wehner|first2=Stephanie|doi=10.1038/ncomms2821|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-signaling adversaries have recently been considered in [[quantum cryptography]].&lt;ref name="BHK"&gt;{{cite journal

Such an adversary is constrained only by the non-signaling principle, and so may potentially be more powerful than a quantum adversary.

==Blasiak's model==

Similarly to [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm pilot wave theory]], Blasiak's model stipulates in the ontology a particle and a pilot wave, and the pilot wave ensures predictions indistinguishable from the quantum case.&lt;ref name="PR-20180713" /&gt; The main distinction is [[wave function collapse]]. De Broglie–Bohm theory avoids collapse by including the whole universe (with all particle detectors, other devices, observers etc.) into the system. Blasiak's model describes a single particle in a [[quantum circuit]] (called "interferometric circuit") that contains devices such as [[Phase shift module|phase shifters]], [[beam splitter]]s and [[particle detector]]s. Usually, a detector causes collapse ([[Wave function collapse#History and context|non-local, discontinuous change]]) of a wave function. But Blasiak's model treats detection without violating the locality principle, via the following ideas.

The wave function consists of fragments. Each fragment emerges from a detection, and propagates from the point of detection, gradually crowding out older fragments. The particle moves inside the expanding region occupied by the most recent fragment. Thus, obsolete fragments are harmless, they never pilot the particle. Gradual elimination of older fragments is implemented via the third ontological component, a field that carries information on the time of the most recent detection in the causal past of a given space-time point.

==No information can travel faster-than-light==
Nonlocality does not mean that information can travel faster-than-light. Indeed, [[quantum field theory]] preserves [[causality]], meaning that no influence can be projected between two points faster than the speed-of-light.

This can be shown by noting that the [[commutator]] of two [[spacelike]] local [[Operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics|quantum operator]]s is always zero (or [[Commutator#Ring theory|anti-commutator]] for [[fermionic field|fermionic operators]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peskin, M. E., &amp; Schroeder, D. V. (1995). An Introduction To Quantum Field Theory (Frontiers in Physics). Westview Press Incorporated. pp. 25-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''R-7 ''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Р-7 "Семёрка"}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] missile developed during the [[Cold War]], and the world's first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/r7.htm|title=R-7|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R-7 made 28 launches between 1957 and 1961, but was never deployed operationally. A derivative, the [[R-7A Semyorka|R-7A]], was deployed from 1959 to 1968. To the West it was known by the [[NATO reporting name]] '''SS-6 Sapwood''' and within the Soviet Union by the [[GRAU]] index '''8K71'''. In modified form, it launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first artificial satellite, into orbit, and became the basis for the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7 family]] which includes [[Sputnik (rocket)|Sputnik]], [[Luna (rocket)|Luna]], [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]], [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok]], and [[Voskhod (rocket)|Voskhod]]  [[Expendable launch system|space launchers]], as well as later [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] variants.

The widely used nickname for the R-7 launcher, "Semyorka", means "the 7" in Russian.

==Description==
The R-7 was {{convert|34|m|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|3.02|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighed {{convert|280|MT}}; it had two stages, powered by [[rocket engine]]s using [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) and [[kerosene]] and capable of delivering its payload up to {{convert|8800|km|abbr=on}}, with an accuracy ([[Circular error probable|CEP]]) of around {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}. A single [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear warhead]] was carried with a nominal yield of 3 [[TNT equivalent|megatons of TNT]]. The initial launch was boosted by four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s making up the first stage, with a central 'sustainer' motor powering through both the first and the second stage. Each strap-on booster included two [[vernier thruster]]s and the core stage included four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/launchers/rocket-r7.html |title=Rocket R-7 |publisher=S.P.Korolev RSC Energia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidance system was inertial with radio control of the vernier thrusters.

==Development==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

Design work began in 1953 at [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|OKB-1]] in Kaliningrad in Moscow Oblast (presently [[Korolev, Moscow Oblast]]) and other divisions with the requirement for a two-stage missile of {{convert|170|MT}} with a range of {{convert|8000|km|abbr=on}} and the maximum speed of 20 mach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Champak Jyoti|last=Bora|title=Missile Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OS4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-329-59323-7|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a {{convert|3000|kg|abbr=on}} warhead. Following first ground tests in late 1953 the initial design was heavily reworked and the final design was not approved until May 1954 and Korolev reportedly reviewed more than 100 design proposals. In 1954, the draft project was completed. 

Contrary to claims{{by whom|date=September 2012}} that the R-7 was based largely on experience and assistance of German scientists, the missile is noteworthy for looking beyond past achievements that had used German ideas. For example, instead of using jet vanes for control, which increased resistance generated at the engine nozzle exhaust outlet, the R-7 used special control engines. These same engines served as the last stage’s [[vernier thruster]]s.&lt;ref name="ChertokVol2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4110/vol2.pdf|title=Boris Chertok: Rockets and People, p. 290|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511221856/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4110/vol2.pdf|archivedate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of clustered design, each booster had its own propellant tanks. The design team had to develop a system to regulate the propellant component consumption ratio and to synchronize the consumption between the boosters.&lt;ref name="ChertokVol2"/&gt;

Starting from the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]], which was a copy of the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], a free-standing missile was launched from a horizontal pad. It turned out that assembling a cluster of a central core and four boosters on the pad is almost impossible without it falling apart. Also, a wind gust could knock the missile off of the pad. The solution was to eliminate the pad and to suspend the entire rocket in the [[truss]]es that bear both vertical weight load as well as horizontal wind forces. The launch system simulated flight conditions with strap-on boosters pushing the central core forward.&lt;ref name="ChertokVol2"/&gt;

The new missile's [[GRAU]] index was 8K71. The first flight-ready vehicle was delivered to the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on 1 May 1957, and flown on 15 May. A fire broke out in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff. It broke away from the booster at T+88 seconds, which crashed 400&amp;nbsp;km (248 miles) downrange. The next attempt on 11 June (notable the same day the United States conducted its first test launch of an ICBM), an electrical short caused the missile to start rolling uncontrollably and disintegrate 33 seconds after liftoff. The first successful long flight, of {{convert|6000|km|abbr=on}}, was made on 21 August 1957. The dummy warhead impacted in the Pacific Ocean and five days later, TASS announced that the Soviet Union had "successfully tested a multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missile". A modified version of the missile (8K71PS) placed [[Sputnik 1]] in orbit from Baikonur on 4 October 1957 and [[Sputnik 2]] on 3 November 1957.

The next ICBM test took place on 30 January 1958, but the strap-ons failed to separate cleanly and damaged plumbing in the core stage, which lost thrust and impacted far off target. These early flights revealed assorted design flaws in the R-7 which necessitated multiple modifications to the missile. Testing continued through December 1959, and the last original 8K71 flew on 27 February 1961. The additional development resulted in the 8K74 (also known as R-7A), which was lighter, had better navigation systems, more powerful engines, extended its range to 12,000&amp;nbsp;km by carrying more fuel, and increased payload to {{convert|5370|kg|abbr=on}}. In addition, the missile was designed to be easier to take apart and service. The warhead was tested on [[Novaya Zemlya]] in October 1957 and again in 1958, yielding an estimated 2.9 Mt.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Aside from the initial Sputnik launches, the 8K71 formed the basis of the 8K72 booster used for the first generation Luna probes. However, six out of nine Luna probes launched on the 8K72 failed. Combined with the failed Sputnik launch on 27 April 1958, this brought the booster's total space launch record to 6 successes in 13 attempts. The improved 8K74 would then form the basis for the later Vostok and Molniya boosters, greatly increasing reliability.

== Operational history ==
The first strategic-missile unit became operational on 9 February 1959 at [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk]] in north-west Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959|title=This Week in EUCOM History: February 6–12, 1959|date=6 February 2012|publisher=[[EUCOM]]|accessdate=8 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003453/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959|archivedate=21 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1959 the R-7 missile was tested at Plesetsk for the first time. The missiles were fully deployed by 1962.

Total service was limited to no more than ten nuclear-armed missiles active at any time.  A single launch pad was operational at [[Baikonur]] and from six to eight were in operation at Plesetsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data-freeway.com/plesetsk/bsemyorka_8.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708233403/http://data-freeway.com/plesetsk/bsemyorka_8.htm |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The costs of the system were high, mostly due to the difficulty of constructing in remote areas the large launch sites required.  At one point, each launch site was projected to cost 5% of the total Soviet defense budget.

Besides the cost, the missile system faced other operational challenges.  With the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] overflights, the huge R-7 launch complexes could not be hidden and therefore could be expected to be destroyed quickly in any nuclear war.  Also, the R-7 took almost twenty hours to prepare for launching, and it could not be left on alert for more than a day due to its [[cryogenic fuel]] system.  Therefore, the Soviet force could not be kept on permanent alert and could have been subject to an air strike before launching. Additionally, the huge payload for which it was designed, adapted to early heavy H-bombs, became irrelevant with the coming of lighter bomb technology.

The limitations of the R-7 pushed the Soviet Union into rapidly developing second-generation missiles which would be more viable weapons systems. The R-7 was phased out of military service by 1968.

While the R-7 turned out to be impractical as a weapon, it became the basis for a series of Soviet [[Expendable launch system|expendable space launch vehicles]], the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz family of launchers.]] As of 2018, in modified versions ([[Soyuz-U]], [[Soyuz-FG]], and the [[Soyuz-2]] (including the boosterless [[Soyuz-2.1v|2.1v variant]]), the vehicle is still in service, having launched over 1840 times.

==Education==
James was born on 9 January 1891 in London. After displaying adolescent skills as a maths prodigy, he was awarded a stipend to pursue studies in [[St. John's College, Cambridge]].

==Career==
James signed on as an expedition [[naturalist]] in the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition led by Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], which departed England on the [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']] in August 1914; James had expected to winter over at the expedition's projected base on the [[Weddell Sea]] but the ice-beset expedition vessel never made Antarctic landfall and, with the rest of the ship's company, James found himself a [[castaway]]. His journal of life on a Weddell Sea ice floe and on [[Elephant Island]] survives.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Upon the rescue of the men from Elephant Island in 1916, James found his country fighting [[World War I]]. He joined the [[Royal Engineers]], rising to the rank of [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] and performing tasks relating to [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. With the coming of peace, James turned to academia at the [[University of Manchester]]. He was a lecturer in 1919, a senior lecturer in 1921, and a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1934. He specialised in problems of [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

1936–1937 saw a change in James' personal and professional life. In the first year he married Annie Watson, and in the second year he changed institutions to the [[University of Cape Town]], which offered him the rank of professor. One of his MSc students there was [[Aaron Klug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1982/klug-bio.html|title=Aaron Klug – Biographical|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His professional career reached culmination in 1953–1957 when he served as Vice-Chancellor of the university. He was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

James began the process of his retirement in 1958 and, beset by progressive cardiovascular disease, wound down his teaching duties over the following five years. He died in [[Cape Town]] at age 73 on 7 July 1964, and was survived by three children.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

The Principal Investigator is Luther Beegle, and the Deputy Principal Investigator is Rohit Bhartia.

SHERLOC will have a calibration target with possible [[Mars suit]] materials, and it will measure how they change over time in the Martian surface environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/02/19/the-next-nasa-rover-could-lead-to-safer-space-suits-for-astronauts-exploring-mars/|title=The next NASA rover could lead to safer space suits for astronauts exploring Mars|date=2018-02-20|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
According to a 2017 [[Universities Space Research Association|Universities Space Research Association (USRA)]] report:&lt;ref name="USRA-2017" /&gt; 

{{quote|The goals of the SHERLOC investigation are to: 
* Assess the habitability potential of a sample and its aqueous history. 
* Assess the availability of key elements and energy source for life (C, H, N, O, P, S etc.) 
* Determine if there are potential biosignatures preserved in Martian rocks and outcrops. 
* Provide organic and mineral analysis for selective sample caching.

To do this SHERLOC does the following: 
* Detects and classifies organics and astrobiologically relevant minerals on the surface and near subsurface of Mars 
* Bulk organic sensitivity of 10-5 to 10-6 w/w over a 7 x 7 mm spot. 
* Fine scale organic sensitivity of 10-2 to 10-4 w/w spatially resolved at &lt;100µm 
* Astrobiologically Relevant Mineral (ARM) detection and classification to &lt;100µm resolution
|author=Beegle, L.W. et al.|source=[[Universities Space Research Association|USRA]] (2017)&lt;ref name="USRA-2017" /&gt;}}

==Construction==
SHERLOC will be mounted on the robotic arm of the Mars 2020 rover. It consists of both imaging and spectroscopic elements. It has two imaging components consisting of heritage hardware from the [[Mars Science Laboratory|MSL]] [[Mars Hand Lens Imager|MAHLI]] instrument. One is a built to print re-flight that can generate color images over multiple scales. The other acts as the mechanism that allows the instrument to get a contextual image of a sample and to autofocus the laser spot for the spectroscopic part of the SHERLOC investigation.

For Spectroscopy, it utilizes a NeCu laser to generate UV photons (248.6&amp;nbsp;nm) which can generate characteristic Raman and fluorescence photons from a scientifically interesting sample. The DUV laser is co-boresighted to a context imager and integrated into an autofocusing/scanning optical system that allows us to correlate spectral signatures to surface textures, morphology and visible features. The context imager has a spatial resolution of 30&amp;nbsp;µm and currently is designed to operate in the 400-500&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beegle|first=L.|last2=Bhartia|first2=R.|last3=White|first3=M.|last4=DeFlores|first4=L.|last5=Abbey|first5=W.|last6=Wu|first6=Yen-Hung|last7=Cameron|first7=B.|last8=Moore|first8=J.|last9=Fries|first9=M.|date=2015-03-01|title=SHERLOC: Scanning habitable environments with Raman amp; luminescence for organics amp; chemicals|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7119105|journal=2015 IEEE Aerospace Conference|pages=1–11|doi=10.1109/AERO.2015.7119105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5927">'''Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity''',&lt;ref name="Weick01"/&gt; also referred to as '''Thorngate's impostulate of theoretical simplicity'''&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt; is the description of a phenomenon in [[social science]] theorizing. [[Karl E. Weick]] maintains that research in the field of social psychology can – at any one time – achieve only two of the three [[Metatheory|meta-theoretical]] virtues of "Generality", "Accuracy" and "Simplicity." One of these aspects therefore must always be subordinated to the others.&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt; The postulate is named for the Canadian social psychologist Warren Thorngate of the [[University of Alberta]], whose work is quoted by Weick.&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt;

Thorngate described the problem this way: 
{{Quotation|'“In order to increase both ''generality'' and ''accuracy'', the ''complexity'' of our theories must necessarily be increased.”&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt;}}

== Background ==
The postulate was a response to the debate among sociologists – mainly between [[Kenneth J. Gergen]]&lt;ref name="Gergen73"/&gt; and [[Barry R. Schlenker]]&lt;ref name="Schlenker74"/&gt; – revolving around the meaning of sociological research. Whilst Schlenker appeared to maintain the position, that context only superficially influenced social behavior, Gergen appeared to maintain that context penetrated everything in social behavior, rendering observations as specific to the very situation observed. Thus, simplifying the discussion, the observation of social behavior would be no more than collecting historical data, since context would never be the same and the results would remain unique. In fact, sociology would be some specialized kind of historical research.&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt; Considering this, Thorngate writes

{{Quotation|''It is impossible for a theory of social behaviour to be simultaneously general, simple or parsimonious, and accurate.''|Warren Thorngate&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt;}}

The statement was confirmed by Gergen:

{{Quotation|''The more general a simple theory, the less accurate it will be in predicting specifics.''|Kenneth J. Gergen&lt;ref name ="Gergen76"/&gt;}}

== Weick's Interpretation ==
Weick represents this model “as a clockface with general at 12:00, accurate at 4:00, and simple at 8:00 to drive home the point that an explanation that satisfies any two characteristics is least able to satisfy the third characteristic.”&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt;

According to Weick, research operates in this continuum: 
* if research that aims to be accurate and simple (6-o'clock), results would not be generally applicable.
* if research that aims to be general and simple (10-o'clock), results would not be accurate and
* if research that aims to be general and accurate (2-o'clock), results would not be simple any more.

Basically, Weick maintains, that there is a "trade-off" between these three virtues in such a way that only two can be achieved at any given time. Research therefore must operate in different modes to capture reality in sufficient precision and granularity.&lt;ref name="Weick02"/&gt; The postulate therefore becomes descriptive of research and prescriptive of research methodology.

== Criticism ==
Though confirming the postulate in general, Fred Dickinson, Carol Blair and Brian L. Ott criticized Weicks use of the word "accurate".&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt; Accuracy is hard to achieve, especially if the topic is difficult to qualify, e.&amp;nbsp;g. in researching memory. They suggest replacing the term "accurate" with "interpretive utility".&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt;

==Origin==

The term was coined by Bradford D. Smart and his son, Geoffrey, in a 1997 article in ''Directors and Boards'' magazine.&lt;ref name="DandB"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Smart| first1=Brad| last2=Smart| first2=Geoff| title =Topgrading the organization| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Directors and Boards''| date =1997 | url =http://capitalsolutionsbancorp.com/files/pdf/Topgrading_The_Organization.pdf| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Smart had used practices similar to topgrading when he helped set up General Electric's hiring practices in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="WSJ1994"&gt;{{cite news | last=Naj| first=Amal Kumar| title =Corporate Therapy: The Latest Addition To Executive Suite Is Psychologist's Couch| newspaper =[[The Wall Street Journal]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =29 August 1994 | url =http://topgrading.com/_tg-content/downloads/WallStreetJournal.pdf| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ2012"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kwoh| first=Leslie| title ='Rank and Yank' Retains Vocal Fans| newspaper =[[The Wall Street Journal]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =31 January 2012 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203363504577186970064375222| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His consulting firm practiced and taught topgrading methods. In 1999, Smart also released a book called ''Topgrading: How Leading Companies Win by Hiring, Coaching and Keeping the Best People'' that detailed the topgrading process.&lt;ref name="FortuneSuper"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gilman| first=Hank| title =The Smart Way to Hire Superstars Tired of the same old "C" employees dragging down your company?

==Methodology==

Topgrading is an evaluative method for identifying the most highly qualified candidate for a particular job position.&lt;ref name="NTT"&gt;{{cite news | last=Fornes| first=Don| title =Put "The A Method for Hiring" to Work| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =New Talent Times| date =25 October 2013 | url =http://new-talent-times.softwareadvice.com/put-the-a-method-for-hiring-to-work-1013/| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in both new hires and in the promotion of current employees.&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt; The idea behind the method is to identify high-performing "A Players" even if the hiring manager has not seen these individuals in action.&lt;ref name="FortuneSuper"/&gt;

Topgrading methodology assumes that the standard interview process can be and is often plagued by dishonesty from job candidates. Resumes are often faked and interviews can be manipulated to make unqualified candidates seem appropriate for the position. To mitigate the potential for dishonesty, one of the first steps in topgrading is to tell candidates that, at the end of the interview process, they must organize their own reference checks from former managers, colleagues, and others. This is known as a Threat of Reference Check (TORC) and is implemented to weed out candidates who may be dishonest or who may lack motivation. The hiring manager can use these reference checks to verify the veracity of any claims made by the candidates. If a candidate fails to arrange these references, the assumption is that they are a "low-performing" B or C Player.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt;

As outlined in Bradford Smart's ''Topgrading'', there are generally 12 steps that companies must take in order to effectively implement topgrading.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt; Some of the most important steps include measuring hiring success before topgrading, using the Threat of Reference Check (TORC) to encourage honesty, creating a detailed job scorecard in lieu of a vague job description, recruiting from established networks, screening with topgrading software, scrutinizing career history via the Topgrading Snapshot (a visual portrayal of the candidate career history including full salary history and estimated performance ratings by all managers), conducting multiple interviews including the tandem chronological Topgrading Interview, asking candidates to organize reference meetings with prior managers and others, coaching new hires, and evaluating the effectiveness of topgrading after making new hires.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NTT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B2C"&gt;{{cite news | last=Jenkins| first=Toby| title =How to Make Coaching Conversations Easy Using Topgrading Scorecards| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Business 2 Community]]| date = | url =http://www.business2community.com/leadership/how-to-make-coaching-conversations-easy-using-topgrading-scorecards-0440892| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNBC"/&gt;

===Interview process===

The interview process is an important aspect of the topgrading methodology.&lt;ref name="DOM"/&gt; The first interview is called "The Telephone Screening Interview" and it simply requires an exchange of basic information and ideas to ensure that the candidate is at least fit for and legitimately interested in the position. The next interview step is a series of "Competency Interviews." These interviews ask candidates to provide examples of certain competencies they possess. The hiring manager typically chooses between 6 and 8 competency categories (including Leadership, Organization, “Company Fit,” Peer Relations, and Resourcefulness) that are essential to the company. Different interviewers then ask questions that revolve around two of the categories (often "Company Fit" and one other).&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite news | last=Morris| first=Bob| title =Brad Smart on "Topgrading's Most Important Competency"| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Bob Morris| date =7 April 2014 | url =http://bobmorris.biz/brad-smart-on-topgradings-most-important-competency| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next interview is referred to as the Topgrading Interview. The hiring manager and another manager act as "tandem interviewers" and  conduct an up to 4-hour interview for managers (interviews for subordinate positions are much shorter). The interview thoroughly covers every aspect of the candidate's career history.&lt;ref name="Edition2"&gt;{{cite news | last=Morris| first=Robert| title =Book review: Topgrading| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Examiner.com]]| date =31 August 2010 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eifler"&gt;{{cite news | last=Eifler| first=Andrew| title =The Topgrading Interview Method| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Andrew Eifler| date =25 August 2013 | url =http://andreweifler.com/the-topgrading-interview-method/| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI2015"&gt;{{cite news | last=Uresin| first=Nick| title =A detailed breakdown of how to hire the employee you want| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''[[Business Insider]]''| date =26 April 2015 | url =http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-hire-for-success-2015-4| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers ask up to 10 standard questions (plus follow-up questions) about each job during the process.&lt;ref name="CNBC"/&gt; The main questions ask candidates about successes, mistakes, key decisions, key relationship, their manager’s strengths and weaker points, how their manager would rate them, and why they left the job. The theory behind this interview method is that the TORC technique will cause many low-performers with exaggerated resumes to drop out, leaving a pool of theoretically honest and successful candidates. Candidates who are more willing to discuss the entirety of their career provide broader insights to interviewers. Patterns of encountering and solving problems can also reveal a wider variety of competencies.&lt;ref name="P360"&gt;{{cite news | last=Smart| first=Bradford D.| title =The high cost of mis-hires: Five steps to better hiring| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Paper 360''| date =January 2008 | url =http://topgrading.com/_tg-content/downloads/HighCostofMisHires.pdf| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the interview process, candidates are generally asked to arrange reference calls with their previous bosses.&lt;ref name="CNBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BI2012"&gt;{{cite news | last=Cortez| first=Samantha| title =5 Proven Hiring Tips From A Top Recruiting Firm| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''[[Business Insider]]''| date =6 September 2012 | url =http://www.businessinsider.com/5-proven-hiring-tips-from-a-top-recruiting-firm-2012-8| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference call interviews are the final aspect of the topgrading interview process. Candidates are asked to arrange reference calls with their previous bosses, peers, subordinates, customers, and others to verify the veracity of the candidate's statements during the interview process.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt;

According to the methodology, those who are "chronic" B or C Players should not be hired.&lt;ref name="Gazelle"&gt;{{cite news | last=Smart| first=Brad| title =B Players are NOT Good Enough| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Gazelles International Coaches| date =2012| url =http://gicoaches.com/b-players-are-not-good-enough/| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who effectively pass through the 12-step topgrading process are often considered A Players and should be given consideration. Theoretically, companies that employ the topgrading process could have an employee base composed of 90% A Players, although this is often dependent on hiring managers, individual grading systems, and other factors.&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt; According to research by Smart, "mis-hires" can ultimately be costly for companies.&lt;ref name="CEO"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Stoddard| first1=Nat| last2=Wyckoff |first2= Claire| title =The Costs of CEO Failure| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''[[Chief Executive (magazine)|Chief Executive]]''| date =12 December 2008 | url =http://chiefexecutive.net/the-costs-of-ceo-failure/| accessdate =20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
A doctoral thesis at Georgia State University examined six different companies who employed topgrading. Between the six companies, a total of around 1,000 new hires were made during the study. Results of the study showed that the average pre-topgrading "mis-hire" rate was 69.3%. After the implementation of topgrading, however, the average mis-hire rate dropped to 10.5%.&lt;ref name="Thesis"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Lorence |first=Michael S. |title=The Impact of Systematically Hiring Top Talent: A Study of Topgrading as a Rigorous Employee Selection Bundle  |url=http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&amp;context=bus_admin_diss |date=4 May 2014 |publisher= [[Georgia State University]] |access-date=27 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
