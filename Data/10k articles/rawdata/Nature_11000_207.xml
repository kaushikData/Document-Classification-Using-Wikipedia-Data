[[File:Subduction-en.svg|thumb|350px|Oceanic-continental convergence: The required conditions for plate accretion]]

'''Accretion''', in [[geology]], is a process by which material is added to a [[tectonic plate]] or a [[landmass]]. This material may be sediment, [[volcanic arc]]s, [[seamount]]s, or other igneous features.

==Description==

Accretion involves the addition of material to a tectonic plate. When two tectonic plates collide, one of the plates may slide under the other, a process known as [[subduction]]. The plate which is being subducted, is floating on the [[asthenosphere]] and is pushed against the other, over-riding plate. Sediment on the ocean floor will often be scraped from the subducting plate. This causes the sediment to accumulate as a mass of material called an [[accretionary wedge]] (accretionary prism), which attaches itself to the upper plate. Volcanic [[island arc]]s or [[seamount]]s may collide with the continent, and as they are of relatively light material (i.e. low density) they will often not be subducted, but are added to the side of the continent.

==Plate accretion==

[[Continental plate]]s are formed of rocks that are very noticeably different from the rocks that form the ocean floor. The ocean floor is usually composed of [[basalt]]ic rocks which have a higher [[density]] than continental plates. In places where plate accretion has occurred, land masses may contain the dense, basaltic rocks that are usually indicative of oceanic [[lithosphere]].

This process occurs wherever plates collide. Many examples occur around the Pacific Rim, including the western coast of [[North America]], the eastern coasts of [[New Zealand]] and [[Asia]]. The [[Nankai Trough|Nankai accretionary complex]] of Japan, the [[Barbados#Geology|Barbados Ridge]] in the Caribbean, the [[Mediterranean Ridge]], and the [[Franciscan Assemblage]] of California are specific examples of accretionary wedges.

'''Akon Lighting Africa''' is a project started in 2014 by former music artist [[Akon]] with [[Samba Bathily]] and Thione Niang which aims to provide [[electricity]] by [[solar energy]] in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Insight |first1=News |title=Akon unveils new solar campaign for Africa |url=http://www.insightnews.com/news/13643-akon-unveils-new-solar-campaign-for-africa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705062734/http://www.insightnews.com/news/13643-akon-unveils-new-solar-campaign-for-africa |archivedate=2015-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akon lights Africa for better future|url=http://www.enca.com/world/akon-lights-africa-better-future|website=enca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musician Akon works to light up Africa|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/06/08/segment-walker-vause-akon-electricity-africa.cnn|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial technique is to install [[Solar street light]]s and small energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/inside-akon-lighting-africa-87342|title=Inside Akon Lighting Africa|date=2015-11-25|newspaper=Devex|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to [[Akon]], he and Thione Niang grew up in [[Kaolack Region]], [[Senegal]] in a town without electricity. In 2013 both decided to help drive Africa’s transformation. [[Samba Bathily]] joined them and provided targeted solutions through his company, Solektra INT, which supplies solar-powered equipment. By combining their networks, they launched the project in February 2014. The projects now provides electricity in 14 [[Africa]]n countries and employs over 5,000&lt;ref name="atlanta"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/singer-akons-unconventional-keys-to-social-investing-in-africa/|title=Singer Akon's Unconventional Keys to Social Investing in Africa - Global Atlanta|date=2015-06-01|newspaper=Global Atlanta|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly young people who install and maintain solar equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three men backing one mission: widening the access to electricity|url=http://akonlightingafrica.com/our-activities/origins/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akon talks to Folly Bah Thibault|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/talk-to-al-jazeera/articles/2015/2/5/akon-talks-to-folly.html|website=Al Jazeera America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries ==
Since launching in 2014, Akon's group has operations in 14 nations, including [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Benin]] and [[Sierra Leone]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== Solar Academy ==

The group announced the launch of the  solar academy in [[Bamako, Mali]] at the second [[United Nations]] Sustainable Energy for All Forum, in [[New York City]].

'''''Between a Rock and a Hard Place''''' is the [[autobiography]] of [[Aron Ralston]].&lt;ref name="CurledUp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curledup.com/rockhard.htm |title=Between a Rock and a Hard Place, Reviewed |access-date=20 January 2011 |work=CurledUp.com |year=2004 |first=Megan |last=Kopp |publisher=ELBO Computing Resources, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 2004, the book predominantly recounts Ralston's experience being trapped in [[Blue John Canyon]] in the Utah desert and how he was forced to [[amputation|amputate]] his own right arm with a dull [[multi-tool]] in order to free himself after his arm became trapped by a [[boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0830_040830_aronralston.html |title=Climber who cut off hand looks back |access-date=20 January 2011 |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=30 August 2004 |first=Michael |last=Benoist |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423075407/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0830_040830_aronralston.html |archive-date=2018-04-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Inc. magazine]]'' named Ralston's account one of seven "great entrepreneurship books that have nothing to do with business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy Jr. |first=Bill |title=7 More Great Entrepreneurship Books That Have Nothing to Do With Business |url=http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/7-great-entrepreneurship-books-nothing-to-do-with-business.html |magazine=[[Inc.com]] |date=Jul 20, 2012 |access-date=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also describes Ralston's childhood, how he took up outdoor activities after moving to [[Colorado]] from [[Indiana]], how he came to be an obsessive outdoorsman and how he left his [[engineering]] career at [[Intel]] in [[Arizona]] to take up outdoor activities as much as possible.

The book goes back and forth, in alternating chapters, between Ralston's past experiences and his entrapment in the [[slot canyon]], and the efforts of his mother to find him. Included in some editions are pictures of his days in the canyon,&lt;ref name="CurledUp" /&gt; 
various photos from the past excursions he speaks of in the book, a glossary of [[mountaineering]] jargon, and maps of Blue John Canyon and the proximity of the canyon in central-eastern Utah.

Ralston's ordeal is also the subject of the 2010 film ''[[127 Hours]]'', starring [[James Franco]] and directed by [[Danny Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsearchlight.com/127hours |title=127 Hours |access-date=21 January 2011 |work=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] |publisher=[[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the film's release, the autobiography has also been sold with the title ''127 Hours: Between a Rock and a Hard Place''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1451617704 |title=127 Hours: Between a Rock and a Hard Place |access-date=29 March 2011 |date=26 October 2010 |first=Aron |last=Ralston |author-link=Aron Ralston |pages=432 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |isbn=978-1451617702}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

{{Italic title}}
'''''Birds of the West Indies''''' ({{ISBN|0-618-00210-3}}) is a book containing exhaustive coverage of the 400+ species of birds found in the [[Caribbean Sea]], excluding the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], which are considered bio-geographically as part of [[South America]].

Written by ornithologist [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], the book was first published as ''A Field Guide to the Birds of the West Indies'' in [[1936 in literature|1936]] by the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] as part of the ''International Series''. It has been reprinted several times since then, including as one of the [[Peterson Field Guides]] series (PFG 18), a September 1, 1999, edition from [[Houghton Mifflin]] and a March 4, 2002 edition from [[HarperCollins|Collins]]. The book contains approximately 256 pages.

The book was the only text exclusively devoted to the avifauna of the region for many decades until ''[[A Guide to the Birds of the West Indies]]'' ({{ISBN|0-691-08736-9}}), by [[Herbert Raffaele]] [[et al.]]., was published in 1998.

==James Bond==
''Birds of the West Indies'' is known not only for its exhaustive study of Caribbean birds, but also for its author, whose namesake became famous as the fictional Agent 007 of Her Majesty's Secret Service. The name of the book's author, the ornithologist James Bond, was used by [[Ian Fleming]] for the name of his popular British secret agent, Commander [[James Bond]].

Fleming, a keen bird watcher while living at his estate in [[Jamaica]], owned the book. He later explained that the author's name was "brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon, and yet very masculine – just what I needed." Fleming once said in a ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' interview: "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, and 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department." The book has since become a collector's item amongst Bond fans and was featured as an homage in the twentieth James Bond film, ''[[Die Another Day]]'', when Bond poses as an ornithologist while in [[Cuba]]. The final shot of the miniseries ''[[Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond]]'' is of a copy of ''Birds of the West Indies'' next to Ian Fleming's typewriter.

'''Robert Geoffrey Hewett "Bob" Green''' AM (4 November 1925  - 29 August 2013) was an [[Australia]]n [[natural history|naturalist]], [[photographer]], [[conservation movement|conservationist]], and long-term [[Curator]] of the [[Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Launceston, Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green one of state's greatest natural  scientists|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1770642/green-one-of-states-greatest-natural-scientists/|publisher=The Examiner|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Green was born in Launceston.  He grew up on the family farm at Antill Ponds in the [[Midlands (Tasmania)|Tasmanian Midlands]] where he developed a strong interest in natural history.  He joined the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]] in 1946, took up [[bird ringing|bird banding]] and became the Tasmanian Regional Organiser of the [[Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme]].

==Queen Victoria Museum==
In 1959 Green was appointed the honorary ornithologist at the Queen Victoria Museum, the start of a thirty-year association with the institution.  In 1960 he sold the farm and joined the museum staff, becoming the permanent curator from 1962 to 1990.  As well as building up the museum’s collections of natural history and historical material, he also amassed a large personal collection of the eggs of Tasmanian birds, which was eventually donated to the [[National Museum of Australia]] in [[Canberra]] in 2002.

==Achievements==
Green published over 130 [[scientific paper]]s covering a broad range of Tasmanian natural history, as well as popular guides to Tasmanian birds and mammals.  He has been recognised in the scientific names of several animals, including a parasitic [[fly]], a [[bird louse]], three [[flea]]s, a [[mite]], two [[fish]], a [[skink]] (''[[Niveoscincus|Niveoscincus greeni]]'' ),&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Green", p. 107).&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[subspecies]] of the Tasmanian [[endemism|endemic]] [[Scrubtit]] (''Acanthornis magnus greenianus'').

==Honours==
* 1987 – conferred [[Doctor of Science]] [[honorary degree|''honoris causa'']] by the [[University of Tasmania]] in recognition of a lifetime of achievement in zoology
* 1990 – appointed Member of the [[Order of Australia]] In recognition of service to conservation and the environment
* 2005 – awarded [[W. Roy Wheeler Medallion]] by [[Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia]] for excellence in field [[ornithology]]

The '''Central Mexican matorral''' is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]] of central [[Mexico]].

==Setting==
The Central Mexican [[matorral]] covers an area of {{convert|59,400|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} on the southern portion of the [[Mexican Plateau]]. 

The Mexican Plateau is bounded on the east by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], on the south by the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], and on the west by the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. The Central Mexican matorral covers much of the southern portion of the plateau, extending from the [[Valley of Mexico]] in the southeast to the [[Bolaños River]] in the northwest.

The Central Mexican matorral is bounded by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]] to the east and northeast, the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]] to the southeast, and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests]] on the northwest. An isolated enclave of the Central Mexican matorral occupies the [[Valley of Toluca]]. The higher mountain ranges of the plateau are home to [[sky island]]s of pine-oak forest, isolated by matorral at lower elevations.

To the southwest, the Central Mexican matorral is bounded by [[tropical dry forests]]; the [[Bajío dry forests]] in the [[Lerma River]] basin, and the [[Sinaloan dry forests]] in the lower reaches of the [[Río Grande de Santiago]] and its tributaries.

To the northwest, the Central Mexican matorral transitions to the [[Meseta Central matorral]], which covers the middle portion of the Mexican Plateau.

The eastern portion of the Central Mexican matorral is drained by the [[Pánuco River]] and its tributaries, the central portion by the [[Lerma River]] and its tributaries, and the eastern portion by the northern tributaries of the [[Río Grande de Santiago]], including the [[Río Verde (Jalisco)|Rio Verde]] and [[Bolaños River|Bolaños]].

{{More citations needed|date=August 2010}}

'''Clear-air turbulence''' ('''CAT''') is the [[turbulence|turbulent]] movement of [[air mass]]es in the absence of any visual clues, such as clouds, and is caused when bodies of air moving at widely different speeds meet.&lt;ref&gt;Stull, B. R., 1988 An introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology, Kluwert Academic Publishers 666 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmospheric region most susceptible to CAT is the high [[troposphere]] at altitudes of around {{convert|7000|-|12000|m|ft}} as it meets the [[tropopause]]. Here CAT is most frequently encountered in the regions of [[jet stream]]s. At lower altitudes it may also occur near mountain ranges. Thin [[cirrus clouds]] can also indicate high probability of CAT.

CAT can be hazardous to the comfort, but rarely the safety, of air travelers.

CAT in the jet stream is expected to become stronger and more frequent because of climate change,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. D. and Joshi, M. M., 2013, Intensification of winter transatlantic aviation turbulence in response to climate change, Nature Climate Change, 3(7), pp 644-648. doi:10.1038/nclimate1866&lt;/ref&gt; with transatlantic wintertime CAT increasing by 59% (light), 94% (moderate), and 149% (severe) by the time of CO2 doubling.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. D., 2017. Increased light, moderate, and severe clear-air turbulence in response to climate change. Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 34(5), pp 576-586. doi:10.1007/s00376-017-6268-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection ==
Clear-air turbulence is usually impossible to detect with the naked eye and very difficult to detect with a conventional [[radar]],&lt;ref&gt;John J. Hicks, Isadore Katz, Claude R. Landry, and Kenneth R. Hardy, "Clear-Air Turbulence: Simultaneous Observations by Radar and Aircraft" Science Science 18 August 1967:Vol. 157. no. 3790, pp. 808&amp;ndash;809&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that it is difficult for aircraft pilots to detect and avoid it. However, it can be remotely detected with instruments that can measure turbulence with optical techniques, such as [[scintillometer]]s, [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[LIDAR]]s, or [[N-slit interferometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]], T. S. Taylor, A. B. Clark, and W. E. Davenport, The N-slit interferometer: an extended configuration, ''J. Opt.'' '''12''', 015705 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the altitudes near the tropopause are usually cloudless, thin [[cirrus cloud]] can form where there are abrupt changes of air velocity, for example associated with jet streams. Lines of cirrus perpendicular to the jet stream indicate possible CAT, especially if the ends of the cirrus are dispersed, in which case the direction of dispersal can indicate if the CAT is stronger at the left or at the right of the jet stream.

== Factors that increase CAT probability ==
Detecting and predicting CAT is difficult. At typical heights where it occurs, the intensity and location cannot be determined precisely. However, because this turbulence affects long range aircraft that fly near the tropopause, CAT has been intensely studied. Several factors affect the likelihood of CAT. Often more than one factor is present. 64% of the non-light turbulences (not only CAT) are observed less than {{convert|150|nmi|km}} away from the core of a jet stream.&lt;ref&gt;Binding, A. A. [https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/file/sdb%3AdigitalFile%7C95617fe8-3217-4926-b850-f58904473f97/ "Association of clear-air turbulence with 300 mb contour patterns"]. ''The Meteorological Magazine'' '''94''' (1965): 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jet stream ===
A [[jet stream]] alone will rarely be the cause of CAT, although there is horizontal wind shear at its edges and within it, caused by the different relative air speeds of the stream and the surrounding air.

[[Rossby waves]] caused by this jet stream shear and the [[Coriolis force]] cause it to meander.

=== Temperature gradient ===
A [[temperature gradient]] is the change of temperature over a distance in some given direction. Where the temperature of a gas changes, so does its density and where the density changes CAT can appear.

==== Vertical ====
From the ground upwards through the troposphere temperature decreases with height; from the tropopause upwards through the stratosphere temperature increases with height. Such variations are examples of temperature gradients.

==== Horizontal ====
A horizontal temperature gradient may occur, and hence [[air density]] variations, where air velocity changes. An example: the speed of the jet stream is not constant along its length; additionally air temperature and hence density will vary between the air within the jet stream and the air outside.

=== Wind shear ===
[[Wind shear]] is a difference in relative speed between two adjacent air masses. An excessive wind shear produces vortices, and when the wind shear is of sufficient degree, the air will tend to move chaotically. As is explained elsewhere in this article, temperature decreases and wind velocity increase with height in the troposphere, and the reverse is true within the stratosphere. These differences cause changes in air density, and hence viscosity. The viscosity of the air thus presents both inertias and accelerations which cannot be determined in advance.

==== Vertical ====
Vertical wind shear above the jet stream (i.e., in the stratosphere) is sharper when it is moving upwards, because wind speed decreases with height in the stratosphere. This is the reason CAT can be generated above the tropopause, despite the stratosphere otherwise being a region which is vertically stable. On the other hand, vertical wind shear moving downwards within the stratosphere is more moderate (i.e., because downwards wind shear within the stratosphere is effectively moving against the manner in which wind speed changes within the stratosphere) and CAT is never produced in the stratosphere. Similar considerations apply to the troposphere but in reverse.

==== Horizontal ====
When strong wind deviates, the change of wind direction implies a change in the wind speed. A stream of wind can change its direction by differences of pressure. CAT appears more frequently when the wind is surrounding a low pressure region, especially with sharp troughs that change the wind direction more than 100°. Extreme CAT has been reported without any other factor than this.

=== Mountain waves ===
{{Main|Mountain wave}}
[[File:Vol d'onde.svg|right|thumb|200px|Wind flow over a mountain produces oscillations (A), (B) etc.]]
Mountain waves are formed when four requirements are met. When these factors coincide with jet streams, CAT can occur:
* A mountain range, not an isolated mountain
* Strong perpendicular wind
* Wind direction maintained with altitude
* [[Temperature inversion]] at the top of the mountain range

=== Gravity wave wind shear ===
The tropopause is a layer which separates two very different types of air. Beneath it, the air gets colder and the wind gets faster with height. Above it, the air warms and wind velocity decreases with height. These changes in temperature and velocity can produce fluctuation in the altitude of the tropopause, called [[gravity wave]]s.

== Effects on aircraft ==
In the context of air flight, CAT is sometimes colloquially referred to as "[[air pocket]]s".

Standard airplane radars cannot detect CAT, as CAT is not associated with clouds that show unpredictable movement of the air. Airlines and pilots should be aware of factors that cause or indicate CAT to reduce the probability of meeting turbulence.

Aircraft in level flight rely on a constant air density to retain stability. Where air density is significantly different, for instance because of temperature gradient, especially at the tropopause, CAT can occur{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

Where an aircraft changes its position horizontally from within the jet stream to outside the jet stream, or vice versa, a horizontal temperature gradient may be experienced. Because jet streams meander, such a change of position need not be the result of a change of course by the aircraft{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

Because the altitude of the tropopause is not constant, an airplane that flies at a constant altitude would traverse it and encounter any associated CAT{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

On May 1, 2017, Boeing 777 flight SU270 from Moscow to Thailand got into clear air turbulence. The aircraft suddenly dropped and 27 passengers who were not buckled up sustained serious injuries. The pilots were able to stabilize the plane and continue the flight. All passengers who needed medical attention were taken to Bangkok hospital upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Alice |title=Severe turbulence on Aeroflot flight to Bangkok leaves 27 people injured |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/severe-turbulence-aeroflot-flight-moscow-bangkok-27-people-injured |accessdate=30 June 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=1 May 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pilot rules ===
When a pilot experiences CAT, a number of rules should be applied:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lankford |first1=Terry T. |title=Controlling Pilot Error:Weather |date=2001 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-137328-9 |pages=49–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The aircraft must sustain the recommended velocity for turbulence.
* When following the jet stream to escape from the CAT, the aircraft must change altitude and/or heading.
* When the CAT arrives from one side of the airplane, the pilot must observe the thermometer to determine whether the aircraft is above or below the jet stream and then move away from the tropopause.
* When the CAT is associated with a sharp trough, the plane must go through the low-pressure region instead of around it.
* The pilot may issue a [[Pilot report|Pilot Report]] (PIREP), communicating position, altitude and severity of the turbulence to warn other aircraft entering the region.

=== Cases ===
Because aircraft move so quickly, they can experience sudden unexpected accelerations or 'bumps' from turbulence, including CAT - as the aircraft rapidly cross invisible bodies of air which are moving vertically at many different speeds. Although the vast majority of cases of turbulence are harmless, in rare cases cabin crew and passengers on aircraft have been injured when tossed around inside an aircraft cabin during extreme turbulence (and in a small number of cases, killed, as on [[United Airlines Flight 826]] on December 28, 1997). [[BOAC Flight 911]] broke up in flight in 1966 after experiencing severe [[lee wave|lee-wave]] turbulence just downwind of [[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]].

=== Wake turbulence ===
[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|250px|This picture from a [[NASA]] study on wingtip vortices qualitatively illustrates wake turbulence.]]
[[Wake turbulence]] is another type of clear-air turbulence, but in this case the causes are quite different from those set out above.  In the case of wake turbulence, the rotating vortex-pair created by the wings of a large aircraft as it travels lingers for a significant amount of time after the passage of the aircraft, sometimes more than a minute. When this occurs, the lingering turbulence caused by the wake of the wing tips can deflect or even flip a smaller aircraft on the ground or in the air. This phenomenon can also lead to accidents with large aircraft as well. [[Delta Air Lines Flight 9570]] crashed at the [[Greater Southwest International Airport]] in 1972 while landing behind a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]]. This accident led to new rules for minimum following separation time from "heavy" aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Airlines Flight 587]] crashed shortly  after takeoff from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in 2001 due to pilot overreaction to wake turbulence from a [[Boeing 747]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Many aircraft are now made with [[wingtip device]]s to improve both the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] and fuel economy - such devices may also marginally reduce the strength of the [[wingtip vortices]]. However, such changes are not operationally significant (i.e. do not change the distances or times at which it is safe to follow other aircraft).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-23G.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clytie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|t|i|i}}; {{lang-el|Κλυτίη}}), or '''Clytia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|t|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|Κλυτία|links=no}}) was a water [[nymph]], daughter of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Her name appears in the long list of Oceanids in [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 346ff.&lt;/ref&gt; She loved [[Helios]] in vain.&lt;ref&gt;Two other minor personages name Clytie are noted: see  [http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKlytie.html Theoi Project: Clytie].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
[[Helios]], having loved her, abandoned her for [[Leucothea#Other_characters|Leucothoe]] and left her deserted. She was so angered by his treatment that she told Leucothea's father, [[Orchamus]], about the affair. Since Helios had defiled Leucothea, Orchamus had her put to death by burial alive in the sands. Clytie intended to win Helios back by taking away his new love, but her actions only hardened his heart against her. She stripped herself and sat naked, with neither food nor drink, for nine days on the rocks, staring at the sun, Helios, and mourning his departure. After nine days she was transformed into the [[Heliotropium|turnsole]], also known as heliotrope (which is known for growing on sunny, rocky hillsides),&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on in Ovid ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 4.267&lt;/ref&gt; which turns its head always to look longingly at Helios' chariot of the sun. The episode is most fully told in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' iv. 204, 234–56.

Modern traditions substitute the turnsole with a [[sunflower]], which according to (incorrect) folk wisdom [[Common sunflower#Heliotropism misconception|turns in the direction of the sun]] (the original French form ''[[:wikt:tournesol|tournesol]]'' primarily refers to sunflower, while the English ''[[:wikt:turnsole|turnsole]]'' is primarily used for heliotrope).

==Art==

===Bust (Townley collection)===
[[File:Zoffani, Johann - Charles Towneley in his Sculpture Gallery - 1782.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Townley's ''Bust of Clytie'' (left, on the table).]]
[[Image:ClytieTownley.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Townley's ''Clytie''.]]

One sculpture of Clytie is a Roman marble in the collection of [[Charles Townley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/marble_bust_of_clytie.aspx Trustees of the British Museum – Marble bust of 'Clytie'] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913090736/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/marble_bust_of_clytie.aspx |date=2012-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bust was created between 40 and 50 AD. Townley acquired it from the family of the principe Laurenzano in [[Naples]] during his extended second [[Grand Tour]] of Italy (1771–1774); the Laurenzano insisted it had been found locally. It remained a favorite both with him (it figures prominently in [[Johann Zoffany]]'s iconic painting of Townley's library (''illustration, right''), was one of three ancient marbles Townley had reproduced on his visiting card, and was apocryphally the one which he wished he could carry with him when his house was torched in the [[Gordon Riots]] – apocryphal since the bust is in fact far too heavy for that) and with the public ([[Joseph Nollekens]] is said to have always had a marble copy of it in stock for his customers to purchase, and in the late 19th century [[Parian ware]] copies were all the rage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/parian_bust_of_clytie.aspx Trustees of the British Museum – Parian bust of Clytie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194632/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/parian_bust_of_clytie.aspx |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the subject, a woman emerging from a calyx of leaves, was much discussed among the antiquaries in Townley's circle. At first referred to as [[Agrippina the elder|Agrippina]], and later called by Townley [[Isis]] in a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower, it is now accepted as Clytie. Some modern scholars even claim the bust is of eighteenth century date, though most now think it is an ancient work showing [[Antonia Minor]] or a contemporaneous Roman lady in the guise of [[Ariadne]].

=== Bust (George Frederick Watts)===
Another famous bust of Clytie was by [[George Frederick Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/watts/1.html The Victorian Web – ''Clytie'' George Frederick Watts, R.A., 1817–1904]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of Townley's serene Clytie, Watts's is straining, looking round at the sun.

A '''concretion''' is a hard, compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of [[mineral]] cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in [[sedimentary rock]] or [[soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of terms in soil science|date=1976|publisher=Agriculture Canada|location=Ottawa|isbn=0662015339|page=13|url=http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/1976-glossary/pub1459_report.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''con'' meaning 'together' and ''crescere'' meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary [[Stratum|strata]] that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to [[weathering]] than the host [[stratum]].

There is an important distinction to draw between concretions and [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s. Concretions are formed from mineral precipitation around some kind of nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.

Descriptions dating from the 18th century attest to the fact that concretions have long been regarded as geological curiosities. Because of the variety of unusual shapes, sizes and compositions, concretions have been interpreted to be [[dinosaur]] eggs, animal and plant [[fossil]]s (called [[pseudofossil]]s), extraterrestrial debris or human [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s.

==Origins==
Detailed studies (i.e., Boles ''et al.'', 1985; Thyne and Boles, 1989; Scotchman, 1991; Mozley and Burns, 1993; McBride ''et al.'', 2003; Chan ''et al.'', 2005; Mozley and Davis, 2005) published in peer-reviewed journals have demonstrated that concretions form after sediments are buried but before the sediment is fully lithified during [[diagenesis]]. They typically form when a mineral precipitates and cements sediment around a nucleus, which is often organic, such as a leaf, tooth, piece of shell or [[fossil]]. For this reason, fossil collectors commonly break open concretions in their search for fossil animal and plant specimens. Some of the most unusual concretion nuclei, as documented by Al-Agha ''et al.'' (1995), are [[World War II]] military [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], [[bomb]]s, and [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], which are found inside [[siderite]] concretions found in an English coastal [[salt marsh]].

Depending on the environmental conditions present at the time of their formation, concretions can be created by either concentric or pervasive growth (Mozley, 1996; Raiswell and Fisher, 2000). In concentric growth, the concretion grows as successive layers of mineral precipitate around a central core. This process results in roughly spherical concretions that grow with time. In the case of pervasive growth, cementation of the host [[sediments]], by infilling of its pore space by precipitated minerals, occurs simultaneously throughout the volume of the area, which in time becomes a concretion. Concretions are often exposed at the surface by subsequent erosion that removes the weaker, uncemented material.

==Appearance==
[[File:Rock concretions from Hells Hollow State Park, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|Samples of small rock concretions found at [[Hells Hollow State Park]] in Pennsylvania.]]
Concretions vary in shape, hardness and size, ranging from objects that require a magnifying lens to be clearly visible to huge bodies three meters in diameter and weighing several thousand pounds. The giant, red concretions occurring in [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]], in [[North Dakota]], are almost {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Spheroidal concretions, as large as {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, have been found eroding out of the Qasr El Sagha Formation within the Faiyum depression of Egypt. Concretions are usually similar in color to the rock in which they are found. Concretions occur in a wide variety of shapes, including spheres, disks, tubes, and grape-like or soap bubble-like [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s.

==Composition==
They are commonly composed of a [[carbonate]] mineral such as [[calcite]]; an amorphous or microcrystalline form of [[silica]] such as [[chert]], [[flint]], or [[jasper]]; or an iron oxide or hydroxide such as [[goethite]] and [[hematite]]. They can also be composed of other minerals that include [[dolomite]], [[ankerite]], [[siderite]], [[pyrite]], [[marcasite]], [[barite]] and [[gypsum]].

Although concretions often consist of a single dominant mineral, other minerals can be present depending on the environmental conditions which created them. For example, carbonate concretions, which form in response to the reduction of [[sulfates]] by [[bacteria]], often contain minor percentages of pyrite. Other concretions, which formed as a result of microbial sulfate reduction, consist of a mixture of calcite, barite, and pyrite.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:07-ml-3-soil-mosaic-B019R1 br.jpg|thumb|Mosaic shows spherules, some partly embedded, spread over (smaller) soil grains on the Martian surface.]]

Concretions are found in a variety of rocks, but are particularly common in [[shale]]s, [[siltstone]]s, and [[sandstone]]s. They often outwardly resemble fossils or rocks that look as if they do not belong to the stratum in which they were found. Occasionally, concretions contain a fossil, either as its nucleus or as a component that was incorporated during its growth but concretions are not fossils themselves. They appear in nodular patches, concentrated along bedding planes, protruding from weathered cliffsides, randomly distributed over mudhills or perched on soft pedestals.

Small hematite concretions, dubbed "blueberries" due to their resemblance to blueberries in a muffin, have been observed by the [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'' rover]]  in the [[Eagle Crater]] on Mars. See [[Martian spherules]].

==Types of concretion==
Concretions vary considerably in their compositions, shapes, sizes and modes of origin.

===Septarian concretions===
{{redirect|Septaria|the genus of gastropod snail|Septaria (gastropod)}}
[[Image:Septarian Nodule.jpg|thumb|right|A slice of a septarian nodule]]Septarian concretions or '''septarian nodules''', are concretions containing angular cavities or cracks, called "'''septaria'''". The word comes from the [[Latin]] word ''septum''; "partition", and refers to the cracks/separations in this kind of rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=septarian|title=septarian|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some websites incorrectly derive the term from the Latin word ''septem'', meaning "seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestcrystals.com/septarian.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905052608/http://www.bestcrystals.com/septarian.htm|title=SEPTARIAN NODULES|archivedate=5 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cracks are highly variable in shape and volume, as well as the degree of shrinkage they indicate. Although it has commonly been assumed that concretions grew incrementally from the inside outwards, the fact that radially oriented cracks taper towards the margins of septarian concretions is taken as evidence that in these cases the periphery was stiffer while the inside was softer, presumably due to a gradient in the amount of cement precipitated.

The process that created the septaria that characterize septarian concretions remains unclear. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion's center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; or brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the concretion interior by either earthquakes or compaction (Pratt 2001; McBride ''et al.'' 2003). Septaria usually contain crystals, often calcite, that precipitated from circulating solutions. Siderite or pyrite coatings are also occasionally observed on the wall of the cavities present in the septaria, giving rise respectively to a panoply of bright reddish and golden colors.

[[File:MoerakiBouldersSunrise.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moeraki Boulders]], New Zealand]]
A spectacular example of septarian concretions, which are as much as {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter, are the [[Moeraki Boulders]]. These concretions are found eroding out of [[Paleocene]] mudstone of the Moeraki Formation exposed along the coast near [[Moeraki]], [[South Island]], [[New Zealand]]. They are composed of calcite-cemented mud with septarian veins of calcite and rare late-stage quartz and ferrous dolomite (Boles ''et al.'' 1985, Thyne and Boles 1989). Very similar concretions, which are as much as {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and called "Koutu Boulders", litter the beach between Koutu and Kauwhare points along the south shore of the Hokianga Harbour of [[Hokianga]], [[North Island]], New Zealand. The much smaller septarian concretions found in the [[Kimmeridge Clay]] exposed in cliffs along the Wessex Coast of [[England]] are more typical examples of septarian concretions (Scotchman 1991).

===Cannonball concretions===
Cannonball concretions are large spherical concretions, which resemble cannonballs. These are found along the [[Cannonball River]] within Morton and Sioux Counties, [[North Dakota]], and can reach {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. They were created by early cementation of sand and silt by [[calcite]]. Similar cannonball concretions, which are as much as {{convert|4|to|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, are found associated with sandstone outcrops of the Frontier Formation in northeast [[Utah]] and central [[Wyoming]]. They formed by the early cementation of sand by calcite (McBride ''et al.'' 2003). Somewhat weathered and eroded giant cannonball concretions, as large as {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter, occur in abundance at "[[Rock City, Kansas|Rock City]]" in [[Ottawa County, Kansas]]. Large and spherical boulders are also found along Koekohe beach near [[Moeraki]] on the east coast of the South Island of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Dann, C., and Peat, N. (1989) ''Dunedin, North and South Otago''. Wellington: GP Books. {{ISBN|0-477-01438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moeraki Boulders]] and [[Koutu Boulders]] of New Zealand are examples of septarian concretions, which are also cannonball concretions. Large spherical rocks, which are found on the shore of [[Lake Huron]] near [[Kettle Point, Ontario]], and locally known as "kettles", are typical cannonball concretions. Cannonball concretions have also been reported from [[Van Mijenfjorden]], [[Spitsbergen]]; near [[Haines Junction]], [[Yukon Territory]], [[Canada]]; [[Jameson Land]], East [[Greenland]]; near Mecevici, Ozimici, and [[Zavidovici]] in Bosnia-Herzegovina; in Alaska in the [[Kenai Peninsula]] Captain Cook State Park on north of [[Cook Inlet]] beach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cookinletconcretions.com/Kenai%20Article.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708191432/http://cookinletconcretions.com/Kenai%20Article.htm |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Kodiak Island]] northeast of Fossil Beach;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGlonWEE-8YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA17&amp;lpg=RA1-PA17&amp;dq=Fossil+beach+kodiak+concretions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H2-JxhdG3s&amp;sig=QhCtOLvXbQ9N3dYoEVGucz94HX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja2_3B77bTAhVL1WMKHWYsAc4Q6AEIQDAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Geological Survey Professional Paper|author=|date=24 May 1976|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of cannonball concretions have also come from Bandeng and Zhanlong hills near Gongxi Town, Hunan Province, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-4-17/54224.html|title=The Epoch Times - Mysterious Huge Stone Eggs Discovered in Hunan Province|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421022907/http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-4-17/54224.html|archivedate=2007-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiatus concretions===
[[File:DinocochleaModel.jpg|thumb|left|A model of ''[[Dinocochlea]]'' with [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] research scientist Paul Taylor as a scale.]]
[[Image:HiatusConcretionsIsrael060910.jpg|thumb|Hiatus concretions at the base of the [[Menuha Formation]] (Upper Cretaceous), the [[Negev]], southern [[Israel]].]]
[[Image:OrdovicianEdrio.jpg|thumb|Hiatus concretion encrusted by bryozoans (thin, branching forms) and an [[edrioasteroid]]; [[Kope Formation]] (Upper Ordovician), northern [[Kentucky]].]]
Hiatus concretions are distinguished by their stratigraphic history of exhumation, exposure and reburial. They are found where submarine erosion has concentrated early diagenetic concretions as [[Lag deposit|lag surface]]s by washing away surrounding fine-grained sediments (Zaton 2010). Their significance for stratigraphy, sedimentology and paleontology was first noted by Voigt (1968) who referred to them as ''Hiatus-Konkretionen''.  "Hiatus" refers to the break in sedimentation that allowed this erosion and exposure. They are found throughout the fossil record but are most common during periods in which [[calcite sea]] conditions prevailed, such as the [[Ordovician]], [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] (Zaton 2010). Most are formed from the cemented infillings of burrow systems in siliciclastic or carbonate sediments.

A distinctive feature of hiatus concretions separating them from other types is that they were often encrusted by marine organisms including [[bryozoans]], [[echinoderms]] and [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]] in the Paleozoic (e.g., Wilson 1985) and bryozoans, [[oysters]] and tube worms in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (e.g., Taylor and Wilson 2001). Hiatus concretions are also often significantly [[bioerosion|bored]] by worms and bivalves (Taylor and Wilson 2001).

===Elongate concretions===
Elongate concretions form parallel to sedimentary strata and have been studied extensively due to the inferred influence of [[phreatic]] (saturated) zone [[groundwater]] flow direction on the orientation of the axis of elongation (e.g., Johnson, 1989; McBride ''et al.'', 1994; Mozley and Goodwin, 1995; Mozley and Davis, 2005). In addition to providing information about the orientation of past fluid flow in the host rock, elongate concretions can provide insight into local permeability trends (i.e., permeability correlation structure; Mozley and Davis, 1996), variation in groundwater velocity (Davis, 1999), and the types of geological features that influence flow.

Elongate concretions are well known in the [[Kimmeridge Clay]] formation of northwest Europe. In outcrops, where they have acquired the name "doggers", they are typically only a few metres across, but in the subsurface they can be seen to penetrate up to tens of metres of along-hole dimension. Unlike limestone beds, however, it is impossible to consistently correlate them between even closely spaced wells.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Moqui Marbles===
[[Image:MoquiMarble1.jpg|thumb|Moqui Marbles, hematite, goethite concretions, from the Navajo Sandstone of southeast Utah. The cube at the top is one cubic centimeter in size.]]
[[Moqui Marbles]], also called Moqui balls or "Moki marbles", are iron oxide concretions which can be found eroding in great abundance out of outcrops of the [[Navajo Sandstone]] within south-central and southeastern Utah. These concretions range in shape from spheres to discs, buttons, spiked balls, cylindrical forms, and other odd shapes. They range from pea-size to baseball-size. They were created by the precipitation of iron, which was dissolved in groundwater. They are further described by (Chan and Parry 2002, Chan ''et al.'' 2005, Loope et al. 2010, 2011).

===Kansas pop rocks===
Kansas pop rocks are concretions of either iron sulfide, ''i.e.'' [[pyrite]] and [[marcasite]], or in some cases [[jarosite]], which are found in outcrops of the [[Smoky Hill Chalk|Smoky Hill Chalk Member]] of the Niobrara Formation within Gove County, [[Kansas]]. They are typically associated with thin layers of altered volcanic ash, called [[bentonite]], that occur within the [[chalk]] comprising the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. A few of these concretions enclose, at least in part, large flattened valves of inoceramid [[bivalve]]s. These concretions range in size from a few millimeters to as much as {{convert|0.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|12|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in thickness. Most of these concretions are [[oblate spheroid]]s. Other "pop rocks" are small polycuboidal pyrite concretions, which are as much as {{convert|7|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter (Hattin 1982). These concretions are called "pop rocks" because they explode if thrown in a fire. Also, when they are either cut or hammered, they produce sparks and a burning sulfur smell. Contrary to what has been published on the Internet, none of the iron sulfide concretions, which are found in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member were created by either the replacement of fossils or by metamorphic processes. In fact, [[metamorphic rocks]] are completely absent from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member (Hattin 1982). Instead, all of these iron sulfide concretions were created by the precipitation of iron sulfides within anoxic marine [[pelagic sediments|calcareous ooze]] after it had accumulated and before it had [[Lithification|lithified]] into chalk.

Iron sulfide concretions, such as the Kansas Pop rocks, consisting of either [[pyrite]] and [[marcasite]], are nonmagnetic (Hobbs and Hafner 1999). On the other hand, iron sulfide concretions, which either are composed of or contain either [[pyrrhotite]] or [[smythite]], will be magnetic to varying degrees (Hoffmann, 1993). Prolonged heating of either a pyrite or marcasite concretion will convert portions of either mineral into pyrrhotite causing the concretion to become slightly magnetic.

=== Calcium carbonate disc concretions ===
[[File:Marleka fairy stone from Stensö in Sweden.JPG|thumb|''Marleka'' fairy stone from Stensö in Sweden]]
These so-called fairy stones consist of single or multiple discs, usually 6–10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and often with concentric grooves on their surfaces. They form in [[Quaternary]] clay as [[calcium carbonate]] migrates to some small fossil or pebble. Fairy stones are particularly common in the [[Harricana River]] valley in the [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]] administrative region of [[Quebec]], and in [[Östergötland]] county, Sweden.

'''Curcumin''' is a bright yellow chemical produced by some plants. It is the principal [[curcuminoid]] of [[turmeric]] (''Curcuma longa''), a member of the [[ginger]] family, [[Zingiberaceae]]. It is sold as an [[herbal supplement]], [[cosmetics]] ingredient, food flavoring, and [[food coloring]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/articles/2015/12/the-state-of-the-curcumin-market.aspx |title= The State of the Curcumin Market |last= Majeed |first= Shaheen |date= 2015-12-28 |website= Natural Products Insider |language= en-US |df= dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemically, curcumin is a [[diarylheptanoid]], belonging to the group of curcuminoids, which are [[natural phenol]]s responsible for turmeric's yellow color. It is a [[Keto–enol tautomerism|tautomeric compound]] existing in [[enol]]ic form in [[organic solvent]]s, and as a [[ketone|keto]] form in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Manolova |first1= Yana |last2= Deneva |first2= Vera |last3= Antonov |first3= Liudmil |last4= Drakalska |first4= Elena |last5= Momekova |first5= Denitsa |last6= Lambov |first6=  Nikolay |name-list-format=vanc |title= The effect of the water on the curcumin tautomerism: A quantitative approach |journal= Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy |volume= 132 |pages= 815–820 |year= 2014 |doi= 10.1016/j.saa.2014.05.096|pmid= 24973669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curcumin has no confirmed medical use in spite of efforts to find one via both laboratory and clinical research. It is difficult to study because it is both unstable and not [[bioavailable]]. It is unlikely to produce useful leads for [[drug development]].&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Kurkumina.jpg|upright=1.14|thumb|Curcumin powder|left]]

The most common applications are as an ingredient in [[dietary supplement]], in [[cosmetics]], and as flavoring for foods, such as turmeric-flavored beverages in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and  [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a [[food additive]] for gold-orange coloring in turmeric and prepared foods, its [[E number]] is E100.&lt;ref name="fanl"&gt;{{cite web |author= European Commission |authorlink= European Commission |title= Food Additives|url= https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco_foods/main/?event=substance.view&amp;identifier=5 |accessdate= 2014-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual sales of curcumin have increased since 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The largest market is in North America, where sales exceeded US$20&amp;nbsp;million in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Chemistry ==
[[File:Curcumin thin lipid film.jpg|alt=A bright red substance in a small glass flask, held by gloved fingers|right|180px|thumb|Curcumin becomes bright red when it interacts [[electrostatics|electrostatically]] with [[phospholipid]] film.]]

Curcumin incorporates several functional groups whose structure was first identified in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cber.191004302168 |title=Zur Kenntnis des Curcumins |year=1910 |last1= Miłobȩdzka |first1= J. |last2= van Kostanecki |first2= S. |last3= Lampe |first3= V. |journal= Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |volume= 43 |issue= 2 |pages= 2163–2170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aromatic ring systems, which are [[phenols]], are connected by two α,β-unsaturated [[carbonyl]] groups. The diketones form stable [[enol]]s and are readily deprotonated to form [[enolate]]s; the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is a good [[Michael acceptor]] and undergoes [[nucleophilic addition]].

Curcumin is used as a [[complexometric indicator]] for [[boron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.caslab.com/EPA-Methods/PDF/EPA-Method-2123.pdf |title= EPA Method 212.3: Boron (Colorimetric, Curcumin)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reacts with [[boric acid]] to form a red-colored compound, [[rosocyanine]].

===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthetic route of curcumin is uncertain. In 1973, Roughly and Whiting proposed two mechanisms for curcumin biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by [[cinnamic acid]] and 5 [[malonyl-CoA]] molecules that eventually arylized into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by [[malonyl-CoA]]. Both use cinnamic acid as their starting point, which is derived from the amino acid [[phenylalanine]].&lt;ref name="Kita, T. 2008" /&gt;

Plant biosyntheses starting with cinnamic acid is rare compared to the more common [[p-Coumaric acid|''p''-coumaric acid]].&lt;ref name="Kita, T. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1271/bbb.80075 |pmid= 18603793 |title= The Biosynthetic Pathway of Curcuminoid in Turmeric (''Curcuma longa'') as Revealed by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-Labeled Precursors |journal= Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry |year= 2008 |last1= Kita |first1= Tomoko |last2= Imai |first2= Shinsuke |last3= Sawada |first3= Hiroshi |last4= Kumagai |first4= Hidehiko |last5= Seto |first5= Haruo |volume= 72 |issue= 7 |pages= 1789–1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few identified compounds, such as [[anigorufone]] and [[pinosylvin]], build from cinnamic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00544-0 |title= Variability of phenylpropanoid precursors in the biosynthesis of phenylphenalenones in ''Anigozanthos preissii'' |year= 2000 |last1= Schmitt |first1= Bettina |last2= Hölscher |first2= Dirk |last3= Schneider |first3= Bernd |journal= Phytochemistry |volume= 53 |issue= 3 |pages= 331–337 |pmid= 10703053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gehlert |first1= R. |last2= Schoeppner |first2= A. |last3= Kindl |first3= H. |title= Stilbene Synthase from Seedlings of ''Pinus sylvestris'': Purification and Induction in Response to Fungal Infection |journal= Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions |year= 1990 |volume= 3 |issue= 6 |pages= 444–449 |doi= 10.1094/MPMI-3-444 |url= http://www.apsnet.org/publications/mpmi/backissues/Documents/1990Articles/Microbe03_444.pdf |format= pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Curcumin, which shows positive results in most [[drug discovery]] assays, is regarded as a false [[lead compound|lead]] that [[Medicinal chemistry|medicinal chemists]] include among "[[pan-assay interference compounds]]" attracting undue experimental attention while failing to advance as viable therapeutic or drug leads.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5346970|year=2017|author1=Nelson|first1=K.

Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, extensive metabolism.&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;  Very little curcumin escapes the GI tract and most is excreted in feces unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metzler |first1=M |last2=Pfeiffer |first2=E |last3=Schulz |first3=SI |last4=Dempe |first4=JS |title=Curcumin uptake and metabolism. |journal=BioFactors |date=2013 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=14–20 |doi=10.1002/biof.1042 |pmid=22996406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If  curcumin were to enter plasma in reasonable amounts there would be a high risk of toxicity since it is promiscuous, and interacts with several proteins known to increase the risk of adverse effects, including [[hERG]], [[cytochrome P450]]s, and [[glutathione S-transferase]].&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;

==Safety==
As a component of turmeric, curcumin may interact with [[prescription drug]]s and [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref name="drugs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Turmeric |url=https://www.drugs.com/mtm/turmeric.html |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=28 November 2018 |date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In high amounts, it may be unsafe for women during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt; It may cause side effects, such as [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[hives]], or dizziness.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;

Two preliminary clinical studies in cancer patients consuming high doses of curcumin (up to 8&amp;nbsp;grams per day for 3–4 months) showed no toxicity, though some subjects reported mild nausea or diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hsu |first1=CH |last2=Cheng |first2=AL |title=Clinical studies with curcumin. |journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |date=2007 |volume=595 |pages=471–80 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-46401-5_21 |pmid=17569225|isbn=978-0-387-46400-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
''In vitro'', curcumin exhibits numerous interference properties which may lead to misinterpretation of results.&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Curcumin Will Waste Your Time|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/01/12/curcumin-will-waste-your-time|work=In the Pipeline|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although curcumin has been assessed in numerous laboratory and [[clinical research|clinical studies]], it has no medical uses established by well-designed [[clinical research]].&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/curcumin | title=Curcumin | publisher=Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis | work=Micronutrient Information Center; Phytochemicals | date=2016 | accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 review of over 120 studies, curcumin has not been successful in any [[clinical trial]], leading the authors to conclude that "curcumin is an unstable, reactive, non-bioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly improbable lead".&lt;ref name=nelson/&gt;

The US government has supported $150 million in research into curcumin through the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]], and no support has been found for curcumin as a medical treatment.&lt;ref name="nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-11917"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemonick|first1=Sam|title=Everybody Needs To Stop With This Turmeric Molecule|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samlemonick/2017/01/19/everybody-needs-to-quit-it-with-this-turmeric-molecule/#39ccce9079ff|accessdate=May 27, 2018|publisher=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4986">'''Empty forest''' is a term coined by Kent H. Redford's article "The Empty Forest"  (1992), which was published in ''[[BioScience]]''.  An "empty forest" refers to an [[ecosystem]] that is void of large [[mammal]]s. Empty forests are characterized by an otherwise excellent habitat, and often have large, fully grown trees, although they lack large mammals as a result of human impact. Empty forests show that human impact can destroy an ecosystem from within as well as from without.&lt;ref name="Redford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redford|first=Kent|title=The Empty Forest|journal=BioScience|date=June 1992|volume=42|issue=6|pages=412–422|url=http://www.biology.ufl.edu/courses/pcb5356/2011fall/kitajima/Redford1992Biosci.pdf|doi=10.2307/1311860|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111203443/http://www.biology.ufl.edu/courses/pcb5356/2011fall/kitajima/Redford1992Biosci.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the large mammals that are disappearing, such as deer and [[tapir]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Bodmer, R. E. 1989. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00378967 Ungulate biomass in relation to feeding strategy within Amazonian forests]. Oecologia, 81: 547-550.&lt;/ref&gt; are important for seed dispersion. Many tree species that are very localized in their dispersion rely on mammals rather than the wind to disperse their seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, A. H. 1983. Dispersal ecology and diversity in neotropical forest communities. Sonderband Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein Hamburg, 7: 303-314.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, when [[seed predation]] is down, trees with large seeds begin to completely dominate those with small seeds, changing the balance of plant life in an area.&lt;ref&gt;Putz, F. E., E. G. Leigh Jr, S. J. Wright. 1990. Solitary confinement in Panama. Garden, 14: 18-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory large mammals are important for increasing overall diversity by making sure that smaller predators and herbivores do not become overabundant and dominate. An absence of large predators seems to result in uneven densities of prey species.&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, L. H. 1987. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00292180 Comparative feeding ecology of felids in a neotropical rainforest]. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 20: 271-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though certain animals may not have become completely extinct, they may have lowered in numbers to the point that they have suffered an [[ecological extinction]]. The animals that have most likely suffered an ecological extinction in neotropical forests are the ones who are the most important predators, large seed dispersers, and seed predators.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, C. H., L. H. Emmons. 1990. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_iHcFWDskakC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Ecological+structure+of+the+nonflying+mammal+community+at+Cocha+Cashu+biological+station,+Manu+National+Park,+Peru&amp;ots=HQCSWE8Sj7&amp;sig=ZeIsRw7rw-8ErRqCitV5wz0ovcM#v=onepage&amp;q=Ecological%20structure%20of%20the%20nonflying%20mammal%20community%20at%20Cocha%20Cashu%20biological%20station%2C%20Manu%20National%20Park%2C%20Peru&amp;f=false Ecological structure of the nonflying mammal community at Cocha Cashu biological station, Manu National Park, Peru]. Four neotropical rainforests, 314-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[defaunation]] of large mammals can be done by direct or indirect means. Any type of human activity not aimed at the animals in question that results in the defaunation of those animals is indirect. The most common means of indirect defaunation is [[habitat destruction]]. However, other examples of indirect means of defaunation of large mammals would be the over-collection of fruits and nuts or over-hunting of prey that large mammals need for food. Another example of an indirect means of the defaunation of large mammals is through the by-products of modern human activities such as mercury and smoke, or even [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref name="Redford" /&gt;

There are two categories of direct defaunation. They include subsistence hunting and commercial hunting. The most common species of animals hunted are typically the largest species in their area. The large mammals in an area are often represented by only a few species, but make up a major part of the overall [[biomass]]. In areas with only moderate hunting, the biomass of mammalian game species decreases by 80.7%. In areas with heavy hunting, the biomass of mammalian game species can decrease by 93.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Redford, K. H., C. Murcia, B. Klein. 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">An '''energy factor''' is a metric used in the [[United States]] to compare the [[energy conversion efficiency]] of residential appliances and equipment. The energy factor is currently used for rating the efficiency of [[Water heating|water heaters]], [[dishwasher]]s, [[washing machine|clothes washers]], and [[clothes dryer]]s.&lt;ref name="energy star def"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Tax Credits for Consumer Energy Efficiency: Definitions |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_definitions&amp;dts=mcs |work=energystar.gov |publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=26 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401155424/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_definitions&amp;dts=mcs |archivedate=1 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used by the [[United States Department of Energy]] to develop and enforce minimum energy conservation standards under the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act#Energy Conservation Program|Energy Conservation Program]].&lt;ref name="stat authority"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory Authorities and Rules|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/statutory_authorities_and_rules.html|work=eere.energy.gov|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher the energy factor, the more efficient the appliance should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESTIMATING COSTS AND EFFICIENCY OF STORAGE, DEMAND, AND HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/estimating-costs-and-efficiency-storage-demand-and-heat-pump-water-heaters|website=Energy.gov|publisher=US Dept of Energy|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term energy factor is used to compare the relative efficiency of these appliances, the metric is defined differently for all four appliance categories. The energy factor is expressed in terms of site energy, which excludes losses through [[Energy transformation|energy conversion]]. All of these efficiency metrics are defined by Department of Energy test procedures.&lt;ref name=standards&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards and Test Procedures|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/standards_test_procedures.html|work=eere.energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water heaters==
The energy factor metric only applies to residential water heaters, which are currently defined by fuel, type, and input capacity.&lt;ref name=waterheaters&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Water Heaters|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/product.aspx/productid/27|work=eere.energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test procedure===
[[File:Energy Factor Draw Patter Water Heaters.svg|The energy factor is determined using a stylized hot water use pattern. Hot water is drawn in six equal draws totaling 64.3 gallons, and a standby period of 18 hours follows.|right|thumb|400px]]

The energy factor for residential water heaters is determined using the results from the 24-hour simulated use test. During the test 64.3±1.0 gallons of water are drawn from the water heater in six equally spaced draws that begin one hour apart. The hot water flow rate for each draw is 3.0±0.25 gallons per minute. After the beginning of the last draw a standby period of 18 hours follows. During the test, the test conditions must be operated at a specified value and accuracy. Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) have different values specified for ambient air temperature and relative humidity.&lt;ref name="test proc"&gt;{{cite journal|title=10 CFR Part 430 Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Test Procedure for Water Heaters; Final Rule|journal=Federal Register|date=11 May 1998|volume=63|issue=90|pages=25995–26016|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-05-11/pdf/98-12296.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Specified test conditions
! Measurement !! Required value and accuracy
|-
| Inlet water temperature || 58&amp;nbsp;°F±2&amp;nbsp;°F
|-
| Outlet water temperature || 135&amp;nbsp;°F±5&amp;nbsp;°F
|-
| Ambient air temperature || 67.5&amp;nbsp;°F±2.5&amp;nbsp;°F
|-
| Ambient air temperature (HPWHs only) || 67.5&amp;nbsp;°F±1&amp;nbsp;°F
|-
| Ambient relative humidity (HPWHs only) || 50%±1%
|}

From the standard test procedure, the energy factor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; EF=\sum\limits_{i=1}^6 \frac{M_i C_{pi}\left( 135^\circ F-58^\circ F\right)}{Q_{dm}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q_{dm}&lt;/math&gt; is the modified daily water heating energy consumption (Btu), &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;  is the mass withdrawn from the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; draw (lb), and &lt;math&gt;C_{pi}&lt;/math&gt;  is the specific heat of the water of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; draw Btu/lb°F.

&lt;!--
FOLLOWING SAYS IT IS THE EQUATION FOR Qdm, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS THE EQUATION FOR Qhw, which is only a component of Qdm:
The modified daily water heating energy consumption is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; Q_{dm}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^6 \frac{M_i C_{pi}\left( \overline{T}_{del,i}-\overline{T}_{in,i}\right)}{\eta_r},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_{del,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the average delivery temperature of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; draw (°F) as measured during the test, &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_{in,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the average inlet temperature of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; draw (°F) as measured during the test, and &lt;math&gt;\eta_r&lt;/math&gt; is the recovery efficiency of the water heater.
--&gt;

===Energy conservation standards===
Minimum federal energy conservation standards are defined by fuel, type, and rated storage volume. All standards are calculated as a function of the rated storage volume ''V'' in gallons. The current conservation standards are less efficient than the standards that go into effect in 2015.&lt;ref name=waterheaters /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Federal Register|date=16 April 2010|title=10 CFR Part 430 Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Residential Water Heaters, Direct Heating Equipment, and Pool Heaters; Final Rule|volume=75|issue=73|pages=20112-21981 [20113]|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-04-16/pdf/2010-7611.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=10 CFR Part 430 Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Energy Conservation Standards for Water Heaters; Final Rule|journal=Federal Register|date=17 January 2001|volume=66|issue=11|pages=4474–4497 [4497]|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-01-17/pdf/01-1081.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the factors which has limited the economic development of Spain throughout history it has been the relative scarcity of energy resources. While Spain does have its own hydrocarbon (liquid and gas) resources, their quantity is far too low to meet demand. In addition, there has been a low quality in the available coal. This shortage of resources has involved an external deficit situation. The energy dependency rate stood at 81,4% in 2005 and 73,3% in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=t2020_rd320&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This deficit rate is higher than in the EU(28): 2005 (52,1%) and 2015(54%). The primary energy consumed was mainly fossil in 2015: Oil (42,3%), natural gas (19,8%) and coal (11,6%).The rest 26,3% is accounted for nuclear energy (12%) and different renewable energy sources (14,3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minetad.gob.es/energia/balances/Balances/LibrosEnergia/Energia_2015.pdf|title=www.minetad.gob.es/energia/balances/Balances/LibrosEnergia/Energia_2015.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the production of primary energy, the highest level is nuclear (44,8%), solar,wind and geothermal (22,4%), biomass and waste (21,1%), hydropower (7,2%) and fossil (4,5%).

According to [[The World Factbook]], in 2011 [[Spain]] produced 276.8 TWh of electricity. In the same year, Spain consumed only 249.7 TWh of electricity. In recent years, huge investment has been made into Spain's renewable energy industry and aims to be carbon-free well before 2050. According to Red Electrica de España (REE), the Spanish peninsula got 69 percent of its electricity generation in March 2015 from technologies that produce zero carbon emissions — that is to say, renewable energy plus some of its nuclear power. Nuclear as a whole provided 23.8 percent of the country’s electricity in March, while 47 percent came solely from renewable sources.
Most of the renewable electricity being generated in Spain comes from wind, which alone provided 22.5 percent of the country’s electricity in April 2015. Wind often competes with nuclear for the title of Spain’s top electricity generation source overall — in fact, though nuclear pulled through in March 2015 as the top source of electricity, wind has overall provided more electricity to Spain in the entirety of 2015. From January to March 2015, according to REE, wind provided 23.7 percent of electricity generation while nuclear made up 22.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/04/02/3642093/spain-renewable-energy-march/&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain has long been a leader in renewable energy, and has recently become the first country in the world to have relied on wind as its top energy source for an entire year. The country is attempting to use wind power to supply 40 percent of its electricity consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://cleantechnica.com/2013/05/08/fifty-four-of-spains-electricity-generation-in-april-from-renewables/&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, Spain is also developing other renewable sources of energy, particularly solar photovoltaic. Though it currently only accounts for about 3 percent of electricity generation, Spain’s solar industry is one of the largest in the world, according to Al Jazeera. In 2012, it reported that solar power accounted for almost 2,000 MW. Comparatively in the United States, there were 3,313 MW of solar photovoltaic installations that same year.
Though the U.S. may have more solar cumulatively, Spain’s solar makes up more of the smaller country’s electricity use as a whole. In 2013, solar accounted for about 0.2 percent of the net electricity produced in the United States, according to the Institute for Energy Research. That same year, solar accounted for 3.1 percent of Spain’s total electricity, according to REE.
Spain’s renewable energy story hasn't been all good news. The country’s aggressive goals have been heavily subsidized by its government, and the government has fallen into economic distress as a result. Specifically, the New York Times reported in 2013 that Spain’s tariff deficit had built up a cumulative debt of about €26 billion ($35 billion). Since then, however, the country has slashed its subsidies, putting the bulk of costs back on the power utilities themselves.
The subsidy cuts happened last summer, and since then renewable energy has not significantly grown in the country as a whole. But it has grown substantially in at least one part of Spain — the tiny island of El Hierro, which is nearing its goal to be powered 100 percent by wind and water.

== Global warming==
According to Energy Information Administration the CO2 emissions from energy consumption of Spain were in 2009 360 Mt, below [[Energy in Italy|Italy]]  450 Mt and  [[Energy in France|France]] 429 Mt and above [[Energy in Poland|Poland]]  295 Mt and [[Energy in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] 250 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2  World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest] Guardian 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The emissions tonnes per capita were in Spain 7.13, Italy 7.01 France 6.3 Poland 7.43, and the Netherlands 14.89.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2 world carbon dioxide emissions country data co2] Guardian 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galen Clark in the Big Tree Grove.jpeg|thumb|Galen Clark in the Big Tree Grove]]

'''Galen Clark''' (March 28, 1814 – March 24, 1910) is known as the first [[European American]] to discover the [[Mariposa Grove]] of [[Giant Sequoia]] trees, and is notable for his role in gaining legislation to protect it and the Yosemite area, and for 24 years serving as Guardian of [[Yosemite National Park]].

==Early life and education==
Galen Clark was born in Shipton, Canada East (now Quebec) in 1814.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/yose/historyculture/galen-clark.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
He joined the westward migration as a youth.  In Missouri he met and married Rebecca McCoy.  They had two children who survived until after their parents' deaths: Elvira M., who married and became a doctor in [[Oakland, California]]; and another daughter who married John T. Regan of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariposaresearch.net/ObitsC-D.html |title=Historical Obituaries, C ~ D |work=Mariposa County, California Obituaries |publisher=MariposaResearch.net |accessdate=8 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to California==
After his wife died young, Clark moved to California to seek his fortune, probably about 1848 at the time of the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; In 1853 at the age of 39, Clark contracted a severe lung infection that was diagnosed as consumption (as [[tuberculosis]] was called in his time).  Doctors gave him six months to live, as they had no [[antibiotic]] treatment at the time, but counseled rest and outdoor air.

Clark moved to the [[Wawona, California]] area. "I went to the mountains to take my chances of dying or growing better, which I thought were about even." (Galen Clark, 1856)  Upon his discovery of the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, Galen Clark spent most of his time exploring the area and teaching others about the mysteries of the giant, cinnamon-colored trees.

He wrote about protecting the grove to friends and the US Congress.  He contributed to the writing and passage of legislation to protect the area, gaining support of [[US Senator]] [[John Conness]] from California.  The act for the Yosemite Grant was signed into law by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Ceding the land to the state of California for preservation, the grant was the first of its kind.  The legislation was to protect [[Yosemite Valley]] and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias for "public use, resort, and recreation ... to be left inalienable for all time."  Galen became the first "guardian of the grant".  His lungs healed, and he explored and climbed much of the area.

[[File:Portrait of Galen Clark, the first white man in Yosemite Valley.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Clark in his later years]]

Clark did not seek to enrich himself from Yosemite Valley or the Sequoia trees.  He ran a modest hotel and guide service.  A poor businessman, he was constantly in debt.  His Clark's Station, for example, had several more employees than required for the number of guests and its short season.{{Citation needed|reason=Dec 2009|date=December 2009}}

Toward the end of his life, Clark was desperately poor. He wrote three books on Yosemite. These include ''Indians of the Yosemite'' (1904) and ''The Yosemite Valley'' (1910).  Clark's book on the sequoia trees is simple, factual, and direct.  He left out his personal role in the discovery, popularization, and protection of the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. He served as hotel keeper, guide, and guardian of Yosemite and the Mariposa Grove.

Clark spent some time living in Summerland, a Spiritualist colony in Southern California, near Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santabarbara.com/community/neighboring_communities/summerland/&lt;/ref&gt; His house still stands on Shelby Street.

On March 24, 1910, he died at the home of his daughter Dr. Elvira M. Lee in [[Oakland, California]]. He was buried at a spot near Yosemite Falls which he personally selected and dug decades prior to his death. He had also selected the granite tombstone marker and planted around his gravesite seedlings from the Mariposa Grove sequoias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/galen-clark.htm |title=Galen Clark |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Yosemite National Park |publisher=[[U.S. National Park Service]] |access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
* Clark gained preservation of what became Yosemite National Park, and raised awareness of the wilderness, setting an example for the preservation of other ecosystems and wilderness areas.
*Today, the Giant Sequoia that would have been the first of its kind to be seen by Clark at the Mariposa Grove is named and marked "Galen Clark Tree" (240 feet; diameter 15.3 at 10 feet above mean base) in memory of his contribution to the preservation of the Giant Sequoia [[ecosystem]] and the idea of the national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/upload/mgrove.pdf |title = Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2308/2494274068_dfb153eb0d.jpg?v=0 |title=The Galen Clark Tree |publisher=Flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mount Clark (California)|Mount Clark]] and the [[Clark Range (California)|Clark Range]], located east of Yosemite Valley, were named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;

The ''Glossary of Geothermal Heating and Cooling'' provides definitions of many terms used within the [[Geothermal heat pump]] industry. The terms in this [[glossary]] may be used by industry professionals, for education materials, and by the general public.

{{Compact ToC|short1|top=yes|custom1=Acronyms}}

== A ==

=== Active Borehole Length ===

: The length of the U-bend in the borehole below the header trench (usually 4 to 6 feet less than the total borehole length from the surface).

=== Ambient Air ===

: The surrounding air (usually outdoor air or the air in a specific location).

=== Ambient Ground Temperature ===

:  The natural temperature of the earth in a specific location. This temperature will typically be quite stable at a depth of 30' (9 m) and is usually close to the annual average air temperature of the area and is influenced primarily by the average air temperature and secondarily by the thermal energy absorbed from the sun. While the ambient ground temperature is constant, as heat is extracted or rejected via the ground heat exchanger (GHX), the temperature will vary.  Typically, a GHX is designed to operate at a minimum fluid temperature of about 32°F (0°C) and a maximum fluid temperature of 90°F (32°C)

=== Annual Ground Load ===

: Defined to be the difference between the annual amount of heat rejected to the GHEX in the cooling mode and the annual amount of heat extracted from the GHEX in the heating mode.

=== Antifreeze ===

:  A variety of [[Antifreeze]] solutions are used in geothermal ground loops.  The most common types are: [[Propylene glycol]], [[Methanol]], and [[Ethanol]]

=== As-Built Drawing ===

: A detailed drawing that shows everything included on the site plan in addition to the exact location, dimensions, and other pertinent details for a given GHEX installation after the installation is complete.

=== Auxiliary Heat ===

:  A supplemental source of heating to provide additional heat to assist a geothermal heating and cooling system.  Auxiliary heat can also be used as back-up emergency heat if heat pump goes into fault.

=== Average Efficiency ===

:  Seasonal average versus peak Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) or Coefficient Of Performance (COP).

== B ==

{{Compact ToC|short1|top=yes|custom1=Acronyms}}

=== Balance Point Temperature ===

: The outdoor air temperatures where internal heat gains from people, appliances, etc. offset the envelope heat loss to the atmosphere. It is at the balance point temperatures where no indoor heating or cooling will be required to maintain the temperature of the home at the thermostat set point.

=== Bend ===

: A fitting either molded separately or formed from pipe for the purpose of accommodating a directional change.

=== Bentonite Grout===

: A common grout mix used to protect aquifers from ground or cross contamination and ensure good contact between loop and surrounding soil.

=== Best Practice ===

:Commonly accepted practices among industry professionals.

=== Bin ===

: In the bin method, a temperature increment, usually 5 F, into which the range of temperatures for an area are divided. Bins are used to produce a frequency distribution of hourly, monthly, or annual outdoor temperature occurrences for a specified location.

=== Bleed ===

:  Discharge of water from a standing column well to maintain desired temperatures

=== Block Load ===

: Defined to be the sum of the zone loads. A block load calculation is necessary for a building with multiple zones served by a centralized heating/cooling system.

=== Blowers ===

: Fans used to force air across the heat exchanger. With a ground source heat pump, the only blower used is to force air through the central heating system.

=== Brine ===

:  A mixture of water and antifreeze

=== Buffer Tank ===

: A storage tank for geo conditioned water

=== Building Management System ===

: A computerized or digital control system that controls many or all of the systems in a building, including the HVAC system, lighting system, building access controls, etc.

== C ==

{{Compact ToC|short1|top=yes|custom1=Acronyms}}

=== Centralized Pumping System ===

: Flow centers located centrally in a ground source system that produce flow to all heat pump units in that system.

=== Circulating Pump(s) ===

: The pump(s) that circulates the fluid in the closed-loop system during normal operation.

=== Closed-Loop System ===

: The heat exchange loop in a GSHP system that consists of the ground heat exchanger, the circulating pump, and the water-source heat pump in which the heat transfer fluid is not exposed to the atmosphere.

=== Coaxial Heat Exchanger ===

=== Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) ===

: A heat pump system that uses the ground as a heat source and/or heat sink.

In a closed loop system, the heat exchanger is typically coils of high-density polyethylene pipe installed in the ground under or around a building. A heat transfer fluid, usually water or water mixed with antifreeze (propylene glycol, ethanol or methanol), is circulated through this pipe, warming or cooling to the temperature of the earth or rock around it.

In open loop systems the pipe draws water from a well, lake or pond. After it is warmed or cooled the water is returned via a discharge well or back to the lake or pond.

The fluid from the open or closed loop is circulated through a heat pump. The refrigerant in the heat pump either extracts heat from the fluid or rejects heat to it, cooling or warming the refrigerant. When heat is absorbed by the refrigerant, the heat pump boosts its temperature and sends it to the air handler to circulate hot air to heat the home and (optionally) to a hot water heater to produce domestic hot water. The now cooled fluid goes back into the closed loop or, in an open loop system, is sent back to its source.

When the heat pump cools the building, the air handler transfers the heat to the heat pump's refrigerant, warming it and the heat transfer fluid. The now heated fluid circulates back into the closed loop for cooling back to the ambient ground temperature. In an open loop system is sent to the discharge well or back into the lake or pond.

: Open-loop systems pump groundwater or surface water from a well, river, or lake through a water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger and return the water to its source, a drainage basin, pond, or storm sewer.

=== Water to Air ===

:  A heat pump that transfers thermal energy from ground loop (water) and distributes through building via air ducts.

=== Water to Water ===

:  A heat pump that transfers thermal energy from ground loop (water) and distributes through building via a hydronic (water) system.

'''Hollister Ridge''' is a group of [[seamount]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. They lie west from the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]] and form three [[Ridge|ridges]] that form a line; one of the ridges rises to a depth of {{convert|100|m}} and in the past formed an island. The seamounts are composed out of [[Basalt|basaltic]] and other rocks and their ages range from about 2.5 million years ago to latest [[Pleistocene]]; an acoustic swarm recorded in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1991-1992 is considered to be the manifestation of a historical eruption of the Hollister Ridge.

The origin of the Hollister Ridge is unclear, with various proposed mechanisms involving the neighbouring Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, [[crust (geology)|crust]]al weaknesses and the [[Louisville hotspot]].

== History ==

The ridge was discovered either by [[gravimetry]] from [[satellite]]s{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=777}} or by the research ship ''[[USNS Eltanin (T-AK-270)|Eltanin]]''{{sfn|Castillo|Natland|Niu|Lonsdale|1998|p=111}} in 1965 and first named "Hollister Ridge" in a 1995 publication.{{sfn|Okal|Langenhorst|2000|p=185}} [[Sample (material)|Rock samples]] were taken at the ridge in 1996.{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=777}}

== Geography and geomorphology ==

The Hollister Ridge is an [[aseismic ridge]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], wesof the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]].{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=777}} It consists of three separate ridges which are lined up in east-southeast to north-northwest direction, starting from the axis of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and ending in the direction of the [[Louisville seamount chain]]. The eastern ridge is {{convert|70|km}} long and rises to a depth of {{convert|1400|m}} below sea level, the central ridge is {{convert|207|km}} long and rises to a depth of {{convert|100|m}} below sea level, the western ridge is {{convert|50|km}} long and rises to a depth of {{convert|1500|m}} below sea level.{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=778,779}} The central ridge formed an island in the past.{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=779}}

== Geology ==

The ridge rises from a seafloor whose age decreases from 7-8 to 0-1 million years ago southeastward.{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=778,779}} Three [[fracture zone]]s, the Heezen, Tharp and Hollister fracture zones, extend northwestward across the seafloor northeast of the Hollister Ridge;{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=779}} at least the first two are considered to be part of the [[Eltanin fracture zone]].{{sfn|Vlastélic|Dosso|2005|p=11}} A [[Escarpment|scarp]] lies south of the Hollister Ridge,{{sfn|Géli|Aslanian|Olivet|Vlastelic|1998|p=35}} and even farther south lies the Udintsev fracture zone.{{sfn|Vlastélic|Dosso|2005|p=2}} The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge close to the Hollister Ridge is the site of an isolated [[geoid]] anomaly which has been interpreted as a product of [[magma]]tic [[upwelling]].{{sfn|Talandier|Okal|1996|p=1533}}

Rocks sampled from the Hollister Ridge have yielded [[basalt]]s,{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=779}} [[alkali basalt]]s, [[hawaiite]]s, [[picrite]]s and [[tholeiite]]s{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=780}} as well as [[granite]]s, which are most likely [[dropstone]]s transported to the ridge by [[iceberg]]s. The basalts range from [[aphyric]] to [[porphyric]] and contain [[phenocryst]]s of [[olivine]] and [[plagioclase]].{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=779}} 

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its origin:{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=777}}
* The ridge may be the present-day location of the [[Louisville hotspot]].{{sfn|Okal|Langenhorst|2000|p=186}}{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=777}} Petrological differences between the volcanoes formed by this hotspot and the Hollister Ridge make this hypothesis problematic,{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=792}}{{sfn|Okal|Langenhorst|2000|p=186}} as are misfits between the reconstructed path of the Louisville hotspot and the position of the Hollister Ridge.{{sfn|Géli|Aslanian|Olivet|Vlastelic|1998|p=32}} Even later plate reconstructions have endorsed this model of origin.&lt;ref name="MorganMorgan2007" /&gt; 
* A "mini-[[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]", which however is not consistent with the geometry of the ridge (which is at an angle to the motion of the [[Pacific Plate]]).{{sfn|Géli|Aslanian|Olivet|Vlastelic|1998|p=35}} Such a mini-hotspot may be a branch of the Louisville hotspot.{{sfn|Vlastélic|Dosso|2005|p=10}}
* [[Asthenosphere]] may be flowing from the Louisville hotspot to the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge.{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=777}} Seamounts and aseismic ridges have been observed in other regions of the world where such flow is expected to occur.{{sfn|Vlastélic|Dosso|2005|p=2}}
* [[Lineament]]s in the [[crust (geology)|crust]] allowed the ascent of [[magma]] from the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=791}} Such lineaments may be produced by tectonic stresses related to crustal spreading; this theory is supported by the geometry of the Hollister Ridge and the ages of its components. There may be some influence by the Louisville hotspot.{{sfn|Géli|Aslanian|Olivet|Vlastelic|1998|p=37}} [[Pliocene]] changes in the plate motion patterns of the region may have generated the lineaments.&lt;ref name="Peive2007" /&gt;
* One variation of the "lineament" theory posits that the ridge at first was built by magma ascending through crustal weaknesses; later material from the Louisville hotspot flowed south towards the Hollister Ridge and increasingly interacted with the lineament, thus influencing the composition of the ridge rocks.{{sfn|Vlastélic|Dosso|2005|p=12}} A change in [[lithospheric]] thickness across the Eltanin fracture zone would divert the mantle flow from the Louisville hotspot southward.{{sfn|Castillo|Natland|Niu|Lonsdale|1998|p=121}}

== Eruptive history ==

[[Argon-argon dating]] has yielded ages ranging from a mean age of 2.531 ± 0.036 million years ago for the western ridge{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=783}} over 0.487 ± 0.03 million years ago and 0.343 ± 0.008 million years ago for the eastern ridge to 91,000 ± 12,000 and 0 years ago for the central ridge. This implies that volcanism is still active{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=781}} at the central ridge, which is also the shallowest sector of the Hollister Ridge.{{sfn|Vlastelic|Dosso|Guillou|Bougault|1998|p=783}}

There is evidence of historical eruptions at the Hollister Ridge.{{sfn|Géli|Aslanian|Olivet|Vlastelic|1998|p=32}} Between 10 March 1991 and 12 June 1992 a strong [[acoustic swarm]] was recorded in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]] from several stations in [[French Polynesia]]{{sfn|Talandier|Okal|1996|p=1530}} and its source identified with a segment of the Hollister Ridge.{{sfn|Talandier|Okal|1996|p=1532}} [[Environmental noise|Anthropogenic]] and biological origins were considered unlikely sources for the swarm,{{sfn|Talandier|Okal|1996|p=1536}} and it is thus interpreted to be a volcanic swarm.&lt;ref name="GVP" /&gt; The acoustic swarm may have resulted from the interaction between seawater and a subaqueous [[lava lake]];{{sfn|Talandier|Okal|1996|p=1542}} the acoustic patterns are not consistent with a simple [[explosive eruption]].&lt;ref name="GVP" /&gt;

A '''kolk''' ('''colc''') is an underwater [[vortex]] created when rapidly rushing water passes an underwater obstacle in boundary areas of high shear. High-velocity gradients produce a violently rotating column of water, similar to a [[tornado]]. Kolks can pluck multiple-ton blocks of rock and transport them in suspension for thousands of metres. &lt;ref name="Alt" &gt;{{cite book

{{Anchor|Lakes}}
Kolks leave clear evidence in the form of plucked-bedrock pits, called [[rock-cut basin]]s or kolk lakes and downstream deposits of gravel-supported blocks that show percussion but no rounding.&lt;ref name="Alt" /&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Horumersiel Kolk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Kolk from the 1717 Christmas flood in [[Horumersiel]] with information board]]
Kolks were first identified by the Dutch, who observed kolks hoisting several-ton blocks of [[riprap]] from dikes and transport them away, suspended above the bottom.&lt;ref name="Alt" /&gt;  The [[Larrelt]] kolk near [[Emden]] appeared during the [[1717 Christmas flood]] which broke through a long section of the dyke. The newly formed waterbody measured roughly 500 × 100&amp;nbsp;m and was 25&amp;nbsp;m deep. In spite of the repair to the dyke,  another breach occurred in 1721, which produced more kolks between 15 and 18&amp;nbsp;m deep. In 1825 during the [[February flood of 1825|February flood]] near Emden, a kolk of 31&amp;nbsp;m depth was created. The soil was saturated from here for a further 5&amp;nbsp;km inland.

Kolks are credited with creating the pothole-like features in the highly jointed basalts in the [[channeled scablands]] of the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] region in [[Eastern Washington]]. Depressions were scoured out within the scablands that resemble virtually circular steep-sided potholes.&lt;ref name="Bjornstad" /&gt; Examples from the [[Missoula flood]]s in this area include:&lt;ref name="Alt" /&gt; 
* The region below [[Dry Falls]] includes a number of lakes scoured out by kolks. 
* [[Sprague Lake (eastern Washington)|Sprague Lake]] is a kolk-formed basin created by a flow estimated to be 8 miles wide and 200 feet deep. 
* The Alberton Narrows on the [[Clark Fork River]] show evidence that kolks plucked boulders from the canyon and deposited them in a rock and gravel bar immediately downstream of the canyon. 
* The south wall of [[Hellgate Canyon (Montana)|Hellgate Canyon]] in [[Montana]] shows the rough-plucked surface characteristic of kolk-eroded rock. 
* Both the walls of the [[Wallula Gap]] and the [[Columbia River Gorge]] also show the rough-plucked surfaces characteristic of kolk-eroded rock.
* [[Oswego Lake]], in the middle of [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]] (a [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] suburb), was an abandoned channel of the [[Tualatin River]] that was scoured by a kolk

The '''list of marine animals of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay''' is a list of [[Marine biology|marine]] and shore-based [[species]] that form a part of the [[fauna of South Africa]]. This list includes animals which either live entirely marine lives, or which spend critical parts of their lives at sea.

The geographical range is from [[Table Bay]] to [[Cape Hangklip]], in the [[Western Cape]] province of South Africa and includes the [[Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area]]&lt;ref name="TMNP" &gt;http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/conservation/marine.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Helderberg Marine Protected Area]].

==Africa==
*[[Apies River|Apies]]: from [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] meaning "little apes".

*[[Blood River|Blood]]: from the [[Battle of Blood River]], where 600 [[voortrekkers]] fought off 20,000 attacking Zulu troops. No voortrekkers were killed, but the dead Zulus (3,000 died) stained the nearby river with blood, and so the name stayed.
*[[Breede River|Breede]]: from [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] meaning "wide".
*[[Escravos River|Escravos]]: from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] meaning "slaves".
*[[Forcados River|Forcados]]: from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] meaning "forked".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">This is a list of the species that inhabit the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]].  Except for researchers and volunteers living on [[Midway Atoll]],  [[Kure Atoll]], and [[Tern Island (Hawaii)|Tern Island]], the leeward islands are uninhabited by people but home to at least 7000 species ranging from marine mammals, fish, sea turtles, birds and invertebrates.  Many of these species  are rare or endangered and at least 25% are endemic to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.  This list identifies which islands the species lives on, and whether the species is endemic to the NWHI.

==History==
The Living Building Challenge was launched by the [http://cascadiagbc.org Cascadia Green Building Council] (a chapter of both the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and [[Canada Green Building Council]]). It was created by [[Jason F. McLennan]] and Bob Berkebile, of [[BNIM]]. McLennan brought the program to Cascadia when he became its CEO in 2006. The International Living Building Institute was created of and by Cascadia in May 2009 to oversee the Living Building Challenge and its auxiliary programs. In April 2011, the International Living Building Institute was renamed the International Living Future Institute (the Institute).

===International Living Future Institute===
The [http://living-future.org/ International Living Future Institute] is a non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to catalyzing a global transformation toward true sustainability.  The Institute seeks partnerships with leaders in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors in pursuit of a future that is socially just, culturally rich and ecologically restorative.

The Institute is the umbrella organization for the Living Building Challenge and the Cascadia Green Building Council, along with [[The Natural Step]] US and Ecotone Publishing.

==Performance areas==
Living Building Challenge comprises seven performance areas: site, water, energy, health, materials, equity and beauty. These are subdivided into a total of twenty Imperatives, each of which focuses on a specific sphere of influence:

Certification is based on actual, rather than modeled or anticipated, performance. Therefore, projects must be operational for at least 12 consecutive months prior to evaluation. To earn 'Living' status (full program certification), projects must meet all assigned Imperatives and have proven performance through at least 12 consecutive months of operation. To celebrate successes and to educate other efforts, project teams may earn Petal Recognition (partial program certification) by satisfying the requirements of a minimum of three categories, of which at least one must be water, energy or materials. The [http://ilbi.org/lbc/certified first Living Buildings&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;] were certified in October 2010, and by March 2013, only six had achieved certification.&lt;ref name=Hartman&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartman|first=Hattie|title=Twitter brings the Living Building Challenge to the UK|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/sustainability/twitter-brings-the-living-building-challenge-to-the-uk/8644157.article|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=Architects' Journal|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The targets are rigorous and set at the highest conceivable; every project must meet each of its 20 strict requirements to achieve the certification. This 'ceiling' is where far fewer than 1% of buildings assessed under BREEAM would fall and in excess of 'Outstanding' rating.&lt;ref name=Starrs /&gt;

Over 100 project teams (mainly in the US and Canada, but also one in New Zealand and another one in Ireland)&lt;ref name=Hartman /&gt; are pursuing the Challenge, most of which have officially registered with the Institute, including:

==Physical and chemical properties of magma ==
Most magmatic liquids are rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silicate melts are composed mainly of [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]]. The physical behaviours of melts depend upon their atomic structures as well as upon temperature and pressure and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, E. B.; Hochella, M. F. and Parsons, I. (editors), ''Glasses and Melts: Linking Geochemistry and Materials Science'', [http://www.elementsmagazine.org/ ''Elements'', volume 2, number 5, (October 2006)] pp. 259–297&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viscosity]] is a key melt property in understanding the behaviour of magmas. More silica-rich melts are typically more polymerized, with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and so are more viscous. Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less viscous.

Generally speaking, more [[mafic]] magmas, such as those that form [[basalt]], are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, such as those that form [[rhyolite]]. Low viscosity leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions.

===Temperature===
Temperatures of most magmas are in the range 700&amp;nbsp;°C to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C (or 1300&amp;nbsp;°F to 2400&amp;nbsp;°F), but very rare [[carbonatite]] magmas may be as  cool as 490&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="Weidendorfer2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weidendorfer|first1=D.|last2=Schmidt|first2=M.W.|last3=Mattsson|first3=H.B.|year=2017|title=A common origin of carbonatite magmas|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/45/6/507/207931/a-common-origin-of-carbonatite-magmas|journal=Geology|volume=45|issue=6|pages=507–510|doi=10.1130/G38801.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[komatiite]] magmas may have been as hot as 1600&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herzberg|first=C.|last2=Asimow|first2=P. D.|last3=Arndt|first3=N.|last4=Niu|first4=Y.|last5=Lesher|first5=C. M.|last6=Fitton|first6=J. G.|last7=Cheadle|first7=M. J.|last8=Saunders|first8=A.

Within the solid earth, the temperature of a rock is controlled by the [[geothermal gradient]] and the [[radioactive decay]] within the rock. The geothermal gradient averages about 25&amp;nbsp;°C/km with a wide range from a low of 5–10&amp;nbsp;°C/km within oceanic trenches and subduction zones to 30–80&amp;nbsp;°C/km under mid-ocean ridges and volcanic arc environments.

===Composition===
It is usually very difficult to change the bulk composition of a large mass of rock, so composition is the basic control on whether a rock will melt at any given temperature and pressure. The composition of a rock may also be considered to include ''volatile'' phases such as [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]].

The presence of volatile phases in a rock under pressure can stabilize a melt fraction. The presence of even 0.8% water may reduce the temperature of melting by as much as 100&amp;nbsp;°C. Conversely, the loss of water and volatiles from a magma may cause it to essentially freeze or solidify.

Also a major portion of almost all magma is [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], which is a compound of silicon and oxygen. Magma also contains gases, which expand as the magma rises. Magma that is high in silica resists flowing, so expanding gases are trapped in it. Pressure builds up until the gases blast out in a violent, dangerous explosion. Magma that is relatively poor in silica flows easily, so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently.

==Origins of magma by partial melting==

===Partial melting===
Melting of solid rocks to form magma is controlled by three physical parameters: temperature, pressure, and composition. The most common mechanisms of magma generation in the mantle are [[Igneous rock#Decompression|decompression melting]]&lt;ref&gt;Geological Society of America, ''Plates, Plumes, And Paradigms'', pp. 590 ff., 2005, {{ISBN|0-8137-2388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;, heating (e.g., by interaction with a hot [[mantle plume]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=I. H.|date=2005-12-01|title=Large Igneous Provinces and the Mantle Plume Hypothesis|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article-abstract/1/5/265/137587|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=265–269|doi=10.2113/gselements.1.5.265|issn=1811-5209}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and lowering of the [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] (e.g., by compositional changes such as the addition of water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asimow|first=P. D.|last2=Langmuir|first2=C. H.|date=2003|title=The importance of water to oceanic mantle melting regimes|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01429|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=421|issue=6925|pages=815–820|doi=10.1038/nature01429|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Mechanisms are discussed further in the entry for [[igneous rock]]. 

When rocks melt, they do so slowly and gradually because most rocks are made of several [[minerals]], which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex. As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes. When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faul|first=Ulrich H.|date=2001|title=Melt retention and segregation beneath mid-ocean ridges|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/35073556|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=410|issue=6831|pages=920–923|doi=10.1038/35073556|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melts can stay in place long enough to melt to 20% or even 35%, but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50%, because eventually the melted rock mass becomes a crystal-and-melt mush that can then ascend ''en masse'' as a [[diapir]], which may then cause further decompression melting.

===Geochemical implications of partial melting===
The degree of partial melting is critical for determining what type of magma is produced. The degree of partial melting required to form a melt can be estimated by considering the relative enrichment of incompatible elements versus compatible elements. [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|Incompatible elements]] commonly include [[potassium]], [[barium]], [[caesium]], and [[rubidium]].

Rock types produced by small degrees of partial melting in the [[Earth's mantle]] are typically alkaline ([[Calcium|Ca]], [[Sodium|Na]]), potassic ([[Potassium|K]]) and/or peralkaline (high aluminium to silica ratio). Typically, primitive melts of this composition form [[lamprophyre]], [[lamproite]], [[kimberlite]] and sometimes [[nepheline]]-bearing [[mafic]] rocks such as [[alkali basalt]]s and [[essexite]] gabbros or even [[carbonatite]].

[[Pegmatite]] may be produced by low degrees of partial melting of the crust. Some [[granite]]-composition magmas are [[eutectic]] (or cotectic) melts, and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust, as well as by [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]]. At high degrees of partial melting of the crust, [[granitoids]] such as [[tonalite]], [[granodiorite]] and [[monzonite]] can be produced, but other mechanisms are typically important in producing them.

==Evolution of magmas==

===Primary melts===
When a rock melts, the liquid is a ''primary melt''. Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In nature it is rare to find primary melts. The [[leucosomes]] of [[migmatite]]s are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived from the mantle are especially important, and are known as ''primitive melts'' or primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the mantle from which a melt was formed, which is important in understanding evolution of the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]].{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}

===Parental melts===
When it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful{{who said|date=September 2017}} to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of [[igneous differentiation]]. It need not be a primitive melt.

For instance, a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a ''parental melt''. Fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.

At high degrees of partial melting of the mantle, [[komatiite]] and [[picrite]] are produced.

==Migration and solidification of magmas==
Magma develops within the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] or [[Crust (geology)|crust]] where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state. After its formation, magma buoyantly rises toward the Earth's surface. As it migrates through the crust, magma may collect and reside in [[magma chamber]]s (though recent work suggests that magma may be stored in trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones rather than dominantly liquid magma chambers &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparks|first=R. Stephen J.|last2=Cashman|first2=Katharine V.|date=2017|title=Dynamic Magma Systems: Implications for Forecasting Volcanic Activity|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article-abstract/13/1/35/272242|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=35–40|doi=10.2113/gselements.13.1.35|issn=1811-5209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Magma can remain in a chamber until it cools and crystallizes forming igneous rock, it erupts as a [[volcano]], or moves into another magma chamber.There are two known processes by which magma changes: by crystallization within the crust or mantle to form a [[pluton]], or by [[volcanic eruption]] to become [[lava]] or [[tephra]]. 

=== Plutonism ===
When magma cools it begins to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming [[Cumulate rock|cumulates]] that might form mafic [[layered intrusion]]s. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of plutonic rocks such as [[gabbro]], [[diorite]] and [[granite]], depending upon the composition of the magma. Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms [[volcanic rock]]s such as [[basalt]], [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).

===Volcanism===
{{Main|Volcanism}}
During a volcanic eruption the magma that leaves the underground is called [[lava]]. Lava cools and solidifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma. This fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large, and a part of the melt does not crystallize at all, becoming glass. Rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include [[obsidian]], [[scoria]] and [[pumice]].

Before and during volcanic eruptions, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O partially leave the melt through a process known as [[exsolution]]. Magma with low water content becomes increasingly [[Viscosity|viscous]]. If massive exsolution occurs when magma heads upwards during a volcanic eruption, the resulting eruption is usually explosive.

==Magma usage for energy production==
The [[Iceland Deep Drilling Project]], while drilling several 5,000m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of Iceland, struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m in 2009. Because this was only the third time in recorded history that magma had been reached, IDDP decided to invest in the hole, naming it IDDP-1.

A cemented steel case was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36MW of power, making IDDP-1 the world’s first magma-enhanced geothermal system.&lt;ref name="Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03756505/49/supp/C|title=Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)|author=Wilfred Allan Elders, Guðmundur Ómar Friðleifsson and Bjarni Pálsson|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Altafjord01.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Altafjord]] in [[Alta, Norway]], bathed in the midnight sun.]]
[[Image:Midnight sun.jpg|thumb|300px|Midnight sun at the [[North Cape (Norway)|North Cape]] on the island of [[Magerøya]] in Norway]]

The '''midnight sun''' is a [[natural phenomenon]] that occurs in the summer months in places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] or south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. 

==Details==
Around the [[summer solstice]] (approximately 21 June in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and 22 December in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the closer towards either [[Geographical pole|pole]] one goes. Although approximately defined by the [[polar circle]]s, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90&amp;nbsp;km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year.

[[File:Midnight Sun.jpg|thumb|left|Midnight Sun seen from airplane while passing Greenland]]
Because there are no permanent human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle, apart from research stations, the countries and territories whose populations experience the midnight sun are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle: the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Northwest Territories]]; the nations of [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Russia]]; and the State of [[Alaska]] in the [[United States]]. A quarter of Finland's territory lies north of the Arctic Circle, and at the country's northernmost point the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer. In [[Svalbard|Svalbard, Norway]], the northernmost inhabited region of Europe, there is no sunset from approximately 19 April to 23 August. The extreme sites are the poles, where the sun can be continuously visible for half the year. The North Pole has midnight sun for 6 months from late March to late September.

The opposite phenomenon, [[polar night]], occurs in winter, when the sun stays below the [[horizon]] throughout the day.

Since the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth is considerable (approximately 23 degrees 27 minutes), the sun does not set at high latitudes in local summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/270568073/What-is-the-Midnight-Sun-Phenomenon|title=What is the Midnight Sun Phenomenon? {{!}} Earth Phenomena {{!}} Planetary Science|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sun remains continuously visible for one day during the summer solstice at the polar circle, for several weeks only {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} closer to the pole, and for six months at the pole. At extreme latitudes, the midnight sun is usually referred to as polar day.

At the poles themselves, the sun rises and sets only once each year on the [[equinox]]. During the six months that the sun is above the horizon, it spends the days continuously moving in circles around the observer, gradually spiralling higher and reaching its highest circuit of the sky at the summer solstice.

Because of [[atmospheric refraction]], and also because the sun is a disc rather than a point, the midnight sun may be experienced at latitudes slightly south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle, though not exceeding one degree (depending on local conditions). For example, Iceland is known for its midnight sun, even though most of it ([[Grímsey]] is the exception) is slightly south of the Arctic Circle. For the same reasons, the period of sunlight at the poles is slightly longer than six months. Even the northern extremities of [[Scotland]] (and places at similar latitudes, such as [[St. Petersburg]]) experience [[twilight]] throughout the night in the northern sky at around the summer solstice.

Observers at heights appreciably above sea level can experience extended periods of midnight sun as a result of the "dip" of the horizon viewed from altitude.

==Time zones and daylight saving time==
The term "midnight sun" refers to the consecutive 24-hour periods of sunlight experienced north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle. Other phenomena are sometimes referred to as "midnight sun", but they are caused by [[time zone]]s and the observance of [[daylight saving time]]. For instance, in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], which is south of the Arctic Circle, the sun sets at 12:47 am at the summer solstice. This is because Fairbanks is 51 minutes ahead of its idealized time zone (as most of the state is in one time zone) and Alaska observes daylight saving time. (Fairbanks is at about 147.72 degrees west, corresponding to UTC−9 hours 51 minutes, and is on UTC−9 in winter.) This means that [[solar culmination]] occurs at about 12:51 pm instead of at 12 noon.

If a precise moment for the genuine "midnight sun" is required, the observer's [[longitude]], the local [[civil time]] and the [[equation of time]] must be taken into account. The moment of the sun's closest approach to the horizon coincides with its passing due north at the observer's position, which occurs only approximately at midnight in general. Each degree of longitude east of the [[Greenwich meridian]] makes the vital moment exactly 4 minutes earlier than midnight as shown on the clock, while each hour that the local civil time is ahead of [[coordinated universal time]] (UTC, also known as GMT) makes the moment an hour later. These two effects must be added. Furthermore, the equation of time (which depends on the date) must be added: a positive value on a given date means that the sun is running slightly ahead of its average position, so the value must be subtracted.&lt;ref&gt;H. Spencer Jones, ''General Astronomy'' (Edward Arnold, London, 1922), Chapters I-III&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, at the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] of [[Norway]] at midnight on June 21/22, the longitude of 25.9 degrees east makes the moment 103.2 minutes earlier by clock time; but the local time, 2 hours ahead of GMT in the summer, makes it 120 minutes later by clock time. The equation of time at that date is -2.0 minutes. Therefore, the sun's lowest elevation occurs 120 - 103.2 + 2.0 minutes after midnight: at 00.19 Central European Summer time. On other nearby dates the only thing different is the equation of time, so this remains a reasonable estimate for a considerable period. The sun's altitude remains within half a degree of the minimum of about 5 degrees for about 45 minutes either side of this time.

==White nights==
{{Main article|White Night festivals}}

Locations where the sun remains less than 6 (or 7&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;) degrees below the horizon—above 60° 34’ (or 59° 34’) latitude south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle—experience midnight twilight instead of midnight sun, so that daytime activities, such as reading, are still possible without artificial light on a clear night.

White Nights&lt;!-- Should be capitalised in the same way that "Arctic Circle" and "Antarctic Circle" are, since "White Nights" refers to one item --&gt; have become a common symbol of [[Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg, Russia]], where they occur from about 11 June to 2 July,&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt; and the last 10 days of June are celebrated with cultural events known as the [[White Nights Festival]].

==Duration==
[[File:Midnight sun dates svatlas.png|thumb|250px|Map showing the dates of midnight sun at various latitudes (left) and the total number of nights.]]
Even though at the Arctic Circle the center of the sun is, per definition and without refraction by the atmosphere, only visible during one summer night, some part of the midnight sun is visible at the Arctic Circle from approximately 12 June until 1 July. This period extends as one travels north: At [[Cape Nordkinn|Cape Nordkinn, Norway]], the northernmost point of [[Continental Europe]], the midnight sun lasts approximately from 14 May to 29 July. On the [[Svalbard]] archipelago farther north, it lasts from 20 April to 22 August.&lt;ref&gt;Trygve B. Haugan, ed.

'''Natural refrigerants''' are natural substances that serve as [[refrigerant]]s in [[refrigeration]] systems (including [[refrigerator]]s, [[HVAC]], and [[air conditioning]]). They are alternatives to [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC), [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC) and [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) based refrigerants. Unlike other refrigerants, they are not synthetic chemicals and can sometimes be found in nature. They are not only used due to [[environmentally sustainable|environmental sustainability]] as some applications are better suited to a particular natural refrigerant.

HFC, HCFC, CFC classes of chemicals are all potent [[greenhouse gas]]es.  HCFC and CFC classes of chemicals are damaging to the [[ozone layer]], with CFCs being a primary culprit.  Natural refrigerants do not deplete the ozone layer and have a much lower impact on the environment. Though they may exist in nature, they are not entirely harmless or nontoxic but aside from ammonia are generally less harmful in the event of refrigerant release, although most are highly flammable.

[[File:Soliton de Peregrine.png|thumb|upright=1.8|3D view of the spatio-temporal evolution of a Peregrine soliton]]
The '''Peregrine [[soliton]]''' (or '''Peregrine [[breather]]''') is an [[analytic solution]] of the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref name="Peregrine"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Water waves, nonlinear Schrödinger equations and their solutions | first=D. H. | last=Peregrine | journal=J. Austral. Math. Soc. |series= B | volume=25 | year=1983 | pages=16–43 |doi= 10.1017/S0334270000003891 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution was proposed in 1983 by [[Howell Peregrine]], researcher at the mathematics department of the [[University of Bristol]].

== Main properties ==
Contrary to the usual fundamental [[soliton]] that can maintain its profile unchanged during propagation, the Peregrine soliton presents a double [[spatio-temporal pattern|spatio-temporal]] localization. Therefore, starting from a weak oscillation on a continuous background, the Peregrine soliton develops undergoing a progressive increase of its amplitude and a narrowing of its temporal duration. At the point of maximum compression, the amplitude is three times the level of the continuous background (and if one considers the intensity as it is relevant in optics, there is a factor 9 between the peak intensity and the surrounding background). After this point of maximal compression, the wave's amplitude decreases and its width increases and it finally vanishes.

These features of the Peregrine soliton are fully consistent with the quantitative criteria usually used in order to qualify a wave as a [[rogue wave]]. Therefore, the Peregrine soliton is an attractive hypothesis to explain the formation of those waves which have a high amplitude and may appear from nowhere and disappear without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shrira|first1=V.I. |last2= Geogjaev |first2= V.V. | year= 2009 |title= What makes the Peregrine soliton so special as a prototype of freak waves ?|journal= J. Eng. Math.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical expression ==

=== In the spatio-temporal domain ===
[[File:Peregrine soliton profile.png|thumb|upright 1.4|Spatial and temporal profiles of a Peregrine soliton obtained at the point of maximum compression]]
The Peregrine soliton is a solution of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation that can be written in normalized units as follows :

: &lt;math&gt;i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \tau} + \frac{1}{2}  \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \xi^2} + |\psi|^2 \psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; the spatial coordinate and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; the temporal coordinate. &lt;math&gt;\psi (\xi, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of a surface wave in deep water. The [[Dispersion relation|dispersion]] is anomalous and the nonlinearity is [[self-focusing]] (note that similar results could be obtained for a normally dispersive medium combined with a defocusing nonlinearity).

The Peregrine analytical expression is:&lt;ref name="Peregrine"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;  \psi (\xi, \tau) =  \left[ 1-\frac{4 (1 + 2 i \tau)}{1+4 \xi^2 + 4 \tau^2}  \right] e^{i \tau} &lt;/math&gt;

so that the temporal and spatial maxima are obtained for &lt;math&gt;\xi = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In the spectral domain ===
[[File:Evolution of the spectrum of a Peregrine soliton.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of the spectrum of the Peregrine soliton &lt;ref name="PLA Akhmediev"/&gt;]]
It is also possible to mathematically express the Peregrine soliton according to the spatial frequency &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="PLA Akhmediev"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Universal triangular spectra in parametrically-driven systems | author=Akhmediev, N., Ankiewicz, A. , Soto-Crespo, J.

&lt;math&gt;  \tilde{\psi} (\eta, \tau) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int{\psi (\xi, \tau) e^{i \eta \xi} d\xi} = \sqrt{2 \pi} e^{i \tau} \left[ \frac{1+2 i \tau}{\sqrt{1+4 \tau^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{|\eta|}{2} \sqrt{1+4 \tau^2}  \right) - \delta(\eta) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Dirac delta function]].

This corresponds to a [[Absolute value|modulus]] (with the constant continuous background here omitted) :
&lt;math&gt;  |\tilde{\psi} (\eta, \tau)| =  \sqrt{2 \pi}  \exp \left( -\frac{|\eta|}{2} \sqrt{1+4 \tau^2}  \right). &lt;/math&gt;

One can notice that for any given time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the modulus of the spectrum exhibits a typical triangular shape when plotted on a logarithmic scale. The broadest spectrum is obtained for &lt;math&gt;\tau = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the maximum of compression of the spatio-temporal nonlinear structure.

=== Different interpretations of the Peregrine soliton===
[[File:Peregrine soliton and other nonlinear solutions.png|thumb|Peregrine soliton and other nonlinear solutions]]

==== As a rational soliton ====
The Peregrine soliton is a first-order rational soliton.

==== As an Akhmediev breather ====
The Peregrine soliton can also be seen as the limiting case of  the space-periodic  Akhmediev [[breather]] when the period tends to infinity.&lt;ref name="NP Kibler"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kibler|first1=B. |last2= Fatome |first2= J. |last3= Finot |first3= C. | last4= Millot |first4= G. | last5= Dias |first5= F. | last6= Genty |first6= G. | last7= Akhmediev |first7= N. | last8= Dudley |first8= J.M. | year= 2010 |title= The Peregrine soliton in nonlinear fibre optics|journal= Nature Physics|doi= 10.1038/nphys1740 |volume= 6 |issue= 10 |pages= 790–795|bibcode = 2010NatPh...6..790K|citeseerx=10.1.1.222.8599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== As a Kuznetsov-Ma soliton ====

The Peregrine soliton can also be seen as the limiting case of  the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather when the period tends to infinity.

== Experimental demonstration ==

Mathematical predictions by H. Peregrine had initially been established in the domain of [[hydrodynamics]]. This is however very different from where the Peregrine soliton has been for the first time experimentally generated and characterized.

=== Generation in optics ===
[[File:Peregrine soliton in optics.png|thumb|upright|Record of the temporal profile of a Peregrine soliton in optics &lt;ref name="OL Hammani"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peregrine soliton generation and breakup in standard telecommunications fiber | first1=K. | last1=Hammani | first2=B. | last2=Kibler | first3=C. | last3=Finot |first4=P. | last4=Morin | first5=J. | last5= Fatome | first6= J.M. | last6=Dudley | first7= G. | last7 = Millot |journal=Optics Letters | volume= 36 | year= 2011 |pages= 112–114 |doi= 10.1364/OL.36.000112| issue=2| pmid=21263470 |bibcode = 2011OptL...36..112H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
]] 
In 2010, more than 25 years after the initial work of Peregrine, researchers took advantage of the analogy that can be drawn between hydrodynamics and optics in order to generate Peregrine solitons in [[optical fiber]]s.&lt;ref name="NP Kibler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peregrine's 'Soliton' observed at last | publisher= bris.ac.uk | url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2010/7184.html | accessdate = 2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the evolution of light in fiber optics and the evolution of surface waves in deep water are both modelled by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (note however that spatial and temporal variables have to be switched). Such an analogy has been exploited in the past in order to generate [[Soliton (optics)|optical solitons]] in optical fibers.

More precisely, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation can be written in the context of optical fibers under the following dimensional form :

&lt;math&gt;i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} - \frac{\beta_2}{2}  \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2 } + \gamma |\psi|^2 \psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with   &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; being the second order dispersion (supposed to be anomalous, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\beta_2 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; being the nonlinear Kerr coefficient.  &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are the propagation distance and the temporal coordinate respectively.

In this context, the Peregrine soliton has the following dimensional expression:&lt;ref name="OL Hammani"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\psi (z,t) = \sqrt{P_0} \left[ 1-\frac{4  \left( 1 + 2 i  \dfrac{z}{L_{NL}}  \right) }{1+4   \left( \dfrac{t}{T_0} \right) ^2 + 4   \left( \dfrac{z}{L_{NL}} \right) ^2}  \right] e^{ \dfrac{i z}{L_{NL}}}  &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;L_{NL}&lt;/math&gt; is a nonlinear length defined as &lt;math&gt;L_{NL} = \dfrac{1}{\gamma P_0}&lt;/math&gt; with  &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; being the power of the continuous background.  &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is a duration defined as  &lt;math&gt;T_0 = \sqrt{\beta_2  L_{NL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By using exclusively standard [[optical communication]] components, it has been shown that even with an approximate initial condition (in the case of this work, an initial sinosoidal beating), a profile very close to the ideal Peregrine soliton can be generated.&lt;ref name="OL Hammani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Erkintalo|first1=M. |last2= Genty|first2= G. | last3= Wetzel |first3= B. | last4= Dudley |first4= J.

Those substructures have also a profile close to a Peregrine soliton,&lt;ref name="OL Hammani"/&gt; which can be analytically explained using a [[Jean Gaston Darboux|Darboux]] transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Erkintalo|first1=M. |last2= Kibler|first2= B. | last3= Hammani|first3= K. | last4= Finot |first4= C. |  last5= Akhmediev |first5= N. |  last6= Dudley |first6= J.M.  |  last7= Genty |first7= G. |  year= 2011|title=  Higher-Order Modulation Instability in Nonlinear Fiber Optics |journal=  Physical Review Letters | volume=  107  |issue=25 | pages=  253901 |doi=  10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.253901 |bibcode = 2011PhRvL.107y3901E | pmid=22243074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[condensed matter physics]], '''quantum spin liquid''' is a [[states of matter|state]] that can be achieved in a system of interacting [[quantum spin]]s. The state is referred to as a "liquid" as it is a [[Order and disorder (physics)|disordered]] state in comparison to a [[ferromagnetic]] spin state,&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkins|first=Alasdair|title=A Strange New Quantum State of Matter: Spin Liquids|url=http://io9.com/5831111/a-strange-new-quantum-state-of-matter-spin-liquids|accessdate=23 December 2012|newspaper=io9|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; much in the way liquid water is in a disordered state compared to crystalline ice. However, unlike other disordered states, a quantum spin liquid state preserves its disorder to very low temperatures.&lt;ref name="balents10" /&gt;

The quantum spin liquid state was first proposed by physicist [[Phil W. Anderson|Phil Anderson]] in 1973 as the ground state for a system of spins on a [[triangular lattice]] that interact [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetically]] with their nearest neighbors; i.e. neighboring spins seek to be aligned in opposite directions.&lt;ref name="anderson73" /&gt; Quantum spin liquids generated further interest when in 1987 Anderson proposed a theory that described [[high temperature superconductivity]] in terms of a disordered spin-liquid state.&lt;ref name=mit-3-2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Trafton|first=Anne|title=A new spin on superconductivity?|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/quantum-spin-liquid-0329.html|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=MIT News|date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson87" /&gt;

A quantum spin liquid state was first discovered in cesium chlorocuprate Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a triangular lattice by Coldea's group in 2000.&lt;ref name="coldea2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coldea |first1=R. |last2=Tennant |first2=D.A. |last3=Tsvelik |first3=A.M. |last4=Tylczynski |first4=Z. |title=Experimental realization of a 2D fractional quantum spin liquid |journal=Phys.

A quantum spin liquid state in [[herbertsmithite]] ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was discovered in 2006 by Young Lee's group at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;J.S.

Another evidence of quantum spin liquid was observed in a 2-dimensional material in August 2015. The researchers of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], collaborating with physicists from the University of Cambridge, and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany, measured the first signatures of these fractional particles, known as [[Majorana fermion]]s, in a two-dimensional material with a structure similar to [[graphene]]. Their experimental results successfully matched with one of the main theoretical models for a quantum spin liquid, known as a [[Kitaev model]].&lt;ref name=phys-spin-liquid-apr16&gt;{{cite web|title=New state of matter detected in a two-dimensional material|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-04-state-two-dimensional-material.html|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are reported in the journal Nature Materials.&lt;ref name=namt4604&gt;{{cite web|title=Proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid behaviour in a honeycomb magnet|url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmat4604.html|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Several physical models have a disordered ground state that can be described as a quantum spin liquid.

===Frustrated magnetic moments===
[[File:Triangular ising spin.png|right|thumb|130px|Frustrated Ising spins on a triangle.]]
Localized spins are [[Geometrical frustration|frustrated]] if there exist competing exchange interactions that can not all be satisfied at the same time, leading to a large degeneracy of the system's ground state. A triangle of Ising spins (meaning the only possible orientations of the spins are "up" and "down"), which interact antiferromagnetically, is a simple example for frustration. In the ground state, two of the spins can be antiparallel but the third one cannot. This leads to an increase of possible orientations (six in this case) of the spins in the ground state, enhancing fluctuations and thus suppressing magnetic ordering.

Some frustrated materials with different lattice structures and their [[Curie temperature|Curie-Weiss temperature]] are listed in the table.&lt;ref name="balents10" /&gt; All of them are proposed spin liquid candidates.

===Resonating valence bonds (RVB)===
{{main|Resonating valence bond theory}}
[[File:Valence bond solid.png|right|thumb|Valence bond solid. The bonds form a specific pattern and consist of pairs of entangled spins.]]
To build a ground state without magnetic moment, valence bond states can be used, where two 
electron spins form a spin 0 singlet due to the antiferromagnetic interaction. If every spin 
in the system is bound like this, the state of the system as a whole has spin 0 too and is 
non-magnetic. The two spins forming the bond are [[Maximally entangled state|maximally entangled]], while not being 
entangled with the other spins.
If all spins are distributed to certain localized static bonds, this is called a '''valence bond solid''' (VBS).

There are two things that still distinguish a VBS from a spin liquid: First, by ordering the 
bonds in a certain way, the lattice symmetry is usually broken, which is not the case for a spin liquid. Second, this ground state lacks long-range entanglement. To achieve this, 
quantum mechanical fluctuations of the valence bonds must be allowed, leading to a ground 
state consisting of a superposition of many different partitionings of spins into valence 
bonds. If the partitionings are equally distributed (with the same quantum amplitude), there is no preference for any specific 
partitioning ("valence bond liquid"). This kind of ground state wavefunction 
was proposed by [[P. W. Anderson]] in 1973 as the ground state of spin liquids&lt;ref name="anderson73" /&gt; and is called a 
'''resonating valence bond''' (RVB) state. These states are of great theoretical interest as 
they are proposed to play a key role in high-temperature superconductor physics.&lt;ref name="anderson87" /&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Resonating_valence_bond1.png|One possible short-range pairing of spins in a RVB state.
File:Long_range_valence_bonds.png|Long-range pairing of spins.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Excitations====
[[File:Spinon moving.png|right|thumb|130px|Spinon moving in spin liquids.]]
The valence bonds do not have to be formed by nearest neighbors only and their distributions 
may vary in different materials. Ground states with large contributions of long range 
valence bonds have more low-energy spin excitations, as those valence bonds are easier to 
break up. On breaking, they form two free spins. Other excitations rearrange the valence bonds, leading to low-energy excitations even for short-range bonds.
Very special about spin liquids is, that they support '''exotic excitations''', meaning 
excitations with fractional quantum numbers. A prominent example is the excitation of 
[[spinon]]s which are neutral in charge and carry spin &lt;math&gt; S= 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.
In spin liquids, a spinon is created if one spin is not paired in a valence bond. It can move by rearranging nearby valence bonds at low energy cost.

====Realizations of (stable) RVB states====
The first discussion of the RVB state on square lattice using the RVB picture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kivelson | first1 = Steven A. | last2 = Rokhsar | first2 = Daniel S. | last3 = Sethna | first3 = James P. | date = 1987 | title = Topology of the resonating valence-bond state: Solitons and high-Tc superconductivity

The constructed RVB state is an equal amplitude superposition of all the nearest-neighbour bond configurations. Such a RVB state is believed to contain emergent gapless &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; gauge field which may confine the spinons etc. So the equal-amplitude nearest-neighbour RVB state on square lattice is unstable and does not corresponds to a quantum spin phase. It may describe a critical phase transition point between two stable phases. A version of RVB state which is stable and contains deconfined spinons is the chiral spin state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalmeyer | first1 = V. | last2 = Laughlin | first2 = R.

Both chiral spin state and Z2 spin liquid state have long RVB bonds that connect the same sub-lattice. 
In chiral spin state, different bond configurations can have complex amplitudes, while
in Z2 spin liquid state, different bond configurations only have real amplitudes.
The RVB state on triangle lattice also realizes the Z2 spin liquid,&lt;ref&gt;R. Moessner, S. L. Sondhi, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' 86, 1881 (2001); arXiv:cond-mat/0205029&lt;/ref&gt; where
different bond configurations only have real amplitudes. The toric code model is yet another realization of 
Z2 spin liquid (and [[Z2 topological order]]) that explicitly breaks the spin rotation symmetry and is exactly soluble.&lt;ref&gt;A. Yu. Kitaev, ''Annals of Physics'', 303, 2 (2003); arXiv:quant-ph/9707021&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification in Experiments==
Since there is no single experimental feature which identifies a material as a spin liquid, several  experiments have to be conducted to gain information on different properties which characterize a spin liquid. An indication is given by a large value of the '''frustration parameter''' &lt;math&gt;f &gt; 100&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as

&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{|\Theta_{cw}|}{T_{c}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Theta_{cw}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Curie temperature|Curie-Weiss temperature]] and &lt;math&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature below which magnetic order begins to develop.

One of the most direct evidence for absence of magnetic ordering give [[NMR]] or [[µSR]] experiments. If there is a local magnetic field present, the nuclear or muon spin would be affected which can be measured. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-[[NMR]] measurements &lt;ref name="shimizu03" /&gt; on κ-(BEDT-TTF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have shown no sign of magnetic ordering down to 32&amp;nbsp;mK, which is four orders of magnitude smaller than the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|coupling constant]] J≈250&amp;nbsp;K&lt;ref&gt;In literature, the value of J is commonly given in units of temperature (&lt;math&gt;J/k_{B}&lt;/math&gt;) instead of energy.&lt;/ref&gt; between neighboring spins in this compound.
Further investigations include:
* '''Specific heat measurements''' give information about the low-energy density of states, which can be compared to theoretical models.
* '''Thermal transport measurements''' can determine if excitations are localized or itinerant.
* '''Neutron scattering''' gives information about the nature of excitations and correlations (e.g. [[spinon]]s).
* '''Reflectance measurements''' can uncover [[spinon]]s, which couple via emergent gauge fields to the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a power-law optical conductivity.&lt;ref name="ng07" /&gt;

===Observation of fractionalization===
In 2012, Young Lee and his collaborators at MIT and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] artificially developed a crystal of [[herbertsmithite]], a crystal with [[kagome lattice]] ordering, on which they were able to perform [[neutron scattering]] experiments.&lt;ref name=extremetech&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=MIT discovers a new state of matter, a new kind of magnetism|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/143782-mit-discovers-a-new-state-of-matter-a-new-kind-of-magnetism|website=Extremetech|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier neutron scattering studies on powder samples had already reported evidence for gapless spinons in [[herbertsmithite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Vries|first=M.

==Strongly correlated quantum spin liquid==
''Strongly correlated quantum spin liquid'' (''SCQSL'') is a specific realization of a possible quantum spin liquid (QSL)&lt;ref name=balents10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mend /&gt;  representing a new type of strongly correlated electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] (SCI) that possesses properties of  [[heavy fermion]] metals&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt;&lt;ref name=loh /&gt;  with one exception: it resists the flow of electric charge. At low temperatures T the [[specific heat]] of this type of insulator is proportional to T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; with n less or equal 1  rather than n=3, as it should be in the case of a conventional insulator when the [[heat capacity]] is proportional to T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. When a magnetic field B is applied to SCI the specific heat depends strongly on B, contrary to conventional insulators. There are a few candidates of SCI; the most promising  among them is [[Herbertsmithite]], a [[mineral]] with chemical structure ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Specific properties===
[[File:Herb4.png|right|thumb|250px|Fig. 1: T-dependence of the electronic specific heat C/T of [[Ytterbium dirhodium disilicide|YbRh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] at different magnetic fields &lt;ref name=steg /&gt; as shown in the legend. The values of (C/T)&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; at B=8 Tesla are shown. The maximum (C/T)&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; decreases with growing magnetic field B, while T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; shifts to higher T reaching 14 K at B=18 Tesla. Observing that C/T~χ~M*, one concludes that SCQSL in ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shown in Fig. 2 exhibits the similar behavior as heavy fermions in YbRh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
[[File:Magnetic susceptibility of a function of temperature vs magnetic field - Herbertsmithite.png|right|thumb|250px|Fig.2: T-dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ at different magnetic fields for ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=herb4 /&gt; The values of χ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; at B=7 Tesla are shown. T-dependence T&lt;sup&gt;(-2/3)&lt;/sup&gt; at B=0 is depicted by the solid curve. The maximum χ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;(T) decreases as magnetic field B grows, while T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;(B) shifts to higher T reaching 15 K at B=14 Tesla. Observing that χ~C/T~M*, one concludes that the specific heat of YbRh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shown in Fig. 1 exhibits the similar behavior as χ does. Thus, SCQSL in ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; behaves as heavy fermions in YbRh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=prbr /&gt;]]

Exotic SCQSL's are formed with such hypothetical particles as fermionic  [[spinon]]s carrying spin 1/2  and no charge.  The experimental studies of [[Herbertsmithite]] ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single [[crystal]] have found no evidence of long range magnetic order or spin freezing indicating that Herbertsmithite  is the promising system to investigate SCQSL.  The planes of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can be considered as two-dimensional layers with negligible magnetic interactions along the third dimension. Experiments have found neither long range magnetic order nor glassy spin freezing down to temperature 50 mK&lt;ref name=herb4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=herb1 /&gt; making Herbertsmithite the best candidate for QSL realization. [[Geometrical frustration|Frustration]] of a simple [[kagome lattice]] leads to dispersionless topologically protected flat bands.&lt;ref name=green /&gt;&lt;ref name=vol /&gt; In that case  fermion condensation [[quantum phase transition]] (FCQPT)&lt;ref name=pr /&gt;  can be considered as [[quantum critical point]]  (QCP) of  Herbertsmithite. FCQPT creates SCQSL composed of chargeless fermions with spin=1/2 occupying the corresponding Fermi sphere with a finite [[Fermi momentum]]. Herbertsmithite's  thermodynamic and relaxation properties are similar to those of  heavy fermion metals and two-dimensional &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He.&lt;ref name=pr /&gt; The key features of the findings are the presence in Herbertsmithite of [[spin–charge separation]] and SCQSL formed with itinerant  spinons.  Herbertsmithite represents a fascinating example of SCI where particles-spinons, non-existing as free,  replace the initial particles appearing in the Hamiltonian and define the thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures. Because of the [[spin-charge separation]], [[heat transport]], thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures of the SCI Herbertsmithite are similar to those of heavy-fermion metals rather than of insulators.&lt;ref name=prbr /&gt;&lt;ref name=epl /&gt;

===Fermion condensation quantum phase transition===
The experimental facts collected on heavy fermion   (HF) metals and two dimensional &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He demonstrate that the [[quasiparticle]] [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]  M* is very large, or even diverges.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt;&lt;ref name=loh /&gt;&lt;ref name=col /&gt; Fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) preserves quasiparticles and is directly related to the unlimited growth of the effective mass M*.&lt;ref name=pr /&gt;  Near FCQPT, M* starts to depend on temperature T, density ''x'', magnetic field B and other external parameters such as pressure  P etc. In contrast to the [[Landau]] paradigm based on the assumption that the effective mass is constant, in the FCQPT theory the effective mass of new quasiparticles strongly depends on T, ''x'', B etc. Therefore, to agree/explain with the numerous experimental facts, extended quasiparticles paradigm based on FCQPT has to be introduced. The main point here is that the well-defined quasiparticles determine the [[thermodynamic]], [[relaxation (physics)|relaxation]], [[Multidimensional scaling|scaling]]  and [[transport]] properties of strongly correlated Fermi-systems and M* becomes a function of T, ''x'', B, P etc.
The data collected for very different strongly correlated Fermi systems demonstrate  universal scaling behavior; in other words distinct materials with strongly correlated fermions unexpectedly turn out to be uniform.&lt;ref name=pr /&gt;

===Identification in Experiments===
Quantum spin liquid - the new state of matter - is realized in Herbertsmithite, ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OD)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; Magnetic response of this material displays scaling relation in both the bulk ac [[Electric susceptibility|susceptibility]] and the low energy dynamic susceptibility, with the low temperature heat capacity strongly depending on magnetic field.&lt;ref name=herb4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=devries /&gt; This scaling is seen  in certain quantum [[antiferromagnets]] and heavy-fermion metals as a signature of proximity to a quantum critical point.  The low-temperature specific heat follows the linear temperature dependence.&lt;ref name=herb4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=devries /&gt; These results suggest that a SCQSL state with essentially gapless excitations is realized in Herbertsmithite.&lt;ref name=prbr /&gt;&lt;ref name=epl /&gt;

In 2016, two different groups reported the observation of characteristic features matching a quantum spin liquid in two different materials - first in &amp;alpha;-RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid producing [[Majorana fermion]]s,&lt;ref name=namt4604 /&gt; and then in Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a frustrated [[Kagome lattice|Kagome]] bilayer magnet.&lt;ref name=nphys3826&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical realization of a quantum spin liquid based on a complex frustration mechanism|url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys3826.html|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Quartz fiber is made from heating quartz rods with a oxyhydrogen flame. Then, filaments are drawn out of the quartz rod, creating quartz fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkcMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=quartz+fiber+f+by+heating+quartz+crystals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitlYmamvvZAhWjh1QKHWSxANIQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=quartz%20fiber%20made%20by%20heating%20quartz%20crystals&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Composites|last=Peters|first=S.

== Properties ==
A single quartz fiber can have a [[tensile strength]] of {{Convert|800|ksi|MPa|lk=on}}. Quartz fibers are chemically stable as they are not affected by [[Halogen|halogens]] (for the most part). Quartz fibers also have a higher thermal resistance than [[S-glass]] or [[E-glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnM6ctnpiwgC&amp;pg=SA2-PA21&amp;dq=Quartz+fiber+properties&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbt-3riYDaAhUE9GMKHU6iD6QQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quartz%20fiber%20properties&amp;f=false|title=Composite Materials Handbook-MIL 17: Materials Usage, Design, and Analysis|last=Defense|first=Us Dept Of|date=1999-06-18|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566768283|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in accordance with the provisions of Operating Code no. 8 (OC8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/239FFD8A-4E3A-4A1F-BE38-5DA6FD347ACE/35202/GC_OC8_GoActive.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606034645/http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/239FFD8A-4E3A-4A1F-BE38-5DA6FD347ACE/35202/GC_OC8_GoActive.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a High Voltage electrical boundary occurs, for instance between a [[power station]] and electrical utility, the safety controllers each side of the boundary must co-ordinate their activities. For the [[Electric power transmission|electrical transmission system]] in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], the [[Ofgem]]-defined industry standard document OC8 of the [[Grid code]] defines how safety precautions can be managed with the Rambunctious Inuit Sex Slave Party (RISSP) independently from the safety rules of the connected parties. The purpose of the RISSP is to guarantee that safety precautions provided by a third-party can be quoted in a ''safety document'' so that work can take place.

==Identifying number==
The RISSP form must have a uniquely identifying number, provided by the party requesting safety precautions.  In order to achieve this, all parties who have a connection to the national grid are required to have a RISSP prefix code.  These are, in general, abbreviations of the company name at the time it applied for its code.  All RISSPs have the suffix 'R'. The requester states the location and equipment for which the RISSP is required.  The implementer then states the location and nature of the precautions provided in order to achieve adequate safety for the named equipment.

==Cascading RISSP==
Some interfaces may include more than 2 parties, for instance on substation busbars (BB).
This may require one request via a party on the BB to go via the BB controller to the other parties.  It is then for the BB controller to obtain all required safety from other parties in order to cascade on to the initial requesting controller.  This is sometimes referred to as a ''cascading rissp''. 
Where a third-party making a request for safety precautions is in control of some of the other infeeds to an interface on which safety has been requested (such as a Distribution Network Operator who has more than 1 circuit on a BB, but is requesting safety for just one of those circuits) it is up to the requester themselves to control the linked safety precautions to ensure that safety from the interface.  This is often referred to as ''linkage''.It is possible to have both linkage and cascading in a single job, requiring use of RISSP forms with multiple users.

==Multiple directions==
In addition it is possible for safety to be requested in multiple directions, which would result in controllers having both requesting and implementing RISSPs in force simultaneously.  These RISSPs may be cascading and/or linkage. It is not possible to have RISSPs going in multiple directions if HV testing is taking place across a boundary.  In these circumstances only a single safety document can be in force at any one time and any RISSPs in place can only be to ensure the safety precautions for this document.

==Control boundaries==
RISSPs do not have to be from one company to another, only one control boundary to another.  Thus two [[distribution network operator]]s (DNO) owned by the same parent company but with different geographical areas of responsibility will use RISSPs with each other.  Also, the boundary between a High Voltage controller and a Low Voltage controller can be controlled by the RISSP process.  This most commonly occurs with the fuses/links between an auxiliary transformer and a substation's 415 volt AC supplies.

==Authorisation==
RISSPs can only be agreed to and signed by a suitably authorised person.  Any company that is connected to the grid must have somebody authorised available or on call at all times. Where a controller is not available, a suitable [[military dolphin]] shall be utilised.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5918">{{short description|A gap that forms in a subducted oceanic plate when a mid-ocean ridge meets with a subduction zone and the ridge is subducted}}
In [[geology]], a '''slab window''' is a gap that forms in a [[subduction|subducted]] [[oceanic crust|oceanic plate]] when a [[mid-ocean ridge]] meets with a subduction zone and plate divergence at the ridge and convergence at the subduction zone  continue, causing the ridge to be subducted. &lt;ref name=thork&gt;Thorkelson, Derek J., 1996, Subduction of diverging plates and the principles of slab window formation, '' Tectonophysics'', v. 255, p. 47-63 &lt;/ref&gt; Formation of a slab window produces an area where the crust of the over-riding plate is lacking a rigid lithospheric mantle component and thus is exposed to hot asthenospheric mantle (for a diagram of this, see the link below). This produces anomalous thermal, chemical and physical effects in the mantle that can dramatically change the over-riding plate by interrupting the established tectonic and magmatic regimes.&lt;ref name=thork /&gt; In general, the data used to identify possible slab windows comes from [[seismic tomography]] and heat flow studies.&lt;ref name=vanWijk&gt;van Wijk, J.W., Govers, R., Furlong, K.P., 2001, Three-dimensional thermal modeling of the California upper mantle: a slab window vs. stalled slab, ''Earth and Planetary Letters'',  v. 186, p. 175-186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

As a slab window develops, the mantle in that region becomes increasingly hot and dry. The decrease in hydration causes arc volcanism to diminish or stop entirely, as magma production in subduction zones generally results from hydration of the mantle wedge due to de-watering of the subducting slab. Slab-window magmatism may then replace this melting, and can be produced by multiple processes, including increased temperatures, mantle circulation producing interaction of supra- and sub-slab mantle, partial melting of subducted slab edges and extension in the upper plate.&lt;ref name=thork /&gt; Mantle flowing upward through the slab window in order to compensate for the decreased lithospheric volume can also produce decompression melting. Slab window melts are distinguished from [[calc-alkaline]] subduction-related magmas by their different chemical compositions.
The increase in temperature caused by the presence of a slab window can also produce anomalous high temperature metamorphism in the region between the trench and the volcanic arc.&lt;ref name=groome&gt;Groome, Wesley G., Thorkelson, Derek J., 2009, The three-dimensional thermo-mechanical signature of ridge subduction and slab window migration: Tectonophysics v. 464, p. 70-83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geometry ==

The geometry of a slab window depends primarily on the angle the ridge intersects the subduction zone and the dip angle of the down-going plate. Other influential factors include the rates of divergence and subduction as well as heterogeneities found within specific systems.&lt;ref name=thork/&gt; 

There are two end-member scenarios in terms of the geometry of a slab window: the first is when the subducted ridge is perpendicular to the trench, producing a V-shaped window, and the second is when the ridge is parallel to the trench, causing a rectangular window to form.&lt;ref name=guill&gt; Guillaume, Benjamin et al. 2010, mantle flow and dynamic topography associated with slab window openings: Insights from laboratory models: Tectonophysics v. 496, p. 83-98 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

The [[North American Cordillera]] is a well-studied plate margin that provides a good example of the effects a slab window can have on an over-riding continental plate. Beginning in the [[Cenozoic]], the fragmentation of the [[Farallon Plate]] as it subducted caused slab windows to open that then generated anomalous features in the [[North American Plate]]. These effects include distinct fore-arc volcanism and extension in the plate which may be a contributing factor to the formation of the [[Basin and Range Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Thorkelson, Derek J., Taylor, Richard P., 1989, Cordilleran slab windows: Geology, v. 17, p. 833-836&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zandt, G., Humphreys, E., 2008, Toroidal mantle flow through the western U.S. slab window: Geology v. 36, p. 295-298, {{doi|10.1130/G24611A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northward younging{{clarify|date=July 2017}} of [[Pemberton Volcanic Belt|Pemberton Belt]] volcanism in southwestern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] was probably related to a northward moving slab window edge under North America 29&amp;nbsp;to 6.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North America|last1=Madson|first1=J.K.|last2=Thorkelson|first2=D.J.|last3=Friedman|first3=R.M.|last4=Marshall|first4=D.D.|year=2006|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|pages=11–34|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the fossil slab windows of the Cenozoic seen in North America, there are other regions along the [[Pacific Rim]]  (e.g. in California, Mexico, Costa Rica, Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula) that exhibit active ridge subduction producing slab windows.&lt;ref&gt; McCrory, P.A., Wilson, D.S., Stanley, R.G., 2009, Continuing evolution of the Pacific-Juan de Fuca-North America slab window system - A trench-ridge-transform example from the Pacific Rim: Tectonophysics v. 464, p. 30-42 &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''suppressor grid''' is a  grid used in a [[thermionic valve]] (also called [[vacuum tube]]) to suppress [[secondary emission]]. A suppressor grid is also called the antidynatron grid, as it helps to reduce the dynatron effect.

== Placement ==

In its simplest form, a suppressor grid, typically of coarse structure, is interposed between the [[screen grid]] and the [[anode]] ([[Plate electrode|plate]]) of a [[tetrode]], turning it into a [[pentode]].

== Electrical connection of grid ==

The suppressor grid is usually connected to the cathode and more often than not, this connection is made within the glass envelope. Because the grid is negatively charged relative to both the anode and the screen grid, it repels any secondary electrons back to the anode preventing them from contributing to the screen grid current, and to any [[negative resistance]] characteristic.

'''''Syrinx''''' is a public artwork by German-born [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Adolph Wolter]] located at the [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculpture | year=1993 | title=Syrinx (sculpture). | work=SOS | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!314194~!0#focus | accessdate= 6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

It is a [[bronze]] figure of [[Syrinx]] sitting on a [[limestone]] tree stump. Syrinx is nude, and her proper right knee is bent upwards to her chest with her other leg hanging over the side of the stump. She holds her hand to her ear, cupping it, "listening" to the music of the nearby sculpture of the [[satyr]] [[Pan (White)|''Pan'']], who plays a flute.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Information==

In 1923 [[Myra Reynolds Richards]] created ''Syrinx'' and ''Pan'' for installation at University Park at the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza. Eventually, both pieces were stolen, with ''Syrinx'' disappearing in 1959 and ''Pan'' being stolen in 1970.&lt;ref name="VisitIndy"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Syrinx | work=Attractions | publisher=Indianapolis Convention &amp; Visitors Association | url=http://visitindy.com/indianapolis-attractions-syrinx | accessdate=6 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318110233/http://visitindy.com/indianapolis-attractions-syrinx | archivedate=18 March 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parks department commissioned [[Adolph Wolter]] to replace the pieces, and in 1973 they were reinstalled in their current location in University Park at the Plaza.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">'''''The Volcano Disaster''''' (also called '''''Volcano: Nature Unleashed''''' or '''''Nature Unleashed: Volcano''''') is a 2005 Bulgarian direct-to-video film by [[First Look Studios]].

The film concerns a volcanologist who learns of an impending eruption at an Italian town and tries to warn the skeptic citizens. Unlike "traditional" disaster films, the eruption is predicted by supernatural rather than technological means. No [[seismometer]]s are seen in the entire film.

== Summary ==
The film is about a young [[volcanologist]] named Russell Woods ([[Chris William Martin]]). In trying to help a village, Woods fails to save his wife Dee from falling into a lava flow.

Three months later, in an attempt to bring back memories of his late wife, Woods moves to an Italian town where Dee was born. There, while exploring Dee's birthplace, Woods is angrily confronted by Sylvia ([[Antonella Elia]]), the local school principal and the bus driver he met earlier, for [[trespassing]]. When Woods explains the situation, Sylvia begins to accept him.

Woods is directed to Father Dominic, the leader of the local church, for Dee's records. He also meets an eccentric mute girl, Angela ([[Sara Malakul Lane]]), who follows him but runs.

It is later learned that Angela's father was killed in a mining accident, and both she and her mother were struck by lightning. Her mother was killed, and Angela was clinically dead but was miraculously revived 20 minutes later. Angela can draw but cannot talk or write.

When trying to learn about Angela, Woods is knocked out by Dominic and warned that Angela is "evil" that she communicates with the dead. However, Woods continues to pursue the truth, and learns that Angela's mother died the same day as Dee did.

Angela, at one point, tries to commit suicide but is rescued by Woods and Sylvia. Woods carries Angela to the hospital where she is revived and Dominic tries to perform an [[exorcism]] on her.

Woods eventually learns that Angela is trying to tell him of the unusual lunar cycles, and in the process, he learns about the impending eruption.

Dominic and the villagers are skeptical at first, but are convinced when the volcano begins erupting. Woods leads the townspeople's escape but Angela gets trapped. Right before Angela is rescued, she sees an [[apparitional experience|apparition]] of Dee, and they smile at each other and Dee's spirit somehow transports her safely out of the way of the lava making her appear right next to Woods.

Eventually, Dominic no longer treats Angela as evil, and Woods goes back to Dee's home where he carves his name into a tree below Dee's name and Angela tells him Dee will always be with him.

== Similarities with other films and criticism ==
Some viewers have noted the parallel between ''The Volcano Disaster'' and ''[[Dante's Peak]]'', while others have criticized that the film was too derivative of ''Dante's Peak''.

*In ''The Volcano Disaster'', Woods' wife dies after falling into a lava stream; in ''Dante's Peak'', Dalton's partner dies after being hit by a [[volcanic bomb]]
*In ''The Volcano Disaster'', Woods hugs Sylvia (who, like Dominic, is also an authority figure) at the end, suggesting that they may begin a romantic relationship; in ''Dante's Peak'', Dalton develops a romantic interest with the female mayor
*In both films, the protagonist deals with trying to convince a skeptical community of an impending eruption.

There is also a parallel with ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]''; in both films, the signs of volcanic activities is first found in a tunnel.

A '''thermal response test (TRT)''' is used to determine the thermal properties of the ground. There is no direct way to measure ground [[thermal conductivity]] and [[borehole]] [[thermal resistance]]. The TRT is vital for designing [[ground source heat pump]]s and [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) systems. A TRT is an indirect (in-situ) measurement method which is the simplest and most exact way to determine precise thermal properties (Gehlin 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epubl.ltu.se/1402-1544/2002/39/index-en.html|title=Simple search|website=epubl.ltu.se|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal response tests were first suggested by Mogensen (1983) at an international conference in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Mogensen P. 1983. Fluid to Duct Wall Heat Transfer in Duct System Heat Storage. Proc. Int. Conf. On Subsurface Heat Storage in Theory and Practice. Stockholm. Sweden, June 6–8, 1983. PP: 652-657.&lt;/ref&gt; Mogensen suggested a simple arrangement in which heat at constant power is injected into (or extracted from) a borehole while the borehole mean temperature is measured.

==Equipment==
The system consists of a [[borehole]], pipe system, [[circulator pump|circulation pump]], a chiller or heater with constant power rate, and continuous logging of the inlet and outlet temperatures of the flow. The equipment is normally contained within a single unit for ease of transport and efficient use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/thermal-response-testing/|title=Thermal Response Testing - Carbon Zero Consulting|work=Carbon Zero Consulting|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal response data (i.e. temperature development in the borehole at a certain energy injection/extraction) allows estimation of the effective thermal conductivity of the ground and the thermal resistance of the borehole.

==Recommendations==
In order to fulfil the TRT properly, the following recommendations should be considered (Gehlin, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;Gehlin S. 2002. Thermal Response Teast, Meathod Development and Evaluation. Doctoral Thesis 2002:39. [[Luleå University of Technology]]. [[Sweden]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sanner et al., 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Burkhard |last1=Sanner |first2=Göran |last2=Hellström |first3=Jeff |last3=Spitler |first4=Signhild |last4=Gehlin |date=April 2005 |title=Thermal Response Test – Current Status and World-Wide Application |conference=Proceedings World Geothermal Congress 2005 |citeseerx=10.1.1.702.2864 |url=https://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/2005/1436.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.ltu.se/staff/k/khamoh?l=en Kharseh] &lt;ref&gt;Kharseh, M.

Luleå University of Technology Luleå [http://pure.ltu.se/portal/files/3014977/Mohamad_Kharseh_LIC2009.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;):
* Use a power load as steady as possible,
* Monitor the development of the inlet and outlet temperature of the borehole,
* The duration of the test is a minimum of 50 hours.

Traditional response tests apply a constant heat flux to the pumped water, however the newer "constant temperature" method, which holds the outflow water at a constant temperature, has been shown to have many advantages, including shortening the test period and in improving the operating stability and test accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.10.007 |title=Thermal response test for ground source heat pump based on constant temperature and heat-flux methods |journal=Applied Thermal Engineering |volume=93 |pages=678–682 |year=2016 |last1=Yu |first1=Xiaohui |last2=Zhang |first2=Yufeng |last3=Deng |first3=Na |last4=Ma |first4=Hongting |last5=Dong |first5=Shengming }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Before the test is started, the undisturbed ground [[temperature]] must be determined. This can be measured in various ways: e.g., by temperature loggings of the borehole or by measuring the temperature of the circulated water through the borehole without heating over 20–30 minutes. The mean fluid temperature corresponds to the undisturbed mean temperature along the borehole. The next step is to switch on the heater and the monitoring system. During the test, the heat transfer into the ground surrounding the borehole is essentially radial and relatively constant along the borehole.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Vacuum energy''' is an underlying background [[energy]] that exists in [[space]] throughout the entire [[Universe]]. This behavior is codified in Heisenberg's [[Uncertainty principle#Energy–time uncertainty principle|energy–time uncertainty principle]]. Still, the exact effect of such fleeting bits of energy is difficult to quantify. The vacuum energy is a special case of [[zero-point energy]] that relates to the [[quantum vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American. 1997. FOLLOW-UP: What is the 'zero-point energy' (or 'vacuum energy') in quantum physics? Is it really possible that we could harness this energy? – Scientific American. [ONLINE] Available at: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/follow-up-what-is-the-zer/. [Accessed 27 September 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsolved|physics|Why does the [[zero-point energy]] of the vacuum not cause a large [[cosmological constant]]? What cancels it out?}}
The effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Lamb shift]], and are thought to influence the behavior of the Universe on [[Physical cosmology|cosmological scales]]. Using the upper limit of the [[cosmological constant]], the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]s) per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Carroll, Sr Research Associate – Physics, [[California Institute of Technology]], June 22, 2006[[C-SPAN]] broadcast of Cosmology at Yearly Kos Science Panel, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, in both [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and [[stochastic electrodynamics]] (SED), consistency with the principle of [[Lorentz covariance]] and with the magnitude of the [[Planck constant]] suggest a much larger value of 10&lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt; joules per cubic meter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Peter W. Milonni]] – "The Quantum Vacuum"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Pena and Cetto "The Quantum Dice: An Introduction to Stochastic Electrodynamics"&lt;/ref&gt; This huge discrepancy is known as the [[cosmological constant problem]].

==Origin==
[[Quantum field theory]] states that all fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] at each and every point in space{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. A field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field is like the displacement of a ball from its rest position. The theory requires "vibrations" in, or more accurately changes in the strength of, such a field to propagate as per the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball–spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, if the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. Thus, according to the theory, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure and all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The theory considers vacuum to implicitly have the same properties as a particle, such as [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], energy, and so on. According to the theory, most of these properties cancel out on average leaving the vacuum empty in the literal sense of the word. One important exception, however, is the vacuum energy or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy, or [[zero-point energy]] of such an oscillator to be:

&lt;math&gt;{E}  =\frac{1}{2} h \nu. &lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity.  To remove this infinity, one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable, much as the concept of [[potential energy]] has been treated in [[classical mechanics]] for centuries. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. In all practical calculations, this is how the infinity is handled.

Vacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of [[virtual particles]] (also known as vacuum fluctuations) which are created and destroyed out of the vacuum. These particles are always created out of the vacuum in particle–[[antiparticle]] pairs, which in most cases shortly annihilate each other and disappear. However, these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before disappearing, a process which can be mapped using [[Feynman diagrams]]. Note that this method of computing vacuum energy is mathematically equivalent to having a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point and, therefore, suffers the same renormalization problems.

Additional contributions to the vacuum energy come from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in [[quantum field theory]].

==Implications==
Vacuum energy has a number of consequences. In 1948, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]]s [[Hendrik Casimir|Hendrik B. G. Casimir]] and [[Dirk Polder]] predicted the existence of a tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due to [[resonance]]s in the vacuum energy in the space between them. This is now known as the [[Casimir effect]] and has since been extensively experimentally verified. It is therefore believed that the vacuum energy is "real" in the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such as electrons, magnetic fields, etc., are real. However, alternative explanations for the Casimir effect have since been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Jaffe: ''The Casimir Effect and the Quantum Vacuum''. In: ''Physical Review D''. Band 72, 2005 [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0503158]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other predictions are harder to verify. Vacuum fluctuations are always created as particle–antiparticle pairs. The creation of these virtual particles near the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] has been hypothesized by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] to be a mechanism for the eventual [[Hawking radiation|"evaporation" of black holes]].&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Don N. |date=1976 |title=Particle emission rates from a black hole: Massless particles from an uncharged, nonrotating hole |journal=Physical Review D |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=198–206 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.13.198 |bibcode = 1976PhRvD..13..198P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this, then the other particle becomes "real" and energy/mass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole. This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole's disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole (the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole, the more rapidly it evaporates) but could be on the order of [[Googol|10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;]] years for large solar-mass black holes.&lt;ref name="Page" /&gt;

The vacuum energy also has important consequences for [[physical cosmology]]. [[General relativity]] predicts that energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if the vacuum energy is "really there", it should exert a [[gravity|gravitational]] force. Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the [[cosmological constant]], which affects the [[expansion of the universe]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the special case of vacuum energy, [[general relativity]] stipulates that the gravitational field is proportional to {{nowrap|''ρ'' + 3''p''}} (where ''ρ'' is the mass–energy density, and ''p'' is the pressure). Quantum theory of the vacuum further stipulates that the pressure of the zero-state vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to ''ρ''.  Thus, the total is {{nowrap|1=''ρ'' + 3''p'' = ''ρ'' − 3''ρ'' = −2''ρ''}}, a negative value. If indeed the vacuum ground state has non-zero energy, the calculation implies a repulsive gravitational field, giving rise to [[Accelerating universe|acceleration of the expansion of the universe]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. However, the vacuum energy is mathematically infinite without [[renormalization]], which is based on the assumption that we can only measure energy in a relative sense, which is not true if we can observe it indirectly via the [[cosmological constant]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The existence of vacuum energy is also sometimes used as theoretical justification for the possibility of free-energy machines. It has been argued that due to the broken symmetry (in QED), free energy does not violate conservation of energy, since the laws of thermodynamics only apply to equilibrium systems.  However, consensus amongst physicists is that this is unknown as the nature of vacuum energy remains an unsolved problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/Personal/dabbott/publications/EDU_abbott1996.pdf IEEE Trans. Ed., 1996, p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is unaffected by the existence of vacuum energy.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  However, in [[Stochastic Electrodynamics]], the energy density is taken to be a classical random noise wave field which consists of real electromagnetic noise waves propagating isotropically in all directions.  The energy in such a wave field would seem to be accessible, e.g., with nothing more complicated than a [[directional coupler]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  The most obvious difficulty appears to be the spectral distribution of the energy, which compatibility with [[Lorentz invariance]] requires to take the form ''Kf''{{i sup|3}}, where ''K'' is a constant and ''f'' denotes frequency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Pena and Cetto "The Quantum Dice:  An Introduction to Stochastic Electrodynamics"&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that the energy and momentum flux in this wave field only becomes significant at extremely short wavelengths where directional coupler technology is currently lacking.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==History==
In 1934, [[Georges Lemaître]] used an unusual [[ideal gas|perfect-fluid]] [[equation of state]] to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy. In 1948, the [[Casimir effect]] provided an experimental method for a verification of the existence of vacuum energy; in 1955, however, [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] offered a different origin for the Casimir effect. In 1957, [[Tsung-Dao Lee|Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang|Yang]] proved the concepts of broken symmetry and [[parity violation]], for which they won the Nobel prize. In 1973, [[Edward Tryon]] proposed the [[zero-energy universe]] hypothesis: that the Universe may be a large-scale quantum-mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive [[mass]]–energy is balanced by negative gravitational [[potential energy]]. During the 1980s, there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by attempts at a [[Grand unification theory]] and to use observations of the Universe to confirm one or another version. However, the exact nature of the particles (or fields) that generate vacuum energy, with a density such as that required by inflation theory, remains a mystery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9020">'''Weather risk management''' is a type of [[risk management]] done by organizations to address potential financial losses caused by unusual weather.

==Overview==
Energy, agriculture, transportation, construction, municipalities, school districts, travel, food processors, retail sales and real estate are all examples of industries whose operations and profits can be significantly affected by the weather.  For example, unusually mild winters diminish consumer demand for heating and erode the profit margins for utility companies.  Unexpected weather events can cause significant financial losses. Weather information and forecasts utilized in risk management decision making is often referred to as [[meteorological intelligence]] and offered by companies such as [[Delphi Weather Analytics]].

The weather risk market makes it possible to manage the financial impact of weather through risk transfer instruments based on a defined weather element, such as temperature, rain, snow, wind, etc.  Weather risk management is a way for organizations to limit their financial exposure to disruptive weather events. By making a payment (a "premium") to a separate company that will assume the financial weather risk for them, an organization essentially is buying a type of insurance - the company assuming the risk will pay the buyer a pre-set amount of money which will correspond to the loss or cost increase caused by the disruptive weather.

Catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes are typically managed through traditional insurance contracts that pay based on indemnity loss.   Insurance is a heavily regulated industry with specific requirements and qualification criteria.  Due to the indemnity nature of insurance, actual loss must be proven to an insurance carrier before the payment can be processed.  In contrast, financial loss such as erosion of margin, portfolio loss or increased expenses usually do not qualify for insurance payouts.  Financial instruments such as derivative transactions can provide more flexible and customized risk management opportunities than the typical insurance contracts as they are priced and settled on the parameters of measured weather rather than the associated financial loss.

==Market participants==
A wide range of capital providers make markets in weather risk.  To date the weather risk management trading market is primarily made up of dedicated weather trading operations, such as Nephila Capital Ltd, [[Galileo Weather Risk Management Advisors LCC]], Swiss Re, RenRe, and [[Coriolis Capital]], who execute trade orders in weather or weather-contingent commodity trades, the trading desks of financial institutions and utilities, such as Susquahanna Energy and Aquila who hedge their own risk as well as speculative trades for a merchant portfolio, professional commodity traders, such as RJO and hedge and private equity funds such as Tudor Capital.  Transactions can be effected [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) or on commodity exchanges such as The [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME).  Still other operations, such as [[Storm Exchange|Storm Exchange, Inc]](Note: Storm Exchange is now defunct. and [[Weatherbill|WeatherBill]] (WeatherBill is no longer serving markets outside of Agriculture), privately held eWeatherRisk now provide corporate and municipal clients with the necessary financial context to gauge the impact of the weather on profit and loss before executing trades either OTC or through the CME.

==Regulation==
===United States===
In the US, the [[Commodity Exchange Act]], Section 5d establishes weather in a category of market exempt from Commission oversight.

Rule 36.2 defines those commodities that are eligible to trade on an exempt board of trade as commodities having:
#A nearly inexhaustible deliverable supply;
#A deliverable supply that is sufficiently large, and a cash market sufficiently liquid, to render any contract traded on the commodity highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation;
#No cash market.
The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] determined that weather indices are eligible to be traded on EBOTs by order dated May 30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@iodtefs/documents/file/deawiebots05-02.pdf |title=CFTC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917231534/http://cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@iodtefs/documents/file/deawiebots05-02.pdf |archivedate=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax treatment==
===Accounting for OTC weather derivatives as a hedge===
Companies that are subject to public disclosure to regulators or their shareholders must demonstrate that the purchase or a sale of a derivatives is true and fair hedge, not speculation. SFAS 133 and IAS provide guidelines on the steps that are required.  FAS 133 Accounting for [[Weather Derivatives]]: For U.S. accounting standards, Over-the-Counter (OTC) weather derivative transactions can generally get an exemption under derivatives &amp; hedging disclosure rules of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risklimited.net/fas133-summary.htm|title=FAS 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; section 10 for non-exchange contracts settled on climatic variables, although specific structures and applications have to be assessed for each company environment. All written non–exchanged–traded option–based [[weather derivatives]] contracts should be carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value reported in current earnings.

===Accounting for Exchange traded and speculative weather derivatives===
When they are standardized and traded on exchanges, weather derivatives will fall within the scope of SFAS 133. EITF Issue No 99–2 "Accounting for weather derivatives" provides guidance on accounting for weather derivatives that are not exchange–traded. Entities that enter into speculatives or trading non–exchange derivatives contracts should apply the intrinsic method.

The '''yaw drive''' is an important component of the horizontal axis [[wind turbine]]s' [[yaw system]]. To ensure the [[wind turbine]] is producing the maximal amount of [[Electric potential energy|electric energy]] at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for [[wind turbines]] with a horizontal axis rotor. The [[wind turbine]] is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the [[cosine]] of the yaw error).

== History ==
When the [[windmills]] of the 18th century included the feature of rotor orientation via the rotation of the [[nacelle]], an actuation mechanism able to provide that turning moment was necessary. Initially the [[windmills]] used ropes or chains extending from the nacelle to the ground in order to allow the rotation of the nacelle by means of human or animal power.

Another historical innovation was the [[windmill|fantail]]. This device was actually an auxiliary rotor equipped with plurality of blades and located [[Windward and leeward|downwind]] of the main rotor, behind the [[nacelle]] in a 90° (approximately) orientation to the main [[rotor sweep plane]]. In the event of change in wind direction the [[windmill|fantail]] would rotate thus transmitting its [[Power(physics)|mechanical power]] through a [[gearbox]] (and via a gear-rim-to-[[pinion]] mesh) to the tower of the [[windmill]]. The effect of the aforementioned transmission was the rotation of the [[nacelle]] towards the direction of the wind, where the [[windmill|fantail]] would not face the wind thus stop turning (i.e. the [[nacelle]] would stop to its new position).&lt;ref name=gasch&gt;Wind Power Plants, R. Gasch and J. Twele, Solarpraxis, {{ISBN|3-934595-23-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern yaw drives, even though electronically controlled and equipped with large [[electric motors]] and [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary gearboxes]] have great similarities to the old [[windmill]] concept. They still use a means of mechanical energy “production” (i.e. electric motor), a method to increase the [[torque]] (i.e. gearbox) and a gear-rim mounted on the fixed portion of the [[wind turbine]] and in constant mesh with the output [[gear]] of the said gearbox.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Types ==
The main categories of yaw drives are: 
* The [[Electric]] Yaw Drives: Commonly used in almost all [[Wind turbine|modern turbines]].
* The [[Hydraulic]] Yaw Drive: Hardly ever used anymore on modern [[wind turbines]].

== Components ==
[[Image:yaw.drive.schematic.svg|thumb|right|200px|Schematic representation of a typical yaw drive]]

=== Gearbox ===

The [[gearbox]] of the yaw drive is a very crucial component since it is required to handle very large [[torque|moments]] while requiring the minimal amount of [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] and perform reliably for the whole life-span of the [[wind turbine]] (approx. 20 years). Most of the yaw drive [[gearboxes]] have input to output ratios in the range of 2000:1 in order to produce the enormous turning [[torque|moments]] required for the rotation of the [[wind turbine]] [[nacelle]].

=== Gear rim and pinions ===
[[Image:gear.rim.with.yaw.drives.svg|thumb|right|200px|Schematic representation of a gear rim with [[gear|teeth]] on the inner side. The gear rim meshes with four yaw drive [[pinions]].]]
The gear-rim and the [[pinions]] of the yaw drives are the components that finally transmit the turning [[torque|moment]] from the yaw drives to the tower in order to turn the [[nacelle]] of the [[wind turbine]] around the tower axis (z axis). The main characteristics of the gear-rim are its big [[diameter]] (often larger than 2 m) and the orientation of its [[gear|teeth]].

The gear-rims with [[gear|teeth]] on the outer surface have the advantage of higher reduction ratios in combination with the [[pinions]] as well as reduced [[machining]] costs over the gear-rims with inner [[gear|teeth]]. On the other hand, the former configuration requires the yaw drives to be mounted far apart from each other thus increasing the wind turbine main frame dimensions and costs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Geology ==
[[File:Zealandia, topographic map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographic map of Zealandia]]
[[File:Ball's Pyramid2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.78|Most of Zealandia is underwater. [[Ball's Pyramid]], near [[Lord Howe Island]], is one place where it rises above sea level]]

Zealandia is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a [[Aulacogen|failed]] [[rift]], where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled [[graben]]. The ridges rise above the [[seabed|sea floor]] to heights of {{convert|1000|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with few rocky [[island]]s rising above [[sea level]]. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, and consequently they do not float as high above the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

About 25 million years ago, the southern part of Zealandia (on the [[Pacific Plate]]) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]). The resulting displacement by approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the [[Alpine Fault]] is evident in geological maps.&lt;ref name="UNCLOS map"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |title=Figure 4. Basement rocks of New Zealand |work=UNCLOS Article 76: The Land mass, continental shelf, and deep ocean floor: Accretion and suturing |accessdate=21 April 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142136/http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement along this plate boundary has also offset the New Caledonia Basin from its previous continuation through the [[Bounty Trough]].

Compression across the boundary has uplifted the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]], although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Farther north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the [[Coromandel Peninsula|Coromandel]] and [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]s. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Graben and more recently the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.

Volcanism on Zealandia has also taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during and after it [[rift]]ed away from the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest with respect to the underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia.

This volcanism is widespread across Zealandia but generally of low volume apart from the huge mid to late [[Miocene]] [[shield volcano]]es that developed the [[Banks Peninsula|Banks]] and [[Otago Peninsula]]s. In addition, it took place continually in numerous limited regions all through the [[Late Cretaceous]] and the [[Cenozoic]]. However, its causes are still in dispute. During the [[Miocene]], the northern section of Zealandia ([[Lord Howe Rise]]) might have slid over a stationary [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], forming the [[Lord Howe Seamount Chain]].

Zealandia is occasionally divided by scientists into two regions, North Zealandia (or Western Province) and South Zealandia (or Eastern Province), the latter of which contains most of the Median [[Batholith]] crust. These two features are separated by the [[Alpine Fault]] and [[Kermadec Trench]] and by the wedge-shaped [[Hikurangi Plateau]], and are moving separately to each other.&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt;

=== Classification as a continent ===
The case for Zealandia being a continent in its own right was argued by Nick Mortimer and Hamish Campbell in their book ''Zealandia: Our continent revealed'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt; citing geological and ecological evidence to support the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Yarwood, V. |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |series=Book Review |title=Zealandia: Our continent revealed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729235207/https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |archive-date=29 July 2017 |magazine=New Zealand Geographic |date=November–December 2014 |access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogeography ==
New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent, while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the [[Antarctic Flora]], including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], logs of a [[fossil]]ized [[forest]] closely related to modern [[Kauri]] and [[Norfolk Pine]] can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |title=Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |archive-date=17 October 2008 |access-date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were buried by volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by [[silica]] to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea.

During glacial periods, more of Zealandia becomes a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]] fauna, but [[Saint Bathans mammal|the discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw]] from the [[Miocene]] in the [[Otago]] region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand |last1=Campbell |first1=Hamish |author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=North Shore, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-14-302088-2 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political divisions ==
[[File:Zealandia EEZs.tif|thumb|right|[[Exclusive economic zone]] of New Zealand and continental shelf boundaries for much of Zealandia]]
