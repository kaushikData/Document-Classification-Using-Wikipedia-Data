[[image:British Museum Flood Tablet.jpg|right|thumb|The [[deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] tablet of the [[Gilgamesh epic]] in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. The historical Gilgamesh had died centuries earlier before his epic was recorded]]

&lt;!-- Note that per WP:DATE, years before 1700 BC should link to the relevant century. Thus wikifying any of these years will redirect to this page. Only wikify links to other centuries. --&gt;

*[[4.2 kiloyear event]] – a severe aridification event that probably lasted the entire 22nd century BC and caused the collapse of several Old World civilizations.
*[[23rd century BC|2217 BC]] – 2193 BC: [[Nomad|Nomadic]] invasions of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]].
*c. 2184 BC: Possible date for the death of [[pharaoh]] [[Pepi II Neferkare]], the longest reigning monarch of history with 94 years on the throne.

Another proposed date is c. 2160 BC with the end of the [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasty]].

*c. 2181 BC: start of the [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt]] with [[Menkare]].
*c. 2180 BC: [[Akkadian Empire]] fell under attack by the [[Guti (Mesopotamia)]], a mountain people from the northeast.

*2138 BC: [[Babylon]]: A [[solar eclipse]] on 9 May and a [[lunar eclipse]] on 24 May occurred and are believed to be the double eclipse that took place 23 years after the ascension of king [[Shulgi]] of [[Babylon]] by those holding to the [[long chronology]].
*c. 2125 BC – [[21st century BC|2055 BC]]: "Model of a house and garden, from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]". [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt]]. It is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]].
*2124 BC: [[Gudea]], the ruler ([[Ensí|ensi]]) of the city of [[Lagash]], died.
*c. 2120 BC: [[Votive statue]] of [[Gudea]] from [[Lagash]] ([[Iraq]]) was made. It is now in the [[Musée du Louvre]].
*2119 BC – 2113 BC: ([[middle chronology]]), [[Utu-hengal]], first king of the [[third dynasty of Ur]].
*2116 BC – 2110 BC: [[Uruk]]–[[Gutian dynasty of Sumer|Gutian]] war.
*2112 BC – 2095 BC: [[Sumer]]ian campaigns of [[Ur-Nammu]].

{{Millenniumbox|2}}

The '''second millennium''' was a period of time spanning the years AD 1001 to 2000 ([[11th century|11th]] to [[20th century|20th]] centuries).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The year 2000 is technically the last year of the 2nd millennium, however it is generally considered the first year of the [[3rd millennium]]. See more at [[century]] and [[millennium]].&lt;/ref&gt; It encompassed the [[high Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]] of the [[Old World]], followed by the [[Early Modern period]], characterized by the [[Wars of Religion]] in Europe, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Colonial era|colonial period]]. Its final two centuries coincide with [[Modern history]], characterized by [[industrialization]], the rise of [[nation state]]s, the rapid development of [[science]], widespread [[education]], and universal [[medical|health care]] and [[vaccination]]s in the [[Western world]].  The [[20th century]] saw increasing [[globalization]], most notably the two [[World Wars]] and the subsequent formation of the [[United Nations]].  20th-century technology includes [[powered flight]], [[television]] and [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor technology]], including [[integrated circuit]]s.  The term "[[Great Divergence]]" was coined to refer the unprecedented cultural and political ascent of the [[Western world]] in the second half of the millennium, emerging by the 18th century as the most powerful and wealthy [[Cultural globalization|world civilization]], having eclipsed [[Qing China]] and the [[Islamic World]].

[[World population]] has grown without precedent over the millennium, from 310 million in AD 1000 to about 6,000 million in AD 2000.
[[Doubling time]] was at first seven centuries (reaching 600 million in 1700), and during the final three centuries [[population growth]] accelerated extremely, growth rate peaking at 1.8% p.a.  in the second half of the 20th century. Unchecked globalization and [[population growth]] also caused  considerable social and environmental consequences, giving rise to [[extreme poverty]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and [[Extinction event|biotic crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/lists/mostrecent.htm |title=The Sixth Extinction – The Most Recent Extinctions |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218012125/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/lists/mostrecent.htm |archivedate=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar==
{{see|Year 2000 problem}}
The [[Julian calendar]] was used in Europe at the beginning of the millennium, and all countries that once used the Julian calendar had adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] by the end of it. For this reason, the end date of the 2nd millennium is usually calculated based on the Gregorian calendar, while the beginning date is based on the Julian calendar  (or occasionally the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]).

In 1999, there was some public debate as to whether the millennium should be taken to end on December 31, 1999, or December 31, 2000.
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] at the time argued there is no objective way of deciding this question.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1999), ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Associated Press reported that the third millennium began on 1 January  2001, but also reported that celebrations in the US were generally more subdued at the beginning of 2001, compared to the beginning of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many public celebrations for the end of the second millennium were held on December 31, 1999 – January 1, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Millennium FAQs – Frequently Asked Questions | work = When does the Millennium start? | publisher = Greenwich2000.ltd.uk | date = 2008-08-12 | url = http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/millennium-faq.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090112125450/http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/millennium-faq.htm| archivedate= 12 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;—with a few people marking the end of the millennium a year later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">'''Augustinus Rotundus''' ({{lang-pl|Augustyn Rotundus}}, {{lang-lt|Augustinas Rotundas}}, 1520–1582) was a Christian and [[Renaissance]] humanist, erudite, jurist, political writer, first historian and apologist of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Rotundus was [[vogt]] of [[Vilnius]], general secretary to the Grand Duke and King [[Sigismund II Augustus I|Sigismund Augustus]] and [[Starosta|elder]] of [[Stakliškės]]. After his [[nobilitation]] to the [[szlachta]], Rotundus adopted surname Mieleski, or Milewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.google.pl/books?id=8WxKAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=De+dignitate+ordinis+ecclesiastici+Regni+Poloniae&amp;dq=De+dignitate+ordinis+ecclesiastici+Regni+Poloniae&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;pgis=1 Zdzisław Czeszejko-Sochacki: Słownik biograficzny adwokatów polskich]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Herb Rola.jpg|right|150px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Rola coat of arms]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Vilnius university grand courtyard church st john.JPG|right|150px|thumb|Church of Saint John's - the Baptist and Evangelist]]
Rotundus was born in [[Wieluń]] around year 1520. His surname is supposed to be "Mieleski", although some researchers suggest that it was adopted later. ''Rotundus'' is translated nickname, probably inherited from his father – Mikołaj ({{lang-en|Nickolas}}) "Okrągły" ({{lang-la|Rotundus}}), who was a rich furrier in the city of Wieluń.

Rotundus studied in [[University of Wittenberg]] and [[Lubrański Academy]] in [[Poznań]], where he was suspected of writing a nasty lampoon about Poznań catholic chapter. Undoubtedly Rotundus was a passionate catholic after graduation and supported [[Hereditary monarchy]] and [[Execution movement]]. &lt;!-- "Zamoyskiites"? --&gt;

He arrived in [[Vilnius]], capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] on August 20, 1551.&lt;ref name='Jovaišas'&gt;{{lt icon}} Albinas Jovaišas, Augusto Rotundo Lietuvos valstybės vizija (Vision of Lithuanian State by Augustinus Rotundus). In "Šešioliktojo amžiaus raštija, Series: Senoji Lietuvos lteratūra vol.5, Vilnius 2000. {{ISBN|9986-9435-8-2}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited by [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] Sigismund Augustus as a legal advisor, and one who knew both Grand Duchy and [[Polish Crown|Crown's]] law. Assigned as vogt of Vilnius in 1552 (most probably suggested by city inhabitants), he became loyal citizen of Lithuania, and wrote several works on Lithuania's history and political polemic works defending Lithuania's rights. In 1558 he was appointed as [[Starosta|elder]] of [[Stakliškės]].&lt;ref name='Jovaišas2'&gt;Jovaišas, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was married to Sofia Montanówna, [[Italians|Italian]] by origin (she died after March 10, 1604). They had a son, Nickolas, who died in his infancy and two daughters: Regina and Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istorija.lt/lim/ragauskiene2000en.html Raimonda Ragauskienė and Aivas Ragauskas: Did Augustyn Rotundus Mieleski Have One Or Two Wives?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105638/http://www.istorija.lt/lim/ragauskiene2000en.html |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his work and achievements Rotundus was ennobled in 1568 by [[General Sejm|Sejm]] held in [[Grodno]]. He was awarded [[Rola coat of arms]]. 

Augustinus Rotundus died on March 20, 1582 and was buried in the church of Saint John's - the Baptist and Evangelist, in Vilnius.

== Ideas and works ==

Rotundus supported Lithuanian statehood against claims of the Polish Crown. He was progenitor of mythical deductions and his passion were [[szlachta|noble families]]. Rotundus contributed to the second and the third [[Statutes of Lithuania]]. He collaborated on these acts together with [[Peter Roisius]], [[Ostafi Wołłowicz]] and [[Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł]]. He personally translated the Second Statute into [[Latin]] and added his own study ''Epitome principum Lituaniae'' (Lithuanian Dukes Epitome) as a foreword. In this study Rotundus promoted the idea, that Lithuanians together with their Dukes have roots in the ancient [[Roman Empire]], from the [[myth]]ical house of [[Palemonids]]. Similar theories were raised by [[Jan Długosz]], but both were lacking evidences to support this theory. 

Rotundus was probably contributing to the second edition of the [[Lithuanian Chronicles]]. He claimed that Publius Libonus, Roman commander who fled from [[Julius Caesar]] and supposedly settled down in Lithuania, was ancestor of Lithuanian and [[Ruthenia]]n rulers. Supposedly the name of ''[[Livonia]]'' comes from ''Libonus''. In his opinion, this explained why Latin language was common in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and also served to support [[sarmatism]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qsBco40rMPcC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Augustyn+mieleski&amp;source=web&amp;ots=jFVVP4bxxA&amp;sig=uab6KDT2yvfm0hfY6d3ycJLAlIM&amp;hl=en  The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt; Rotundus was a close friend to other Vilnius renaissance scholars like physician [[Jan Antonin]] ({{lang-la|Joannes Antoninus}}) and a poet [[Klemens Janicki]] ({{lang-la|Clemens Ianicius}}), after the latter died, both published Ianicius artworks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoFks1eW75oC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=Augustinus+Rotundus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wIgeqNUnmW&amp;sig=u9BlUBHCKZPJdtr1ysvgkaFHJh8&amp;hl=en#PPA284 M1 Renaissance Culture in Poland: The Rise of Humanism]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1564 on personal request by [[Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł]] Rotundus  wrote ''Rozmowy Polaka z Litwinem'' (''Conversations of Pole with Lithuanian'') – a polemic work, where he defended Lithuania's dignity against insults by Polish author [[Stanisław Orzechowski]] in ''Quincunx'' (1554), "''...against disgraceful and mistaken Stanisławs Orzechowski writing, which innocent famous Lithuanian Duchy insulted...''". Although it is recognized as Rotundus personal work, after thorough analysis of the work Lithuanian historian [[Ingė Lukšaitė]] suggested that it was a collective work by several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} Lukšaitė, Ingė, Andrius Volanas XVI-XVIIa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">'''Beef rings''' are cooperative groups of six to twenty-four farms, with each member of the cooperative being required to supply one animal over the course of the summer to the cooperative for [[animal slaughter|slaughter]] they are either done locally on the farm or at a [[slaughterhouse]] at the member's expense. 

==Information==
Beef rings were common among [[North America]]n farmers who had no means for [[refrigeration]] of meat until the beginning of the 20th century. Although pigs were small enough that a smoked [[pork]] carcass could be consumed by a single farming family before the meat spoiled, the same was not true of [[cattle]], and smoked or salted beef was not popular in any case.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan&gt;{{cite book|title=Kill and Chill|author=Ian MacLachlan|pages=124|publisher=University of Toronto Press|date=2002|isbn13=9780802078322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining the slaughtered steer, the meat would be distributed among the members of the cooperative, providing them with a [[steak]], a [[roast beef|roast]], and a boiling [[joint]] each week.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan/&gt; By slaughtering each animal in sequence, the cooperative ensured that all members received fresh meat throughout the summer. Distributions were weighed, so that each member received a fair share of the meat.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmers "making Good"|author=Lyle Dick|pages=170|publisher=University of Calgary Press|date=2008|isbn13=9781552382417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beef rings died out for several reasons, including technological advances in refrigeration, greater economic prosperity for farmers, greater independence, and the ability of farmers to buy meat at butchers' shops rather than slaughter and store it themselves.&lt;ref name=Dick/&gt;

{{Numismatics}}
'''Byzantine currency''', money used in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] after the fall of the West, consisted of mainly two types of [[coin]]s: the [[gold]] [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] and a variety of clearly valued [[bronze]] coins. By the end of the empire the currency was issued only in silver [[stavraton|stavrata]] and minor copper coins with no gold issue.&lt;ref name="Berk2008Constantine XI" /&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Solidus-Justinian II-Christ b-sb1413.jpg|thumb|left|''Solidus'' of [[Justinian II]], second reign, after 705]]
Early Byzantine coins continue the late Roman conventions: on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] the head of the Emperor, now full face rather than in profile, and on the reverse, usually a Christian symbol such as the cross, or a Victory or an angel (the two tending to merge into one another). The gold coins of [[Justinian II]] departed from these stable conventions by putting a [[Depiction of Jesus|bust of Christ]] on the obverse,{{#tag:ref|The first [[Depiction of Jesus|portrait of Christ]] to appear on a coin may be on a [[Solidus (coin)|gold solidus]] of [[Marcian|Flavius Valerius Marcianus]], a senator who came to rule the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire from CE 450-457. The coin appears to depict [[Christ]] bestowing a blessing on the [[Emperor of the East]] and his Empress, [[Aelia Pulcheria]]. But such [[Depiction of Jesus|images of Christ]] were far from popular until many years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Edward | last=Banning | title=Byzantine Coins Led Way In Using Christ's Image | newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=18 April 1987 | page=C20}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} and a half or full-length portrait of the Emperor on the reverse.  These innovations incidentally had the effect of leading the Islamic [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], who had previously copied Byzantine styles but replacing Christian symbols with Islamic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive Islamic style, with only lettering on both sides.  This was then used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period.

[[File:ByzantineBronzes.jpeg|thumb|left|100px|Anastasius 40 ''nummi'' (''M'') and 5 ''nummi'' (''E'')]]

The type of Justinian II was revived after the end of [[Iconoclasm]], and with variations remained the norm until the end of the Empire.

In the 10th century, so-called "anonymous folles" were struck instead of the earlier coins depicting the emperor. The anonymous folles featured the bust of [[Jesus]] on the obverse and the inscription "XRISTUS/bASILEU/bASILE", which translates to "Christ, Emperor of Emperors"

Byzantine coins followed, and took to the furthest extreme, the tendency of precious metal coinage to get thinner and wider as time goes on. Late Byzantine gold coins became thin wafers that could be bent by hand.

The Byzantine coinage had a prestige that lasted until near the end of the Empire. European rulers, once they again started issuing their own coins, tended to follow a simplified version of Byzantine patterns, with full face ruler portraits on the obverse.

==Denominations==
The start of what is viewed as Byzantine currency by numismatics began with the [[monetary reform]] of [[Roman Emperor Anastasius I|Anastasius]] in 498, who reformed the late Roman Empire coinage system which consisted of the gold ''solidus'' and the bronze ''nummi''. The ''[[nummus]]'' was an extremely small bronze coin, at about 8–10&amp;nbsp;mm, weight of 0.56 g making it at 576 to the [[Roman pound]]&lt;ref name="Berk2008Justinian"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Story of Justinian | url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/currency/Justinian.htm | publisher=Tulane.edu | accessdate=8 May 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509144710/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/currency/Justinian.htm# | archive-date=9 May 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was inconvenient because a large number of them were required even for small transactions.

[[File:Half follis-Justinian I-sb0165.jpg|thumb|left|[[Justinian I]] half-follis, 20 ''[[nummus|nummi]]''. Note the ''K'' on the reverse.]]

New bronze coins, multiples of the ''nummus'' were introduced, such as the 40 ''nummi'' (also known as the ''[[follis]]''), 20 ''nummi'', 10 ''nummi'', and 5 ''nummi'' coins (other denominations were occasionally produced). The obverse (front) of these coins featured a highly stylized portrait of the emperor while the reverse (back) featured the value of the denomination represented according to the [[Greek numerals|Greek numbering system]] (M=40, K=20, I=10, E=5). Silver coins were rarely produced.

[[File:Miliaresion-Romanus III-sb1822.jpg|thumb|left|[[Romanus III]] ''miliaresion''.]]

The only regularly issued silver coin was the [[Hexagram (currency)|Hexagram]] first issued by [[Heraclius]] in 615 which lasted until the end of the 7th century,&lt;ref name="CNG2008Byzantine"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; minted in varying fineness with a weight generally between 7.5 and 8.5&amp;nbsp;grams. It was succeeded by the initially ceremonial ''[[miliaresion]]'' established by [[Leo III the Isaurian]] in ca. 720, which became standard issue from ca. 830 on and until the late 11th century, when it was discontinued after being severely debased. Small transactions were conducted with bronze coinage throughout this period.

The gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' or ''[[nomisma]]'' remained a standard of international commerce until the 11th century, when it began to be debased under successive emperors beginning in the 1030s under the emperor [[Romanus III|Romanos Argyros]] (1028&amp;ndash;1034). Until that time, the fineness of the gold remained consistent at about&amp;nbsp;0.955&amp;ndash;0.980.

[[File:Histamenon nomisma-Constantine VIII-sb1776.jpg|thumb|right|''Histamenon'' by [[Constantine VIII]].]]

The Byzantine monetary system changed during the 7th century when the 40 ''nummi'' (also known as the ''[[follis]]''), now significantly smaller, became the only bronze coin to be regularly issued. Although [[Justinian II]] (685&amp;ndash;695 and 705&amp;ndash;711) attempted a restoration of the ''follis'' size of [[Justinian I]], the ''follis'' continued to slowly decrease in size.

In the early 9th century, a three-fourths-weight solidus was issued in parallel with a full-weight solidus, both preserving the standard of fineness, under a failed plan to force the market to accept the underweight coins at the value of the full weight coins. The &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; weight coin was called a ''[[tetarteron]]'' (a [[Greek language|Greek]] comparative adjective, literally "fourth-er"), and the full weight solidus was called the ''[[histamenon]]''. The ''tetarteron'' was unpopular and was only sporadically reissued during the 10th century. The full weight solidus was struck at 72 to the Roman pound, roughly 4.48&amp;nbsp;grams in weight. There were also solidi of weight reduced by one ''siliqua'' issued for trade with the Near East. These reduced solidi, with a star both on obverse and reverse, weighed about 4.25 g.

The Byzantine solidus was valued in Western Europe, where it became known as the ''[[bezant]]'', a corruption of ''Byzantium''.  The term bezant then became the name for the heraldic symbol of a [[roundel]], tincture [[or (heraldry)|or]] - i.e. a gold disc.

==Alexius I reforms==
[[File:Hyperryron-Manuel I-sb1965.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manuel I Comnenus]] [[scyphate]] (cup-shaped) ''hyperpyron''.]]
Former money changer [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] (1034–41) assumed the throne of Byzantium in 1034 and began the slow process of debasing both the ''tetarteron nomisma'' and the ''histamenon nomisma''. The debasement was gradual at first, but then accelerated rapidly. about 21 carats (87.5% pure) during the reign of Constantine IX (1042–1055), 18 carats (75%) under Constantine X (1059–1067), 16 carats (66.7%) under Romanus IV (1068–1071), 14 carats (58%) under Michael VII (1071–1078), 8 carats (33%) under Nicephorus III (1078–1081) and 0 to 8 carats during the first eleven years of the reign of Alexius I (1081–1118). Under [[Alexius I Comnenus]] (1081&amp;ndash;1118) the debased solidus (''tetarteron'' and ''histamenon'') was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness (generally .900-.950) was established, commonly called the ''[[hyperpyron]]'' at 4.45 grs. The ''hyperpyron'' was slightly smaller than the solidus. 

It was introduced along with the electrum ''[[aspron trachy]]'' worth a third of a ''hyperpyron'' and about 25% gold and 75% silver, the [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] ''aspron trachy'' or ''[[stamenon]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/CoinExhibition/CaseI/Case1_16_17.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807042036/http://www.doaks.org/CoinExhibition/CaseI/Case1_16_17.html |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; valued at 48 to the hyperpyron and with 7% silver wash and the copper ''[[tetarteron]]'' and ''[[noummion]]'' worth 18 and 36 to the billon ''aspron trachy''.&lt;ref name="tulane1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/currency/Comnenian.htm |title=History 303: Comnenian and Palaeogian Ages |publisher=Tulane.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033108/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/currency/Comnenian.htm# |archive-date=5 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Andronicus II reforms==
[[File:ByzantineBillonTrachy.jpg|thumb|right|Billon trachy of [[Andronicus I]], 12th century]]
During [[Andronicus II]]'s reign he instituted a some new coinage based on the hyperpyron. They were the silver miliaresion or basilika at 12 to the hyperpyron and the billon politika at 96 per hyperpyron.&lt;ref name="tulane1"/&gt;
along with the copper assaria, tournesia and follara&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barber.org.uk/coins/byzantine3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008062706/http://www.barber.org.uk/coins/byzantine3.html |date=8 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''basilikon'' was a copy of the [[Sequin (coin)|Venetian ducat]] and circulated since 1304 for fifty years.&lt;ref name="Doaks2008Byzantinecoinage"&gt;{{cite web

The ''hyperpyron'' remained in regular issue and circulation until the 1350s, remaining in use thereafter only as a [[money of account]]. After 1400, Byzantine coinage became insignificant, as Italian money became the predominant circulating coinage.

These ''scyphate'' (cup-shaped) coins known as ''trachy'' were issued in both [[electrum]] (debased gold) and [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] (debased silver). The exact reason for such coins is not known, although it is usually theorized that they were shaped for easier stacking.

==Buying power==

It is possible to get some small snapshots in time, specific to region, culture and local inflation. The literary world is littered with references to prices from different time frames. A good portion of them may be inaccurate or tainted by translation. 

At Jerusalem in the sixth century a building worker received 1/20 of a solidus per day, that is 9 folles. 1/23 of a solidus was earned by a casual labourer at Alexandria in the early seventh century. A family’s vegetable allowance for one day cost 5 folles. A pound of fish 6 folles, a loaf of bread was 3 folles worth at a time of shortage.  The cheapest blanket was worth ¼ of a solidus, a second-hand cloak 1 solidus, and a donkey 3-4 solidi.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril. (1980) “Byzantium: the empire of New Rome”. Weidenfeld and Nicolson.

The '''Centre for History and Philosophy of Science''' is a research institution devoted to the historical and philosophical study of science and technology, based in the Department of [[Philosophy]], at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England. The Centre – previously known as the Division of History and Philosophy of Science, which was founded in 1956 – is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in the world. Throughout its history, the Centre has been home to many of the leading historians and philosophers of science who have shaped our understanding of scientific activity and how it shapes and is shaped by wider society.

==Early history and expansion==
The key figure in establishing history and philosophy of science (HPS) as a discipline at Leeds was the philosopher of science [[Stephen Toulmin]], who was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Leeds in 1954 and head of department in 1956. Whilst [[Thomas Kuhn]] is often seen as the founder of the modern field of history and philosophy of science, Toulmin had argued for an integration of philosophy of science and history of science some nine years before Kuhn published his famous work, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, ''Philosophy of Science: An Introduction'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;
After becoming head of the department of philosophy, Toulmin hired two young scholars who would subsequently become amongst the most important thinkers in history and philosophy of science: Jerry Ravetz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerryravetz.co.uk/ Jerry Ravetz], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and June Goodfield. Furthermore, physicist-turned-historian Donald Cardwell become a research fellow in HPS and then a lecturer. However, Cardwell left Leeds in 1963 to start a similar department at UMIST. When Toulmin, followed by Goodfield, left Leeds for the USA in 1959, Ravetz led the Leeds HPS group into a period of expansion during the 1960s, which is described by many as a ‘golden age’ of HPS at Leeds. A number of scholars were hired, including Piyo Rattansi, Charles Webster, Ted McGuire, Maurice Crosland, and Charles Schmitt, and a number of postgraduate students who would go to become leading HPS thinkers, such as Margaret Jacob&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/jacob/ Margaret Jacob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207224607/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/jacob/ |date=December 7, 2008 }}, [[UCLA]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Fox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/staff/faculty/fox_r.htm Robert Fox], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; studied at Leeds with them.   

In the 1970s, after the departures of – amongst others – Webster and Crosland, historian of genetics Robert Olby became a leading figure in the Division through his book ''Path to the Double Helix'',&lt;ref&gt;Robert Olby, ''Path to the Double Helix'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; which showed how the 1953 discoveries of [[Francis Crick|Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|Watson]] were rooted in the work of two University of Leeds scientists: the creator of molecular biology, [[William Astbury]], and the Nobel prizewinning inventor of [[X-ray crystallography]], [[William Henry Bragg]]. During this period, a number of scholars who would shape HPS at Leeds during the 1980s and 1990s were appointed. These scholars included John Christie&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/Jrrc/Index.htm John Christie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807234936/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/Jrrc/Index.htm |date=August 7, 2009 }}, University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hodge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/JH/Index.htm Jonathan Hodge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614083917/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/JH/Index.htm |date=June 14, 2009 }}, University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geoffrey Cantor]], whose groundbreaking research on the history of physics – in particular [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Michael Faraday]] – would earn him the first professorship in the HPS division at Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday: Sandemanian and Scientist : a Study of Science and Religion in the Nineteenth Century'' (1991), ''Optics After Newton: Theories of Light in Britain and Ireland, 1704–1840'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hodge collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor on the classic co-edited study ''Conceptions of Ether: Studies in the History of Ether Theories, 1740–1900'' (1981). However, Dr Hodge’s main research interest lies in the history of theories of creation and, in this context, he has written historical articles on the theories of [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Ronald Fisher]], as well as philosophical pieces on evolutionary biology. In chronological terms, Hodge’s historical focus has been on the period 1770–1850, especially in France and Britain, working on [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Monographs are under preparation{{when|date=January 2011}} on the last two, following on from the ''Cambridge Companion to Darwin'' (2003), which was co-edited with recently arrived colleague Gregory Radick, and recently issued in a second edition to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''On the Origin of Species''.

John Christie has a broad range of expertise in enlightenment science, especially th history of chemistry. A significant proportion of his articles focus on the characters of [[William Cullen]] and [[Joseph Black]] in [[Edinburgh]] and on [[Joseph Priestley]] in Leeds. Christie, too, has collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor, their shared interests in linguistic aspects of science leading to the co-edited volume ''The Figural and the Literal: Problems of Language in the History of Science and Philosophy, 1630–1800'' (1987).

Notable research students supervised by Cantor, Hodge, and Christie include:

* Chris Kenny&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/842/chris_kenny Chris Kenny], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Cantor and now a teaching fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Leeds. 
* Sam Alberti – co-supervised by Hodge, Graeme Gooday (Leeds), and Sally Shuttleworth (Sheffield), and now Keeper of Science and Technology at National Museums Scotland.
* Jan Golinski&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unh.edu/history/golinski/index.html Jan Golinski] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417055157/http://www.unh.edu/history/golinski/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}, [[University of New Hampshire]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Christie and now Professor of History and Humanities at the [[University of New Hampshire]].
* Mark Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/history/staff/jackson/ Mark Jackson], [[University of Exeter]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Christie and now Professor of the History of Medicine and Director of the Centre for Medical History at the [[University of Exeter]].

Furthermore, the collective endeavours of life in the Division of HPS at Leeds were epitomized in the much-cited multi-authored ''Companion to the History of Modern Science'' (1990), co-edited by Olby, Cantor, Christie and Hodge. Although there are now competitor volumes, articles from the Leeds Companion still reside on many a reading list for history of science courses throughout the world.

==Diversification and expansion in the 1990s==
From 1993 onwards, Leeds HPS took a new direction as several new specialist appointments were made in the philosophy of science, the history of medicine and the history of technology. Professor Steven French&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/902/steven_french Steven French], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; came to Leeds in 1993, having previously worked in Brazil and the USA. He teaches the philosophy of science, especially the philosophy of physics, and he has supervised numerous PhD students in both areas. His research covers several areas in the history and philosophy of physics. Primarily, Professor French is known for a structuralist approach to models and theories, which can be extended to cover issues of explanation and representation in science and also provides the formal basis for a form of structural realism. 

In the same year that Steven French was appointed, Adrian Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/822/adrian_wilson Adrian Wilson], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturer in History of Medicine, came to the Division under a Wellcome University Award. Dr Wilson’s main research focus is seventeenth- and eighteenth-century midwifery/childbirth, particularly with reference to male and female roles in delivery – a subject he explored in his book ''The Making of Man-Midwifery'' (1995). However, Dr. Wilson also studies English provincial voluntary hospitals in the eighteenth century and the history of pathology.   With help from colleagues, Dr. Wilson built up History of Medicine teaching both as part of the HPS degree programmes (BA and MA) and within the medical curriculum; and Leeds now offers an Intercalated Degree in History of Medicine (only the fourth such degree in Britain). 

In 1994, Graeme Gooday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/860/graeme_gooday Graeme Gooday], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to teach courses on the history and philosophy (especially the ethics) of technology. Gooday’s main research interests are in the history of late nineteenth-century physics, technology, instrumentation, and gender. In particular, as demonstrated by his first book, ''The Morals of Measurement: Accuracy, Irony and Trust in Late Victorian Electrical Practice'' (2004), Gooday focuses on the history of laboratories, the multifaceted roles of measurement and on the spatial issues of scientific practice.

Jonathan Topham&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/872/jon_topham Jonathan Topham], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;arrived in Leeds in 1999 as an AHRB Institutional Fellow for the Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciper.leeds.ac.uk/ Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; having previously worked on the Darwin Correspondence Project and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The work of the SciPer Project reflects Dr Topham’s wide interest in the production and reading of scientific publications in nineteenth-century Britain, a subject on which he has published a number of widely cited articles. Topham’s other main research focus is on science and religion, and he has published valuable articles on natural theology and theologies of nature in nineteenth-century Britain. As a lecturer in history and philosophy of science since January 2005, Topham has helped develop a new Masters programme in science communication in collaboration with the University of Leeds’s Institute of Communication Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/coursefinder/17024/MA_Science_Communication Communication Studies], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his postgraduate studies at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Dr Gregory Radick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/861/gregory_radick Gregory Radick], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed as lecturer in the HPS Division in 2000 during Professor Cantor’s sabbatical, becoming a permanent member of staff in 2003. His research and teaching specialties are in the history of the life sciences and the human sciences, with special emphasis on questions of Darwinism and genetics. He has published and contributed to two co-edited volumes, including, with colleague Jonathan Hodge, ''The Cambridge Companion to Darwin'' (2003), which was recently issued as a second edition. Radick’s research work has concentrated on three themes in particular: scientific studies of animal mind and animal language; the role of social context and historical contingency in the development of modern biology; and the new genetic technologies in historical and philosophical perspective, concentrating especially on patenting and genetic testing. An interest in the relations between changing technology and changing knowledge runs throughout his work and was demonstrated in his first book, ''The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate About Animal Language'' (2008).

Notable postgraduate students at Leeds during and since the 1990s include:{{fact|date=January 2011}}

'''Contemporary philosophy''' is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the early 20th century with the increasing [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;The publication of Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900–1) and Russell's ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophy (see ''Spindel Conference 2002 – 100 Years of Metaethics. The Legacy of G. E. Moore'', University of Memphis, 2003, p. 165).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "contemporary philosophy" is a piece of [[technical terminology]] in philosophy that refers to a specific period in the [[history of Western philosophy]] (namely the [[20th-century philosophy|philosophy of the 20th]] and 21st centuries).&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Waithe (ed.), ''A History of Women Philosophers: Volume IV: Contemporary Women Philosophers, 1900-Today'', Springer, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phrase is often confused with [[modern philosophy]] (which refers to an earlier period in Western philosophy), [[postmodern philosophy]] (which refers to continental philosophers' criticisms of modern philosophy), and with a non-technical use of the phrase referring to any recent philosophic work.

==Professionalization==
{{Rquote|right|...the day of the philosopher as isolated thinker--the talented amateur with an idiosyncratic message--is effectively gone.|[[Nicholas Rescher]]|"American Philosophy Today," ''[[Review of Metaphysics]]'' '''46''' (4)}}

===Process===
[[Professionalization]] is the social process by which any trade or occupation establishes the group [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] of conduct, acceptable [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]s for membership of the [[profession]], a [[professional body]] or association to oversee the conduct of members of the [[profession]], and some [[demarcation problem|degree of demarcation]] of the qualified from unqualified [[amateurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=4281 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724115941/http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=4281 |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Steven Hetcher, ''Norms in a Wired World, Cambridge University Press, 2004, 432pp, Reviewed by Stefan Sciaraffa,'' University of Arizona&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation into a profession brings about many subtle changes to a field of inquiry, but one more readily identifiable component of professionalization is the increasing irrelevance of "the book" to the field: "research communiqués&lt;!--sic--&gt; will begin to change in ways [...] whose modern end products are obvious to all and oppressive to many. No longer will [a member's] researches usually be embodied in books addressed [...] to anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field. Instead they will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to professional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm can be assumed and who prove to be the only one able to read the papers addressed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', The University of Chicago Press (1962), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy underwent this process toward the end of the 19th century, and it is one of the key distinguishing features of the contemporary philosophy era in Western philosophy.

Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simons "Open and Cloded Culture" in ''Phenomenology and analysis: essays on Central European philosophy.'' Edited by Arkadiusz Chrudzimski and Wolfgang Huemer. Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1817, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] was the first philosopher to be appointed professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of [[Prussian Reform Movement (1806–1815)|Napoleonic reform in Prussia]]. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, James (2006) A Thoughtful Profession, Open Court Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; James Campbell describes the professionalisation of philosophy in America as follows:

{{quotation|The list of specific changes [during the late 19th-century professionalization of philosophy] is fairly brief, but the resultant shift is almost total. [...] No longer could the [philosophy] professor function as a defender of the faith or an expounder of Truth. The new philosopher had to be a leader of inquires and a publicizer of results. This shift was made obvious when certified (often German-certified) philosophy Ph.D.'s replaced theology graduates and ministers in the philosophy classroom. The period between the time when almost no one had a Ph.D. to when almost everyone did was very brief. [...] The doctorate, moreover, was more than a license to teach: it was a certificate that the prospective philosophy instructor was well, if narrowly, trained and ready to undertake independent work in the now specializing and restricted field of academic philosophy. These new philosophers functioned in independent departments of philosophy [...] They were making real gains in their research, creating a body of philosophic work that remains central to our study even now. These new philosophers also set their own standards for success, publishing in the recognized organs of philosophy that were being founded at the time: The Monist (1890), The International Journal of Ethics (1890), The Philosophical Review (1892), and The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods (1904). And, of course, these philosophers were banding together into societies--the American Psychological Association (1892), the Western Philosophical Association (1900), and the American Philosophical Association (1900)--to consolidate their academic positions and advance their philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, James (2006) A Thoughtful Profession, Open Court Publishing pp. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Professionalization in England was similarly tied to developments in higher-education. In his work on [[T.H. Green]], Denys Leighton discusses these changes in British philosophy and Green's claim to the title of Britain's first professional academic philosopher:

{{quotation|Henry Sidgwick, in a generous gesture, identified [T.H.] Green as Britain's first professional academic philosopher. Sidgwick's opinion can certainly be questioned: William Hamilton, J.F. Ferrier and Sidgwick himself are among the contenders for that honour. [...] Yet there can be no doubt that between the death of Mill (1873) and the publication of G.E.Moore's [[Principia Ethica]] (1903), the British philosophical profession was transformed, and that Green was partly responsible for the transformation. [...] Bentham, the Mills, Carlyle, Coleridge, Spencer, as well as many other serious philosophical thinkers of the nineteenth century were men of letters, administrators, active politicians, clergy with livings, but not academics. [...] Green helped separate the study of philosophical from that of literary and historical texts; and by creating a philosophy curriculum at Oxford he also established a rationale for trained teachers of philosophy. When Green began his academic career much of the serious writing on philosophical topic was published in journals of opinion devoted to a broad range of [topics] (rarely to 'pure' philosophy). He helped professionalize philosophical writing by encouraging specialized periodicals, such as 'Academy' and 'Mind', which were to serve as venues for the results of scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Leighton, Denys (2004) 'The Greenian moment' pp.70-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, [[Academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their "philosophy", these views are rarely informed or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to [[Popular science|popularize science]] and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher [[Michael Sandel|Michael Sandel's]] book "Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?" and [[Harry Frankfurt|Harry Frankfurt's]] "[[On Bullshit]]" are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times best sellers]].

===Professional philosophy today===
Not long after their formation, the Western Philosophical Association and portions of the American Psychological Association merged with the American Philosophical Association to create what is today the main professional organization for philosophers in the United States: the [[American Philosophical Association]]. The association has three divisions: Pacific, Central and Eastern. Each division organises a large annual conference. The biggest of these is the Eastern Division Meeting, which usually attracts around 2,000 philosophers and takes place in a different east coast city each December. The Eastern Division Meeting is also the USA's largest recruitment event for philosophy jobs, with numerous universities sending teams to interview candidates for academic posts. Among its many other tasks, the association is responsible for administering many of the profession's top honors. For example, the Presidency of a Division of the American Philosophical Association is considered to be a professional honor and the American Philosophical Association Book Prize is one of the oldest prizes in philosophy. The largest academic organization devoted to specifically furthering the study of continental philosophy is the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]].

Concerning professional journals today, a 2009 survey of mostly professional philosophers asked them to rank the highest quality "general" philosophy journals in English. The top 19 results were:

The [[Philosophy Documentation Center]] publishes a well-known "[[Directory of American Philosophers]]" which is the standard reference work for information about philosophical activity in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pages/Products/directories/ad10-11.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202231003/http://www.pdcnet.org/pages/Products/directories/ad10-11.htm |archivedate=2 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The directory is published every two years, alternating with its companion volume, the "[[International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers]]" (the only edited source for extensive information on philosophical activity in Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, and Latin America).

Since the start of the 21st century, philosophers have also seen the growing utilization of [[blogs]] as a means of professional exchange. A few notable milestones in this development include an informal listing of philosophy blogs begun by philosopher [[David Chalmers]] which has since become a widely used resource by the profession,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/philosophical-weblogs/|title=Philosophical Weblogs – David Chalmers|author=|date=|website=consc.net|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029065310/http://consc.net/philosophical-weblogs/|archivedate=29 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of a partnership between ethics blog [[PEA Soup]] and the prominent journal [[Ethics]] to post featured articles for online discussion on the blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2009/11/the-next-chapter-ethics-discussions-at-pea-soup.html|title=PEA Soup: The Next Chapter: Ethics Discussions at PEA Soup|author=|date=|website=peasoup.typepad.com|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111165111/http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2009/11/the-next-chapter-ethics-discussions-at-pea-soup.html|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of blogs like [[What is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy?]] in bringing attention to the experience of women in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beingawomaninphilosophy.wordpress.com/|title=What is it like to be a woman in philosophy?|author=|date=|website=What is it like to be a woman in philosophy?|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426192512/http://beingawomaninphilosophy.wordpress.com/|archivedate=26 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5787195/philosophy-departments-are-full-of-sexual-harassment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212215250/http://gawker.com/5787195/philosophy-departments-are-full-of-sexual-harassment |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/03/30/philosophers_consider_what_to_do_about_sexual_harassment|title=A Call to Shun|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031005827/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/03/30/philosophers_consider_what_to_do_about_sexual_harassment|archivedate=31 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside the profession===
[[Ayn Rand]] is perhaps the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of "philosophy": "For all her [Ayn Rand's] popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/ayn-rand/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Neera K.|last1=Badhwar|first2=Roderick T.|last2=Long|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=20 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (''Die reine und die praktische Philosophie. Drei Vorträge zur philosophischen Praxis'', 1983) and [[Michel Weber]] (see his ''Épreuve de la philosophie'', 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/279936/L_%C3%89preuve_de_la_philosophie|title=L’Épreuve de la philosophie|first=Michel|last=Weber|date=|website=academia.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722214346/http://www.academia.edu/279936/L_%C3%89preuve_de_la_philosophie|archivedate=22 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework.

==The analytic–continental divide==

===The beginning of the divide===
Contemporary [[continental philosophy]] began with the work of [[Franz Brentano]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Adolf Reinach]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] and the development of the philosophical method of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. This development was roughly contemporaneous with work by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] inaugurating a new philosophical method based on the analysis of language via modern logic (hence the term "analytic philosophy").&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Michael Dummett, ''The Origins of Analytical Philosophy'' (Harvard University Press, 1994), or C. Prado, ''A House Divided: Comparing Analytic and Continental Philosophy'' (Prometheus/Humanity Books, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cn span|Analytic philosophy dominates in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and, indeed, most of Europe. Continental philosophy prevails in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]] and parts of the [[United States]].|date=August 2017}}

Some philosophers, such as [[Richard Rorty]] and [[Simon Glendinning]], argue that this "analytic–continental" divide is inimical to the discipline as a whole. Others, such as [[John Searle]], claim that continental philosophy, especially post-structuralist continental philosophy, should be expunged, on grounds that it is obscurantist and nebulous.

Analytic and continental philosophy share a common Western philosophical tradition up to [[Immanuel Kant]]. Afterwards, analytic and continental philosophers differ on the importance and influence of subsequent philosophers on their respective traditions. For instance, the German idealism school developed out of the work of Kant in the 1780s and 1790s and culminated in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who is viewed highly by many continental philosophers. Conversely, Hegel is viewed as a relatively minor figure for the work of analytic philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Analytic philosophy===
{{Main|Analytic philosophy}}
The analytic program in philosophy is ordinarily dated to the work of English philosophers [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]] in the early 20th century, building on the work of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]].  They turned away from then-dominant forms of [[Hegelianism]] (objecting in particular to its [[idealism]] and purported obscurity)&lt;ref&gt;See for example Moore's ''[[A Defence of Common Sense]]'' and Russell's critique of the [[Doctrine of internal relations]],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...analytic philosophy opposed right from its beginning English neo-Hegelianism of Bradley's sort and similar ones. It did not only criticize the latter's denial of the existence of an external world (anyway an unjust criticism), but also the bombastic, obscure style of Hegel's writings." Peter Jonkers, "Perspectives on twentieth century philosophy: A Reply to Tom Rockmore," {{cite web|url=http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128165848/http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop a new sort of conceptual analysis based on recent developments in logic. The most prominent example of this new method of conceptual analysis is Russell's 1905 paper "[[On Denoting]]", a paper that is widely seen to be the exemplar of the analytic program in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Peter, "Descriptions", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),  URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/descriptions/
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although contemporary philosophers who self-identify as "analytic" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined the analytic movement between 1900 and 1960—analytic philosophy, in its contemporary state, is usually taken to be defined by a particular style&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;See, e.g., Brian Leiter. [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp] "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic, and resistance to "imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2b"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm "Analytic Philosophy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703212901/http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |date=3 July 2009 }}. ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analytic philosophers at the end of the 20th century, such as [[Richard Rorty]], have called for a major overhaul of the analytic philosophic tradition. In particular, Rorty has argued that analytic philosophers must learn important lessons from the work of continental philosophers.&lt;ref name=Rorty&gt;Rorty, Richard. (1979) ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, such as Paul M. Livingston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/30207-the-politics-of-logic-badiou-wittgenstein-and-the-consequences-of-formalism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521064006/http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/30207-the-politics-of-logic-badiou-wittgenstein-and-the-consequences-of-formalism/ |archivedate=21 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Paul M. Livingston, The Politics of Logic: Badiou, Wittgenstein, and the Consequences of Formalism, Routledge, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Shaun Gallagher contend that there exist valuable insights common to both traditions while others, such as [[Timothy Williamson]], have called for even stricter adherence to the methodological ideals of analytic philosophy:

{{quotation|We who classify ourselves as "analytic" philosophers tend to fall into the assumption that our allegiance automatically grants us methodological virtue. According to the crude stereotypes, analytic philosophers use arguments while "continental" philosophers do not. But within the analytic tradition many philosophers use arguments only to the extent that most "continental" philosophers do [...] How can we do better? We can make a useful start by getting the simple things right. Much even of analytic philosophy moves too fast in its haste to reach the sexy bits. Details are not given the care they deserve: crucial claims are vaguely stated, significant different formulations are treated as though they were equivalent, examples are under-described, arguments are gestured at rather than properly made, their form is left unexplained, and so on. [...] Philosophy has never been done for an extended period according to standards as high as those that are now already available, if only the profession will take them seriously to heart.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy "The Philosophy of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "crude stereotypes" that Williamson refers to in the above passage are these: that analytic philosophers produce carefully argued and rigorous analyses of trivially small philosophic puzzles, while continental philosophers produce profound and substantial results but only by deducing them from broad philosophical systems which themselves lack supporting arguments or clarity in their expression. Williamson himself seems to here distance himself from these stereotypes, but does accuse analytic philosophers of too often fitting the critical stereotype of continental philosophers by moving "too fast" to reach substantial results via poor arguments.

===Continental philosophy===
[[File:FourExistentialPrecursors.jpg|thumb|Existentialism is an important school in the continental philosophical tradition. Four key existentialists pictured from top-left clockwise: [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Hubben, William. (1952) ''Four Prophets of Our Destiny''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Continental philosophy}}

The history of continental philosophy is taken to begin in the early 1900s because its institutional roots descend directly from those of phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the largest academic organization devoted to furthering the study of continental philosophy is the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Edmund Husserl]] has often been credited as the founding figure in continental philosophy. Although, since analytic and continental philosophy have such starkly different views of philosophy after Kant, continental philosophy is also often understood in an extended sense to include any post-Kant philosophers or movements important to continental philosophy but not analytic philosophy.

The term "continental philosophy", like "analytic philosophy", marks a broad range of philosophical views and approaches not easily captured in a definition. It has even been suggested that the term may be more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers.{{sfn|Glendinning|2006|p=12}} Indeed, continental philosophy is often characterized by its critics as philosophy that lacks the rigor of analytic philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Nonetheless, certain descriptive rather than merely pejorative features have been seen to typically characterize continental philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;The following list of four traits is adapted from Michael Rosen, "Continental Philosophy from Hegel", in A.C. Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'', p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

* First, continental philosophers generally reject [[scientism]], the view that the [[natural science]]s are the best or most accurate way of understanding all phenomena.{{sfn|Critchley|2001|p=115}}
* Second, continental philosophy usually considers experience as determined at least partly by factors such as context, space and time, language, culture, or history.  Thus continental philosophy tends toward [[historicism]], where analytic philosophy tends to treat philosophy in terms of discrete problems, capable of being analyzed apart from their historical origins.{{sfn|Critchley|2001|p=57}}
* Third, continental philosophers tend to take a strong interest in the unity of theory and practice, and tend to see their philosophical inquiries as closely related to personal, moral, or political transformation.
* Fourth, continental philosophy has an emphasis on [[metaphilosophy]] (i.e. the study of the nature, aims, and methods of philosophy). This emphasis can also be found in analytic philosophy, but with starkly different results.

Another approach to approximating a definition of continental philosophy is by listing some of the philosophical movements that are or have been central in continental philosophy: [[German idealism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]] (and its antecedents, such as the thought of [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]), [[hermeneutics]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Feminism#French feminism|French feminism]], and the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] and some other branches of [[Western Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;The above list includes only those movements common to both lists compiled by {{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=13}} and {{harvnb|Glendinning|2006|pp=58–65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Mormon]] is a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which adherents believe contains writings of ancient [[prophet]]s who lived on the [[Americas|American continent]] from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 "Praise to the Man"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608020249/http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 |date=2012-06-08 }}, 1979-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in March 1830 by [[Joseph Smith]] as ''The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi'', who claimed that it had been written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as "[[reformed Egyptian]]" engraved on [[golden plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mormon|morm|9|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary followers of the Latter Day Saint movement typically regard the text primarily as scripture, but also as a [[Historicity of the Book of Mormon|historical record]] of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name = bomintroduction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction|title=Introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy of Smith's story has been questioned, however. Most scholars reject Smith's claims of ancient origin and many believe that it was fabricated by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record, noting that no evidence of a supposed Reformed Egyptian language has ever been discovered.&lt;ref name="Tanner Shadow"&gt;{{Citation|title=Mormonism - Shadow or Reality?|isbn=9993074438|first=Jerald and Sandra|last=Tanner|publisher=Utah Lighthouse Ministry|year=1987|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakauer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=standard/&gt; The content found within the book has also been questioned. Scholars have pointed out a number of [[Anachronisms in the Book of Mormon|anachronisms]] within the text, and no archaeological or genetic evidence has supported the book's claims about the indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abanes7477"/&gt; The text has also undergone many significant revisions, which critics see as a rebuttal of its supposedly divine origins.&lt;ref name="Brody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakauer"/&gt;

Adherents have defended the book against these scholarly claims. The oldest, and most significant, defense of the Smith's story comes from the testimonies of the [[Three Witnesses]] and the [[Eight Witnesses]], which are published in every copy of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Testimony of the Three Witnesses|bofm|three}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Testimony of the Eight Witnesses|bofm|eight}}&lt;/ref&gt; More contemporary adherents have also sought to rebut scholarly claims. For instance, an identification of Reformed Egyptian with a known ancient Egyptian dialect has been proposed.&lt;ref name="Nibley"/&gt; Some adherents have also claimed that various archaeological findings give evidence for the book's claims, but, as previously mentioned, there is no evidence for this.&lt;ref name="archaeology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abanes7477"/&gt;

==Ancient origin==
{{Main|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon witnesses}}

{{quote box| quote = The evidence indicates that the Book of Mormon is in fact an amalgamation of ideas that were inspired by Joseph's own environment (new) and themes from the Bible (old).|source = —[[Grant H. Palmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Grant H.|title=An insider's view of Mormon origins|date=2002|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=1560851570|edition=[Nachdr.]|quote=The evidence indicates that the Book of Mormon is in fact an amalgamation of ideas that were inspired by Joseph's own environment (new) and themes from the Bible (old).}}&lt;/ref&gt; | width = 26% | align = left}}

Scholars reject Smith's explanation of the origin of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith said that the Book of Mormon was originally an ancient native-American record written on golden plates, and that God gave him the power to translate it into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng | title = Gospel Topics: Book of Mormon Translation | work = LDS.org | publisher = LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics note that there is no physical proof of the existence of golden plates; Smith said that the angel Moroni reclaimed the plates once he had completed the translation. To provide support towards the existence of the plates, Smith included two statements in the Book of Mormon saying that the [[Book of Mormon witnesses]] had been shown the plates, and their testimony is typically published at the beginning of the Book of Mormon. While none of these men ever retracted their statement, critics nevertheless discount these testimonies for varying reasons, one of which is because most of these men were closely interrelated.  In later years Martin Harris, one of the witnesses, is recorded to have confessed that none of the witnesses saw the plates with their natural eyes but only through a vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brodie|first1=Fawn M.|title=No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet|date=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679730540|page=78|edition=2. ed., rev.and enl., 1.

Most linguists, archeologists, and historians do not regard the Book of Mormon to be of ancient origin. In 1834 a publication by [[Eber D. Howe]] claimed that Smith had plagiarized [[Spalding–Rigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship|an unpublished manuscript]] written by [[Solomon Spalding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Howe |first= Eber D |authorlink= Eber Dudley Howe |year= 1834 |title= Mormonism Unvailed |place= [[Painesville, Ohio]] |publisher= Telegraph Press |url= https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe |publication-date= 1834 |page= {{page needed|date=January 2014}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Spaulding |first= Solomon |title= Manuscript Found: The Complete Original "Spaulding" Manuscript |editor-last= Reeve |editor-first= Rex C |year= 1996 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Religious Studies Center]], Brigham Young University |isbn= 1570082979 |oclc= 37469063 |page= {{page needed|date=January 2014}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Roper |first= Matthew |title= The Mythical "Manuscript Found" |journal= [[FARMS Review]] |volume= 17 |issue= 2 |publisher= Maxwell Institute, BYU |location= Provo, Utah |month= |year= 2005  |pages= 7–140  |url= http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1449&amp;index=3 |accessdate= 2014-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars today have varying theories about the true authorship of the Book of Mormon, but most conclude that Smith composed the book himself, possibly with the help of Oliver Cowdery and [[Sidney Rigdon]], drawing from information and publications available in his time, including the [[King James Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abanes|2003|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tanner|1987|pp=73–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Wonders of Nature]]'',&lt;ref name="Abanes 2003 68"&gt;{{harvnb|Abanes|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tanner|1987|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[View of the Hebrews]]''.&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{Citation |last= Brody |first= Fawn |title= No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith |year= 1971 |edition= 2nd |publisher= Alfred A.

===Existence of golden plates===
Two separate sets of witnesses, a set of three and a set of eight, testified as having seen the [[golden plates]], the record from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Critics, including [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], and the [[Institute for Religious Research]] note several pieces of evidence that they argue call into question the authenticity of the experience, including letters and [[affidavit]]s in which Martin Harris stated that the [[Eight Witnesses]] never saw the plates, and that his own witness was more spiritual than physical.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Additionally, each of the [[Three Witnesses]] ([[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and [[David Whitmer]]) left the church during Joseph Smith's lifetime and considered Smith to have been a fallen prophet.  Harris&lt;ref&gt;Millennial Star, 6 Feb. 1882, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; and Cowdery&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/display.php?table=transcripts&amp;id=50#Anchor-58442 The Return of Oliver Cowdery - Maxwell Institute Papers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013171045/http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/display.php?table=transcripts&amp;id=50 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later returned to the church. However, the Institute for Religious Research disputes the sincerity of their conversion and return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irr.org/mit/bomwit1.html|title=Facts On The Book Of Mormon Witnesses — Part 1|website=www.irr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apologists note that the witnesses in most cases affirmed their witness until their death, and claim that the aforementioned affidavits and letters are either fraudulent, or otherwise not reliable. In 1881 Whitmer, the one witness who never returned to the church, issued an affidavit reaffirming his testimony of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;"An Address," 27, in ''EMD'', 5: 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text and language==
[[File:Caractors large.jpg|thumb|Joseph Smith provided a sample of "reformed Egyptian" characters. [[Egyptologists]] assert this language was merely Smith's invention.]]
{{Main|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon}}
Historians view the language patterns, phrases, and names in the Book of Mormon as evidence that it is not authentic.

Joseph Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon from a language called [[Reformed Egyptian]]. Archaeologists and Egyptologists have found no evidence that this language ever existed.&lt;ref name = standard&gt;Standard language references such as Peter T. Daniels and William Bright, eds., ''The World's Writing Systems'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996) (990 pages); David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997); and Roger D. Woodard, ed., ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) (1162 pages) contain no reference to "reformed Egyptian." "Reformed Egyptian" is also ignored in Andrew Robinson, ''Lost Languages: The Enigma of the World's Undeciphered Scripts'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 2002), although it is mentioned in Stephen Williams, ''Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991). On their website, ''Bad Archaeology'', two British archaeologists, Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews and Dames Doeser, say "The only writing systems to have been recognised in the Americas are those used by the Maya and the Aztecs, neither of which resembles Egyptian hieroglyphs, although Joseph Smith, the founder of the religion, produced a scrap of papyrus containing hieroglyphs he claimed to be a Reformed Egyptian text written by the Patriarch Abraham." [http://www.badarchaeology.net/forgotten/mormonism.php Bad Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hugh Nibley]], a [[Mormon studies#Apologetics|Mormon]] [[Apologetics|apologist]], argues that Reformed Egyptian is actually [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] Egyptian.&lt;ref name="Nibley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nibley|first1=Hugh|quote=And at the very same time, the priests who used to be in the former royal court at Napata fled farther to Meroe.  There they produced a new type of Egyptian at this time which was Meroitic (I've got a picture of it here).  When you compare the Anthon transcripts with Meroitic, it's very impressive. In fact, Brother Bushman back at Brown University (which is one of the four universities in the country where Egyptian has always been a big thing), showed them the Anthon transcript, and Parker immediately recognized them as Meroitic.  He said, "They're the closest thing you can get to Meroitic."... &amp;nbsp;This is the new Egyptian which was invented way up the Nile, way up in Meroe, which is even south of Napata.  That's the Nubian kingdom.  It's very interesting that so many Book of Mormon names come from way up there.|title=Teachings of the Book of Mormon|isbn=9781621081050|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meroitic.png|thumb|The [[Meroitic alphabet]]]]
Furthermore, official LDS church commentary on the Book of Mormon says that at least some ancestors of Native Americans came from the Jerusalem area; however, Native American [[linguistics|linguistic specialists]] have not found any Native American language that appears to be related to languages of the ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Brigham H.|editor1-last=Madsen|editor1-first=Brigham|title=Studies of the Book of Mormon|date=1992|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=1560850272|pages=63–94|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters point out the interesting elements of the creation drama that turn up in temple, tomb, or coffin texts from ancient Egypt that is described in detail in the Book of Mormon as the coronation of King Mosiah long before these ancient texts were understood by Egyptologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Hugh |last= Nibley |authorlink= Hugh Nibley |first2= Michael D |last2= Rhodes |author2-link= Michael D. Rhodes |first3= Michael P |last3= Lyon |year= 2009 |title= One Eternal Round |place= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Deseret Book |isbn= 9781606412374 |oclc= 465330437 |pages= 112–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the Book of Mormon claim it uses [[chiasmus]]—a figure of speech utilizing inverted parallelism—and claim it is evidence to support the book's ancient origin.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Critics such as [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] argue that chiasmus in the Book of Mormon are a characteristic of Joseph Smith's speech pattern and not evidence of antiquity.  They cite chiasmus in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Book of Moses which were not translated from an ancient text as evidence.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Critics claim that language patterns in the Book of Mormon indicate that it is merely a repetition of rhetorical patterns found in the Old Testament.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} They point out that the Book of Mormon contains many words and phrases that are not consistent with the time frame or location of the stories included in the book.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Some critics theorize that Smith derived the account of the golden plates from treasure-hunting stories of [[William Kidd]]. Critics base this theory on the similarity of the names from Smith's account—Moroni and Cumorah—to the location [[Moroni, Comoros]], related to Kidd's hunt for treasure. Apologists argue that it was unlikely that Smith had access to this material since at the time of the writing and publishing of the Book of Mormon his family were living in backwoods America, were very poor and there was no public library available to read such a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.palmyrany.com/about/1900.htm |title= A Brief History of Palmyra: 1900's |first= Bob |last= Lowe |year= 1998 |work= PalmyraNY.com |publisher= Town &amp; Village of Palmyra, NY |quote= In 1899, the Palmyra King's Daughters Free Library was begun as a reading room.

[[File:JosephSmithTranslating.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Smith sitting on a wooden chair with his face in a hat|A depiction of Joseph Smith dictating the Book of Mormon by peering at a seer stone in a hat.]] 
{{Main|Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)}}
The only thing Joseph Smith ever said about the translation process was "through the medium of the urim and thummim I translated the record, by the gift and power of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunderli|first1=Earl M.|title=An imperfect book : what the Book of Mormon tells us about itself|date=2013|publisher=Signature Books|isbn=9781560852308|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Harris, Joseph's second scribe, and David Whitmer, a witness of Joseph translating the plates to Oliver Cowdery, both describe the process as an exact word-for-word translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunderli|first1=Earl M.|title=An imperfect book : what the Book of Mormon tells us about itself|date=2013|isbn=9781560852308|pages=34–35|quote=Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine.  A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing.  One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English.  Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern LDS scholars tend to fall into two schools: tight control and loose control. Those who believe in tight control interpretation believe Joseph had very little leeway in the words used in dictating the Book of Mormon (but without being restricted to exact word-for-word). Those who believed in loose control interpretation believe that "'ideas were revealed to Joseph Smith' and he put them 'into his own language.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunderli|first1=Earl M.|title=An imperfect book : what the Book of Mormon tells us about itself|date=2013|isbn=9781560852308|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical language===

The Book of Mormon claims to be the original writings of [[Nephite]] leaders in ancient America, but it contains extensive quotation of the 17th century edition of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] (KJV) and the [[deuterocanonical books]], which Joseph Smith's bible had as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Furthermore, the language of the Book of Mormon mimics the Elizabethan English used in the KJV with 19th century English mixed into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Wesley|title=The Use of the Old Testament in the Book of Mormon|date=1990|publisher=Utah Lighthouse Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mormon quotes 25,000 words from the KJV Old Testament and over 2,000 words from the KJV New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brodie|first1=Fawn M.|title=No man knows my history : the life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet|date=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679730540|page=58|edition=2. ed., rev.and enl., 1. Vintage books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, there are numerous cases where the Nephite writers mimic wording from the New Testament—a document to which they had no access.  Below are five examples out of a list of 400 examples created by Jerald and Sandra Tanner:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tanner |first1= Jerald |last2= Tanner |first2= Sandra |title= The Case Against Mormonism |publisher= Utah Lighthouse Ministry |pages= 87–102 }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
{{Further|Angel Moroni #Theorized origin of the name | Cumorah #Alternative origin of the name}}
Critics believe Joseph Smith came up with all the names in the Book of Mormon, noting that Joseph owned a King James Bible with a table listing all the names used in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tanner|1987|pp=95|ps="It is interesting to note that when Joseph Smith purchased a Bible in the late 1820s, he picked one that contained "An alphabetical table of all the names of the Old and New Testaments with their significations"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Wesley|title=The Use of the Old Testament in the Book of Mormon|publisher=Utah Lighthouse Ministry|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Book of Mormon names are either biblical, formed from a rhyming pattern, changed by a prefix or suffix, or Greek in etymology.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Furthermore, [[Jaredites]] and [[Nephites]] shared names despite the Jaradites being of a different time, place, and language than the Nephites.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Lastly, some people would occasionally name their sons after their fathers, something not practiced in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunderli|first1=Earl M.|title=An imperfect book : what the Book of Mormon tells us about itself|date=2013|isbn=9781560852308|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
{{Main|Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon}}
Most, but not all, Mormons hold the book's connection to ancient American history as an article of their faith. However, this view finds little acceptance outside of Mormonism.&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duffy|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that the Book of Mormon is an ancient American history is considered to fall outside academic credibility.&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004 37"/&gt; [[Mormon apologetics]] have proposed multiple theories tying Book of Mormon places to modern locations.

===Anachronisms===
{{Main|Anachronisms in the Book of Mormon}}
There are a number of words and phrases in the [[Book of Mormon]] that are [[anachronistic]]—their existence in the text of the Book of Mormon is at odds with known linguistic patterns, archaeological findings, or known historical events.

Each of the anachronisms is a word, phrase, artifact, or other concept that critics, historians, archaeologists, or linguists believe did not exist in the Americas during the time period in which the Book of Mormon claims to have been written.

Apologists offer varying views on these anachronisms, typically countering them in one of two ways. One claim is that archaeological evidence may exist that has not yet been found. Another is that Joseph Smith used English words in a generic way, sometimes referring to an item other than that which the direct English word would imply.

===Archaeology===
[[File:Book of Mormon Lands and Sites2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Map showing the possible lands and sites of the Book of Mormon in Mesoamerica (speculative)]]
{{Main|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon}}
Since the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, both [[Mormons|Mormon]] and non-Mormon [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have attempted to find archaeological evidence to support or criticize it. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and other denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] generally believe that the Book of Mormon describes ancient historical events in the [[Americas]], but historians and archaeologists do not regard it as a work of ancient American history.

Some early 20th century researchers claimed various archaeological findings such as place names, and ruins of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmec]], and other ancient American and Old World civilizations as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{Harvnb|Priddis|1975}}; see [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-110.htm RLDS D&amp;C 110:20], were advanced by [[Community of Christ|RLDS]] members: {{Harvnb|Hills|1917}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1918}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1924}}, and {{Harvnb|Gunsolley|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree with these conclusions, arguing that the Book of Mormon mentions several animals, plants, and technologies that are not substantiated by the archaeological record between 3100 BC to 400 AD in America.&lt;ref name="Abanes7477"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolverton|2004|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Persuitte|2000|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Does Archaeology Support The Book Of Mormon? | work = Mormons in Transition web site | publisher = [[Institute for Religious Research]] | url = http://irr.org/mit/bom-arch-v1.html | accessdate = February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American genetics===
{{Main|Genetics and the Book of Mormon}}
Since the late 1990s pioneering work of [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] and others, scientists have developed techniques that attempt to use genetic markers to indicate the ethnic background and history of individual people. The data developed by these mainstream scientists tell us that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have very distinctive DNA markers, and that some of them are most similar, among old world populations, to the DNA of people anciently associated with the [[Altay Mountains]] area of central Asia. This conclusion from a genetic perspective supports a large amount of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic evidence that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500–13,000 years ago. (See [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|Settlement of the Americas]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]).

The mainstream scientific consensus about the origin of the ancient Americans and peoples is apparently at odds with the claims put forth in the Book of Mormon, although [[Mormon apologetics|Mormon apologists]] have made efforts to reconcile these apparent contradictions.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints released an essay on their website titled "Book of Mormon and DNA Studies". The conclusion states, "Much as critics and defenders of the Book of Mormon would like to use DNA studies to support their views, the evidence is simply inconclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng|title=Book of Mormon and DNA Studies|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population size and the Book of Mormon===

==Relation to the Book of Abraham==
[[File:Joseph Smith Papyrus VII.jpg|thumb|Egyptologists' translations of these fragments of the [[Joseph Smith Papyri]] do not coincide with Smith's translation.]]
{{Further|Book of Abraham|Critical appraisal of the Book of Abraham|Joseph Smith Papyri}}

Critics point out that Joseph Smith also translated the [[Book of Abraham]]. Unlike the Book of Mormon, fragments of the documents from which Smith translated the Book of Abraham are available for inspection; Egyptologists find no resemblance between the original text and Smith's translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Charles M.|title=By his own hand upon papyrus : a new look at the joseph smith papyri.|date=1992|publisher=Inst For Religious|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0962096326|edition=Rev. ed., 2. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters point out that the Church has never claimed that the fragments of papyri which include facsimile 1, 2, and 3 are where Joseph Smith obtained his material for the Book of Abraham.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These fragments are from the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]] which was just one of the scrolls from Egypt that Joseph Smith had in his possession. When these fragments were discovered in the Metropolitan Museum many years ago, Hugh Nibley wrote a book called ''The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri, An Ancient Egyptian Endowment'' showing how the fragments that had been discovered had nothing to do with the Book of Abraham but everything to do with Egyptian funeral texts from the ''Book of the Dead''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The translation of the papyri by both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists does not match the text of the Book of Abraham as purportedly translated by Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1992|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the transliterated text from the recovered papyri and facsimiles published in the Book of Abraham contain no direct references, either historical or textual, to Abraham,&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{Harvnb|Reeve|Parshall|2010|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|ashment|2000|p=126}}."&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashment|2000|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ritner69&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Abraham's name does not appear anywhere in the papyri or the facsimiles. Edward Ashment notes, "The sign that Smith identified with Abraham ... is nothing more than the [[hieratic]] version of ... a 'w' in Egyptian. It has no phonetic or semantic relationship to [Smith's] 'Ah-broam.'"&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|ashment|2000|p=126}}."/&gt; University of Chicago Egyptologist [[Robert K. Ritner]] concluded in 2014 that the source of the Book of Abraham "is the 'Breathing Permit of Hôr,' misunderstood and mistranslated by Joseph Smith",&lt;ref name=ritnerresponse/&gt; and that the other papyri are common Egyptian funerary documents like the Book of the Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Original manuscripts of the Book of Abraham, microfilmed in 1966 by Jerald Tanner, show portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri and their purported translations into the Book of Abraham. Ritner concludes, contrary to the LDS position, due to the microfilms being published prior to the rediscovery of the Joseph Smith Papyri, that "it is not true that 'no eyewitness account of the translation survives'", that the Book of Abraham is "confirmed as a perhaps well-meaning, but erroneous invention by Joseph Smith", and "despite its inauthenticity as a genuine historical narrative, the Book of Abraham remains a valuable witness to early American religious history and to the recourse to ancient texts as sources of modern religious faith and speculation".&lt;ref name=ritnerresponse&gt;{{Citation|url=http://signaturebooks.com/a-response-to-translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham-by-dr-robert-ritner/|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20161022063517/http://signaturebooks.com/a-response-to-translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham-by-dr-robert-ritner/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 22, 2016|title=A Response to 'Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham'|first=Robert K.|last=Ritner|authorlink=Robert K.

'''Cynthia Radding''' is an American historian and specialist in Latin American studies; since 2008, she has held the Gussenhoven [[Professors in the United States|Distinguished Professorship]] of Latin American Studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

== Biography ==
Cynthia Radding graduated from [[Smith College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree (BA) in 1968, [[Major (academic)|majoring]] in history. She then completed a [[Master of Arts]] degree (MA) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1970. From 1973 to 1990, she was a Research Historian at the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] in [[Mexico]]; in 1990, she was awarded her [[doctorate]] (PhD) in history from the [[University of California, San Diego]]. She then joined the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]] as an Assistant Professor and in 1995 moved to an equivalent post at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]; she became an Associate Professor there in 1999 and served as Acting Director of the University's Centre of Latin American and Caribbean Studies for the year 1999–2000. From 2004 to 2008, she was Professor of History at the [[University of New Mexico]], where she was also Director of its Latin American and Iberian Institute (2004–07). She joined the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 2008 as Gussenhoven Distinguished Professor of Latin American Studies and Professor of History, where she remains as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.unc.edu/files/2012/03/Radding-CV-2014.pdf "Cynthia Radding CV"], University of North Carolina, June 2014. Retrieved 30 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
According to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's research profile, Radding's research on "Latin American colonial history focus on the intersections between environmental and ethnographic history"; she is particular interested in the imperial borderlands of the Spanish and Portuguese American empires and the way that indigenous people shaped society there.&lt;ref name="prof"&gt;[http://history.unc.edu/people/faculty/cynthia-radding/ "Cynthia Radding"], ''University of North Carolina''. Retrieved 30 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Her published works include ''Borderlands in World History, 1700-1914'' (London and New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2014), which she co-edited with [[Paul Readman]] and Chad Bryant, and ''Landscapes of Power and Identity: Comparative Histories in the Sonoran Desert and the Forests of Amazonia from Colony to Republic'' (Duke University Press, 2005).&lt;ref name="prof"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Klatt's review of ''Borderlands in World History'' for ''[[Journal of Borderlands Studies]]'', vol. 32, no. 3 (2017), pp. 413–414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For ''Landscapes of Power and Identity,'' see: David Block's review for the ''[[The Hispanic American Historical Review|Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', vol. 87, no. 1 (2007), p. 211; Rachel St John's review for ''[[Western Historical Quarterly]]'', vol. 38, no. 3 (2007), p. 380; Barbara A. Sommer's review for ''[[Ethnohistory (journal)|Ethnohistory]]'', vol. 55, no. 4 (2008), p. 701; Christian Brannstrom for ''[[Journal of Latin American Studies]]'', vol. 39, no. 2 (2007), pp. 395-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of ''Landscapes of Power and Identity'' for ''[[The Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', David Block argues that "By narrating the interrelationship between humans and their natural surroundings, [Radding] challenges her readers to examine our understanding of the different ways that new societies formed on American frontiers and of the nature of boundaries themselves" and states that her "most important contribution ... is her thoughtful commentary on the nature of boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;David Block, review of ''Landscapes of Power and Identity'' in ''[[The Hispanic American Historical Review|Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', vol. 87, no. 1 (2007), pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Ethnography (journal)|Ethnography]]'', Barbara A. Sommer wrote that the book offered a "sweeping, conceptually driven analysis of Sonora and Chiquitos" which "extend[s] ethnohistory to the Ibero-American periphery and reconfigure[s] the concept of frontier", while her "bold comparative approach" is her "most salient contribution to the historiography".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Sommer's review for ''[[Ethnohistory (journal)|Ethnohistory]]'', vol. 55, no. 4 (2008), pp. 702, 704.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The International Review of History'', Stuart McCook reiterated this point, arguing that Radding "weaves the stories of these borderlands together to develop an innovative comparative study".&lt;ref&gt;Stuart McCook, review of ''Landscapes of Power and Identity'' in ''The International History Review'', vol. 29, no. 4 (2007), p. 866.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to state that the book is "a superb example of how to incorporate the natural world into more traditional historical themes. It moves beyond the now-standard historical narratives of environmental decline in colonial Latin America to offer a more complex and nuanced picture of the interplay between nature and society in the late colonial and early national periods".&lt;ref&gt;McCook, p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyril Frederick Cherrington Beeson''' [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]], [[Doctor of Science#The United Kingdom, Ireland and the Commonwealth|D.Sc.]] (1889–1975) was an English [[Entomology|entomologist]] and [[Forestry|forest conservator]] who worked in India. Beeson was an expert on forest entomology who wrote numerous papers on insects, and whose book on Indian forest insects remains a standard work on the subject. After his retirement and return to England he became an [[antiquarian]] [[Horology|horologist]].

==Family==
Beeson was born in Oxford on 10 February 1889 to Walter Thomas Beeson and Rose Eliza Beeson, ''née'' Clacey.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} Walter Beeson was Surveyor to [[St John's College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}}

Cyril Beeson got married to Marion Cossentine in 1922 and they had a daughter, Barbara Rose, who was born ''circa'' 1925.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} Beeson's first wife died in 1946 after a long period of ill-health.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} In 1971, aged 82, Beeson got married to his second wife, Margaret Carbury.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}}

Beeson died on 3 November 1975.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}}

==Education==
Beeson attended [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]], where his best friend was [[T. E. Lawrence#Middle East archaeology|T. E. Lawrence]] (better remembered today as [[Lawrence of Arabia]]).{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} Lawrence called him by his nickname of "Scroggs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1888-1910/080816_beeson.htm |publisher=Jeremy Wilson |work=Writings |title=T. E. Lawrence to C. F. C. ('Scroggs') Beeson |date=16 August 1908 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15 Beeson and Lawrence bicycled around [[Berkshire]], Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, visited almost every village's parish church, studied their [[English church monuments|monuments]] and [[Antiquarian|antiquities]] and made [[Brass rubbing|rubbings]] of their [[monumental brass]]es.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}} The two schoolboys monitored building sites in Oxford and presented their finds to the [[Ashmolean Museum]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}} The Ashmolean's ''Annual Report'' for 1906 said that the pair ''"by incessant watchfulness secured everything of antiquarian value which has been found''".{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}} In the summers of 1906 and 1907 Beeson and Lawrence toured France by bicycle, collecting photographs, drawings and measurements of [[medieval]] castles.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}} Beeson made many of the drawings that Lawrence used in his thesis ''The influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture – to the end of the 12th century'', which was published in 1936 as ''Crusader Castles''.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}}

Beeson entered the [[University of Oxford]] in 1907 to read geology.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} He was a non-collegiate student until 1908, when he won an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] that enabled him to enter St John's College.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} He graduated in 1910 but then changed disciplines to [[forestry]], in which he obtained a diploma.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} He received his [[Master of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|MA]] in 1917 and an Oxford D.Sc. in 1923.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}}

==Army service==
Beeson was a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}}

==Forest entomologist==
[[File:Main Building of the Doon School in 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of the Forest Research Institute at Dehra Dun in 1915, when Beeson was Forest Zoologist of India]]
From 1911 until 1941 Beeson worked for the [[Indian Forest Service|Imperial Forest Service]] (IFS) as a research officer, forest conservator and forest entomologist.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} The IFS seconded him to study tropical and forest entomology in London and Germany, after which he first served in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} In 1913 he was appointed Forest Zoologist of India.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} Beeson was closely involved with the development of the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] at [[Dehradun]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} In 1922 his post was renamed Forest Entomologist.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=1}} He served in the same position until his retirement in 1941, when he was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Indian Empire]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}}

Beeson's first book, ''The Ecology and Control of the Forest Insects of India and the Neighbouring Countries'' was published in 1941.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} It remained the standard work in its field,{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} being republished in 1961 and 1993.

Beeson returned to Oxford, where he became Director of the [[Imperial Forestry Bureau]] from 1945 to 1947.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} While he was Director of the IFB, Beeson and his wife moved to [[Adderbury]] in North Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}}

==Antiquarian horologist==
[[File:Knibb-Dial.jpg|thumb|Nine inch square dial of month-going walnut longcase clock, signed ''Joseph Knibb Londini fecit'' circa 1675]]
When the couple moved to Adderbury, Beeson began to collect antique clocks, many of which originated from Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} Beeson turned his scholarly and scientific approach to [[antiquarian]] [[horology]], and in 1953 became a founder member of the [[Antiquarian Horological Society]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} He contributed many articles to the AHS's quarterly [[academic journal]] ''Antiquarian Horology'', and edited it for the year 1959–60.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}}

Beeson became a published authority on the prominent clockmakers [[Joseph Knibb]] (1640–1711){{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|pp=122–124}} and [[John Knibb]] (1650–1722).{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|pp=117–122}} Beeson's own collection included five clocks and three watches by John Knibb.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|pp=8–9}} He also developed a special interest in [[turret clock]]s and made an influential study of the clock installed in 1669 at [[Wadham College, Oxford]], which he proposed was made by Joseph Knibb.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}}

Beeson joined the [[Banbury Historical Society]] soon after its foundation in 1958.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} He was Chairman of the BHS 1959–60 and founding editor of its journal ''Cake and Cockhorse'' 1959–62.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} In 1962 the AHS and BHS jointly published the first edition of Beeson's [[monograph]], ''Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400–1850''.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}}

The [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]] had started a small collection of historic clocks and watches in 1924.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=6}} In 1966 Beeson greatly expanded this by presenting the Museum with his own historic collection,{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} which included 42 [[longcase clock]]s, 24 other clocks and 13 watches.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|pp=8–9}} In 1967 the Museum published a second, enlarged{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=4}} edition of his book ''Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400–1850''.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} In 1971 the Museum published a broader study by Beeson, ''English Church Clocks 1280–1850: History and Classification''.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|pp=2–3}} This led the AHS in 1973 to form its turret clock section, of which Beeson became chairman.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}} In 1972 [[Alan Bullock|Lord Bullock]], [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford]] opened the Museum of the History of Science's Beeson Room to house its horological collection.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=6}}

For his final book Beeson returned to one of the castles in France that had interested him and T.E. Lawrence as teenagers. ''Perpignan 1356: The Making of a Tower Clock and Bell for the King's Castle'' is a substantial account of the tower clock and bell made in 1356 for the [[Palace of the Kings of Majorca]] at [[Perpignan]].{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=3}}

==Published works==
Over a period of more than 30 years Beeson published more than 60 scientific articles on tropical forest insects.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} He also edited the Indian forestry journal.{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=2}} Listed below are only the books that Beeson wrote, including journal articles that were republished as books.

'''''Dirty Wars''''' is a 2013 American [[documentary film]], which accompanies the book ''Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battlefield'' by [[Jeremy Scahill]]. The film is directed by [[Richard Rowley (film director)|Richard Rowley]], and written by Scahill and [[David Riker]].

==Production==
Production for the film began in 2010 when Scahill, who worked as a reporter for ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, traveled to Afghanistan with director Richard Rowley, with only a vague idea for what the film would be about; they only decided upon the subject matter after investigating a series of night raids carried out by the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC).&lt;ref name="Moss 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moss |first=Stephen |date=November 24, 2013 |title=Jeremy Scahill: the man exposing the US Dirty War |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/24/jeremy-scahill-exposing-us-dirty-war-afghanistan-pakistan-somalia-yemen |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had no budget, and at the outset Scahill and Rowley traveled to Afghanistan using money from a grant Scahill had received to support his reporting.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Stuart |first=Tessa |date=June 10, 2013 |title=Jeremy Scahill’s "Dirty Wars" And The Very Dark Side Of American Military Intervention |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tessastuart/jeremy-scahills-dirty-wars-and-the-very-dark-side-of-america |newspaper= |location= |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |accessdate=August 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the film was not intended to have Scahill as a narrator or protagonist, instead acting as a "tour guide" as the film traveled between the sites of covert U.S. military action.&lt;ref name="Egner 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Egner |first=Jeremy |date=June 6, 2013 |title=His Target Is Assassinations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/movies/jeremy-scahill-on-his-documentary-dirty-wars.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=August 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Riker was brought on board to assist with writing after an initial four-hour rough cut of the film was put together, and he convinced Scahill and Rowley to make the film more personal.&lt;ref name="Ingersoll 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jeremy-scahill-talks-dirty-wars-black-ops-2013-7 |title=Jeremy Scahill Tells Us How He Uncovered America's Massive, Global Dirty Wars |last1=Ingersoll |first1=Geoffrey |last2=Kelley |first2=Michael B. |last3=Jones |first3=Brian |date=July 16, 2013 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher= |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During filming, Scahill and Rowley traveled to [[Somalia]] to meet [[warlord]]s in different territories of the country. As no American insurance companies would cover them to travel there, they had to get [[kidnap and ransom insurance]] from another country.&lt;ref name="Ingersoll 2013"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Investigative journalist [[Jeremy Scahill]] travels to [[Afghanistan]], [[Yemen]], [[Somalia]], and other countries where the United States has taken military action in the [[War on Terror]]. In Afghanistan, he investigates the United States military and government cover-up of the [[Khataba raid|deaths of five civilians, including two pregnant women]] killed by US soldiers from the [[Joint Special Operations Command]]. After investigating the attack, Scahill travels to other sites of [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]] intervention, interviewing both proponents and opponents, and the survivors, of such raids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dirtywars.org/the-film | title=About the Film | work=dirtywars.org | accessdate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including U.S. Senator [[Ron Wyden]].&lt;ref name="O'Hehir 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/06/09/obamas_dirty_wars_and_a_soiled_presidency/ |title=Obama's "Dirty Wars" — and a soiled presidency |last1=O'Hehir |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |date=June 9, 2013 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |publisher= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scahill also investigates the assassinations of American citizens [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and his son Abdulrahman al-Awlaki,&lt;ref name="Stuart 2013"/&gt; meeting with their family at their home in Yemen. Scahill suggests that the War on Terror is in fact a "self-fulfilling prophecy" and causes the radicalization of Muslims.&lt;ref name="Egner 2013"/&gt; He also discusses the case of Yemeni investigative journalist [[Abdulelah Haider Shaye]] who was detained, tried and sentenced on terrorism-related charges after reporting on American drone strikes.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2013"/&gt;

Over the opening weekend, it grossed an estimated $66,000, a theater average of $16,500.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt; The film opened in British cinemas on {{nowrap|November 29}}, 2013 with showings in nine cities around the country.&lt;ref name="Stop the War"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopwar.org.uk/events/dirty-wars-film-screenings-29-november-11-december|title=Dirty Wars film: Screenings 29 November - 11 December|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=December 2, 2013|website=|publisher=[[Stop the War Coalition]]|accessdate=August 17, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819102815/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/events/dirty-wars-film-screenings-29-november-11-december|archivedate=August 19, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Dirty Wars'' received critical acclaim. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] certified the film as "fresh" with a score of 85% based on 67 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_wars_2013/|title=Dirty Wars (2013)|accessdate=December 4, 2013|publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] rated the film 76 based on 18 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-wars | title=Dirty Wars Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film obtained a high score of 7.5 out of 10 from the aggregation of more than 6000 votes at the [[Internet Movie Database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2532528/ | title=Dirty Wars (2013) | work=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=June 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trevor Johnston found the film to be a "''gripping investigative doc, which plays out like a classic conspiracy thriller as it follows a trail of clues to the heart of darkness behind President Obama’s good-guy facade. Scahill may not have the screen charisma of a Hollywood leading man, but he has the integrity to keep on pushing at closed doors even after threats are made to his personal security. He also widens his focus to include Yemen and Somalia and draws a pattern of state-sanctioned assassination by unchecked US special forces and their mercenary hirelings.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/dirty-wars|title=Dirty Wars|work=Time Out London|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Douglas Valentine wrote "''...the film is so devoid of historical context, and so contrived, as to render it a work of art, rather than political commentary. And as art, it is pure self-indulgence.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dissidentvoice.org/2013/06/dirty-wars-as-self-indulgence/|title=Dirty Wars and Self-indulgence|last=Valentine|first=Douglas|date=June 7, 2013|work=Dissident Voice|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some reviewers criticized the film's focus on Scahill rather than on the issues he covers. Ella Taylor said that "as a journalist Scahill is surely the messenger, not the subject, and the attention he receives in Dirty Wars distracts us from the bigger picture he paints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/06/188991466/covert-conflicts-decried-in-dirty-wars|title=Covert Conflicts, Decried In 'Dirty Wars'|last=Taylor|first=Ella|date=June 6, 2013|work=National Public Radio|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
''Dirty Wars'' was nominated for a 2013 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/86/nominees.html|title=Nominees for the 86th Oscars|work=oscars.org|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Barnett (Sound Designer at Skywalker Sound) won the 2014 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing: Sound Effects, Foley, Dialogue, ADR and Music in a Feature Documentary, given by the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors]] society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpse.org/motion-picture-sound-editor-golden-reel-awards-winners-announced/ 2014 Golden Reel Award Winners: TV/Feature Animation &amp; Documentary Category] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006074628/http://mpse.org/motion-picture-sound-editor-golden-reel-awards-winners-announced/ |date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edelweiss Pirates''' ('''''Edelweißpiraten''''') were a loosely organized group of youth in [[Nazi Germany]]. They emerged in western Germany out of the [[German Youth Movement]] of the late 1930s in response to the strict regimentation of the [[Hitler Youth]]. Similar in many ways to the ''[[Leipzig Meuten]]'', they consisted of young people, mainly between the ages of 14 and 17, who had evaded the Hitler Youth by leaving school (which was allowed at 14) and were also young enough to avoid military conscription, which was only compulsory from the age of 17 onward. The roots and background of the Edelweiss Pirates movement were detailed in the 2004 film ''[[Edelweiss Pirates (film)|Edelweiss Pirates]]'', directed by [[Niko von Glasow]].

==History==
The origins of the ''Edelweißpiraten'' can be traced to the period immediately prior to [[World War II]], as the state-controlled [[Hitler Youth]] was mobilized to [[indoctrinate]] young people, at the expense of the leisure activities previously offered to them. This tension was exacerbated once the war began and youth leaders were conscripted. In contrast, the ''Edelweißpiraten'' offered young people considerable freedom to express themselves and to mingle with members of the opposite sex, whereas [[Nazism|Nazi]] youth movements were strictly segregated by gender, the [[Hitler Youth]] (''Hitler-Jugend'') for boys and the ''[[League of German Girls]]'' (''Bund Deutscher Mädel'') for girls. Although predominantly male, the casual meetings of the ''Edelweißpiraten'' even offered German adolescents an opportunity for sexual experimentation with the opposite sex.{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}} The ''Edelweißpiraten'' used many symbols of the outlawed [[German Youth Movement]], including their tent (the ''[[Kohte]]''), their style of clothing (the ''[[Jungenschaftsjacke]]''), and their songs.{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

The first ''Edelweißpiraten'' appeared in the late 1930s in western Germany, comprising mostly young people between 14 and 18. Individual groups were closely associated with different regions but identifiable by a common style of dress with their own [[edelweiss]] badge and by their opposition to what they saw as the paramilitary nature of the Hitler Youth.&lt;ref name=welch&gt;{{cite book | last = Welch | first = David  | title = The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda | publisher = [[Routledge]] | date = 1993 | pages = 62–63 | isbn = 0-415-09033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subgroups of the ''Edelweißpiraten'' included the ''Navajos'', centred on [[Cologne]], the ''Kittelbach Pirates'' of [[Oberhausen]] and [[Düsseldorf]], and the ''Roving Dudes'' of [[Essen]].&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book | last = Lee | first = Stephen J | title = Hitler and Nazi Germany | publisher = [[Routledge]] | date = 1998 | page = 58 | isbn = 0-415-17988-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one Nazi official in 1941, "Every child knows who the Kittelbach Pirates are. They are everywhere; there are more of them than there are Hitler Youth... They beat up the patrols... They never take no for an answer."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/14/society | type =review | title = Teenage: The Creation of Youth 1875–1945 by Jon Savage | first =Andy | last = Beckett | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] |date=April 14, 2007 |accessdate=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they rejected the Nazis' authoritarianism, the ''Edelweißpiraten''{{'}}s nonconformist behaviour tended to be restricted to petty provocations. Despite this, they represented a group of youth who rebelled against the government's regimentation of leisure and were unimpressed by the propaganda touting ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community").&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

During the war, many ''Edelweißpiraten'' supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and assisted deserters from the German Army. Some groups also collected propaganda leaflets dropped by Allied aircraft and pushed them through letterboxes.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

Apart from gatherings on street corners, the ''Edelweißpiraten'' engaged in hiking and camping trips, defying the restrictions on free movement, which kept them away from the prying eyes of the totalitarian regime.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; They were highly antagonistic to the Hitler Youth, ambushing their patrols and taking great pride in beating them up. One of their slogans was "Eternal War on the Hitler Youth".&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; As one subgroup, the Navajos, sang:

===Nazi response===
The Nazi response to the ''Edelweißpiraten'' was relatively minor before the war, because they were viewed as a minor irritant and it didn't fit in with the policy of selective terror.  As the war went on, and some 'Pirates' activities got more extreme, the punishments did too. Individuals identified by the [[Gestapo]] as belonging to the various gangs were often rounded up and released with their heads shaved to shame them. In some cases, young people were sent to [[concentration camp]]s for youth or temporarily detained in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peukert|first1=Detlev J. K.|title=Inside Nazi Germany: Conformity, Opposition and Racism in Everyday Life|date=1987|publisher=B. T. Batford Ltd|location=London|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 1944, [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered a crackdown on the group and in November of that year, a group of thirteen people, the heads of the ''[[Ehrenfeld Group|Ehrenfelder Gruppe]]'', were publicly hanged in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Education in Nazi Germany | first=Lisa | last=Pine | publisher=Berg | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-84520-264-4 | page=109 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jfW28Uq3_QC&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were former ''Edelweißpiraten''. The ''Edelweißpiraten'' hanged included six teenagers, amongst them [[Barthel Schink|Bartholomäus Schink]], called Barthel, former member of the local Navajos. [[Fritz Theilen]] survived.

Nevertheless, government repression never managed to break the spirit of most groups, which constituted a [[subculture]] that rejected the norms of Nazi society. While the ''Edelweißpiraten'' assisted army deserters and others hiding from the Third Reich, they have yet to receive recognition as a resistance movement (partly because they were viewed with contempt by many of their former Youth Movement comrades, because of their 'proletarian' background and 'criminal' activities), and the families of members killed by the Nazis have as yet received no reparations.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===Post-World War II===
Contrary to what the Allies had hoped, the ''Edelweißpiraten'' were neither pro-British nor pro-American. In the early days of the Allied Occupation, they sought contact with the Occupying Authority to intervene on behalf of friends, and even to propose that they might go on patrol, as did the [[Wuppertal]] ''Edelweißpiraten''.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{cite journal | last = Biddiscombe | first = Perry | title = 'The Enemy of our Enemy': A View of the Edelweiss Piraten from the British and American Archives | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 30 | pages = 37–63| location = | date = 1995 | url = | doi = 10.1177/002200949503000102}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were taken seriously and courted by various factions; the first known pamphlets of the KPD (''[[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]]'') in July 1945 were directed at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Billstein| first = R | title = Das entscheidende Jahr. Sozialdemokratie und Kommunistische Partei in Köln 1945/46| year = 1988 | location = Cologne | page = 143 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a small number of ''Edelweißpiraten'' remained in the Antifascist Youth and the [[Free German Youth]] organizations, the majority turned their back on these bodies as soon as they realized that, in the words of one member, "politics were taking centre stage again". For example, a group in [[Bergisch Gladbach]] disbanded when young people of Communist orientation tried to form a majority in the group.&lt;ref name=perry/&gt;

The ''Edelweißpiraten's'' turning away from the re-authorized political youth groups forced them into the role of social outcasts and brought them into conflict with the Allies. The headquarters of the American Counter-Intelligence Corps in Frankfurt reported in May 1946 that Edelweiss activities were known throughout the British and American Zones.{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

In a trial held by a military court at [[Uelzen]] in April 1946, a juvenile named as Heinz D. was initially sentenced to death, for his "...very active part in carrying out the nefarious schemes of the E. Piraten. An organization such as this might well threaten the peace of Europe." The sentence was commuted the following month to a prison term. In the Soviet Zone, young people suspected of being ''Edelweißpiraten'' were sentenced to a virtually obligatory 25 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Schildt | first1 = Axel  | first2 = Detlef | last2 = Siegfried | title = European Cities, Youth and the Public Sphere in the Twentieth Century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | date = 2005 | location = Munich | page = 48 | isbn = 0-7546-5173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy surrounded the claims that the group was Widerstandskämpfer [resistance fighters] after one member Fritz Theilen published his memoirs in 1984, leading to several legal battles that Theilen won.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/fritz-theilen-member-of-the-edelweiss-pirates-the-children-who-resisted-hitler-7707378.html|title=Fritz Theilen: Member of the Edelweiss Pirates, the children who|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Colognes Mayor [[Jürgen Roters]] presented Theilen and four other survivors the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis''' (28 October 1892 in [[Tilburg]] – 18 May 1965 in [[De Bilt]]) was a Dutch [[historian of science]].

==Career==
He studied mathematics at the [[University of Groningen]] from 1911 to 1918 and titled his Ph.D. thesis "A Contribution to the Knowledge of the Flat Helicoid."&lt;ref name=Hooyk&gt;[[Reijer Hooykaas]], ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'', Vol. 58, No. 2, (Summer, 1967), pp. 223-225&lt;/ref&gt; From 1916 to 1953 he was a [[professor]] and taught [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[cosmography]]. He wrote about [[Archimedes]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s. He advocated changes in the way mathematics was taught to reinforce the formal characteristics of the discipline. In 1950, he was appointed as a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004831 |title=Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis (1892 - 1965) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, he was appointed to teach the history of mathematics and the nature of science at [[Utrecht University]] and in 1955 at [[Leiden University]].

'''GADV-protein world''' is a hypothetical stage of [[abiogenesis]]. GADV stands for the one letter codes of four [[amino acid]]s, namely, [[glycine]] (G), [[alanine]] (A), [[aspartic acid]] (D) and [[valine]] (V), the main components of GADV [[protein]]s. In the GADV-protein world hypothesis, it is argued that the prebiotic chemistry before the emergence of [[gene]]s involved a stage where GADV-proteins were able to pseudo-replicate. This hypothesis is contrary to the [[RNA world]] hypothesis, which is the most accepted theory of abiogenesis.{{sfn|Ikehara|2005}}

== Description ==
The GADV-protein world hypothesis was first proposed by Kenji Ikehara at [[Nara Women's University]]. It is supported by GNC-SNS primitive gene code hypothesis ([[GNC hypothesis]]) also formulated by him. In the GNC hypothesis, the origin of the present standard [[genetic code]] is considered to be the GNC genetic code that includes the [[codon]]s G[[Guanine|G]]C, G[[Cytosine|C]]C, G[[Adenine|A]]C, G[[Uracil|U]]C, respectively coding [[glycine]], [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]], and [[valine]]; it also follows the SNS primitive genetic code that codes ten amino acids, where N denotes arbitrary four [[RNA base]]s and S denotes [[guanine]] (G) and [[cytosine]] (C).

The GADV hypothesis proposes these mechanisms:
* Analysis on present proteins and simulation using chemical factors of amino acid shows GADV-proteins that contains almost the same amount of the four amino acids can form four basic structures of protein, namely, [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and [[hydrophilic]] structures, [[Alpha helix|α-helices]] and [[Beta sheet|β-sheets]].
* Therefore, GADV-proteins polymerized from randomly chosen amino acids from the four choices, probably becoming globular and water-soluble like some present proteins.
* Proteins generated like this have different [[Protein primary structure|primary structures]], but their simple composition leads to formation of similar spherical and water-soluble proteins that have bulky and hydrophobic valines inside and hydrophilic aspartic acids outside.
* GADV-peptides can polymerize by simple cycles of evaporation and hydration. This gives a rationale for the production of GADV-peptides in [[tide pool]]s on the primitive Earth. Moreover, GADV-peptides randomly polymerized as above have catalytic activity to [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] [[peptide bonds]] in bovine [[serum albumin]] and therefore they can catalyze the formation of [[peptide bond]]s as the reverse reaction.
* GADV-proteins can multiply by pseudo-replication in the absence of genes, taking the features above into consideration.

==First Samoan dictionary 1862==
Pratt is particularly notable for being the first person to document the [[Samoan language]]. He authored the first grammar and dictionary of the language, ''A Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, with English and Samoan Vocabulary'', which was first printed in 1862 at the Samoa Mission Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Samoan songs and myths 1891==
He also collected Samoan songs and myths and translated them into a publication ''Some Folk-songs and Myths from Samoa'', published in 1891. In this work is a section ''Samoan Custom: Analogous to those of the [[Israelites]]'', where he wrote about cultural similarities including the importance of the number 7, [[embalming]], natural eloquence, rod or staff of office, heads cut off in war, the use of slings and stones in war, possessions by evil spirits, the 'near sacred' relationships between brothers and sisters, calling the name of the chief who is to drink during ceremony, the giving of names and [[circumcision]].

Pratt's valuable Samoan work records many old words of special interest - specialist terminology, archaic words and names in Samoan tradition. It contains sections on Samoan poetry and proverbs, and an extensive grammatical sketch.&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;{{cite web

{{cquote|''For my own amusement in 1875 I wrote out a syntax of the Samoan Grammar. I was led to do this by observing, while reading Nordheimer's Hebrew Grammar, that the Samoan, in many points, resembled the [[Hebrew]]. Shortly afterwards the Rev. S. J. Whitmee asked me to contribute the Samoan part of a comparative Malayo-Polynesian Dictionary. I at once, with the aid of pundits, commenced revising the first edition of my Dictionary, which was printed at the Samoan Mission Press in 1862. I read through the [[Hawaii]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Tahiti]], and [[Fiji]] Dictionaries, and from these I obtained some words which occur also in the Samoan dialect, but which had been overlooked in the first edition. I also culled words and examples from Samoan genealogical accounts, songs, traditionary tales, proverbs, &amp;c. In this way I have been enabled to add over four thousand new words or new meanings....That all Samoan words have been collected it would be useless to affirm. I would fain have had several years during which to go on collecting, but must needs be content to go to press with such as I have, as a new edition is called for, the former being out of print.''|4=George Pratt, Matautu, Island of Savai'i, June 5, 1876.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;}}

The '''great man theory''' is a 19th-century idea according to which [[philosophy of history|history]] can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or [[hero]]es; highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal [[charisma]], [[intelligence]], [[wisdom]], or political skill used their [[power (philosophy)|power]] in a way that had a decisive historical impact. The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer [[Thomas Carlyle]], but in 1860 [[Herbert Spencer]] formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Cannero"&gt;[[Robert L. Carneiro]] "[http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_2/5_2_2.pdf Herbert Spencer as an Anthropologist]" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', vol. 5, 1981, pp. 171–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rives La Monte ''Socialism: Positive and Negative'', Chicago: [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company]], 1912, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook"&gt;[[Sidney Hook]] (1950) ''The Hero in History'', New York: [[Humanities Press]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Carlyle stated that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men", reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their personal attributes and divine inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Carlyle, "The Hero as Divinity" in: ''Heroes and Hero-Worship '' (1840).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CultLit&gt;[[Hirsch, E.D.]] ''[http://www.bartleby.com/59/17/greatmantheo.html The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Third Edition)]'', [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], Boston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book [[On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History|''On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History'']], Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions of "heroes", giving detailed analysis of the influence of several such men (including [[Muhammad]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Rousseau]], [[Pericles]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Richard Wagner]]). Carlyle also felt that the study of great men was "profitable" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's true nature.&lt;ref name=Carlyle&gt;Carlyle, Thomas. ''[https://www.questia.com/read/1444983# On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History]'', Fredrick A. Stokes &amp; Brother, New York, 1888. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

American scholar [[Frederick Adams Woods]] supported the great man theory in his work ''The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History''.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, F. A. 1913. The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History. New York, NY: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th century until the French revolution in the late 18th century and their influence on the course of historical events.

This theory is usually contrasted with "[[history from below]]", which emphasizes the life of the masses over the leader. An overwhelming wave of smaller events causes certain developments to occur. The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories. For example, all information on the post-Roman "[[Migrations Period]]" of European History is compiled under the biography of [[Attila the Hun]]. This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as [[Leon Bloy]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]],  [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]] and [[Max Weber]],&lt;ref&gt;As to Hegel and Nietzsche: Edelstein, Alan (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=enzisDOv4jUC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji7dji45TYAhUuSt8KHS7KArwQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Man%20Theory%22%20heroic%20history&amp;f=false ''Everybody is Sitting on the Curb: How and why America's Heroes Disappeared''] Greenwood. {{isbn|9780275953645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As to Kierkegaard: Evjen, John Oluf (1938) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LRz5Rihgyb4C&amp;dq=%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history+Kierkegaard&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Kierkegaard ''The Life of J.

Stuckenberg: Theologian, Philosopher, Sociologist, Friend of Humanity''] Luther Free Church Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As to Spengler, Nietsche, Boy and Weber: Saul, John Ralston (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8NIYDjTZwn4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22Great+Man+Theory%22+heroic+history+Spengler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlyvn05ZTYAhWwSd8KHevGB9wQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Spengler&amp;f=false ''The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense''] New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 58 {{isbn|9781476718941}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it fell out of favor after [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'', Nietzsche writes that "the goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nietzsche and Antiquity: His Reaction and Response to the Classical Tradition|author=Bishop, P.|date=2004|publisher=Camden House|isbn=9781571132826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vn3GBIA7wUYC|page=94|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Kierkegaard writes that "to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime and the pedestrian—that only these knights of faith can do—this is the one and only prodigy."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Fear and Trembling''. Preliminary Expectoration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel, proceeding from [[Providentialism |providentialist]] theory, argued that "what is real is reasonable" and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit's agents. Hegel wrote: "Such are great historical men—whose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will of the World-Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. W. F. [1837].  Philosophy of History, trans. J. Sibree (New York: Dover, 1956), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Hegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only uncovers the inevitable future.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]] was a contemporary critic of Carlyle's great man theory.]]

One of the most forceful critics of Carlyle's formulation of the great man theory was [[Herbert Spencer]], who believed that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals was a hopelessly primitive, childish, and unscientific position.&lt;ref name=HeroMyths&gt;Segal, Robert A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JbE5UxcCr10C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22herbert+spencer%22+%22genesis+of+the+great+man%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9Y0ClaQ1gQ&amp;sig=cacRypZdX1McozPwmBuTDwJBqoU#PPA3,M1  Hero Myths]'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that the men Carlyle called "great men" were merely products of their social environment:

{{quote|You must admit that the genesis of a great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown.&amp;nbsp;... Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.|Herbert Spencer, ''The Study of Sociology''&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756 The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' features criticism of Great Man Theories as a recurring theme in the philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great individuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only ''history's slaves'' realizing the decree of Providence.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, L. 2010. War and Peace. Oxford, MA: Oxford University Press Bk. IX, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] in his lecture "Great Men and Their Environment"&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 2005 [1880]. Great Men and Their Environment. Kila, MT: Kessinger Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; underlined the importance of the Great Man's congruence with the surroundings (in the broad sense), though his ultimate point was that environments and individuals shape each other reciprocally, just as environments and individual members of animal species do according to [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] theory.

Among modern critics of the theory, one, [[Sidney Hook]], is supportive of the idea; he gives credit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book ''The Hero in History'' is devoted to the role of the [[hero]] and in history and influence of the outstanding [[person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1943. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Grinin]]  defines a historical figure (a great man) thus:
{{quote|Owing to his personal features, or to a chance, or to his social standing, or to the peculiarity of the epoch, an individual by the very fact of his existence, by his ideas or actions (or inaction) directly or indirectly, during his lifetime or after his death may have such an influence upon his own or another society which can be recognized significant as he left a noticeable mark (positive, negative or unambiguous) in history and in the further development of society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/ "The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration"]. ''Social Evolution &amp; History'', Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136). pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So, he concludes that the role of great man depends on a number of factors, not on none at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4768">'''Haim Nathan Dembitzer''' (June 29, 1820, [[Krakow]]&lt;ref name="Chaim NattanDembitzerBirthCert"&gt;[http://www.archiwum.krakow.pl The State Archive of Krakow]: "Jewish Civil Registry of Krakow", Town: Krakow, Year: 1820, Akt (record) #: 145, Record Type: birth, Surname: Dembitzer, Given Name: Chaim Nattan, Father: Salomon, Mother: Nechel, Mother's Father: Moyzes.&lt;/ref&gt; – November 20, 1892, Krakow)  was a Polish [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] [[rabbi]] and historian.

==Biography==
His father, Jekuthiel Solomon, a scholarly merchant who claimed he was a descendant of R. [[Moses Isserles]], died in 1833,&lt;ref name="SalomonDembitzerDeathCert"&gt;[http://www.archiwum.krakow.pl The State Archive of Krakow]: "Jewish Civil Registry of Krakow", Town: Krakow, Year: 1833, Akt (record) #: 109, Record Type: death, Surname: Dembitzer, Given Name: Salomon, Age: 44&lt;/ref&gt; aged forty-four. On Jun 11, 1841 he married Doba Deutscher.&lt;ref name="DembitzerDeutscherMarriageCert"&gt;[http://www.archiwum.krakow.pl The State Archive of Krakow]: "Jewish Civil Registry of Krakow", Town: Krakow, Year: 1841, Akt (record) #: 41, Record Type: marriage, Date: Jun 11, Groom's Name: Chaim Nathan Dembitzer, Groom's Age: 20, Groom's Father: Salomon, Groom's Mother: Mecheli Mozes, Bride's Name: Doba Deutscher, Bride's Age: 16, Bride's Father: Mojzesz Eliasz, Bride's Mother: Gitli Rebeki&lt;/ref&gt; While diligently occupied with his [[Talmudical]] studies, he came across the "[http://worldcat.org/oclc/20414324 Tzemach Dawid]," a chronological work by [[David Gans]], which aroused his interest in Jewish biography and history. He received his ordination as rabbi from [[Solomon Kluger]], [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]], and [[Dob Berush Meisels]], the last named of whom was rabbi of Cracow until 1854. Dembitzer sided nevertheless with Meisel's rival, Saul Landau, in the quarrel about the rabbinate of Cracow. In 1856 Dembitzer became a dayyan in his native city, and was, like his older brother Jacob, advanced to the position of rosh [[Beth din]], which he held till his death. In 1874 he visited [[Germany]] and made the acquaintance of [[Leopold Zunz]] and other Jewish scholars, with whom he corresponded on historical subjects.

==Works==
Dembitzer's earlier works were all on [[halakic]] subjects, on which he was a recognized authority. His "[http://worldcat.org/oclc/123274176 Maginne Eretz Yisrael]" ([[responsa]], [[Lemberg]], 1852); "Dibre Hen," which appeared as a supplement to Solomon Kluger's "Abodat ha-Kodesh" ([[Zolkiev]], 1863); and "Liwyat Hen" (Cracow, 1882) belong to that class. But the last-named, a critical commentary on the work "RABYH" of [[Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi]], which Dembitzer [http://worldcat.org/oclc/19140488 published] from a manuscript, contains much valuable material for the history of the [[Tosafists]], which is interspersed among the [[pilpul]]istic arguments of the main subject. His chief historical work, "[http://worldcat.org/oclc/122859818 Kelilat Yofi]," of which the first part, containing biographies of the rabbis of Lemberg and of other Polish communities, appeared in 1888, and the second part, also biographical and historical, in 1893 (Cracow), is an important contribution to the science of Judaism. He is also the author of "[http://worldcat.org/oclc/19143898 Michtave Bikoret]," a valuable correspondence with the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]] about the [[Council of Four Lands]] ("Otzar ha-Sifrut," iv. 193-243; also published separately, Cracow, 1892), and of a biography of the [[Tosafot|Tosafist]] Joseph Porat, which appeared posthumously in "Ha-Hoker," ii. 48-59. The "[http://hebrewbooks.org/20497 Mappelet Ir ha-Tzedek]" (1878), a severe and vindictive criticism of J. M. Zunz's "[http://worldcat.org/oclc/123344887 Ir ha-Tzedek]" on the rabbis of Cracow, was likewise written by him, although the name of Joel Dembitzer, his younger brother, appears on the title-page as the nominal author.

'''Pir Hassam-ud-Din Rashidi''' ({{lang-sd|پير حسام الدين راشدي}}) (September 20, 1911 &amp;ndash; April 1, 1982) was a [[Pakistan]]i [[historian]] and scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/03/23/local17.htm KARACHI: Seminar on Rashdi brothers] Dawn 23 March 2006. Retrieved 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1911 near Nusrat Station, [[Ratodero Taluka]], [[Larkana District]], he was the son of Muhammad Hamid Shah Rashidi and the younger brother of [[Ali Muhammad Rashidi|Pir Ali Muhammad Rashidi]].  He was an internationally acclaimed scholar of [[Sindhi literature]] as well as a historian, journalist and biographer.

==Biography==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Rashidi was born at the house of Mohammad Hamid Shah Rashidi, village Behman, near Nusrat Station, Ratodero Taluka, Larkana District. He took his primary education from Molvi Muhammad Soomar and Muhammad Elyas. Then he went to Syed Ali Shah Lakyari. He passed class 4th and Sikander Nama from those teachers. Rashidi got English education from the [[station master]] of Nusrat Station. He was very found of studying books and newspapers, that's why he got more and more information and was able to understand [[Persian language|Persian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Urdu]] languages.

Rashidi began working in [[journalism]] at the age of 18. First, he joined the newspaper ''Jagan''. He became the editor of ''Al-Manar Newspaper'' at Sukkur in 1930. At last he started his own newspaper, ''Sitar-e-Sindh'' in collaboration with his elder brother.

He visited many countries with delegations of scholars. He was awarded ''Nishan-e-Spas'' by the Iranian government in 1963, and ''Tamgh-e-Imtiaz'' from the government of [[Pakistan]] the next year.

He published more than 40 books on topics ranging from history and archeology to biography, and collections of essays and lectures.

Rashidi died on April 1, 1982. He is buried at [[Allama Makhdoom Muhammad Hashim Thattvi]]'s shrine in [[Makli]] [[Thatta]].

==History==
{{further|History of Somali Bantus in Maine|Horn Africans in the United States}}
[[File:Somwmnlew.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Somali people|Somali]] woman in Lewiston.]]
In the 2000s, [[Somalis|Somali]] immigrants in the United States began a secondary migration to Maine from other states due to the area's low crime rate, good schools and cheap housing.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;[http://www.bates.edu/pix/PerceivedBarriers09Jan20.pdf Perceived Barriers to Somali Immigrant Employment in Lewiston - A Supplement to Maine’s Department of Labor Report]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2002,  Lewiston Mayor Laurier T. Raymond wrote an [[open letter]] addressed to leaders of the Somali community, predicting a negative impact on the city's social services and requesting that they discourage further relocation to Lewiston. The letter angered some people and prompted some community leaders and residents to speak out against the mayor, drawing national attention. Demonstrations were held in Lewiston, both by those who supported the immigrants' presence and those who opposed it.&lt;ref name="Dgbtlto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=James|title=Diversity group brings The Letter' to Owatonna|url=http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/archives/article_016b301f-06e7-530b-b57a-04aa82d70099.html|accessdate=4 July 2014|agency=Faribault Daily News|date=24 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mogbuscen1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Somali-owned Mogadishu Business Center in Lewiston.]]
In January 2003, a small [[white supremacist]] group demonstrated in Lewiston in support of the mayor, prompting a simultaneous counter-demonstration of about 4,000 people at [[Bates College]] and the organization of the "Many and One Coalition".&lt;ref name="Dgbtlto"/&gt; Only 32 attended the rally by the white supremacist group. The mayor was out of state on the day of the rallies, while governor [[John Baldacci]] and other officials attended.

In 2006, a severed frozen pig's head was  thrown into a Lewiston [[mosque]] while about 40 men were praying.

In June 2011, the ''Lewiston Sun Journal'' also noted the growing number of Somali recent immigrants earning high school degrees, with more enrolling in local community colleges. The university students consist of both adult undergraduate and continuing education pupils, as well as high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/1044488 For Somali grad, Lewiston feels like home] - ''[[Lewiston Sun Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mssgfs"&gt;[http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/1040259 More Somali students graduate, find success] - ''[[Lewiston Sun Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, immigrants from Somalia also led [[Lewiston High School]]'s ''Blue Devils'' boys soccer team to win the state championships under coach Mike McGraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Goal: A Coach, a Team, and the Game that Brought a Divided Town Together|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/amy-bass/one-goal/|website=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Sombuslstr.jpg|thumb|upright|A Somali shop on Lisbon Street.]]
In 2011, there were an estimated 5,000 Somali immigrants in Lewiston.&lt;ref name="Mhctsous"/&gt; Around 5,000 Somalis also resided in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]].&lt;ref name="Mangsvscp"/&gt; According to the Immigrant Resource Center, there were approximately 7,500 immigrants from East Africa in [[Androscoggin County, Maine|Androscoggin County]] where Lewiston is located, including individuals from Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics - Maine|url=http://www.ircofmaine.org/statistics.html|publisher=Immigrant Resource Center of Maine|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalis have opened up community centers to cater to their community. In 2001, the non-profit organization United Somali Women of Maine (USWM) was founded in Lewiston, seeking to promote the empowerment of Somali women and girls across the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uswofmaine.org/ United Somali Women of Maine] website&lt;/ref&gt; The Somali Community Resource Center also provides English and citizenship classes among other services to Portland's resident Somalis, as does the Somali Cultural &amp; Development Association.&lt;ref name="Mangsvscp"/&gt;

As of 2014, the most common non-English language spoken by students of the [[Lewiston Public Schools]] is [[Somali language|Somali]]. Speakers make up around 90% of the district's pupils who do not speak English as a native language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewistonpublicschools.org/~publicannouncements/FOV1-00068613/RFP%20ELL%20Audit%20%20Final%204.28.14.pdf REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS  Review of English Language Development Program and Services]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6a641KJHm Archive]). [[Lewiston Public Schools]]. Retrieved on July 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commerce==
In August 2010, the ''[[Lewiston Sun Journal]]'' reported that Somali entrepreneurs had helped reinvigorate downtown Lewiston by opening dozens of shops in previously closed storefronts. Amicable relations were also reported by the local merchants of French-Canadian descent and the Somali storekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/897656 Somali stores bring people back to Lisbon Street] Lewiston Sun-Journal, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 2010, several Somali immigrants, now citizens of the United States and residents of Portland, filed to run for the [[Maine Legislature]]. Mohammed Dini ran in District 119 in a [[Maine Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] primary, and Badr Sharif ran in the [[Maine Republican Party|Republican Party]] primary for District 116; both candidates were defeated in primary challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforecaster.net/node/54789 Somali immigrants eye Portland legislative seats] Portland Forecaster, April 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Portland's Somali community led a campaign to permit non-[[Citizenship|citizens]] to vote in municipal elections.&lt;ref name="Mangsvscp"/&gt;

Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election of [[Donald Trump]], the federal government released [[Executive Order 13780]], a three-month travel restriction against citizens of six Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Matt|last1=Zapotosky|first2=David|last2=Nakamura|first3=Abigail|last3=Hauslohne|title=Revised executive order bans travelers from six Muslim-majority countries from getting new visas|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-executive-order-bans-travelers-from-six-muslim-majority-countries-applying-for-visas/2017/03/06/3012a42a-0277-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html|date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalis and other immigrants in Lewiston as well as local residents worried that the temporary decision had put a strain on communal living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinckley|first1=Story|title=In one town, how Mainers and new immigrants learned to coexist – until Trump|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2017/0306/In-one-town-how-Mainers-and-new-immigrants-learned-to-coexist-until-Trump|website=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the geographical area}}
[[File:Atmospheric circulation.svg|right|thumb|300px|A diagram showing the relative positions of the Horse latitudes]]
'''Hoarse [[latitudes]]''' or '''subtropical highs''' are [[Subtropics|subtropical]] [[latitude]]s  between 30 and 35 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s both north and south where Earth's atmosphere is dominated by the  [[subtropical high]], an area of [[high pressure area|high pressure]], which suppresses precipitation and cloud formation, and has variable winds mixed with calm winds.

The horse latitudes are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of air from high-altitude currents moving toward the poles. After reaching the earth's surface, this air spreads toward the equator as part of the prevailing trade winds or toward the poles as part of the westerlies. The belt in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is sometimes called the "calms of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]]" and that in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] the "calms of [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]]".

The consistently warm, dry, and sunny conditions of the horse latitudes are the main cause for the existence of the world's major non-polar deserts, such as the [[Sahara Desert]] in Africa, the [[Arabian Desert|Arabian]] and [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] deserts in the Middle East, the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] and [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]] deserts in the southwestern [[United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], all in the Northern Hemisphere; and the [[Atacama Desert]], the [[Kalahari Desert]], and the [[Australian Desert]] in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Etymology==
A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the "dead [[horse]]" ritual of seamen (see [[Flogging a dead horse#Earlier meaning|Beating a dead horse]]). In this practice, the seaman paraded a straw-stuffed [[effigy]] of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard.  Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage, and they frequently spent their pay all at once, resulting in a period of time without income. If they got advances from the ship's paymaster, they would incur debt. This period was called the "dead horse" time, and it usually lasted a month or two. The seaman's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the "dead horse" debt. As west-bound shipping from [[Europe]] usually reached the subtropics at about the time the "dead horse" was worked off, the latitude became associated with the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Peter. ''The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea'', London, Oxford University Press, 1976. pp. 233, 399&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative theory, of sufficient popularity to serve as an example of [[folk etymology]], is that the term horse latitudes originates from when the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] transported horses by ship to their colonies in the West Indies and Americas. Ships often became becalmed in mid-ocean in this latitude, thus severely prolonging the voyage; the resulting water shortages made it impossible for the crew to keep the horses alive, and they would throw the dead or dying animals overboard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. New York: Columbia University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A third explanation, which simultaneously explains both the northern and southern horse latitudes and does not depend on the length of the voyage or the port of departure, is based on maritime terminology: a ship was said to be 'horsed' when, although there was insufficient wind for sail, the vessel could make good progress by latching on to a strong [[ocean current|current]]. This was suggested by Edward Taube in his article "The Sense of "Horse" in the Horse Latitudes" (''Journal of Geography'', October 1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-hor3.htm|title=World Wide Words|last=|first=|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued the maritime use of 'horsed' described a ship that was being carried along by an ocean current or tide in the manner of a rider on horseback. The term had been in use since the end of the seventeenth century. Furthermore, ''The India Directory'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India Directory, or,  Directions For Sailing To And From The East Indies, China, Australia, Cape of Good Hope, Brazil and the Interjacent Ports...|last=Horsburgh|first=James|publisher=W. H. Allen|year=1836|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its entry for [[Fernando de Noronha]], an island off the coast of Brazil, mentions it had been visited frequently by ships "occasioned by the currents having horsed them to the westward".

==Cultural references==
[[Horse_Latitudes_(song)|"Horse Latitudes,"]] [[The Doors]] song, a spoken-word piece written by [[Jim Morrison]], from their second album, [[Strange Days (album)|''Strange Days,'']] (1967), evokes the second explanation above. Morrison wrote the prose piece when he was 12 years old.

'''Hristo Silyanov''' (1880 in [[Istanbul]],  [[Ottoman Empire]] &amp;ndash; 1939 in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]) ({{lang-bg|Христо Силянов}}) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[revolutionary]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HElykp392AgC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=christo+siljanov+bulgarien&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UdKpCwRcf3&amp;sig=4YxR1zUxJFPjcasuTF4DKP70N2E&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=8uHASdn9KpGPsAbon6StDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Die Jungtürken und die Mazedonische Frage (1890-1918), Mehmet Hacısalihoğlu, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2003, ISBN 3-486-56745-4, p. 20.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[historian]] and [[memoirist]]. He was among the activists of the [[Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees]] and in his memoirs uniquely described  the history of the organization in its early period.
[[File:Siljanov ovm1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The cover of the first volume of the book ''The Liberation Struggles of Macedonia'' by Hristo Silyanov.]]

Silyanov was born in a rich family in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. His father was a [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] from [[Ohrid]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and his mother was [[Greeks|Greek]]. He studied in Istanbul and [[Thessaloniki]], but graduated from the Bulgarian school in [[Bitola]]. Later Silyanov worked as the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]]'s teacher in various towns in Ottoman Macedonia. After his participation in [the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] (IMARO), he joined the [[cheta]] lead by [[Marko Lerinski]]. As result of a severe illness in 1902, Silyanov moved to Sofia for treatment and from there criticized sharply the decision made by IMARO's Central Committee in Thessaloniki concerning the [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising]]. However, in 1903 he was elected secretary of the Preobrazhenie Uprising committee in a session near [[Malko Tarnovo]]. During the Uprising he was a member of [[Mihail Gerdzhikov]]'s cheta and participated in the battles in [[Strandzha]] for the taking of [[Tsarevo|Vasiliko]] and [[Ahtopol]].

After the Uprising, he graduated in history from [[Sofia University]] and afterwards specialized in [[Switzerland]]. In 1908 Siljanov was elected to the leading body of IMARO and made unsuccessful attempts to save the unity of the organization. During the Balkan Wars he was the leader of a cheta in Southern Macedonia and supported the Greek and later the Bulgarian Army during their invasions. During the [[First World War]], he was imprisoned in Sofia as a [[Russophilia|Russophile]], when Bulgaria was fighting against Russia. After the wars he settled in Sofia and worked there as a writer, publicist and journalist. Later he also became a politician and a member of the [[Macedonian Scientific Institute]]. His son Evgeny Silyanov was a prominent Bulgarian diplomat.

[[Silyanov Peak]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after Hristo Silyanov.

{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}
'''Krishnaattam''' ([[Malayalam]]: കൃഷ്ണാട്ടം, [[IAST]]: Kṛṣṇaāṭṭaṃ) is a temple art in [[Kerala]], India. It is a dance drama and presents the story of [[Krishna]] in a series of eight plays and was created by [[Manaveda]] (1585–1658 AD), the then [[Zamorin]] Raja of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in northern [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chintha.com/kerala/krishnanattam-history-origin.html|title=Krishnanattam - History and Origin - chintha|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight plays are: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehenseive Study of Indian Folk Music and Culture, Volume 11,page 228&lt;/ref&gt; It  survives in its glory at the [[Guruvayur temple|Guruvayur Sri Krishna temple]] ([[Thrissur]] district, Kerala, India).

The troupe of players, once maintained by [[Zamorin of Calicut]] came to [[Guruvayur Devaswom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guruvayurdevaswom.nic.in/krattam.html|title=[www.guruvayurdevaswom.org] - KRISHNANATTAM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1958.The only troupe of artists are well maintained by devaswom till date.

==Origin==
Krishnanattam is based on Krishnagiti (1654 AD) written by [[Manaveda]], [[Zamorin of Calicut]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Indian theatre ,vol 1,page 93&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the Zamorin had a vision of Krishna who gave the king a [[peacock]] feather, which became the living symbol of this dance-drama. Krishnanattam players wore a peacock feather and thus commemorated the vision of the chieftain.&lt;ref&gt;The Contribution of Kerala to Sanskrit Literature, K. Kunjunni Raja - 1980,page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legend==
[[File:Krishnanattam Mudra.jpg|thumb|Krishnanattam Mudra]]

King [[Manaveda]] told Vilwamangalam about his ambition to view Krishna. The next day the Swamiyar told him that Guruvayurappan has given his consent and [[Manaveda]] can see [[Guruvayurappan]] playing in the early hours of the morning at the platform of the Elanji tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangeethasabha.blogspot.in/2010/08/manavedans-krishnageethi-story.html|title=Manavedan's  'Krishnageethi'-the story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could only see and not touch Him. When as per this agreement, [[Manaveda]] saw [[Guruvayurappan]] in the form of little child Sri Krishna, he was so excited that he forgot himself and, rushed to embrace little Sree [[Krishna]]. Guruvayoorappan immediately disappeared saying, "Vilwamangalam did not tell me that this will happen".  However, [[Manaveda]] got one [[peacock feather]] from the head gear of Bhagavan [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chintha.com/kerala/krishnanattam-history-origin.html|title=Krishnanattam - History and Origin - chintha|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The peacock feather was incorporated in the headgear for the character of Sri Krishna in the dance drama Krishnanattam based on his own text krishnageeti which is composed of 8 chapters . It was performed near the sanctum sanctorum of the [[Guruvayur]] Temple. On the ninth day, Avatharam was repeated as the [[Zamorin]] felt that it was not auspicious to end the series with the demise of Lord Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Bhavan's journal ,vol 33,page 97&lt;/ref&gt; The blessed art form is still maintained by [[Guruvayur devaswom]] and staged as an offering by [[Devotional cults in India|devotees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=Krishnanattam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uFrvPA7_mL&amp;sig=mJYxmPjdVMTSnhoXj25qkOYFYoA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L74pUcwMhdatB8ONgMgL&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzhu#v=onepage&amp;q=Krishnanattam&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|first=|last=Ayyappappanikkar|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
Samoothiri Manavedan Raja (1585–1658 AD) had education from Anayath Krishna pisharody and Desamangalath varrier.

He wrote Poorva bharatha champu (Sanskrit) in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;Krsngitih of Manaveda, Indira Gandhi National Center for Arts, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; He completed Krishnanattam on 16 November 1653.&lt;ref name="malayalamresourcecentre1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/culture/artforms/krishnanaattam/krishnanaattam.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704045348/http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/culture/artforms/krishnanaattam/krishnanaattam.html |archivedate=4 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His statue was installed near 'Panjajanyam' guest house in [[Guruvayur]].

==Krishnageethi==
The [[Sanskrit]] text based on which Krishnanattam was created was written on A.D 1653, aged 68.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham - 1995,The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, page 614&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of eight plays: [[Avataram]], [[Kaliyamardanam (play)|Kaliyamardanam]], [[Rasakrida]], [[Kamsavadham]], [[Swayamvaram (play)|Swayamvaram]], [[Banayuddham]], [[Vividavadham]], and [[Swargarohanam]].It is based on 10th and 11th skandhas of [[Bhagavata Purana]] dealing solely the story of [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;Martha Bush Ashton-Sikora, Robert Peter Sikora,Krishnattam, page 201&lt;/ref&gt; It has also gained inspirations from [[Gita Govinda]] of [[Jayadeva]], [[Sree krishna vilaasam]] [[mahakavya]] and [[Narayaniyam]] of [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guruvayur.com/Krishnanattam.htm|title=Welcome to Guruvayur.. The Bhooloka vaikunda ....|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening [[sloka meter|sloka]] of Krishnanattam is
*{{transl|san|Jagathi sukritilokai: nandithaananthidaasa}}
*{{transl|san|Kalaviranithavamsiibhasamanaasamana}}|
*{{transl|san|Pashupayuvathibhogya devathaadevathaa saa}}
*{{transl|san|Sajalajaladhapaliimechaka me chakaasthu}}&lt;ref name="malayalamresourcecentre1"/&gt;

Apart from such slokas it is also adorned by many padyageethams like that of [[Gita Govinda]] of [[Jayadeva]].Krishnagiti is a masterpiece work in [[sanskrit]] by a [[keralite]].

==The stories==
[[File:Krishnanattam 1.ogg|thumb|Staged at Melpathur auditorium during utsavam]]The eight plays are: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kerala.me/art_krishnanaattam.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811155136/http://kerala.me/art_krishnanaattam.php |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; its easily memorised by a [[mnemonic]] "a-ka-ra-ka-swa-bha-vi-swa".On the ninth day, Avatharam is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of South Asian Literature.Vol 10(1997),page 65&lt;/ref&gt;
The various benefits of Krishnanattam as an offering are listed here.

#Avatharam for a birth of a child.
#Kaliyamardhanam to remove the effect of [[poison]].
#Rasakreeda well being of unmarried girls, to end disputes between [[wikt:couple|couples]].
#Kamsavaddham to remove [[enemy|enemies]].
#Swayamvaram for a happy [[matrimony]].
#Bana yuddham to remove impoverishment, for good farm production.
#Vividha vadham to eliminate poverty and increase yield from farms.
#Swargarohanam for [[peace]] of a departed [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guruvayuronline.com/index.php/temple/temple-offerings/special-offerings/179-krishnanattam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costumes, Makeup and related Rituals==
All four aspects of a drama,as told by [[Bharata Muni]]-viz, Angika, Vachika, Aharya and Satvika are well coordinated in it.

The teachers and artists themselves made the [[costumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections |author=Ayyappappanikkar |page=223 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;dq=manaveda#v=onepage&amp;q=manaveda&amp;f=false|isbn=9788126003655 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic costume differed for male and female characters. The dress of male characters consisted of
#a starched gathered [[petticoat]]
#a gathered white skirt with orange/orange-red and black horizontal stripes near the bottom
#[[bell (instrument)|bell]]s attached to leather pads to tie below the knees
#a long-sleeved shirt open at the back, secured by ties
#a breast-plate
#chest [[ornament (art)|ornament]]s of [[beads]] and fresh [[flora]]
#a girdle
#upper arm and wrist ornaments
#one shawl or more with a mirror at each end
#ear and forehead ornaments; and
#a headdress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justkerala.in/culture/kerala-dance-forms/krishnanattam|title=Krishnanattam Temple Dance Kerala - Krishnattam Traditional Dance of Kerala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the female characters the basic costume included
#a long, almost floor-length white gathered skirt with red border, wrapped so that the material crossed in the back
#a long sleeved blouse which was open in the back, secured by ties
#a girdle
#arm ornaments
#a wooden breast plate with the breasts covered in red cloth and with ornamentation above and below the breasts.

Female characters tie strings of [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s around their ankles. These are called chilanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetsinfolab.com/horizonguruvayur.com/krishnanattam.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411160507/http://www.planetsinfolab.com/horizonguruvayur.com/krishnanattam.html |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors used any or three colours for their basic make-up.
#[[pazhuppu]], an orange with more red than yellow
#[[minukku]], an orange with more yellow than red
#[[Paccha]], a particular shade of green which has more yellow than blue. If he was to wear a chutti the chutti artist applies it. The chutti was two white protruding borders which extended from ear to ear along the jaw and chin line.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Oriental Research'', Volume 12, [[University of Madras]], page 223-229&lt;/ref&gt;

The green for [[Krishna]] as a young child has more yellow than blue. Before applying make-up the actor prostrated himself before the oil lamp and thought of the God [[Guruvayoorappan]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Krishnanattam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QmYCmh4NWk&amp;sig=B5HTS2qrViOjypMNOswO7ehWhWI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3rwpUZy5LYPprQe62IHADQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADha#v=onepage&amp;q=Krishnanattam&amp;f=false|title=Dance Dialects of India|first=Ragini|last=Devi|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sacred part of the Krishnanattam costume is the head gear.&lt;ref&gt;A panorama of Indian dances,Yu. Es Kr̥ṣṇarāv, Yu. Ke Candrabhāgādēvi,1983,page 43&lt;/ref&gt; There are two basic kinds of head dress; a mudi, 'hair that has been wound into a bun and a kiriitam 'a [[Coronet|crown]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/12-09/features1569.htm|title=The Sampradaya Sun - Independent Vaisnava News - Feature Stories - December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Training for artists starts as early as 10 years for 'vesham' and music,5 years for [[Madhalam]] and chutti.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.traveladda.com › South india › Kerala › Dance and music&lt;/ref&gt; Oil massage and sternous exercises makes an artist well enough to perform on stage.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"/&gt;

'''Michael Bar-Zohar''' ({{lang-he|מיכאל בר-זהר}}, born 30 January 1938) is an [[Israel]]i [[historian]], [[novelist]] and politician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/15636/Michael_BarZohar/index.aspx Michael Bar-Zohar, HarperCollins]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Knesset]] on behalf of the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] and [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] in the 1980s and early 1990s.

==Biography==
Born in [[Bulgaria]], Bar-Zohar [[aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel in 1948. He attended High School Heh in [[Tel Aviv]] and went on to study economics and international relations at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He also studied at the Institute of Political Science in the [[University of Paris]], where he earned a PhD.

He became science editor for ''[[Davar]]'', a weekly newspaper in 1958, but left the job the following year. Between 1960 and 1964 he wrote for ''[[LaMerhav]]'', an Israeli newspaper in [[Paris]]. In 1967 he became a spokesman for the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Defense]], and later lectured at the [[University of Haifa]] between 1970 and 1973.

===Political career===
Bar-Zohar became involved in politics in the 1960s, and joined [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] upon its foundation in 1965. Rafi merged into the Alignment in 1968, forming formed the Labor Party faction, with Bar-Zohar becoming a Labor Party member, eventually joining its central committee.

He was first elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]] on the Alignment's list and was a member of the Education and Culture Committee. Although he lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 election]], he regained it in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], after which he was appointed chairman of the Education and Culture Committee. As a protégé of [[Moshe Dayan]], Bar-Zohar was known as a hawk within the Labor Party. He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992 election]] and did not return to the Knesset, despite running in Labor Party primaries in the 1990s. In 2008 he joined the new [[Yisrael Hazaka]] party formed by [[Ephraim Sneh]], which failed to win a seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 election]].

===Writings===
In 1965 Bar-Zohar won the [[Sokolov Award]] for his achievements as a journalist. He published several books, including biographies of [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Shimon Peres]], several books about the Israeli security organizations, and an account of the rescue of [[History of the Jews in Bulgaria|Bulgarian Jews]] from the Nazis in [[World War II]].

Bar-Zohar's book ''Mossad: The Great Operations'' (המוסד - המבצעים הגדולים), published in 2010 with Nissim Mishal, was the subject of an investigation by the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]''.&lt;ref name=Haaretz1&gt;{{cite news | author = Ofer Matan | date = Nov 22, 2010 | title = Who really wrote the sagas of Israel's spies? | newspaper = Haaretz | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/who-really-wrote-the-sagas-of-israel-s-spies-1.326072}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, large parts of the book were copied from books and articles of journalist [[Ronen Bergman]] without acknowledgement.&lt;ref name=Haaretz1/&gt; It even used fictitious names for an intelligence unit and an intelligence officer that Bergman had invented.&lt;ref name=Haaretz1/&gt; Bar-Zohar admitted to ''Haaretz'' that they had followed Bergman closely, but said it was in order to avoid trouble from the Israeli military censor.&lt;ref name=Haaretz1/&gt; The three authors reached an agreement which included financial compensation for Bergman.&lt;ref name=Haaretz2&gt;{{cite news | author = Maya Sela | date= Aug 26, 2013 | title = Israeli reporter, accused of badmouthing book on Mossad, sued for libel | newspaper = Haaretz | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.543501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bergman later claimed that Bar-Zohar and Mishal had violated the agreement, and he wrote to foreign publishers in an attempt to prevent publication of the international edition of Bar-Zohar and Mishal's book.&lt;ref name=Haaretz2/&gt; In August 2013, Bar-Zohar and Mishal responded with a libel suit against Bergman.&lt;ref name=Haaretz2/&gt; In November 2013, Bergman initiated a lawsuit against Bar-Zohar and Mishal, alleging plagiarism, intellectual property theft, defamation of character and more.&lt;ref name=Haaretz3&gt;{{cite news | author = Maya Sela | title = Mossad book sparks NIS 4 million lawsuit by journalist | newspaper = Haaretz | date = November 22, 2013 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/.premium-1.557308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2866">The '''National Emergency Command Post Afloat''' ('''NECPA''') was part of the [[United States]] government's [[Continuity of government|Continuity of Operations]] plans during the 1960s.  It was one-third of a triad composed of airborne, ground, and sea-based assets.&lt;ref name="usaf"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb249/doc08.pdf USAF Historical Division: "The Air Force and the Worldwide Military Command and Control System 1961-1965]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In October 1961, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] approved the NECPA plan, directing initial operating capability (IOC) by 1&amp;nbsp;March 1962. [[United States Atlantic Command]] converted the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|2}} in March 1962, and the light carrier {{USS|Wright|CC-2|2}} in 1963 for NECPA duties.  The [[United States Navy]] began alternating the ships in mid-1964, to keep one at sea and the other in port at any time.  The ''Northampton'' was marginally upgraded for NECPA duties, since it was due for replacement; however, the ''Wright'' was modified to the utmost efficiency to hold the [[National Command Authorities]] for indefinite periods.&lt;ref name="usaf"/&gt;

The software was developed by the [[Naval Electronics Laboratory]], San Diego. The product was turned over for acceptance and administration to the Naval Command and Systems Support Activity (NAVCOSSACT), [[Washington Navy Yard]], [[Washington, DC]].

==Communications==
A permanent [[UHF]] ground station (located in [[Waldorf, Maryland]]), served as the primary communications link between the separate command posts: [[National Military Command Center]], [[Alternate National Military Command Center]], [[National Emergency Airborne Command Post]], and NECPA.  Three ground communications vans were located at [[Otis AFB]], [[Massachusetts|MA]], [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville, SC]], and [[Homestead AFB]], [[Florida|FL]] to cover commonly used routes of Presidential aircraft.  After President [[John F. Kennedy]]’s assassination, vans were moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson, MS]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin, TX]], to cover President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]’s travel routes.&lt;ref name="usaf"/&gt;

'''Nueva Ciudad Guerrero''' (''New Guerrero City'') is a city in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Tamaulipas]]. It lies on the banks of the [[Rio Grande|Rio Grande / Río Bravo]], near the [[United States–Mexico border|US–Mexico border]], opposite to [[Falcon Heights, Texas]]. The [[Lake Falcon Dam International Crossing]] connects Falcon Heights with Nueva Ciudad Guerrero.

It is located in [[Guerrero Municipality, Tamaulipas]]. The city's population at the 2010 census was 4,312 inhabitants, comprising 96.3% of its municipality population of 4,477 inhabitants.

==History== 
Ciudad Guerrero was founded in 1750, as ''Villa del Señor San Ignacio de Loyola de Revilla'' but later was named after the second [[President of Mexico]] [[Vicente Guerrero]]. The city served for a short time as the capital of the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] in 1840.

The city name of City of New Guerrero follows the '''Old Guerrero City''' (Antigua Guerrero) that was located on a tributary of the Rio Grande, the [[Rio Salado (Mexico)|Rio Salado]], some ten kilometers from the original banks of the Rio Grande.  Old Guerrero was flooded after the construction of Falcon Dam, and moved south to its current location on the current shoreline of Falcon Lake.   The original Church {{coord|26.7777|N|99.3391|W}} is partially above water and may still be viewable on the Salado Arm of the lake or approached on land when the water level in the lake is low. As of 2010, the area was reported to have become dangerous to visit because of the presence of rival drug cartels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">'''Obcells''' are hypothetical proto-organisms or (earliest form of life). The term was first proposed by [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] in 2001. According to Cavalier-Smith's theory for the origin of the first cell, two cup-shaped obcells or hemicells fused to make a [[protocell]] with double-lipid layer envelope, internal genome and ribosomes, protocytosol, and periplasm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Obcells as proto-organisms: membrane heredity, lithophosphorylation, and the origins of the genetic code, the first cells, and photosynthesis |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=53 |issue=4–5 |pages=555–95 |year=2001 |pmid=11675615 |doi=10.1007/s002390010245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis ==
The beginning of life and living organisms is difficult to specifically date as proto-organisms' earliest existence left no paleontological clues. Cavalier-Smith argues that initially there was [[primordial soup]] which contained [[amino acids]], the building blocks for [[proteins]]. Replication and phosphorylation were not relevant until the prebiotic soup started to become organized into the "nucleic acid" era. Although still not "living," the substances during this period could replicate and undergo organized chemical processes. Based off these orderly processes, the world transitioned into an obcell world which included coding for proteins and chromosomes and the symbiotic interactions between membranes, genes, and enzymes. Obcells probably had a single membrane that was lipid-dense and also had specific [[Cytoskleton|cytoskeletal]] proteins that gave the obcells its curvature.  These skeletal proteins were probably contained within the obcell's protoperiplasm.

=== Role of polyphosphate ===
Based on the high concentration of phosphate in the Earth's crust,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The First Living Systems: a Bioenergetic Perspective| last = Deamer| first = David| date = June 1997| journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews| doi = |pmid = 9184012|PMC=232609| volume=61| pages=239–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; the universal metabolism of [[pyrophosphate]] and [[Polyphosphate|polyP]] in modern cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = |title = Inorganic Polyphosphate: a Molecule of Many Functions|last = Kornberg| first = A| date = 1999| journal = National Center for Biotechnology Information |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ability to form phosphates abiotically, and its simplicity compared to nucleotides and [[nucleic acid]]s, replication probably began on phosphate-rich mineral surfaces and involved phosphate related [[enzyme]]s. Replicases are necessary for the genetic code to have existed, so Cavalier-Smith argues that "polyP kinases and pyrophosphate kinases may have been among the earliest protein-coded catalysts." If these did exist, then polyP-binding proteins would have been the most useful source of energy for the obcells. Due to its anionic properties, it is quite plausible that while immersed in the nucleotide and nucleic acid rich environment, polyP-binding proteins could have polymerized with these substances. Therefore, obcells with [[exonuclease]]s attached to their membrane would have had an advantage for replication compared to those that did not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In modern cells, [[Glucokinase regulatory protein|glucokinases]] typically have two different phosphate-binding domains, mainly containing the amino acids [[glycine]], [[threonine]], and [[Aspartic acid|aspartate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cloning, Expression, and Characterization of Polyphosphate Glucokinase from Mycobacterium Tuberculosis|last = Hsieh|first = P|date = March 1996|journal = National Center of Biotechnology Information|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Cavalier-Smith proposes that these shared domains could have originated in obcells to bind to pyrophosphate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Living conditions ===
Cavalier-Smith argues that the most plausible location for obcells to survive and grow in number on Earth was by the land-water interface, not by oceanic seafloor vents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to their likely dependence on polyP and pyrophosphate for energy over[[Adenosine triphosphate ATP]], obcells would likely congregate in areas where these minerals were formed in high concentrations. Polyphosphate could easily be formed by the seashore in "small salty pools, porous sediments, or protosoils."
 At lower temperatures, nucleic acids are more stable&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Stability of the RNA Bases: Implications for the Origin of Life|last = Levy|first = Matthew|date = July 7, 1998|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|doi =10.1073/pnas.95.14.7933|volume=95|pages=7933–7938|pmc =20907|pmid=9653118}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shorter chain lipids can form membranes easier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Combined with their dependence on polyP and pyrophosphate, the lower temperatures at the land-water interface the most likely habitat for obcells to evolve. In these conditions, the extreme temperature changes and heterogeneity of external components could induce sharp changes in the structure and function of colonizing obcells which is more likely to lead to the evolution of protocells compared to stable temperatures and homogeneous external components.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phosphorylation ===
From the obcells' dependence on polyP and pyrophosphate for energy, their metabolism did not rely on [[oxidative phosphorylation]] or [[photophosphorylation]]. These processes were too complex for the simple nature of obcells. Cavalier-Smith calls the obcells' phosphorylation of these minerals for energy "lithophosphorylation", which is simple and possible from the existence of [[kinase]]s that could catalyze polyP- binding proteins and pyrophosphate-binding proteins. From this, it is likely that obcells had these kinases on their surfaces to react with these external polyP-binding and pyrophosphate proteins. Polyphosphate and pyrophosphate were possibly small enough to diffuse into obcells. Therefore, it also likely that some of these kinases were in the obcell lumen to react with these proteins and then store them for later use. This storage would be beneficial for obcells in times when the concentration of external polyP-binding proteins and pyrophosphate-binding proteins would vary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Replication ==

=== Division ===
Since obcells were cup-shaped and could expose their chromosomes to the harsh environment, to protect their genetic information and any signaling factors, obcells could attach to polyphosphate surfaces using local [[Adhesin molecule (immunoglobulin -like)|adhesin]] proteins. During division, division proteins would begin to pinch the obcell in half, separating the internal components between the two daughter obcells. As this pinching was occurring, the structural integrity of the membrane began to weaken and the two halves would migrate towards the [[polyphosphate]] surface. Adhesin proteins would attach these ends to the surface and division would be complete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fusion ===
Over several millions of years, obcells managed to survive off division only. Eventually, obcells evolved to fuse into proto-organisms for added protection of their internal components and the decreased probability of the loss of [[oligosaccharide]]s during division. Two obcells would come in contact with each other and would adhere together by the adhesion proteins at the rims of both. This adhesion could also be firmer than on the polyphosphate surfaces without restricting division and growth. The fusions of obcells lead to the creation of cytosol, compared to obcell division. From this, the membrane began to change into a cytoplasmic side and an outer side, the preliminary double membrane of modern protocells. In order to prevent the obcells from completely fusing together, it is believed that the after the two obcells adhered together, the adhesin proteins continued to act as plugs. These points of adhesion could have allowed transport for some substances between the cytosol and environment, but these could have evolved into Bayer's patches which are breaks between the cytoplasmic side and outer side of the membrane in [[gram-negative bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historiography==
Boyer, a [[pacifist]] who came from a highly traditional religious background in an offshoot of the [[Mennonites]], specialized in the religious and moral history of the American people from the days of the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in the 1690s, through the [[Protestant]] efforts to reform society in the 19th and early 20th centuries to the impact of [[nuclear weapons]] on the American psyche after [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Boyer was born in 1935 in [[Dayton, Ohio]] to Clarence and Ethel Boyer.  He had two older brothers, [[Ernest L. Boyer]] and William Boyer. In 1962 he married Ann Talbot, of [[Baltimore, Md]].

'''Pherecydes of Syros''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|s|ᵻ|ˌ|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Φερεκύδης ὁ Σύριος}}; fl. 6th century BC) was a Greek thinker from the island of [[Syros]]. Pherecydes authored a [[cosmogony]],  derived from three divine principles, ''Zas'' ([[Zeus]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Doric and Attic-Ionic forms with α (of doubtful origin), nom. Ζάν [...] nom. Ζάς Pherecyd.Syr.1, 2 (Ζής ap.Hdn.Gr. l.c.[2.911]), "Ζάς Ζαντός" Choerob. in Theod.1.116; Δάν (q. v.); Τάν Head Hist.Num.2469 (Crete)" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*zeu%2Fs Ζεύς] {{harv|Liddell|Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chthonic|Cthonie]]'' ([[Earth (classical element)|Earth]])&lt;ref&gt;"Ionic  ἡ χθονίη, an earlier name of Γῆ [Pherecyd.Syr.1, cf. Dam.Pr.124bis]" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxqo%2Fnios χθόνιος] {{harv|Liddell|Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Chronos]]'' ([[Time]]), known as the "Pentemychos" (Πεντέμυχος, "of the five recesses"; sometimes the alternative title "Heptamychos", "seven recesses" is given). It formed a bridge between the mythological thought of [[Hesiod]] and [[pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. His work is lost, but it survived into the [[Hellenistic period]] and we are informed on part of its content indirectly. Pherecydes was said to have been the first writer to communicate philosophical musings in [[prose]]. According to William (ca. 1896), ''Aristotle regarded him partly a mythological writer and [[Plutarch]], as well as many other writers gave him the title of Theologus''.{{sfn|Smith|Chetham1896|p=258}}

== Life ==
According to tradition Pherecydes was a native of the island of [[Syros]] and flourished in the 59th [[Olympiad]] (544–541 BC).{{sfn|Kahn|2003|p=143}}{{sfn|Granger|2007|pp=135–163}} It was said that he was a son of one Babys.  Schibli (1990) dates his birth in the 49th olympiad (584–581).

Anecdotes of "unknown reliability"{{sfn|Munn|2006|p=48}} place Pherecydes on the island of [[Samos]], and in the city of [[Ephesus]], where he is supposed to have been buried, although another tradition claims he was buried on [[Delos]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 116-121; Diodorus Siculus, 10.4.3; ''Suda'', ''Pherekudes Babuos Syrios''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle wrote in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1091b8&lt;/ref&gt; of Pherecydes being in part a mythological writer and Plutarch, in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'' 36&lt;/ref&gt; instead wrote of him being a theologian. He was considered to have had the greater significance in teaching on the subject of [[metempsychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculan Disputations'', i. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings were extant in the [[Hellenistic period]], although only fragments have survived to the present day. His works were written in prose rather than [[Greek poetry|verse]] and he has been said to have been the first to have communicated or conveyed philosophical musings in this form.{{sfn|Smith|1870|p=
258}}  Tradition maintains that Pherecydes lived in two caves in the northern part of the island of Syros. His summer habitation remains a popular tourist destination to this day.

==Cosmogony==
[[File:Pherecydes' Cave.jpg|thumb|left|Pherecydes’ Cave.]]
Some sources say that Pherecydes' book was entitled "Pentemychos" (Πεντέμυχος ''Pentemuchos'') translated as five ([[Wikt:πέντε|πέντε]]) "recesses" (μυχός ''muchos'', "nook, cranny, recess", also "sanctuary" as in "small domestic altar in a corner").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpente%2Fmuxos πεντέ-μυχος] {{harv|Liddell|Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in some sources said to have been titled "Heptamychos" ("seven ([[Wikt:ἑπτά|ἑπτά]]) recesses").
There seems to be no complete agreement among scholars on which sources to trust regarding the title of Pherecydes' book, the standard survey reference on the Presocratic philosophers by Kirk, Raven and Schofield, opts for "Heptamychos".{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=51}}  The author of the only modern scholarly book devoted entirely to Pherecydes, Hermann S. Schibli, argues that "Pentemychos" was the true title.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schibli|1990|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this work, Pherecydes taught his philosophy through the medium of mythic representations. Although it is lost, the fragments that survive are enough to reconstruct a basic outline.

In the older [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th–7th century BC) the initial state of the universe is [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], a dark void considered as a divine primordial condition and the creation is ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing).
Pherecydes probably interpreted ''chaos'' as water and he does not place it at the very beginning. In his cosmogony there are three divine principles, ''Zas'' (Ζάς, [[Zeus]]), ''[[Chthonic|Cthonie]]'' (Χθονίη, [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]) and ''[[Chronos]]'' (Χρόνος, [[Time]]) who always existed.

The semen (seeds) of Chronos which can probably be considered as a ''watery chaos'' was placed in the recesses and composed numerous other offsprings of gods.{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|pp=56–60}} This is described in a fragment preserved in [[Damascius]]' ''On First Principles''.

A close relationship is thought to exist between these recesses and Chthonie.
[[Hesiod]] described [[Tartaros]] as being "in a recess (''muchos'') of broad-wayed earth".{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=34}} Hermann S. Schibli thinks the five ''muchos'' were actually harboured within Chthonie, or at least were so initially when Chronos disposed his seed in the five "nooks".{{sfn|Schibli|1990|p=22}}

Alongside Chthonie and Chronos, Pherecydes held a power called Zas. Zas (Zeus), comparable with the Orphic [[Eros]] in function, and as such a personification of masculine (sexual) creativity.
[[Proclus]] said that "Pherecydes used to say that Zeus changed into Eros when about to create, for the reason that, having created the world from opposites, he led it into agreement and peace and sowed sameness in all things, and unity that interpenetrates the universe".{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=62}}

The act of creation itself (perhaps it is more accurate to say that Chronos creates and that Zas orders and distributes) is described mytho-poetically as Zas making a cloth on which he decorates earth and sea, and which he then presents as a wedding gift to Chthonie, and wraps around her. Yet, in another fragment it is not Chthonie, but "a winged oak" that he wraps the cloth around.{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=63}} The "winged oak" in this cosmology has no precedent in Greek tradition.{{sfn|West|2007|p=347}}

The stories are different but not mutually exclusive, because much is lacking in the fragments, but it seems clear that creation is hindered by chaotic forces.

[[Image:Nuremberg chronicles f 61v 1.png|right|thumb|Pherecydes, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
[[File:Pherecydes of Syros recent bust Syro208.jpg|thumb|180px|Bust in [[Syros]]]]

Before the world is ordered a cosmic battle takes place, with Cronus as the head of one side and [[Ophioneus]] as the leader of the other.{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=66}}  The same story is elsewhere enacted with Zeus and [[Typhon|Typhon/Typhoeus]] as leading characters, and it also has close parallels in many myths from cultures other than the Greek ([[Marduk]] vs. [[Tiamat]], etc.). Ophioneus and its brood are often depicted as ruling the birthing cosmos for some time, before falling from power. The chaotic forces are eternal and cannot be destroyed; instead they are thrown out from the ordered world and locked away in Tartaros in a kind of "appointment of the spheres", in which the victor (Zeus-Cronus) takes possession of the sky and of space and time.{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|pp=66-67}} The locks to Tartaros are fashioned in iron by Zeus, and might hence have been associated with his element of ''aither'', and in bronze by [[Poseidon]], which might indicate a link to water (which was often conceived of as the "first matter"). Judging from some ancient fragments Ophioneus is thrown into [[Okeanos]], not into Tartaros.

Exactly what entities or forces that were locked away in Pherecydes’ story cannot be known for sure. There may have been five principal figures. Ophioneus and Typhon are one and the same, and [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]] fought on the side of Ophioneus against Cronus.{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=66}} Chthonie is a principal "thing" of the underworld, but whether she is to be counted as one of the five or the five "sum-total" is an open question. Apart from these it is known that Ophioneus-Typhon mated with [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], and that Echidna herself was somehow mysteriously "produced" by [[Callirrhoe (Oceanid)|Callirhoe]]. If Pherecydes counted five principal entities in association the pentemychos doctrine, then Ophioneus, Eurynome, Echidna, Calirrhoe and Chthonie are the main contenders.
             
Cronus (or Zeus in the more popularly known version) orders the offspring out from the cosmos to Tartaros. There they are kept behind locked gates, fashioned in iron (associated with Zeus and his element of sky/space) and bronze (by Poseidon—the water force). We are told about chaotic beings put into the pentemychos, and we are told that the Darkness has an offspring that is cast into the recesses of Tartaros. No surviving fragment makes the connection, but it is possible that the prison-house in Tartaros and the pentemychos are ways of referring to the essentially same thing. According to [[Celsus]], Pherecydes said that: "Below that portion is the portion of Tartaros; the daughters of Boreas [the north wind], the Harpies and Thuella [Storm], guard it; there Zeus banished any of the gods whenever one behaves with insolence."{{sfn|Schibli|1990|p=22}} Thus the identity between Zeus' prison-house and the pentemychos seems likely.

== Influence ==
Pherecydes' "Pentemychos" was thought to have contained a mystical esoteric teaching, treated allegorically. One ancient commentator said that:
{{quote|Also, Pherecydes, the man of Syros, talks of recesses and pits and caves and doors and gates, and through these speaks in riddles of becomings and deceases of souls.{{sfn|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=59}} }}

A comparatively large number of sources say Pherecydes was the first to teach the eternality and transmigration (''[[metempsychosis]]'') of human souls.{{sfn|Schibli|1990|p=104}} Both [[Cicero]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] thought of him having given the first teaching of the "immortality of the soul".{{sfn|Baynes|Smith|1885|loc=''Pherecydes Of Syros''}} It is not surprising that some considered Pherecydes to have been the teacher of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 13, 118–119}}; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925c|loc=2, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; That he was the first to teach such a thing is doubtful, but that he was among the first and that he did profess this teaching is certain. Hermann S. Schibli concludes that Pherecydes "included in his book ["Pentemychos"] at least a rudimentary treatment of the immortality of the soul, its wanderings in the underworld, and the reasons for the soul’s incarnations".{{sfn|Schibli|1990|p=108}}

Pherecydes was occasionally counted among the [[Seven Sages of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 122}} &lt;br&gt; See also {{harvnb|Parada|Förlag|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A sun-dial (''heliotropion''), supposedly made by Pherecydes, was said by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] to be "preserved on the island of Syros."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconstruction ==

Basing himself on the extant fragments of Pherecydes' work, on testimonia from ancient authors regarding Pherecydes' philosophy, as well as on themes from Ancient Greek and Near Eastern mythologies, Hermann S. Schibli offers the following reconstruction of the main elements of Pherecydes' lost book:

{{quote| CHRONOS and Zas always were, and also Chthonie (Ζὰς μὲν καὶ Χρόνος ἦσαν ἀεὶ καὶ Χθονίη). Once Chronos, alone and without a partner, cast forth his seed. From his seed he made fire, air, and water, and deposited these in five hollows. Lo, from the mixtures of fire, air and water in the hollows arose another generation of gods. The fiery gods dwelt in Ouranos and gleaming [[Aether (mythology)|Aither]], the gods of wind in gusty Tartaros, the watery gods in Chaos, and the gods of darkness dwelt in black Night.
After the generation of gods, born of the seed of Time, assumed their habitations, Zas became Eros and married Chthonie. The other gods built many large palaces for him; they provided all the necessary goods, the banquet tables, servants and maids, and when all the needful things had been accomplished, they performed the wedding. On the third day of the wedding, Zas [[Demiurge|fashioned]] a big and beautiful robe, and on it he embroidered Earth and Ogenos and the mansions of Ogenos. When he had finished his task, he presented the robe to Chthonie and said: 'Because I wish to marry you, I honour you with this robe. Rejoice and be my consort!' This they say was the first feast of unveiling, and hence arose the [[Origin myth|custom]] for both gods and men. And she responded as she received the robe from him: 'I take this as my honour, and henceforth I shall be called Ge...' The gods celebrated, feasting on ambrosia. And the Earth was like a [[World tree|winged oak]], strong and mighty; its roots extended into the depths of Tartaros, its trunk was encircled by Ogenos, and its branches reached into Ouranos. The Earth flourished and Zas rejoiced.

But below the Earth, in a hollow of Tartaros, Ophioneus was born. He and his monstrous sons challenged Kronos. The battle-lines were drawn up, with Kronos the commander of one army and Ophioneus leading the Ophionidai. The terms of the battle were stated: whichever of them fell into Ogenos would be the defeated, while those who thrust them out and defeated them would possess Ouranos. A fierce conflict followed. Kronos had a strong ally in Zas; in single combat he overthrew Ophioneus. So Ophioneus and his brood were cast into Ogenos, and they dwell in the mansions of Ogenos to this [[Sea monster|day]]. Kronos, commander of the victorious army, was crowned by the other gods (from this arose the custom of the wearing of crowns by victors). Zeus honoured the victorious gods and assigned them their domains. Kronos had won Ouranos. These are the shares of the other gods: below Ouranos is the fiery Aither; below Aither the portion of Earth; below that portion is Tartaros; the daughters of Boreas, the [[Harpy|Harpies]] and Thuella, guard it; there Zeus banishes any of the gods who behave with [[Hubris|insolence]]. There also are the souls of men who have committed bloodshed. Their souls are borne through the portals and gates of Tartaros on an outflowing river to [[Metempsychosis|birth]]; the river is like the [[Traducianism|seed]] that leads to new life. And the souls of men depart from life and enter again the caves and hollows of Tartaros through its portals and gates. Alongside Tartaros is Chaos and the realms of dark Night.{{sfn|Schibli|1990|pp=128-129}} }}

'''Podgórze''' is a district of [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], situated on the right (southern) bank of the [[Vistula]] River, at the foot of Lasota Hill. The district was subdivided in 1990 into six new districts, see present-day [[districts of Kraków]] for more details. The name Podgórze roughly translates as ''the base of a hill''. Initially a small settlement, in the years following the [[First Partition of Poland]] the town's development was promoted by the [[Austria-Hungary]] [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] who in 1784 granted it the city status, as the Royal Free City of Podgórze. In the following years it was a self-governing administrative unit. After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795 and the takeover of the entire city by the Empire, Podgórze lost it political role of an independent suburb across the river from the [[Kraków Old Town|Old Town]].&lt;ref name="Marczewski" /&gt;

The administrative reform of 1810 which followed the expansion of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] brought Podgórze together with the rest of the historic city. However, after the [[Congress of Vienna]] made Kraków [[Free City of Kraków|a free city]] in 1815, Podgórze fell back under the Austrian rule and remained there for the rest of the 19th century. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, in 1910 it was the 13th largest town in the Austrian-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (population 18,142 in 1900).&lt;ref name=EncBrit1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cracow |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading to the return of Polish independence, the city council discussions from July 1915 made Podgórze again a part of the Greater Kraków (''Wielki Kraków''); its president, the vice president of a single administrative unit.&lt;ref name="Marczewski"&gt;Adam Marczewski, [http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/podgorze-obecnie-dzielnica-krakowa-/3,local-history/ Podgórze history and its Jewish Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204310/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/podgorze-obecnie-dzielnica-krakowa-/3,local-history/ |date=4 March 2016 }} on ''[[Virtual Shtetl]]''. Retrieved April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
The oldest man-made structure in Podgórze is the [[Krakus Mound]] ({{lang-pl|Kopiec Krakusa}}) on Lasota Hill, believed to be the grave of the legendary prince [[Krakus]]. It is the largest prehistoric mound in Poland and one of the best view points in the city.

The Austrian bridge named [[Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria|Carl]]'s Bridge ({{lang-de|Karls Brücke}}), linking Podgórze with the Kraków proper across the Vistula was built in 1802. This wooden structure located between today's Mostowa and Brodzińskiego streets, survived only until 1813 when it was destroyed in a flood.

Towards the end of the Austrian rule, in 1915 the size of Podgórze reached {{frac|1|5}} of the size of Kraków. Since the return of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's independence]], it remained integrated into the city. It includes the historic part of Podgórze with the triangular market square and impressive [[St. Joseph's Church, Podgórze|St. Joseph Church]] as well as the green hills of Krzemionki with the World War II [[quarry]] called ''Liban''. It also includes the site of the Nazi [[Kraków Ghetto]] and a [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|factory]] of [[Oskar Schindler]] who saved nearly 1,200 Jews from the camps, as well as the old villages (now suburbs) of Płaszów, Rybitwy and Przewóz. [[Districts of Kraków|The district population]] as of 31 December 2006 was 31,599 at an area of 2,456&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]].&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;Cracow City Council official publication {{cite web|url=http://www.bip.krakow.pl/?sub_dok_id=15893|title=Population by district|accessdate=2007-09-22|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9070">In [[Historiography|historical studies]], '''prosopography''' is an investigation of the common characteristics of a historical group, whose individual biographies may be largely untraceable, by means of a collective study of their lives, in multiple career-line analysis.&lt;ref&gt;"multiple career-line analysis (as the social scientists call it)", Lawrence Stone remarked, in "Prosopography", ''Daedalus'' '''100'''.1 (1971), pp. 46&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosopographical research has the goal of learning about patterns of relationships and activities through the study of collective biography; it collects and analyses statistically relevant quantities of biographical data about a well-defined group of individuals. This makes it a valuable technique for studying many pre-modern societies.

==History==
British historian [[Lawrence Stone]] (1919–1999) brought the term to general attention in an explanatory article in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "Prosopography", ''Daedalus'' '''100'''.1 (1971), pp. 46&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is drawn from the figure of [[prosopopeia]] in classical [[rhetoric]], introduced by [[Quintilian]], in which an absent or imagined person is figured forth—the "face created" as the Greek suggests—in words, as if present.

Stone noted two uses of prosopography as an historian's tool: first, in uncovering deeper interests and connections beneath the superficial rhetoric of politics, in order to examine the structure of the political machine; and second, in analysing the changing roles in society of particular status groups—holders of offices, members of associations—and assessing social mobility through family origins and social connections of recruits to those offices or memberships. "Invented as a tool of political history," Stone observed, "it is now being increasingly employed by the social historians."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1971:47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain mass of data is required for prosopographical research.&lt;ref&gt;The classic early example of prosopography was the series of volumes of ''Prosopographia Imperii Romanae'', edited by P. von Rohden and H. Dessau, (Berlin), appearing from 1897, which amassed a database covering the governing class of the Roman [[Principate]].&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of data underlies the creation of a prosopography and, in contemporary research, this is usually in the form of an electronic database. But data assembly is not the goal of the research; rather, the objective is to understand patterns and relationships by analysing the data. A uniform set of criteria needs to be applied to the group in order to achieve meaningful results. And, as with any historical study, understanding the context of the lives studied is essential.

In the words of prosopographer [[Katharine Keats-Rohan]], "prosopography is about what the analysis of the sum of data about many individuals can tell us about the different types of connection between them, and hence about how they operated within and upon the institutions—social, political, legal, economic, intellectual—of their time".&lt;ref&gt;Keats-Rohan, Katharine. ''History and Computing''. 12:1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense prosopography is clearly related to, but distinct from, both [[biography]] and [[genealogy]]. Whilst biography and prosopography overlap, and prosopography is interested in the details of individuals' lives, a prosopography is more than the plural of biography. A prosopography is not just any collection of biographies—the lives must have enough in common for relationships and connections to be uncovered. Genealogy, as practiced by family historians, has as its goal the reconstruction of familial relationships, and as such, well-conducted genealogical research may form the basis of a prosopography, but the goals of prosopographical research are generally wider. 

The nature of prosopographical research has developed over time. In his 1971 essay, Lawrence Stone discussed an "older" form of prosopography which was principally concerned with well-known social elites, many of whom were already well-known historical figures. Their genealogies were well-researched, and social webs and kinship linking could be traced, allowing a prosopography of a "power elite" to emerge. Prominent examples which Stone drew upon were the work of [[Charles A. Beard]] and Sir [[Lewis Namier]]. Charles Beard's ''[[An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States]]'' (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the [[U.S. Constitution]] by looking at the class background and economic interests of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]. Sir [[Lewis Namier]] produced an equally influential study of the 18th century [[British House of Commons]], and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed "Namier Inc." 

Stone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which concern was with much wider populations including, particularly, "ordinary people". An example of this kind of work, published slightly later, is [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s pioneering work of [[microhistory]], ''[[Montaillou|Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error]]'' (1978), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy, daily and seasonal routine, in a small [[Occitania|Occitan]] village, the last pocket of [[Cathars]], over a 30-year period from 1294 to 1324. Stone anticipated that this new form of prosopography would become dominant as part of a growing wave of [[Social Science History]]. But prosopography and other associated forms of social science and quantitative history went into a period of decline during the 1980s. In the 1990s, however, perhaps because of developments in computing, and particularly in database software, prosopography was revived. The "new prosopography" has since become clearly established as an important approach in historical research.

The '''Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg''' ({{lang-de|Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg}}) or '''SPSG''', was founded by a treaty of 23 August 1994 between the German federal states of [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] as a public [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] following [[German reunification]]. The treaty came into force on 1 January 1995.
The foundation is separate from the considerably larger [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] (''Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz'').

== History ==

The SPSG is an amalgamation of the Potsdam-Sanssouci State Palaces and Gardens (''Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten Potsdam-Sanssouci'') in the former [[East Germany]] and the State Palaces and Gardens Administration (''Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten'') in [[West Berlin]] that had been formed following the [[division of Germany]]. These institutions were formed from the Prussian State Palaces and Gardens Administration that had been founded on 1 April 1927 as a result of the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and the [[Prussia]]n state and which was disbanded in 1945.

The SPSG has its headquarters in Brandenburg's capital city, [[Potsdam]]. Its owners are the states of Berlin (21.35%) and Brandenburg (36.60%) and the federal government (42.05%) (as at: 2007). The foundation receives other support from numerous societies and private sponsors.

The Berlin-Brandenburg Foundation For Prussian Palaces and Gardens was listed in 2001 in the "Blue Book" that publishes a list of heritage sites in eastern Germany that are of national significance and currently includes 20 so-called "cultural beacons" (''kulturelle Leuchttürme''). The selection of heritage sites was based on an initiative of the commissaries of the Federal Office of Heritage and the Media and voted on by the East German ministers of culture.

== Properties of SPSG ==
The Foundation manages and administers approximately 500 employees in Potsdam, Brandenburg and Berlin, about 300 buildings or structures, including more than 150 historic buildings and nearly 800 acres of gardens, with Potsdam-Berlin's cultural landscape forming the largest part. With the treaty of SPSG coming into force, these land and buildings are included in the inventory:

== Goals ==
In über dreihundertjähriger Bautätigkeit entstanden durch die brandenburg-preußischen Herrscher Schlösser und Gartenanlagen von internationaler Anerkennung. 1990 wurden die Schlösser und Gärten in Potsdam, die auf Berliner Gebiet liegende Pfaueninsel sowie Schloss und Park Glienicke als Weltkulturerbe unter den Schutz der [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] gestellt.

Um die kulturhistorisch bedeutenden Anlagen und Gebäude zu erhalten, ist die SPSG nach dem Gesetz zum Staatsvertrag, Artikel 2 (1), verpflichtet:
:''„…, die ihr übergebenen Kulturgüter zu bewahren, unter Berücksichtigung historischer, kunst- und gartenhistorischer und denkmalpflegerischer Belange zu pflegen, ihr Inventar zu ergänzen, der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen und die Auswertung dieses Kulturbesitzes für die Interessen der Allgemeinheit insbesondere in Wissenschaft und Bildung zu ermöglichen.“''

Neben der denkmalpflegerischen Aufgabe und der Öffnung der Schlossanlagen für Besichtigungen werden jährlich Sonderveranstaltungen und Sonderausstellungen, vor allem zu Themen der preußischen Kulturgeschichte, durchgeführt. Konzerte, wie die „Schlössernacht“ in Potsdam-Sanssouci oder das „Kammeroperfestival“ in Rheinsberg, gehören seit Jahren zu den feststehenden, gut besuchten Veranstaltungen in den Schlossanlagen.

== Die Vermögensauseinandersetzung ==

Nach dem [[Erster Weltkrieg|Ersten Weltkrieg]] und dem Ende der Monarchie wurde im November 1918 das Vermögen, der Grundbesitz und die Immobilien des Hauses Hohenzollern von der neuen Regierung beschlagnahmt. Nach achtjähriger Verhandlung zwischen dem ehemaligen Königshaus und dem preußischen Staat mit dem Ziel eines [[Vergleich (Recht)|Vergleichs]] wurde am 26. Oktober 1926 ein „Gesetz über die Vermögensauseinandersetzung zwischen dem Preußischen Staat und den Mitgliedern des vormals regierenden Preußischen Königshauses“ verabschiedet.

Dem voraus ging ein von [[Sozialdemokratie|sozialdemokratischen]] und [[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands|kommunistischen]] Parteien angestrebter [[Volksentscheid]] mit dem Ziel der entschädigungslosen [[Enteignung]] aller zweiundzwanzig Fürstenhäuser des [[Deutsches Reich|Deutschen Reichs]]. Die am 20. Juni 1926 durchgeführte Abstimmung, die erste in der [[Weimarer Republik]], brachte 14,5 Millionen Wahlstimmen, die einem „Gesetz zur Enteignung des Fürstenvermögens“ zusagten. Eine für die Durchführung erforderliche Stimmenzahl von mindestens 20 Millionen wurde jedoch nicht erreicht. (''siehe'': [[Fürstenenteignung]])

In Folge weiterer Zugeständnisse von Seiten des Hauses Hohenzollern konnte im Oktober 1926 ein Vertrag zwischen dem ehemaligen Königshaus und der preußischen Regierung ratifiziert werden. Der als Eigentum verbliebene Immobilien- und Grundbesitz, der hauptsächlich im Osten des ehemaligen Deutschen Reichs lag, ging jedoch durch Zerstörung und Enteignung während und nach dem [[Zweiter Weltkrieg|Zweiten Weltkrieg]] verloren. Nur ein Bruchteil des durch den Vertrag zugesprochenen Besitzes blieb erhalten. Heute ist nur noch die [[Burg Hohenzollern]] bei [[Hechingen]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) Eigentum des Hauses Hohenzollern.

Zur Verwaltung und Instandhaltung der in Staatsbesitz gekommenen Gebäude und Gartenanlagen wurde am 1. April 1927 die preußische „Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten“ gegründet, die die Schlossanlagen als Museen der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich machten. Auch hier gab es durch Kriegseinwirkung, Gebietsverlust und Beutenahme von Kulturgut durch die [[Rote Armee|Sowjetarmee]] erhebliche Verluste. Obwohl 1955 und 1957/58 Kunstschätze aus der [[Sowjetunion]] nach Deutschland zurückkamen, fehlen in den Schlössern der SPSG bis heute mehr als 3.000 Ölgemälde, circa 1.000 Skulpturen, Tausende von Porzellanen, Möbel, 80.000 Bände aus den königlichen Bibliotheken und mehrere tausend Grafiken.

== Bildrechte ==

Im Jahre 2010 gewann die Stiftung einen Rechtsstreit um die Verwertung von Fotografien ihrer Liegenschaften vor dem Bundesgerichtshof.&lt;ref&gt;V ZR 44/10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qedarite Kingdom''', or '''Qedar''' ({{lang-ar|مملكة قيدار}}, ''Mamlakat Qaydar''), was a largely [[nomad]]ic, ancient [[Arab people|Arab]] tribal confederation. Described as "the most organized of the Northern Arabian tribes", at the peak of its power in the 6th century BCE it had a kingdom and controlled a vast region in Arabia.&lt;ref name=Stearnsp41&gt;Stearns and Langer, 2001, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eshelp149&gt;Eshel in Lipschitz et al., 2007, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingp40"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyersp223/&gt;

Biblical tradition holds that the Qedarites are named for Qedar, the second son of [[Ishmael]], mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]]'s books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (25:13) and [[Book of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] (1:29), where there are also frequent references to Qedar as a tribe.&lt;ref name=Eshelp149/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5&gt;Bromiley, 1997, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extrabiblical inscriptions [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology|discovered by archaeologists]] that mention the Qedarites are from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. Spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, they list the names of Qedarite kings who revolted and were defeated in battle, as well as those who paid Assyrian monarchs tribute, including [[Zabibe]], queen of the Arabs (šar-rat KUR.a-ri-bi).&lt;ref&gt;Teppo (2005): 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The queens we have encountered during these hundred years are only queens of the Arabs. None of them is called anything else. This must be interpreted in the following way: Arab and Qedar, although connected, are not identical." Jan Retsö, ''The Arabs in antiquity'', (Routledge, 2003), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Old South Arabian]] inscriptions recalling the Qedarites, who further appear briefly in the writings of [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]], such as Herodotus, and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historians, such as [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Diodorus]].

It is unclear when the Qedarites ceased to exist as a separately defined confederation or people. Allies with the [[Nabataeans]], it is likely that they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons ([[Nebaioth]] and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of [[God]] in [[Islam]], alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.

==Etymology==
It has been suggested that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar.&lt;ref name=Eshelp148/&gt; Though the tribal name is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], it was first transcribed in [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] (8th century BCE) and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (6th century BCE), as the [[Arabic alphabet]] had not yet been developed. In the [[Mareshah]] onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in Aramaic transliteration is ''QDRYN''.&lt;ref name=Eshelp148&gt;Eshel in Lipschitz, 2007, pp. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic [[triliteral root]] ''q-d-r'' means "to measure, compute, estimate"; "to decree, appoint, ordain"; and "to have power, or ability." ''Qidr'', a noun derived from the same root, means "cauldron, kettle", and also gives the verbal derivation, "to cook".&lt;ref name=Stetkevychp73&gt;Stetkevych, 1996, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Axel Knauf, a biblical scholar who undertook a historical study of the [[Ishmaelites]] and determined that they were known in Assyrian inscriptions as the Šumu'il, surmises that the name of the Qedarites was derived from the verb ''qadara'', with its meaning of "to ordain, to have power".&lt;ref name=Stetkevychp76&gt;Stetkevych, 1996, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; As this etymology is a deduction based solely on the prominence of the Qedar among the Šumu'il tribes, it is viewed as inconclusive by other scholars.&lt;ref name=Stetkevychp138&gt;Stetkevych, 1996, p. 138, note #50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical scope==
[[File:Assyrian empire 750 625.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map of the Assyrian Empire and the Region about the Eastern Mediterranean, 750–625 BCE from William R. Shepherd's "Historical Atlas" (1911) – Early Qedarite rulers are listed in 8th and 7th century BCE [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform inscriptions as vassals of the [[Assyrian Empire]]]]
The Qedarites were an "Arab tribal confederation," or "alliance of nomadic [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]]."&lt;ref name="Kingp40"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyersp223&gt;Meyers, 1997, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Philip J. King]], theologian and historian, they lived in the northwest [[Arabian desert]] and were "an influential force from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE."&lt;ref name="Kingp40"/&gt; Geoffrey Bromiley, historical theologist and translator, transcribes their name as ''Kedar'' and states they lived in an area southeast of Damascus and east of the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt;

8th century BCE Assyrian inscriptions place the Qedarites as living in the area to the east of the western border of Babylon.&lt;ref name=Eshelp149/&gt; Moving further east into areas of the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] and southern [[Syria]] in the 7th century BCE, by the 5th century BCE they had spread into the Sinai and as far as the [[Nile Delta]].&lt;ref name="Eshelp149"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blenkinsoppp225&gt;Blenkinsopp, 1988, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Qedarite domination of northwest Arabia involved alliances between the kings of Qedar and the kings of [[Dedanites|Dedan]] ([[Al-`Ula]]).&lt;ref name=Archibaldp123&gt;Archibald and Gabrielsen, 2001, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Israel Eph'al writes that the "breadth of Qedarite distribution suggests a federation of tribes with various sub-divisions."&lt;ref name=Eshelp149/&gt;

Oases in the largely desert region lived in by the Qedarites - such as Dedan, [[Tayma]], and Dumah - played an important role as sites of settlement, trade, and watering-places.{{ref label|names_A|a}}&lt;ref name=Kitchenp119&gt;Kitchen, 1994, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Avanzinip335&gt;Avanzini, 1997, pp. 335-336.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dumat al-Jandal|Dumah]], a remote desert city to the west, known later as [[Dumat Al-Jandal]] and today as [[al-Jawf]], was the most important of these, sitting as it did between the empires of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]. Serving as the base for Qedarite religious ceremonies, Dumah's strategic position on the north-south trade route in the area meant that relations with its inhabitants were sought after by both empires, though Dumah and the Qedarites were closer in both geographical and political terms to Babylonia. Those coming from the south and wishing to access [[Mesopotamia]] were obliged to pass through Dumah, which also lay on an alternate route to the northwest, leading to the city of [[Damascus]], and from there, on to Assyria and Anatolia.&lt;ref name=Avanzinip335/&gt;

During the period of Persian imperial rule in the region (c. 550–330 BCE), the Qedarites exercised control over the desert areas bordering [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]] and the traffic related to Arabian [[Incense route|incense trade]] upon which [[Gaza City|Gaza]] depended.&lt;ref name=Lipinskip333&gt;Lipinski, 2004, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daviesp87&gt;Davies et al., 1984, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] ([[circa|c.]] 484–425 BCE) writes of their presence in the northern [[Sinai]] near the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] border where they may have been engaged by the [[Achaemenid]]s, the Persian imperial authorities, to keep that border secure as well as their control of the city of Gaza.&lt;ref name=Eshelp149/&gt;

====Assyrian inscriptions====
&lt;!--[[File:Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A relief from Sennacherib's palace walls in [[Nineveh]] portraying his Babylonian campaign]]--&gt;

The first documented mention of Qedar is from a [[stele]] (c. 737 BCE) of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], a king of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], that lists leaders from the western part of [[Mesopotamia]] that pay him [[tribute]].&lt;ref name=Eshelp149/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gallagherp53b&gt;Gallagher, 1999, p. 53, note 120.&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Assyria]]ns, the Qedarites were known as ''Qidri'' or ''qi-id-ri'' with other [[cuneiform]] inscriptions also using ''Qadri'', ''Qidarri'', ''Qidari'' and ''Qudari'' ([[Neo Babylonian]]).&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stetkevychp76" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blenkinsoppp225"/&gt;  [[Zabibe]] (c. 738 BCE) is listed among those paying tribute under the title "queen of the ''Qidri'' and the ''Aribi''" (''Aribi'' meaning "Arabs").&lt;ref name=Eph&gt;Eph'al, 1982, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also mentioned in Assyrian royal inscriptions is Zabibe's successor [[Yatie]] (c. 730 BCE), who sent forces headed by her brother [[Baasqanu]] to aid [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|Merodach-Baladan]] in his bid to hold onto power in [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name=Boardmanp34&gt;Boardman, 1991, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lesliep249&gt;Leslie, 1999, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with an army from [[Elam]], this alliance faced the forces of [[Sennacherib]], on the Assyrian king's first campaign in 703 BCE.&lt;ref name=Ephalp112/&gt; The events of the battle are recorded in the annals of Sennacherib which describe Yatie as "queen of the Arabs," and tell of the capture of her brother Baasqanu in battle. Israel Eph'al writes that this is the first mention in Assyrian documents of [[Arabs]] as an ethnic element in [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=Ephalp112&gt;Eph'al, 1982, pp. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements about the Qedarites in the annals of the Assyrian kings of [[Ashurbanipal]] and his son [[Esarhaddon]] indicate that the term ''Kedar'' was almost synonymous with ''Arabia''.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; [[Hazael]], who ruled c. 690–676 BCE, is described as a Qedarite king by Ashurbanipal and "king of the Arabs" by Esarhaddon.&lt;ref name=Handyp132&gt;Handy, 1997, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gallagherp53&gt;Gallagher, 1999, p. 53, note 118.&lt;/ref&gt; After Sennacherib's invasion of [[Babylonia]] in 691–689 BCE, Hazael fled to Dumah.&lt;ref name=Gallagherp56&gt;Gallagher, 1999, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoylandp68&gt;Hoyland, 2001, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumah is referred to as ''Adummatu'' by the Assyrians, and the city is described by them as the seat of the Qedar confederation and the base of their cult.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp68&gt;Hoyland, 2001, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Te'elkhunu and Tabua, both referred to as both "queens of Qidri" and "queens of ''Aribi''," have ''Adummatu'' explicitly denoted as their seat and capital city in the inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Sudayrip25&gt;Sudayrī, 2001, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; While the capital city for the three other queens referred to as "queens of ''Aribi''" ([[Samsi]], Zabibe and Yatie) is not explicitly mentioned, it is thought to have been ''Adummatu'' as well.&lt;ref name=Sudayrip25/&gt; Numerous inscriptions discovered in Dumah itself are further indications for a strong Qedarite presence, one of which asks of three [[deities]] known to the Assyrians as gods of Qedar ([[Ruda (deity)|Ruda]], [[Nuha (deity)|Nuha]] and [[Atarsamain]]) for "help in the matter of my love."&lt;ref name=Hoylandp68/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Kinadshburn.JPG|200px|thumb|Ashurbanipal, pictured on a chariot during a royal lion hunt]]--&gt;

The conquest of ''Adummatu'' by Sennacherib in 690 BCE and the capture of a Qedarite queen, Te'elkhunu, who was brought back to Assyria with other loot, including divine images, is also mentioned in the annals of the Assyrian monarchs.&lt;ref name=Teppo/&gt; Esarhaddon eventually returned the "renewed" images of the Arab gods to ''Adummatu'' with Tabua, "who grew up in the palace of Sennacherib," and was appointed Qedarite queen by Esarhaddon to replace Te'elkhunu.&lt;ref name=Teppo/&gt; However, strained relations between the Assyrians and the Qedarites meant that she ruled for only a brief period, with Esarhaddon recognizing Hazael as the king of Qedar after he increased his tribute to the Assyrian monarch by 65 camels.&lt;ref name=Sudayrip29&gt;Sudayrī, 2001, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Esarhaddon then appointed [[Yauta]], son of Hazael, as a Qedarite king, following Hazael's death.&lt;ref name=Teppo/&gt; That Yauta paid a tribute in the form of 10 minas of gold, 1,000 precious stones, 50 camels, and 1,000 leather pouches of aromatics is also recorded.&lt;ref name=Retsop159&gt;Retsö, 2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of [[Ammuladi]] and Yauta after they mounted Qedarite forces to march against the kings of the [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] is recorded by Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; Yauta is said to have "roused the people of Arabia to revolt with him."&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Patonp269/&gt; His wife, [[Adiya]], is the only woman mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions as both a Qedarite queen and the wife of a Qedarite king, and is thought to be the only woman who was not a ruler in her own right.&lt;ref name=Teppo&gt;{{cite web|title=Women and their agency in the Neo-Assyrian Empire|author=Saana Teppo|url=https://oa.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/820/womenand.pdf?sequence=2|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=2009-04-16|publisher=Doria, from the collection of e-theses of Helsinki University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions record how Adiya was sent by Yauta to accompany Ammuladi and the Qedarite forces, and their subsequent defeat and capture in 604 BCE by the forces of [[Kaasḥalta|Kamushaltu]], king of [[Moab]] and a loyal [[vassal]] of the Assyrian empire.&lt;ref name=Teppo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bartonp521&gt;Barton, 2004, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Yauta is said to have "fled to the [[Nabataeans]]."&lt;ref name=Patonp269&gt;Paton, 2008, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent capture and sentencing in [[Nineveh]] are recorded by Ashurbanipal who relates that, "I put a dog chain upon him and made him guard a kennel."&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; [[Abiyate]] was appointed as Yauta's successor, and soon joined with the [[Nabataeans]] to revolt against Assyria again, prompting Ashurbanipal to launch a three-month campaign to end it, beginning in [[Palmyra]], continuing on to [[Damascus]] and ending in the southern part of [[Leja|al-Leja]].&lt;ref name=Patonp269/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guzzop10/&gt;

[[Old South Arabic]] inscriptions mention ''qdrn'' ("Qadirān" or "Qadrān") as a person or people.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; [[Graffiti]] found in al-Ula, known as the Graffito of Niran at Dedan, mentions [[Geshem (Bible)|Gashmu I]], son of [[Shahr I]], as King of Qedar.&lt;ref name=Kitchenp169&gt;Kitchen, 1994, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "king of Qedar" is also mentioned in a late 5th century BCE [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription on a silver vessel found at [[Tell el-Maskhuta|Tell Maskhuta]] in the eastern [[Nile]] Delta in lower [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Guzzop11&gt;Guzzo et al., 2002, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription names him as "Qainū son of [[Geshem (Bible)|Gashmu]]," with the vessel described as an, "offering to [[Allat|han-'Ilāt]]".&lt;ref name=Eshelp149/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guzzop11/&gt;

While it does not specifically mention the Qedar and is therefore a subject of debate, an Aramaic inscription dating to 5th century BCE discovered on an incense altar at [[Lachish]] and dedicated to, "Iyas, son of Mahaly, the king," is interpreted by [[André Lemaire]] as a possible reference to kings of Qedar.&lt;ref name=Kitchenp722&gt;Kitchen, 1994, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later writings ===

====Classical Antiquity====
[[Herodotus]] has documented that the Qedarites were called upon to assist [[Cambyses II]] of the [[Persian empire]] in his invasion of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 525 BCE.&lt;ref name=Blenkinsoppp225/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guzzop10/&gt; The Qedarites and Nabataeans were known to enjoy close relations, even engaging as wartime allies against the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=Shahidp335/&gt; It is possible that the Qedarites were eventually incorporated into the Nabataean state which emerged as the strongest Ishmaelite presence in northwestern Arabia c. the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=Shahidp335/&gt; In ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', some of the ''(Arab) Nabataeans'' mentioned by [[Diodorus]] in his retelling of events that took place in 312 BCE are said to be Qedarites.&lt;ref name=Boardmanp148&gt;Boardman et al., 1988, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 CE), who refers to the ''Cedrei'' and ''Cedareni'' ("Cedarenes") in the context of other Arabian tribes, placing their domain to the south of the ''[[Conchlei]]'' and adjacent to that of the ''[[Nabataei]]'', is thought to be referring to the Qedar.&lt;ref name="Stetkevychp76"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forsterp244&gt;Forster, 1844, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] (c. 357–420 CE), also writing in [[Latin language|Latin]], transcribes Qedar as ''Cedar'', and refers to it as a region.&lt;ref name=Beckettp102/&gt; In one entry, he describes it as, "a region of the [[Saracens]], who are called [[Ishmaelites]] in [[scripture]]"; in another, he writes that it was a "once uninhabitable region across Saracen Arabia"; and in a third, he writes that it is a "deserted region of the Ishmaelites, whom they now call Saracens."&lt;ref name=Beckettp102&gt;Beckett, 2003, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[Theodoret]] (c. 393 – c. 457) mentions that in his time, the Qedar lived near Babylon.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Cedar (2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====
There are brief references to the Qedar in the writings of [[Western culture|Western]] travellers to the Levant in the 19th century. Drawing on biblical motfis, comparisons are made between the [[Bedouins]] and the Qedar. For example, [[Albert Augustus Isaacs]] describes the imposing spectacle of a Bedouin encampment on a plain upon which, "the black tents of Kedar were spread far and wide."&lt;ref name=Isaacsp111&gt;Isaacs, 1862, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier account by [[Charles Boileau Elliot]] describes the Arabs as falling into two main groups, [[Fellah]]s and Bedouins, and identifies the latter with Ishmael and the Qedar as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the Bedouins still retain the wandering habits of their father Ishmael; their 'hand is against every man, and every man's hand is against' them; the wild desert is their home; the ground their pallet and their canopy the sky; or, if luxurious their choicest place of sojourn is a little tent 'black as the tents of Kedar' their progenitor [...]&lt;ref name=Elliotp144&gt;Elliot, 1839, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Charles Forster (theologian)|Charles Forster]] identifies the Arab tribe of the [[Beni Harb]] as the modern descendants of the Kedar.&lt;ref name=Forsterp255&gt;Forster, 1844, pp. 255-259.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that Beni Harb ("sons of war") is a [[patronym]] and [[nom de guerre]] that was adopted by the tribe at least 2,000 years ago, replacing Kedar as the national moniker.&lt;ref name=Forsterp255/&gt;

===Biblical===
[[File:Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness.jpg|thumb|left|220px|right|Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness, painting by [[Karel Dujardin]]]]
The descendants of [[Abraham]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] are called [[Ishmaelites]], after [[Ishmael]], their firstborn, and the Qedarites are named for his second son, Qedar.&lt;ref name=Waddellp50&gt;Alexander and Alexander, 1839, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible refers to both the Qedarites and Qedar frequently.&lt;ref name=Kingp40&gt;King, 1993, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Old Testament references include [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (25:13), [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] (21:16-17, 42:11, 60:7), [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] (2:10, 49:28-33), [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] (27:21), and [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] (1:29).&lt;ref name=Blenkinsoppp225/&gt; Twice, Qedar is used to refer to the actual son of Ishmael, as in the books of Genesis and Chronicles, while remaining references are to his descendants, referring either to his most prominent North Arabian sons, or to the Arabs and [[Bedouins]] as a more general collective.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp761&gt;Freedman et al., 2000, p. 761.&lt;/ref&gt; The "tents of Kedar" equated with "the peace-hating [[Meshech]]" mentioned in the [[Book of Psalms]] (120:5) were likely a Qedarite sub-group.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp761/&gt;

In [[Canticles]] (1:5), the tents of the Qedarites are described as black:  "Black I am, but beautiful, ye daughters of Jerusalem / As tents of Qedar, as tentcloth of Salam black."&lt;ref name=Freedmanp761/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seitz&gt;{{Citation|title=Jerusalem and its Gods A Review of Ancient Astral Worship and 'Jerusalem'|author=Charmaine Seitz|journal=Jerusalem Quarterly|publisher=Institute of Jerusalem Studies|volume=Issue 32, Fall 2007|accessdate=2009-04-17 | url=http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=43|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their tents are said to be made of black goat hair.&lt;ref name="Kingp40"/&gt; A tribe of [[S-L-M|Salam]] was located just south of the [[Nabateans]] in [[Madain Salih]], and Knauf proposed that the Qedarites mentioned in this [[Masoretic text]] were in fact Nabataeans and played a crucial role in the [[spice trade]] in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name=Seitz/&gt;

Biblical descriptions indicate there were two major types of Qedarites: nomads ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''wabariya'') living in tents and sedentary people ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:''ḥaḍariya'') living in villages.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; Jeremiah describes them as "a nation at ease, that dwells securely" (49:31) and notes that they engage in the pagan practice of shaving their temples.&lt;ref name="Kingp40" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; Isaiah recalls their warrior activities and skill with the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]]. (21:16f) &lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt; Ezekiel associates, "Arabia and all the princes of Kedar," and indicates that they engaged in sheep/goat trading with the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freedmanp761/&gt; The three books list the flocks of the Qedarites as including lambs, rams, goats and camels.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt;

Jeremiah also tells of a campaign by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] (630–562 BCE) against the Qedarites during the Babylonian period.&lt;ref name=Guzzop10/&gt; [[Geshem (Bible)|Gashmu]], the king of the Qedarites mentioned in the 5th century BCE Aramaic inscription described above, is also referred to as "Geshem the Arab" or "Geshem the Arabian" by [[Nehemiah]] who lists him as one of his adversaries, since Gashmu stands opposed to Nehemiah's governorship over [[Judea]] in 447 BCE.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guzzop10&gt;Guzzo et al., 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malamatp177&gt;Malamat and Ben-Sasson, 1976, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and society==
Biblical and extrabiblical evidence suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name=Blockp78&gt;Block, 1998, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other nomadic groups, they lived primarily in unfortified encampments.&lt;ref name=Ephalp175&gt;Eph'al, 1982, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastoralists and traders in livestock, such as male lambs, rams and goats, they also played a key role in the prosperity of Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine.&lt;ref name=Lipinskip333/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blockp78/&gt; As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp63&gt;Hoyland, 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they were vassals under Assyrian rule and were often engaged in rebellion against that empire, the rise to dominance of the Persian empire proved beneficial to the Qedarites.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp63/&gt; Qedarite control of the trade routes and the access they afforded the Persians translated into what Herodotus described as a friendly relationship.{{ref label|friendship_C|c}}

===Language===
The Qedarites are among a number of North Arabian tribes whose interactions with [[Arameaens|Arameaen]] tribes beginning in the 8th century BCE resulted in cultural exchanges between these two large [[Semitic people|Semitic]] groups.&lt;ref name=Greenfieldp158/&gt; Early Arab tribal groups like the Qedarites spoke [[Old Arabic]], but as the [[Arabic alphabet]] had not yet been developed, they used the [[Aramaic alphabet]] to write.&lt;ref name=Greenfieldp158/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylorp151/&gt; "The tongue of Kedar" is used in [[rabbinical]] sources as a name for the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=Alexanderp67&gt;Alexander, 1847, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papponymy]], the practice of naming boys after their grandfathers, was common among the Qedar.&lt;ref name=Crossp158&gt;Cross, 2000, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Qedarites had Aramaic personal names (e.g. Hazael or ''Haza-el''), while others had Arabic personal names (e.g. Gashmu and [[Zabibe]]).&lt;ref name=Taylorp151&gt;Taylor, 2001, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipinskip438&gt;Lipinski, 2000, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaic civilization and its peoples were gradually absorbed by the Arabs with [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]] in [[Lebanon]], [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestine]], [[Syrian Arabic|Syria]], and [[Iraqi Arabic|Iraq]] in particular exhibiting the influence of Aramaic.&lt;ref name=Greenfieldp158&gt;Greenfield et al., 2001, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious worship among the Qedar, as was the case for most of the inhabitants of Arabia until the 7th century CE, was polytheistic. Its practices and beliefs included an emphasis on female idols and worshippers. Divine images of the gods and goddesses worshipped by Qedarite Arabs, as noted in Assyrian inscriptions, included representations of Atarsamain, Nuha, Ruda, Daa, Abirillu, and Atarquruma. The female guardian of these idols, usually the reigning queen, served as a priestess (''apkallatu'', in Assyrian texts) who communed with the other world.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp132&gt;Hoyland, 2001, pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, there is also evidence that the Qedar worshipped [[Al-lāt]], to whom the inscription on a silver bowl from a king of Qedar is dedicated.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp63&gt;Hoyland, 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], which was passed down orally for centuries before being transcribed c. 500 CE, in tractate [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Taanis]] (folio 5b), it is said that most Qedarites worshipped pagan gods .&lt;ref name=Neusnerp295&gt;Neusner, 2006, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gidar.jpg|220px|thumbnail|Qedarite tomb in [[Qeydar]] city]]

===Tomb===
There is a mausoleum assigned to Qedar in [[Qeydar]] city, [[Zanjan Province]], [[Iran]].

==Genealogy==
The biblical view of the late [[Iron Age]] political and cultural map describes it as a set of branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from [[Terah]] are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the [[Kingdom of Judah]] between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such is the case of the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.&lt;ref name=Routledgep43&gt;Routledge, 2004, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The majority of [[Sayyid]] believe they are one of the modern day descendants of [[Muhammad]], and that they are therefore the descendants of Ishmael and his second son Qedar.&lt;ref name=Shahidp334&gt;Shahîd, 1989, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad al-Baqir|Abu Ja'far al-Baqir]] (676–743 CE) wrote that his father [[Zayn al-Abidin|Ali ibn Husayn]] informed him that [[Mohammed]] had said: "The first whose tongue spoke in clear Arabic was Ishmael, when he was fourteen years old."&lt;ref name=Wheelerp110&gt;Wheeler, 2002, p. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hisham Ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi]] (737–819 CE) established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Mohammed using writings that drew on biblical and [[Palmyra]]n sources, and the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs. His book, ''Jamharat al-Nasab'' ("The Abundance of Kinship"), seems to posit that the people known as "Arabs" are all descendants of Ishmael.&lt;ref name=Sinai&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centre for Sinai|url=http://www.centre4sinai.com.eg/arabia%20in%20ancient%20history.htm|title="Arabia" in Ancient History|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1373) writes, "All the Arabs of the [[Hijaz]] are descendants of [[Nebaioth]](Nubia,Sudan) and Qedar."&lt;ref name=Wheelerp110/&gt; Medieval Jewish sources also usually identified Qedar with Arabs and/or Muslims.&lt;ref name="Alexanderp67" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alfonsop137&gt;Alfonso, 2007, p. 137, note 36.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|poetry_D|d}} According to author and scholar Irfan Shahîd, Western scholars viewed this kind of "genealogical Ishmaelism" with suspicion, seeing it as, &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] a late [[Islam]]ic fabrication because of the confusion in Islamic times which made it such a capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the north of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. But shorn of this extravagance, the concept is much more modest in its denotation, and in the sober sources it applies only to certain groups among the Arabs of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] times. Some important statements to this effect were made by  Muhammed when he identified some Arabs as Ishmaelites and others as not.&lt;ref name=Shahidp335&gt;Shahîd, 1989, p. 335-336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that Ishmael was both an important religious figure and [[eponym]]ous ancestor for some of the Arabs of western Arabia.&lt;ref name=Shahidp335/&gt; Prominence is given in Arab genealogical accounts to the first two of Ishmael's twelve sons, Nebaioth ({{lang-ar|نبيت}}, ''Nabīt'') and Qedar ({{lang-ar|قيدار}}, ''Qaydār''), who are also prominently featured in the Genesis account.&lt;ref name=Shahidp335/&gt; It is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern Arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve [[Ishmaelites|Ishamelite]] tribes.&lt;ref name=Shahidp335/&gt;

In accounts tracing the [[Family tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim|ancestry of Mohammed]] back to [[Ma'ad]] (and from there to [[Adam]]), Arab scholars alternate, with some citing the line as through Nebaioth, others Qedar.&lt;ref name=Mousawip219&gt;al-Mousawi in Boudreau et al., 1998, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Footnotes ==
*{{note|names_A|a}}The place names of Dumah and Tayma (or Tema') also happen to be the names of two of Ishamel's sons as recorded in the Bible, and Tayma was also the name of a tribe.&lt;ref name=Ephalp238&gt;Eph'al, 1982, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|transliteration_B|b}}It should be noted that in the original [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], ''Ú-a-a-te'' is used to refer to the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda).&lt;ref name=Ephalp115&gt;Eph'al, 1982, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is also sometimes referred to as ''Ia-u-ta-'' and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written ''Ú-a-a-te''.&lt;ref name=Ephalp115/&gt; The transliteration of the original Akkadian into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.
*{{note|poetry_C|c}}For example, in a love poem by [[Moses Ibn Ezra]] centering on a beautiful Muslim boy he met, he refers to him as, "a son of Qedar," another way of saying he is "Arab".&lt;ref name=Rothp192&gt;Roth, 1994, pp. 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|friendship_D|d}}Herodotus described the relationship between the Qedarites and the Persians as follows: "they did not yield the obedience of slaves to the Persians, but were united to them by friendship for having given Cambyses passage into Egypt, which the Persians could not enter without the consent of the Arabs."&lt;ref name=Hoylandp63/&gt;

{{cite CanLII|litigants='''Reference Re Eskimos'''|link=|year=1939|court=scc|num=22|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1939] SCR 104}} is a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] regarding the constitutional status of [[Canada]]'s [[Inuit]] people, then called "[[Eskimo]]s."  The case concerned section 91(24) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', then the ''British North America Act, 1867'', which assigns jurisdiction over "Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians" to the federal government.  The Supreme Court found that for the purposes of section 91(24), Inuit should be considered Indians.

==Background==
The case arose due to controversy as to whether Inuit in [[Quebec]] were under federal or provincial jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court noted that when the British North America Act was originally adopted, there were "few, if any" Inuit in Canada, which was then a much smaller country.  However, the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] always left open the possibility of joining Canada with other lands, and thus the Inuit in [[Rupert's Land]] were now within Quebec's borders.

The federal government at the time of this case did not want to take responsibility over the Inuit.  It argued that the term "Indians" as defined by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] would not include the Inuit, and that this document could be used to help interpret the British North America Act.

==Decision==
===Duff===
[[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice]] [[Lyman P. Duff]], in his opinion, consulted what he believed to be "the most authoritative" evidence, namely evidence from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]  which governed Rupert's Land. A [[British House of Commons]] committee examined how the company dealt with the Inuit in 1856 and 1857.  The Hudson's Bay Company prepared a report for the committee, and as Duff noted, the report referred to Inuit as a type of "Indian."  Later, after the British North America Act was adopted, the [[Parliament of Canada]] declared in December 1867 that if it gained jurisdiction over Rupert's Land, it would take responsibility for the Indians there.  In 1870, the territories were awarded to Canada.

Duff then added that the Inuit of [[Labrador]], as well, had been widely referred to as Indians from around 1760 and were when the British North America Act was adopted.  Official records from 1762 called Inuit "[[Primitive culture|savages]]", and Duff compared this to how Indian tribes such as the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and [[Wyandot people|Huron]] were called savages.  In 1869, a judge from the Court of Labrador prepared a report for the [[Governor of Newfoundland]] which referred to "Esquimaux" (Inuit) as a type of Indian.  Duff also found some [[missionaries]] referred to Inuit as Indians.  In this context, Duff found it important that in 1879, [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], one of the chief negotiators of the British North America Act and [[Prime Minister of Canada]], discussed the Inuit with [[Sir Hector Langevin]], and the discussion referenced the Inuit as Indians.

As defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Indians are "the several nations or tribes of Indian with whom We are connected and who lived under Our protection."  The federal government argued this would not include the Inuit, as the words "nations" and "tribes" were not used to describe Inuit communities.  However, Duff found evidence contradicting this.  Duff also said the Inuit under the Hudson's Bay Company to an extent lived under the "protection" of the Crown, "under either charter or license from the Crown."  Duff also doubted that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 could guide interpretation of the British North America Act.

Justices [[Albert Hudson]] and [[Henry Hague Davis]] each wrote brief opinions concurring with Duff.

===Cannon===
Justice [[Lawrence Arthur Dumoulin Cannon|Cannon]] wrote his own opinion finding the Inuit should be considered Indians.  He noted the report by [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]] in 1857 calling Inuit Indians.  Cannon then concluded, "the report of the Committee must have been known to the Legislature at Westminster in 1867."  He also pointed to the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] of 1864, in which Resolution 29(29) of the [[Quebec Resolutions]] declaring the (Federal) Parliament should govern "Indians and Lands reserved for the Indians," in which the latter term was translated into [[French language|French]] as "Les Sauvages et les terres réservées pour les Sauvages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-7104-f.html|language=French|title=Les résolutions de la Conférence de Québec - octobre 1864 (Les 72 Résolutions)|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant all natives in [[British North America]], including [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].

===Kerwin===
Justice [[Patrick Kerwin]] also wrote an opinion finding that Inuit were Indians. He felt the British North America Act, in referring to Indians, was intended to mean Aboriginals. He noted evidence that [[Samuel de Champlain]], missionaries and others classified Indians as "sauvages" and Inuit as "sauvages esquimaux."  Books which Kerwin speculated that the [[Fathers of Confederation]] and the [[British Parliament]] in 1867 might have seen also used this classification.  Editions of [[Webster's Dictionary]] from 1913 and the 1920s did not count the Inuit as Indians, but earlier [[dictionaries]] did.

===Crocket===
Justice [[Oswald Smith Crocket]] wrote an opinion briefly concurring with Justices Cannon and Kerwin.

==Financial trouble==
Following the voyage, there was concern for some time that certain bills to the tall ship operators would not be paid, as The Sea Trek Foundation ran short on cash and failed to honor its commitments.  However, Property Reserve, Inc, an affiliate of the LDS Church, which was not an organizer or sponsor of the event, stepped in and paid all of the foundation's debts in full.&lt;ref name=lds-affiliate&gt;{{cite news | author=Carrie A.

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).]]
{{International relations theory sidebar}}
In [[world-systems theory]], the '''semi-periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the semi-periphery''') are the [[industrialization|industrializing]], mostly [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[country|countries]] which are positioned between [[periphery countries|the periphery]] and [[core countries]]. Semi-periphery countries have organizational characteristics of both core countries and periphery countries and are often geographically located between core and peripheral regions as well as between two or more competing core regions.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; Semi-periphery regions play a major role in mediating economic, political, and social activities that link core and peripheral areas.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall.''The Seedbed of Change''.Chapter 5 of C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These regions allow for the possibility of innovative technology, reforms in social and organizational structure, and dominance over peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; These changes can lead to a semi-periphery country being promoted to a core nation.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Semi-periphery is, however, more than a description, as it also serves as a position within the world hierarchy in which social and economic change can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=terlouw&gt;Terlouw 1992 pg 136-145&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems theory describes the semi-periphery as a key structural element in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller&gt;Wallerstein 1976, pp. 229-233&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-periphery plays a vital role comparative to that of the role that Spain and Portugal played in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as intermediate trading groups within the European colonial empire.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

Today, the semi-periphery is generally industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2&gt;Wallerstein 1974 Vol.3, No.4., pp 461-483&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-peripheral countries contribute to the manufacturing and exportation of a variety of goods.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; They are marked by above average land mass, as exemplified by Argentina, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; More land mass typically means an increased market size and share.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral nations are not all large though, as smaller countries such as [[Israel]], Poland, and Greece exist within the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Sociological theory==
Semi-peripheral countries offer their citizens relatively diverse economic opportunities but also have extreme gaps between the rich and poor. World-system theorists originally used only two categories: [[periphery countries]] and [[core countries]]. A need for an in between category became quickly apparent,&lt;ref name="Chirot"&gt;Chirot. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the semi-periphery category for societies that have moved away from the periphery but have not become core. In other words, the category describes societies that remain dependent, and to some extent underdeveloped, despite having achieved significant levels of industrialization.&lt;ref name="Chirot"/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are tied into dynamic world systems that focus on the reliance of poor nations upon the wealthy, a concept known as the [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A.&lt;/ref&gt; The term semi-periphery has been applied to countries that existed as early as in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the creation of a semi-periphery category has added sociological and historical layers to previous developmental theories—yet it still has similar, inherently capitalist foundations.&lt;ref name="waller" /&gt;

===Function===
[[File:China fuels 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Energy and mineral resources]]
The semi periphery is needed to stabilize the world system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; as it facilitates interaction and provides a connection between the low-income [[periphery countries|peripheral states]] and the high-income [[core countries|core states]] by adding another step in the world system hierarchy.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; As the middle ground, semi-peripheral countries display characteristics of both the [[Core countries|core]] and the [[Periphery countries|periphery]].&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; They also serve as a political buffer zone in that while they are exploited, they are also the exploiters.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; These areas have either been core regions in the past or formerly-peripheral areas that have since advanced in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

Semi-peripheral nations are a necessary structural element in a world-trade system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; since such nations can serve to alleviate the political pressures that the core can exert upon the periphery and the political unrest that the periphery can direct back at the core.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; On the other hand, the semi-periphery can find itself excluded from the region's politics, as it lies just outside the bounds of political arena of the core states.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

The semi-periphery exists because it needs to divide the economic power between the core and the periphery. Semi-periphery, referred to as the middle class by Wallerstein, is what makes the capitalist world function because it is much like the sociological [[structural functionalism]] theory, where norms, customs, traditions, and institutions act as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole. Without these industrializing countries, change will never reach the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Chirot, Daniel, and Thomas D. Hall. 1982. 8:81-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of their contribution to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are major exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. They are often focused in the manufacturing and exportation of industrial goods and commodities. While these advances separate the semi-periphery from the periphery, they lack the power and the economic dominance of core nations and still have a lot of un-managed poverty, placing them beneath the core.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are important contributors to the world economy because of the above reasons and because they tend to have above average land mass, meaning that they are host to an above average market.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; A primary example is China, a country with not only a large area but with a booming population.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt;

==History and development==

===13th century===
[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[silk road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]This era of human history found the semi-periphery concentrated in the area stretching from the Middle East to China, including India and the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; This was the first time in history that the peripheries and semi-peripheries of the world became connected and involved in the trade of the world, both with cores and with each other.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through a lucrative trade system, including heavy taxing of goods traveling through their borders, they were able to maintain a steady stream of wealth, becoming the driving forces of economic change throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;  In addition, a heavy emphasis on defense and border security, particularly among the [[Mongols]], allowed them to be fairly impenetrable [[trade]] obstacles.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; [[Geography]] also played a role, as seen in India's development of an impressive [[maritime industry]].  Because of its position along a convenient route through the Indian Ocean, India established its role as a "hinge" between the [[East]] and [[West]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through their positions within the world trade system, semi-peripheries in the Middle East became crucially important in connecting the cities of Chinese and Indian cores with the fledgling cities of Europe, as well as serving as key points between other, more major core cities in the region, such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1300–1450===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes.]]

Following increases in population and commerce in Western Europe in the thirteenth century, the [[feudal system]] met severe economic difficulties in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;Halsall 1997, pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in development was caused by a combination of the decline in agricultural production, the shrinking economy that had already hit its peak within the current feudal structure, and the devastating effects of the [[Black Plague]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; The regression of Western Europe into the semi-periphery and periphery allowed for the rise of the trading powers of Italy, most notably [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; These Italian city-states took advantage of their established trade connections with the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Far East]], the Middle East, and the other Mediterranean powers to maintain their growth despite the economic failures of their European trade partners.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa and Venice had influence beyond their trade channels. Both were instrumental in the [[Crusades]] through their provisions of troops, transport vessels, and naval ships.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa also assisted the [[Byzantine Empire]] when it helped recapture the capital, [[Constantinople]], in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The Byzantine Empire took advantage of its strategic position along various trade routes and the decline of Western Europe to rise to [[Core countries|core]] status until its fall in 1453.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

During this time period, Genoa and Venice developed forms of [[laissez-faire]] government and institutions that are viewed as precursors to modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Despite these advances in influence and entrepreneurship, Genoa and Venice suffered from the crippling effects of the Black Plague, as much of the rest of Europe had before them.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Venice was able to survive due to its connection with the Southern trade route, though her strength was much reduced by the middle of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa never fully recovered from the [[Black Death]] and its defeat at the hands of Venice in the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The decline of Genoa and the shift in Venice's focus to the [[Red Sea]] trade route left the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic open to Portugal and Spain, who were already better positioned geographically to control Atlantic trade routes.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1450–1700===
[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|460px|The areas of the world that at one time were territories of the Spanish Empire.]]
  
In a push to ensure stable economic growth, Europe turned to a capitalistic economy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries to replace the failed feudal system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Modern capitalism allowed for economies to extend beyond geographical and political boundaries, leading to the formation of the first worldwide economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; At the base of this world system was an [[international division of labor]] that determined countries' relationships and placement within the categories of the world system: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The core regions, most notably the countries of Northwestern Europe like England, France, and the [[Netherlands]], gained the most from the world economy.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Their ascension from previous peripheral and semi-peripheral status to the core was driven by the development of strong central government and military power, the combination of which made possible control of international commerce and exploitation of colonial possessions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum was the periphery, marked by lack of central government, exportation of raw materials to the core, and exploitive labor practices.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this time period, especially toward the end of the 17th century, South America and parts of North America stood out as peripheral zones under the control and capitalistic exploitation of core countries in Europe.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; [[Slaves]] and indigenous workers in these regions developed [[raw materials]] for export to Europe, a distinctive characteristic of the new capitalism, as goods were no longer produced solely for internal consumption.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The [[aristocracy]] of these regions controlled commerce and became wealthy through the new world economy, leading to their rise in power above the government.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Even in periods of upheaval, local aristocrats were able to rely on core European powers to assist in keeping control over the economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

In between the core and periphery was the semi-periphery, which constituted both previous core regions that had declined, like Italy, Spain and Portugal, and peripheries that had improved their position, like southern Germany and southern France.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Spain and Portugal had taken advantage of the opening to Atlantic control left by the decline of Italian powers like Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Much like the core European powers, Spain and Portugal had strong navies and expansive colonial domains, which they exploited for their natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Rather than using the increased wealth to develop strong domestic [[manufacturing]] sectors, as other Western European powers did, Spain and Portugal used imported gold and silver to obtain manufactured goods from the core countries, relegating them to semi-periphery instead of core status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; So, while they had control over several peripheral regions and exploited them, a characteristic of a core region, these countries failed to develop the quality manufacturing industries and the access to international banking that further defined core countries, leaving them a step below in the world system at semi-periphery status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1700–1875===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|300px|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies]]
The development of trade between Europe, the Americas, and the East generated massive profits for a relatively small [[merchant]] elite in the European colonial powers.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; These merchants were able to utilize their profits to take control of [[agriculture]] and other industries.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The merchant class further consolidated its power by extending control over internal markets and the prices of finished goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The end result was the development of the necessary capital to [[industrialize]] the European core states.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

This era was defined by the transition from agriculture to [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The rapid development of industry triggered several reactions. Many European states explored new territories in addition to their original colonial holdings for new markets to exploit.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The European world system continued to expand and include more regions, as it absorbed the Indian Ocean economic system through the acquisition of colonies by Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, among others.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Previously isolated regions, like much of the American interior zone, joined newly independent South American countries in becoming part of the periphery.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; By the nineteenth century, Asia and Africa had also entered the world system as peripheral regions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; This development of Africa and Asia as peripheral continents allowed for new cores like the United States and Germany to improve their core status, rising higher within the world system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

Throughout this time period was a constant shift within core regions from a combination of agriculture and industry to solely industrial enterprise.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of this time period, as core regions encouraged the development of [[manufacturing]] in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1875–1914===
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|A ration party of the Royal Irish Rifles in a communication trench.]] The [[West]] represented both the core and the semi-periphery, as Europe dominated 80% of the world's market share.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rest of the world was a diverse periphery, though Japan was a notable exception.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; As expansionism continued, new core nations emerged, such as the Britain, Germany, and the United States, while old cores such as Spain and Portugal faded to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The growth of the power of the common man led to an expansion of thought concerning democracy, communism, and revolution, which pervaded the weaker semi-peripheral nations overcome with civil distress.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; In some cases, this led to the weakening of the nations, such as the violent revolution in France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; This contributed to the adoption of totalitarian leaders, as seen in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The major factors contributing to world war were the conflicts and power struggles taking place between the three classes of nations in the global system.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; Nations considered part of the semi-periphery felt oppressed by the stronger, larger core nations.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt;

===1914–today===

This trend known to continued throughout the century, with Germany, Russia, and Japan also taking seats at the core. At the end of World War II however, Germany quickly fell to the [[semi-periphery]] along with war-ravaged France. As the rest of Europe struggled to rebuild itself, it also fell to the [[semi-periphery]], with the exception of many [[Eastern European]] nations, who fell under the Soviet Union as bloc countries. Japan also fell back into semi-periphery, along with the industrializing China and India, until their recent upswing in influence. Change also came to North America, where [[American imperialism]] led to the rise of countries like [[Guatemala]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. On the other side of the Pacific, Australia was also developing, helping to secure an Allied Victory in World War II.

In today's global hierarchy, some states are transitioning upward while others are moving downward in terms of status and influence. Former colonial powers no longer exercise control over an international domain and are instead mostly relegated to their core; for example, former European world powers do not exert influence over colonial outposts in the [[Americas]], Africa, or Asia, but rather have consolidated their power in the form of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, Timothy M.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/2118h2x63n84u170/]&lt;/ref&gt; The new leading powers are mostly non-European (United States, Canada, Japan). Outside of these developed countries are countries (see list below) that are considered semi-periphery and are both dominant and dominated within economic, political, and social realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; These middle powers are a combination of nations that have emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and nations that have risen because of their possession of resources in high demand, like oil in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; While these nations are by no means on the level of the stated world powers, they are able to exert influence over the weaker nations of the impoverished [[Fourth World]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Other terms used to describe semi-periphery countries include sub-imperial and semi-industrial.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] identifies three ways by which countries can emerge from the periphery into the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Countries with a large market and room for industrial growth, like [[Brazil]], South Africa, and Mexico, and countries with valuable energy resources, like [[Iran]] and Saudi Arabia, can utilize the strategy of seizing the chance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; The strategy of promotion by invitation can be utilized by countries willing to be open to foreign governmental and regional administrative centers.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Examples of past countries to utilize this strategy are the capitalist regimes in Africa like [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Zaire]], [[Senegal]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; These countries use [[dependency theory|dependent development]] to integrate into the world economy and establish local dominance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Outside of these strategies is that of self-reliance, a basic theory that as some countries grow, others will decline.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Many countries in Africa and South America have exhibited the qualities of a sub-imperial or semi-industrial power.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Wallerstein examines the role of semi-periphery countries during a period of economic downturn.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To redefine core and periphery countries in an economic sense, core countries are characterized by advanced technology, high [[Profit (economics)|profits]], high wages, and diversified production while periphery countries have less technology, low profits, low wages, and less diversified production.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-periphery countries fall in the middle of these spectra, and their unique political and social structure place them in a position where they can best take advantage of economic downturns.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

These economic downturns occur because of increased [[supply (economics)|supply]] and decreased [[demand]], which combine to create a shift in surplus and power to the semi-periphery. Semi-periphery regions take advantage of the situation by expanding control of their home markets and the surrounding periphery countries at the expense of core countries.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; The underlying reason for this shift in power lies in the basic economic principle of [[scarcity]]. As long as core countries maintain scarcities of their goods, they can select customers from semi-periphery and periphery countries that are competing over them. When excess supply occurs, the core countries are the ones competing over a smaller market. This competition allows semi-peripheral nations to select from among core countries rather than vice versa when making decisions about commodity purchases, manufacturing investments, and sales of goods, shifting the balance of power to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; While in general there is a power shift from core to semi-periphery in times of economic struggles, there are few examples of semi-peripheral countries transitioning to core status.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To accomplish this, semi-peripheral nations must not only take advantage of weaker core countries but must also exploit any existing advantages over other semi-peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; How well they exploit these advantages determines their arrangement within the semi-periphery class.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Election MG 3455.JPG|thumb|A ballot box]]
The semi-peripheral nations of the world have played an important role to world trade and interaction since early periods of globalized trade. This "middle ground" between the very powerful [[Core countries|cores]] and the backwaters of the far [[Periphery countries|periphery]] allowed those two zones to interact with greater ease. For example, during the [[Pax Mongolica|13th-century world system]], the semi-periphery areas around Europe's Mediterranean Coast facilitated trade between the peripheries of the more manufacturing based [[Flanders|Northern Europe]] and the cores of India and China.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; John Markoff, a [[sociology|sociologist]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of [[democracy]], originate in the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable [[First World|core nations]], where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor [[Third World|periphery]] where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.&lt;ref name="Markoff"&gt;Markoff, John. 1999-1041:4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheikh Abdurahman Sh. Nur''' ({{lang-so|Sheekh Cabdiraxmaan Sheekh Nuur}}, {{lang-ar|الشيخ عبد الرحمن الشيخ نور}}) was one of the few educated Somali people in nintee  century elite Sheikh|Qādi (judge) of the government at that time and the inventor of the [[Borama script]] for the [[Somali language]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=I. M.|date=1958-01-01|title=The Gadabuursi Somali Script|jstor=610496|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=21|issue=1/3|pages=134–156|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00063278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Omni"&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm Somali alphabets, pronunciation and language]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sheikh Abdurahman Sh. Nur grew up in [[Borama]], he was of royal lineage, the Reer Ugaas subclan of the [[Makayl-Dheere]] branch of the [[Gadabuursi]] [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan.&lt;ref name="Laitin"&gt;David D. Laitin, ''Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience'', (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), pp.86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up he was a [[Qur'an]]ic teacher in the [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]]. His father Sheikh Nur was a well-known and notable figure and was a [[Qadi|qādi]] for many years. He was a learned or knowledgeable man, in particular when it came to the history of his own clan, the [[Gadabuursi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=I. M.|date=1958-01-01|title=The Gadabuursi Somali Script|jstor=610496|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=21|issue=1/3|pages=142|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00063278}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheikh]] 'Abdurahman would later follow in his father's footsteps by also becoming a [[Qadi|qādi]], albeit of the entire northern British Somaliland region.&lt;ref name="Laitin" /&gt;

In 1933, Nuur devised a quite phonetically accurate new [[orthography]] for transcribing the Somali language. While the script enjoyed considerable currency in his hometown, the Sheikh harbored no illusions as to its widespread adoption, writing in a publication of his wherein he employed the script itself that "I publish it here with no intention of attempting to contribute to the already abundant confusion in the choice of a standard orthography for Somali".&lt;ref name="Laitin"/&gt;
