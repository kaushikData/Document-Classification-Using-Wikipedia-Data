'''Akatek''' (Acateco) is a [[Mayan language]] spoken by the [[Akatek people]] primarily in the [[Huehuetenango Department]], [[Guatemala]] in and around the municipalities of [[Concepción Huista]], [[Nentón]], [[San Miguel Acatán]], [[San Rafael La Independencia]] and [[San Sebastián Coatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cabral |first=Ernesto Díaz Couder |year=2001 |title=Culturas e interculturalidad en Guatemala |url=http://www.relint.deusto.es/ALFA_EPI/documentos/Culturas%20e%20interculturalidad%20en%20Guatemala%5B1%5D.16-5-02.doc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215201714/http://www.relint.deusto.es/ALFA_EPI/documentos/Culturas%20e%20interculturalidad%20en%20Guatemala%5B1%5D.16-5-02.doc |archivedate=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of speakers also live in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]]. It is a living language with 58,600 speakers in 1998, of which 48,500 lived in [[Guatemala]] and the remaining in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=knj Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Akatek is closely related to the two [[List of Mayan languages|Mayan languages]], [[Q'anjob'al language|Q'anjob'al]] and [[Jakaltek language|Jakaltek]]. The three languages together form the Q'anjob'al-Jakaltek sub-branch, which together with the [[Mocho' language]] form the Q'anjob'alan sub-branch, which again, together with the Chujean languages, [[Chuj language|Chuj]] and [[Tojolab'al language|Tojolab'al]], form the branch Q'anjobalan–Chujean. It is believed that Q'anjob'al–Jakaltek split into Akatek, Q'anjob'al and Jakaltek some 500 to 1,500 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Akatek was regarded as a dialect of the [[Q'anjob'al language]] until the 1970s, when linguists realized that it has a distinct grammar from that of Q'anjob'al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maldonado | first = Roberto Zavala | year = 1992 | title = Acateco de la frontera sur | url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED378803}}&lt;/ref&gt; That it has been thought a dialect of Q'anjob'al is reflected in the many names Akatek has had through time. One of its primary names before it was named Akatek was ''Western Q'anjob'al'', but it has also been called ''Conob'' and various names including ''Q'anjob'al'' and the municipality where it is spoken.

An interesting aspect of Akatek [[grammar]], which is also present in most other Q'anjobalan languages, is the use of [[morpheme|directional morphemes]], which appear as [[Clitic#Classification|enclitics]]. These morphemes make it possible for the speaker to talk about movement and direction in space without pointing or using other gestures. Consider the [[stative verb]] {{IPA|[ʔej]}} ''to be'', which can appear as {{IPA|[ʔejʔok]}} ''existing inwards'', {{IPA|[ʔejtok]}} ''existing towards there, away from the speaker and listener'' and {{IPA|[ʔeːltox]}} ''existing from the inside out'', using different enclitics.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===

'''Akshay Kumar Datta''' (also spelt '''Akshay Kumar Dutta''') ({{lang-bn|&lt;big&gt;অক্ষয় কুমার দত্ত&lt;/big&gt;}}) (15 July 1820 – 18 May 1886) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] writer from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was born in [[Bagerhat]], [[British India]]. Son of Pitamber Dutta, he was one of the initiators of the [[Bengal Renaissance]].

==Early life and studies==
After studying in the [[Oriental Seminary]] under the special care of '''Hardman Jeffroy''', he had to give up studies because of the death of his father and go job-seeking. However, that could not put an end to his yearning for learning. At the Sovabazar Rajbari library, he studied and mastered Calculus and Geometry. He had learnt Sanskrit and Persian, and read the Hindu scriptures at school. He acquired proficiency in French, German and various Indian languages. He composed the poetry-book ''Anangamohan'' at the age of 14. While a youngster he used to translate news items and features for [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta|Iswar Chandra Gupta's]] ''[[Sambad Prabhakar]]''. He even studied in Medical College for some time to gain knowledge of botany, zoology and chemistry. 

==Writing==
In 1839, he joined the Tattwabodhini Sabha and soon became its assistant secretary. He was appointed a teacher of the Tattwabodhini Pathsala the next year and in 1843, ''[[Tattwabodhini Patrika]]'' was published as mouthpiece of both the Tattwabodhini Sabha and [[Brahmo Samaj]]. He was the '''first editor of the journal''' and contributed substantially towards the development of prose writing in Bengali. He was the first [[Bengali people|Bengali]] writer to seriously work for the propagation of a '''modern scientific outlook''', writing books on Physics and Geography in Bengali. He also wrote profusely on astronomy, mathematics and geology. The students of Hindu College used to make fun of Bengali writing and some even felt that nothing worthwhile can be written in the Bengali language. However, whenever, ''Tattwabodhini Patrika'' came out they not only read it seriously but even brought it to the attention of one another. 

Akshay Kumar Datta was the first person in the Brahmo Samaj to boldly proclaim that the ''Vedas'' were not infallible. He succeeded in convincing Debendranath Tagore in this respect and ultimately Brahmo Samaj adopted the thinking that while it respected all religious scriptures it did not consider any as infallible. It was in this perspective that [[Debendranath Tagore]] wrote ''Brahmo Dharma''.

==Magnum opus==
In 1855, he developed some kind of agonising cerebral problem and could not continue with his massive work for the ''Tattwabodhini Patrika''. His work was such that sometimes he used to spend the entire night writing. Moreover, he had serious philosophical and theological differences with his employer Debendranath Tagore. He left Tattwabodhini and served for sometime as Principal of the Normal School for teachers' training established by [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]], his friend and mentor.

His magnum opus was the two-part ''Bharatbarshiya Upasak Sampraday'' (Vol.1, 1871, Vol.2, 1883). The brilliant introductions to the two volumes of this book evince his profound philosophical, linguistic and scientific learning and depth. Among others, '''Max Muller, Monier-Williams and Rajendralal Mitra''' were greatly impressed by his profound scholarship, though not agreeing on all points.

===Major points===
Deeply influenced by Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and Rammohan Roy, he was among the first few men in modern India who had presented an '''empiricist critique of the ancient Indian philosophies.''' He was bold enough to point out that contrary to popular belief, much of Indian philosophy was suffused with atheist and sceptical thought. For example, Samkhya was professedly atheist; Patanjali / Yoga, while no doubt theist, basically explained the applied aspects of Samkhya; Vaisheshika traced the ultimate reality to ''paramanu'', i.e., atoms; Nyaya studied the logic and methodology of studying reality; Purba Mimamsa of Jaimini pooh-poohed gods; even Vedanta, while accepting that Brahma was the ultimate reality, said that god was not the creator but the constructor of the world. Jainism, Charvaka philosophy and Buddhism also had no place for God, he showed. He was an agnostic and went against all religions, considering them to be harmful for humanity.

==Other works==
His other books were: ''Bahyabastur sahit manabprakritir sambandha bichar'' (based on the ''Constitution of Man'' by [[George Combe]]), ''Dharmaniti'', ''Prachin Hinduder Samudrajatra O Banijya bistar'' (published posthumously by his son Rajani Nath Datta), ''Charupath'' (in three volumes), and ''Padarthyabidya''. 

The textbook ''Charupath'' was mandatory reading for almost three generations. Akshay Datta earned a lot of money from it. This he spent in building up a botanical garden and a geological museum at Shovon-Udyan, his retreat at Bally in Howrah. The portraits of Newton, Darwin, Mill, T H Huxley and Raja Ram Mohan Roy hung in his study cum laboratory.

==Personal life==
His family life was not happy. Relations with both his wife and his sons were strained. In a sense he died a lonely man, leaving a substantial amount for the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science. A few days after his death in 1886 at Bally in Howrah, a meeting was held in Calcutta where tall promises were made on how to immortalise his memory. But absolutely nothing emerged and eventually he became forgotten.

The renowned Bengali poet [[Satyendranath Dutta]] was his grandson.

The '''Arapaho''' (Arapahoe) language ('''{{lang|arp|Hinónoʼeitíít}}'''){{sfn|Conathan|2006|loc='A'}} is one of the [[Plains Algonquian languages]], closely related to [[Gros Ventre language|Gros Ventre]] and other [[Arapahoan languages]]. It is spoken by the [[Arapaho]] of [[Wyoming]] and [[Oklahoma]]. Speakers of Arapaho primarily live on the [[Wind River Indian Reservation]] in Wyoming, though some have affiliation with the [[Cheyenne]] living in western Oklahoma.

==Classification==
Arapaho is an Algonquian language of the [[Algic languages|Algic family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arapaho|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arp|website=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
By the 1850s, Arapaho bands formed two tribes: the Northern Arapaho and Southern Arapaho. Since 1878 the Northern Arapaho have lived with the Eastern Shoshone on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and are federally recognized as the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation. The Southern Arapaho live with the Southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma. Together their members are enrolled as the federally recognized Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.

== Current status ==
The exact number of Arapaho speakers is not precisely known; however it has been estimated that the language currently retains between 250 {{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p = 1}} and 1,000 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arp&lt;/ref&gt; active users. Arapaho has limited development outside of the home; however, it is used in some films&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arp&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bible]] was translated into the language in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arp&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, under 300 people over the age of 50 speak the language in Wyoming, and in Oklahoma the language is used by "only a handful of people . . . all near eighty or older".{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p = 1}} As of 1996, there were approximately 1,000 speakers among the Northern Arapaho.{{sfn|Greymorning|2001|p = 287}} As of 2008, the authors of a newly published grammar estimated that there were slightly over 250 fluent speakers, plus "quite a few near-fluent passive understanders".{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p = 1}} In 2008, it was reported that a school had been opened to teach the language to children.{{sfn|Frosch|2008}} Arapaho language camps were held in Summer 2015 at [[Wind River Tribal College]] and in [[St. Stephens, Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Northern Arapaho Language Camp wrapped up Wednesday at St. Stephens|url = http://county10.com/2015/08/13/northern-arapaho-language-camp-wrapped-up-wednesday-at-st-stephens/|website = County 10|accessdate = 2015-10-03|first = Ernie|last = Over}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the language may be acquired by children, for a population estimate as recent as 2007 lists an increase to 1,000 speakers and notes that the language is in use in schools, bilingual education efforts begun on Wind River Reservation in the 1980s and the Arapaho Language Lodge, a successful immersion program, was established in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arp&lt;/ref&gt; "The Arapaho Project" is an effort made by the Arapaho people to promote and restore their traditional language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/linguistics/csilw/newarapproj2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Despite hope for the language, its relatively few active users and the fact that it has seen recent population decreases render Arapaho an [[endangered language]]. [[Ethnologue]] deems it "threatened," meaning that some children are learning it but it is threatened by other languages and it may be losing speakers.

==Dialects==
Besawunena, only attested from a wordlist collected by Kroeber, differs only slightly from Arapaho, though a few of its sound changes resemble those seen in Gros Ventre. It had speakers among the Northern Arapaho as recently as the late 1920s.

==Phonology==
Among the sound changes in the evolution from [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] to Arapaho are the loss of Proto-Algonquian *k, followed by *p becoming either {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/tʃ/}}; the two Proto-Algonquian [[semivowel]]s merging to either {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}; the change from *s to {{IPA|/n/}} in word-initial position, and *m becoming {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} depending on the following vowel. Arapaho is unusual among Algonquian languages in retaining the contrast between the reconstructed phonemes *r and *θ (generally as {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}, respectively).{{sfn|Hale|2001|pp=283-284}}{{sfn|Goddard|1974|p=}}{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=103}} These and other changes serve to give Arapaho a phonological system very divergent from that of Proto-Algonquian and other Algonquian languages, and even from languages spoken in the adjacent [[Great Basin]]. Some examples comparing Arapaho words with their cognates in Proto-Algonquian can illustrate this:{{sfn|Goddard|1974|pp=1974:104, 106, 107, 108}}{{sfn|Goddard|2001|p=75}}{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=103}}

===Vowels===

At the level of pronunciation, Arapaho words cannot begin with a vowel, so where the underlying form of a word begins with a vowel, a prothetic {{IPA|/h/}} is added.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=14}}

Arapaho has a series of four short vowels {{IPA|/i e o u/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ ɛ ɔ ʊ]}}) and four long vowels {{IPA|/iː eː oː uː/}} (customarily written {{angle bracket|ii ee oo uu}} and pronounced {{IPA|[iː ɛː ɔː uː]}}). The difference in length is phonemically distinctive: compare '''hísiʼ''', "tick" with '''híísiʼ''', "day", and '''hócoo''', "steak" with '''hóócoo''', "devil".{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=14}} {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are mostly in complementary distribution, as, with very few exceptions, the former does not occur after [[velar consonant]]s, and the latter only occurs after them. {{IPA|/u/}} does have some exceptions as in the free variants '''kokíy''' ~ '''kokúy''', "gun"; '''kookiyón''' ~ '''kookuyón''', "for no reason"; and '''bííʼoxíyoo''' ~ '''bííʼoxúyoo''', "Found in the Grass" (a mythological character). There is only one minimal pair to illustrate the contrast in distribution: '''núhuʼ''', "this" versus '''níhiʼ-''', "X was done with Y", in which '''níhiʼ-''' only occurs in bound form.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|pp=14-16}}

Remarkably, unlike more than 98% of the world's languages, Arapaho has no [[Open vowel|low vowels]], such as {{IPA|/a/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid_find.html Search the [[UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database|UPSID database]] for languages not having a low vowel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are four diphthongs, {{IPA|/ei ou oe ie/}}, and several triphthongs, {{IPA|/eii oee ouu/}} as well as extended sequences of vowels such as {{IPA|/eee/}} with stress on either the first or the last vowel in the combination.{{sfn|Salzman ''et al.''|1998|p=}}

===Consonants===
The consonant inventory of Arapaho is given in the table below. When writing Arapaho, {{IPA|/j/}} is normally transcribed as {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} as {{angle bracket|c}}, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} as {{angle bracket|ʼ}}, and {{IPA|/θ/}} as {{angle bracket|3}}.

===Allophony===
The phoneme /b/ (the [[voiced bilabial stop]]) has a voiceless allophone [p] that occurs before other consonants or at the end of a word. The plosives {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, /k/, and /t/ are pronounced without [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] in most environments, but are aspirated before other consonants or at the end of a word, or when preceding a syllable-final sequence of short vowel + /h/. In this same environment /b/ is aspirated and devoiced. For example, the grammatical prefix '''cih-''' is pronounced {{IPA|[tʃʰɪh]}}, the grammatical prefix '''tih-''' is pronounced {{IPA|[tʰɪh]}}, and the word '''héétbihʼínkúútiinoo''', "I will turn out the lights" is '''het'''{{IPA|[b̥ʰ]}}'''ihʼínkúútiinoo'''.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|p=14}}

===Consonant clusters===
Consonant clusters in Arapaho can only be two consonants long. Consonant clusters do not occur word initially, and /hC/ is the only that occurs word finally. The only consonant cluster that is "base generated" (exists in the most underlying representation of words) is /hC/. At the "surface" (at the level of actual pronunciation), other clusters arise by phonological processes including vowel syncope, or by juxtaposition of morphemes.

===Prosody===
Arapaho is a [[pitch accent]] language. There are two phonemic tones: high (marked with an acute accent) or "normal" (unmarked). The contrast can be illustrated with the pair '''hónoosóóʼ''', "it is fancy" and '''honoosóóʼ''', "it is raining." Long vowels and vowel sequences can carry a contour tone from high to low, as in '''hou3íne-''', "to hang" (where the first syllable has a normal tone) versus '''hóu3íne-''', "to float" (where the first syllable has a high+normal, or falling, tone). Although tonal contrasts are distinctive in Arapaho, minimal pairs such as those listed above are rare.{{sfn|Cowell|Moss|2008|pp=22-23}}

The '''Armenian Wikipedia''' ({{lang-hy|Վիքիպեդիա|translit=Vikipedia}} or Վիքիպեդիա Ազատ Հանրագիտարան, ''Vikipedia Azat Hanragitaran'') is the [[Armenian language]] version of [[Wikipedia]].

It was created in February 2003&lt;ref&gt;[[:stats:EN/TablesWikipediaGrowthSummary.htm|Wikipedia Statistics: Creation history / Accomplishments]]&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Հայերեն Վիքիփեդիա''', but started developing in 2005{{attribution needed|date=December 2014}}. The name was changed to '''Հայերեն Վիքիպեդիա''' on 5 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[:hy:Վիքիպեդիա:Տերմինների քննարկում/Վիքիփեդիայի անվանում|Վիքիպեդիայի անվանափոխության առաջին փուլ]] and [[:hy:Վիքիպեդիա:Տերմինների քննարկում/Վիքիփեդիայի անվանում/Եզրափակիչ փուլ|Վիքիպեդիայի անվանափոխության երկրորդ փուլ]]։&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenpress.am/arm/news/679716/ Հայկական «Վիքիփեդիա»-ն քննարկում է անվանափոխության հնարավորությունը]&lt;/ref&gt;։

On 2 December 2013 it had reached 200,000 articles.

It has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|hy|N}} articles.&lt;ref&gt;[[:hy:Սպասարկող:Վիճակագրություն|Վիքիպեդիա Վիճակագրություն]]&lt;/ref&gt; It also has about {{NUMBEROF|USERS|hy|N}} registered contributors, including {{spellnum|{{NUMBEROF|ADMINS|hy}}}} administrators.

With all of its current content, it is listed in [[List of Wikipedias]] in the 100,000+ category.

==Language==
The [[Armenian language]] used is mainly the [[Eastern Armenian]] dialect. However, the Armenian Wikipedia is inclusive, and also contains articles of interest in the [[Western Armenian]] dialect, which is predominantly spoken in the [[Armenian Diaspora]].

Some articles have separate Eastern and Western Armenian versions. In those cases, the articles' secondary dialect is positioned at the top right corner of the article with the primary dialect. Articles in Western Armenian are also distinctly categorized [[:hy:Կատեգորիա:Արեւմտահայերէն յօդուածներ այբբենական կարգով|here - Category: Wikipedia Articles in Western Armenian]].

== History ==

===Name change===
The Armenian Wikipedia was originally named Վիքիփեդիա (''Vikʻipʻedia'') but in 2012 it was renamed Վիքիպեդիա (''Vikʻipedia''). The letter պ (''pē'') replaced the letter փ (''pʻiwr'') to reflect the [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]] pronunciation used in the [[Eastern Armenian]] dialect, the official form of the language as used in Armenia; however, the revised spelling is not consistent with the [[Western Armenian]] transliteration. The discussion and decision to make the change were done in two phases,&lt;ref&gt;[[:hy:Վիքիպեդիա:Տերմինների քննարկում/Վիքիփեդիայի անվանում|Վիքիպեդիա:Տերմինների քննարկում/Վիքիփեդիայի անվանում]] (in Armenian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:hy:Վիքիփեդիա:Տերմինների քննարկում/Վիքիփեդիայի անվանում/Եզրափակիչ փուլ|Վիքիպեդիա:Տերմինների քննարկում/Վիքիփեդիայի անվանում/Եզրափակիչ փուլ]] (in Armenian)&lt;/ref&gt; and the change was put in effect on 5 April 2012.

=== "One Armenian, One Article" ===
On 24 March 2014, both Wikimedia Armenia and the ''[[Human Factor (Armenian TV program)|Human Factor]]'' ({{lang-hy|[[:hy:Մարդկային գործոն (հեռուստածրագիր)|«Մարդկային գործոն»]]}}) launched a promotion called "One Armenian, One Article" ({{lang-hy|«Մեկ հայ՝ մեկ հոդված»}}). This mass-media campaign was promoted on several Armenian television stations.

The plan aimed to increase both the quantity and quality of Armenian Wikipedia articles. In addition to expanding the Armenian language's presence on Wikipedia, it would raise the level of each article to reflect the rich history of the Armenian people as well as their current, flourishing position in the contemporary world.

The project hoped to organize Wiki-meetings of representatives of [[science]], [[art]] and other subjects with the aim of familiarizing them with the Wiki-culture and helping them in making their own contributions in the development of the Armenian Wikipedia. The campaign would be conducted with training and incentive programs, as well as joint activities with educational and cultural institutions and organizations.

The "One Armenian, One Article" campaign was shown on the ''Human Factor'' TV program that aired on 24 March 2014 on Armenia TV. The campaign was subsequently popularised by many other information agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asekose.am/index.php/news/11/155241-meknarkec-mek-hay--mek-hodvac-hamahaykakan-naxagice.html Մեկնարկեց «Մեկ հայ, մեկ հոդված» համահայկական նախագիծը] {{ref-hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://armenpress.am/eng/news/755155 Armenpress joins "One nation, one article in Wikipedia" initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a [[news conference]] on the "One Armenian, One Article" All-Armenian project on 27 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikimedia.am/wiki/%22%D5%84%D5%A5%D5%AF_%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B5%60_%D5%B4%D5%A5%D5%AF_%D5%B0%D5%B8%D5%A4%D5%BE%D5%A1%D5%AE%22_%D5%B4%D5%A1%D5%B4%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%AC%D5%AB_%D5%A1%D5%BD%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%AC%D5%AB%D5%BD "Մեկ հայ` մեկ հոդված" մամուլի ասուլիս] {{ref-hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[BBC News]] reported that as a result of the campaign, the Armenian Wikipedia appeared to be outnumbering its neighboring countries with its more than 125,000 pages, compared to approximately 102,000 pages on the [[Azerbaijani Wikipedia]] and almost 84,000 pages on the [[Georgian Wikipedia]].

The campaign was supported by the Armenian government as well. Education Minister [[Armen Ashotyan]] publicly stated, "One Armenian, One Article – I will definitely do that and believe you will too." Defense Minister [[Seyran Ohanyan]] said that he created a Wikipedia entry on the Armenian army.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (July 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28588188 “Armenia: Citizens urged to write a Wikipedia entry each”], BBC News, 31 July 2014. Retrieved 31 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enjoli Liston: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/armenia-wikipedia-entry-promote-language-culture Armenians asked to write Wikipedia entries to promote culture], ''The Guardian'', 1 August 2014.

==Overview==
Block programming involves scheduling a series of related shows which are likely to attract and hold a given audience for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="museumtv-programming"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of overt block programming were [[NBC]]'s Thursday evening "[[Must See TV]]" lineup, which included two hours of sitcoms and one hour of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', and [[Channel 4]]'s "T4" program which often ran sitcoms like ''[[Friends]]'' back-to-back for an hour or more. [[Rerun]]s on [[cable television]] are often assembled into similar blocks to fill several hours of generally little-watched daytime periods. A particularly long program block, especially one that does not air on a regular schedule, is known as a [[marathon (television)|marathon]].

Block programming in radio also refers to programming content that appeals to various demographics in time blocks, usually corresponding to the top or bottom of the hour or the quarter-hour periods. For example, various musical genres might be featured, such as a country music hour, a three-hour afternoon block of jazz, or a four-hour Saturday night '70s disco show.

Generally speaking, block programming is anathema to modern competitive commercial radio, which traditionally uses uniform formats, other than a handful of speciality shows in off-peak hours such as weekends (for instance, the infamous [[beaver hour]]s in Canadian radio). The general rationale for not using block programming is that listeners expect a certain type of music when they tune into a radio station and breaking from that format will turn those listeners away from the station; likewise, a station that airs its programming in hodgepodge blocks will have difficulty building listener loyalty, as listeners' music will only be on for a few hours of the day. This argument for homogenized radio was also a driving force behind the effective death of [[freeform (radio format)|freeform radio]] in the late 20th century. The case of [[talk radio]] is indicative of the decline of block programming: prior to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to mix various blocks of talk programming together on one station, but this has declined dramatically in the late 1990s and beyond. A listener to a [[conservative talk radio]] station will have little interest in a [[progressive talk radio]], [[sports radio]] or [[shock jock|hot talk]] block, which reaches a different demographic; stations that have attempted the block strategy have historically been unsuccessful. Block programming of this nature is alive and well on outlets like [[public radio]] (such as [[NPR]], [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], or the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]) and in multicultural radio serving broad ethnic and cultural audiences, although even in this realm the idea of block programming is declining due to competition for donations.

Some programming blocks have become so popular that they have been transformed to full-fledged 24-hour channels. Current channels which started as program blocks include [[TeenNick]] (originally a [[TEENick|program block]] on [[Nickelodeon]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/189298-_Nick_Of_Time_For_Rebrand.php 'Nick’ Of Time For Rebrand - N, Noggin To Adopt Parent Net’s Family Name] ''Multichannel News'' March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disney Junior]] (which is still a program block on the [[Disney Channel]]); [[Nick Jr.]] (which still airs on Nickelodeon); [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] (which was once a program block on [[Cartoon Network]]); and [[PBS Kids]], a 24/7 channel, which [[PBS]] member stations are able to provide in addition to their current children's programming on the primary PBS channel.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2016/02/23/pbs-kids-widens-access-with-247-channel-offerings/ |title=PBS KIDS widens access with 24/7 channel offerings |publisher=Kidscreen |date=2016-02-23 |accessdate=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[TV Land]] airs older shows that were once aired on sister channel Nickelodeon's [[Nick at Nite]] program block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''Entertainment Weekly'', May 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blowback''' is a system of operation for [[Semi-automatic firearm|self-loading]] [[firearm]]s that obtains energy from the motion of the [[cartridge case]] as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gas created by the ignition of the [[propellant charge]].&lt;ref name="Chinn"&gt;{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several blowback systems exist within this broad principle of operation, each distinguished by the methods used to control [[bolt (firearms)|bolt]] movement.  In most actions that use blowback operation, the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delay opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel.&lt;ref&gt;Walter H. B. Smith, ''Rifles'', Military Service Publishing Co., 1948,  "blowback semiautomatic operation" pp.88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.

The blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.&lt;ref name="Chinn"/&gt; Other operating principles for self-loading firearms include [[blow forward]], [[Gas-operated reloading|gas operation]], and [[recoil operation]].

==Principle of operation==
The blowback system is generally defined as an operating system in which energy to operate the firearm's various mechanisms and provide automation is derived from the movement of the spent cartridge case pushed out of the chamber by rapidly expanding powder gases.&lt;ref name="Chinn_11"&gt;{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rearward thrust, imparted against the breech, is a direct result of the expansion of propellant gases.&lt;ref name="Chinn_11"/&gt; Certain guns will use energy from blowback to perform the entire operating cycle (these are typically designs using relatively "low pressure" ammunition) while others will use a portion of the blowback to operate only certain parts of the cycle or simply use the blowback energy to enhance the operational energy from another system of automatic operation.&lt;ref name="Chinn_11"/&gt;

What is common to all blowback systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action.&lt;ref name="Chinn_11"/&gt; The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears in the form of kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation.&lt;ref name="Chinn"/&gt; How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: '''simple blowback''' (often just "blowback"), '''delayed/retarded blowback''', and '''advanced primer ignition.'''

Relating blowback to other types of automatic firearm operation, George M. Chinn wrote that: "In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of gas operation. This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of as a sort of piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of [[gas operation]] or [[recoil operation]] is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one."&lt;ref name="Chinn"/&gt;

==Simple blowback==
[[File:Firearm simple blowback animation.gif|thumb|right|221px|Animation of simple blowback operation.]]
[[File:Hammerless380.jpg|thumb|right|The [[.380 ACP]] [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]] uses simple blowback. The mass of the [[Pistol slide|slide]] is enough to delay opening of the chamber until pressure has dropped.]]

The blowback (sometimes referred to as "simple", "straight" or "pure" blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type.  In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against the rear of the barrel, but is not locked in place.  At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel while at the same time pushing the case rearward against the bolt.  The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring.  The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber.  The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear.  The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon [[Open bolt|fires from an open bolt]]).  A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.

The blowback system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets.  Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts to keep the breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical.  For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel during the first few milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the return spring is limited to {{convert|60|lbf|N}} or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the return spring is not powerful enough to keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in the bolt to cycle the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|pp=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the required bolt weight, blowback designs in pistols are generally limited to calibers smaller than [[9×19mm Parabellum]] (e.g., [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.380 ACP]], [[9×18mm Makarov]], etc.) There are exceptions such as the simple blowback pistols from [[Hi-Point Firearms]] which include models chambered in [[.45 ACP]], [[.40 S&amp;W]], [[.380 ACP]] and [[9×19mm Parabellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |title=Hi-Point Firearms: Handguns |work=Hi-Point Firearms |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165408/http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple blowback operation can also be found in small-bore (such as [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]]) semi-automatic [[rifle]]s, [[carbine]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.  Most simple blowback rifles are chambered for the [[.22 Long Rifle]] cartridge. Popular examples include the [[Marlin Model 60]] and the [[Ruger 10/22]]. Most blowback carbines and submachine guns are chambered for pistol cartridges such as the 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP. Examples include the [[MP 40]], [[Sten]] and [[UZI]].  The bolt can be made bigger and more massive in these weapons than in handguns, as they are intrinsically heavier and designed, ideally at least, to be fired with both hands, often with the aid of a shoulder stock; and these factors help to ameliorate the disruption to the shooter's aim caused by the heavy bolt's movement. Consequently, simple blowback is adequate for somewhat more powerful rounds in submachine guns than in standard pistols. There were also a few rifles that chambered cartridges specifically designed for blowback operation. Examples include the [[Winchester Model 1905]], [[Winchester Model 1907|1907]] and [[Winchester Model 1910|1910]].

Whereas simple blowback is limited to guns using low-power rounds, it is so efficient in this context that in small-calibre [[semi-automatic pistols]] it is by now almost ubiquitous.  Heavier calibre models of handgun (other than [[revolvers]], obviously) characteristically employ a [[Recoil operation|short recoil system]], of which by far the most common type are [[John Browning#Products|Browning]]-derived designs which rely on a locking barrel and [[Pistol slide|slide]] assembly instead of blowback. But blowback guns can be used to fire powerful cartridges if they are of the other two types already mentioned: API or delayed/retarded blowback.

==Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback==
{{stack|[[File:MK108 bolt cycle AB.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part I)]]|[[File:MK108 bolt cycle CD.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part II)]]}}
In the API blowback design, the primer is ignited when the bolt is still moving forward and before the cartridge is fully chambered. This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile weight, propellant charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static [[inertia]] to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first have to do the work of overcoming forward [[momentum]] to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved.&lt;ref name="Chinn_31"&gt;{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.

According to Anthony G. Williams, the "API blowback principle is used virtually in all [[open bolt]] [[sub-machine gun]]s" (technically, although generally these are known as "simple blowback" weapons due to the very late ignition of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although "the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and [[rebated-rim cartridge]]s are not required" for sub-machine guns.&lt;ref name="Williams_65"&gt;Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; In heavier weapons, advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html Williams, Anthony G., ''Of Oerlikons and other things……''] www.quarry.nildram.co.uk article&lt;/ref&gt; for use on the [[20 mm Becker|Becker 20-mm automatic cannon]]. It became a feature of a wide range of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.&lt;ref name="Williams_65"/&gt;

To increase performance of API blowback firearms,&lt;ref name="Chinn_31"/&gt; larger calibre APIB guns such as the Becker and Oerlikon use extended chambers, longer than is necessary to contain the round, and ammunition for APIB firearms come with straight-sided cartridges with [[Rim (firearms)#Rebated rim|rebated rims]] (rims that are smaller in diameter than the cartridge itself).&lt;ref name="Williams_63"&gt;Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 63-68&lt;/ref&gt; The last part of forward motion and the first part of the rearward motion of the case and bolt happen within the confines of this extended chamber. As long as the gas pressure in the barrel is high, the walls of the case remain supported and the breach sealed, although the case is sliding rearwards. This sliding motion of the case, while it is expanded by a high internal gas pressure, risks tearing it apart, and a common solution is to grease the ammunition to reduce the friction. The case needs to have a rebated rim because the front end of the bolt will enter the chamber, and the extractor claw hooked over the rim therefore has to fit also within the diameter of the chamber. The case generally has very little neck, because this remains unsupported during the firing cycle and is generally deformed; a strongly necked case would be likely to split.

The API blowback design permits the use of more powerful ammunition in a lighter gun than would be achieved by using simple blowback, and the reduction of felt recoil results in further weight savings. The original Becker cannon, firing 20×70mmRB ammunition, was developed to be carried by World War I aircraft, and weighed only 30&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Williams_89"&gt;Anthony G. Williams, ''Flying Gun World War I'', Airlife UK 2003, pages 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Oerlikon even produced an anti-tank rifle firing 20×110mmRB ammunition using the API blowback operation, the [[Oerlikon SSG36|SSG36]]. On the other hand, because the design imposes a very close relationship between bolt mass, chamber length, spring strength, ammunition power and rate of fire, in APIB guns high rate of fire and high muzzle velocity tend to be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="Williams_63"/&gt; API blowback guns also have to fire from an open bolt, which is not conducive to accuracy and also prevents [[synchronization gear|synchronized]] fire through an aircraft propeller arc.

According to a [[United States Army Materiel Command]] engineering course from 1970, "The advanced primer ignition gun is superior to the simple blowback because of its higher firing rate and lower recoil momentum. However, favorable performance depends on timing that must be precise. A slight delay in primer function, and the gun reverts to a simple blowback without the benefit of a massive bolt and stiffer driving spring to soften the recoil impact. [...] The exacting requirements in design and construction of gun and ammunition reduce this type almost to the point of academic interest only."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 Automatic Weapons], [[United States Army Materiel Command|AMC]] pamphlet no. 706-260, February 1970, page 2{{hyphen}}47&lt;!-- this not a page range, but a single page number --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

API mechanisms are very sensitive to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their [[MG FF]] (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter [[Minengeschoß]] shell, they had to rebalance the spring strength and bolt weight of the gun, resulting in a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models.&lt;ref name="Williams_166"&gt;Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 65 and 166&lt;/ref&gt; The 30&amp;nbsp;mm [[MK 108 cannon]] was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.

An example of API in sub-machine guns is the L2A3 [[Sterling submachine gun]], where the maximum chamber pressure is achieved while the breechblock is still moving forward and is about 0.46&amp;nbsp;mm away from the rear face of the chamber.&lt;ref name="Cutshaw2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Q. Cutshaw|title=Tactical Small Arms of the 21st Century: A Complete Guide to Small Arms From Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npHP9aV5rBgC&amp;pg=PT27|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=978-1-4402-2482-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is also used in some automatic grenade launchers, for example in the US [[Mk 19 grenade launcher]] or Russian [[AGS-30]].

==Delayed blowback==
For more powerful rounds than can be safely used in simple blowback, or in order to obtain a lighter mechanism than the simple format can provide, the alternative to API is some system of '''delayed''' or '''retarded''' blowback, in which the bolt is never fully locked, but is initially held in place sealing the cartridge in the chamber by the mechanical resistance of one of various designs of delaying mechanism.  As with the resistance provided by momentum in API, it takes a fraction of a second for the propellant gases to overcome this and start moving cartridge and bolt backwards; and this very brief delay is sufficient for the bullet to leave the muzzle and the internal pressure in the barrel to decrease to a safe level.  The bolt and cartridge are then pushed to the rear by the residual gas pressure.   

Because of high pressures, rifle-caliber delayed blowback firearms, such as the [[FAMAS]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3]], typically have fluted chambers to ease extraction. Below are various forms of delayed-blowback actions:

===Roller-delayed===
[[File:Delayed blow back breech with locking rollers (en).svg|thumb|right|Roller-delayed blowback-operated breech for automatic weapons]]
[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|right|A schematic of the roller-delayed blowback mechanism used in the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]]. This system had its origins in the late-war [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototype.]]

Roller-delayed blowback was first used in [[Mauser]]'s Gerät 06H prototype. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from roller-locked [[recoil operation]] as seen in the [[MG 42]] and gas operated roller locked, as seen in the Gerät 06.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Forgotten Weapons|title=Last Ditch Innovation: The Development of the Gerat 06 and Gerat 06H Rifles|date=2012-11-19|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WEPwmYcCPFs|accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil, and unlike the Stg 44, roller-delayed blowback systems lack a gas piston. This lack aids relatively light constructions. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers on the sides of the bolt are driven inward against a tapered bolt carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, R. Blake, ''Full Circle: A Treatise on Roller Locking'', Collector Grade Publications (2006). {{ISBN|0-88935-400-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mausers Wilhelm Stähle and [[Ludwig Vorgrimler]]. Though appearing simple its development during World War II was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by [[Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer]], the director of [[Mauser|Mauser Werke's]] Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce as the bolt opened at an extreme velocity of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;m/s during automatic fire. To counter bolt-bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found to significantly reduce the opening velocity of the bolt. The extremely high bolt carrier velocities problem was not solved by trial and error. Mathematician Dr. Karl Maier provided analysis of the components, assemblies in the development project. In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45° and 27° on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis reducing the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the bolt carrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear bolt carrier was forced to move 3 times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the bolt carrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the bolt carrier. Making the bolt carrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers [[StG 45(M)]] project Maier assumed a 120 g bolt head and 360 g bolt carrier (1 to 3 ratio). The prototype StG 45 (M) assault rifle had 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] wall to assist the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls during extraction. Fluting the end of the chamber provides pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior and thus ensures extraction without tearing the case making extraction easier and more reliable. In 1944 other German companies like Großfuß, Rheinmetall and Haenel showed interest in developing roller-delayed blowback small arms. Großfuß worked on a roller-delayed blowback [[MG 45]] general-purpose machine gun that, like the StG 45 (M), had not progressed beyond the prototype stage by the end of World War II.

After World War II, former Mauser technicians Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor Löffler perfected the mechanism between 1946 and 1950 while working for the French small arms manufacturer [[Atelier Mécanique de Mulhouse|Centre d'Etudes et d'Armament de Mulhouse]] (CEAM). In 1950 Ludwig Vorgrimler was recruited to work for [[CETME]] in Spain. The first full-scale production rifle to utilize roller-delay was the Spanish [[CETME rifle|CETME battle rifle]], which was closely followed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[SIG SG 510]] and the CETME Model B-based [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3]]. The G3 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface.&lt;ref name="woźniak"&gt;Woźniak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej – tom 2 G-Ł. Bellona. 2001. pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The G3's "bolt head locking lever" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. Due to the relative low [[bolt thrust]] exhibited by pistol cartridges the anti-bounce mechanism is omitted by Heckler &amp; Koch on their roller-delayed blowback firearms chambered for pistols cartridges. Heckler &amp; Koch's [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]] is the most common weapon still in service worldwide using this system. The [[Heckler &amp; Koch P9]] semi-automatic pistol, [[CETME Ameli]] light machine gun and [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK21]] general-purpose machine gun also use roller-delayed blowback.

===Lever-delayed===
[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]
Lever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to delay the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. [[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]] patented the first known design for a lever-delay system.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1410270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism was adapted by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] arms designer [[Pál Király]] in the 1930s and used in the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 39M and 43M]] submachine guns for the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]]. After the [[World War II]], Király settled in the [[Dominican Republic]] and developed the [[Cristóbal Carbine]]  (or Király-Cristóbal Carbine). Other weapons to use this system are the [[Hogue Avenger]] and [[Benelli B76]] pistols, the [[FNAB-43]] submachine gun, the [[TKB-517]], [[VAHAN (firearm)|VAHAN]] and [[FAMAS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernfirearms.net/assault/fr/famas-e.html|title=GIAT FAMAS assault rifle (France)|website=Modern Firearms|first=Maxim|last=Popenker}}&lt;/ref&gt; assault rifles, the [[Sterling submachine gun#7.62 NATO variant|Sterling 7.62]] and AVB-7.62 battle rifles/light machine guns, and the [[AA-52 machine gun|AA-52]] machine gun.

===Gas-delayed===
Gas-delayed blowback should not be confused with [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operation]]. The [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding [[propellant]] gases, as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It was used by some World War II German designs for the [[7.92×33mm Kurz]] cartridge, including the [[Volkssturmgewehr]] rifle (with little effectiveness) and the [[Grossfuss Sturmgewehr]] (with slightly more efficiency),&lt;ref name="kalash"&gt;{{citation |first=Юрий |last=Пономарёв |url=http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/44a/020_026.pdf |script-title=ru:история: малоизвестное оружие второй мировой войны: Автомат Хорна |trans-title=History: a little-known weapon of World War II: Horn Assault Rifle |language=Russian |journal=КАЛАШНИКОВ.

===Chamber-ring delayed===
When a cartridge is fired, the case expands to seal the sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp. model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other firearms that used this system were the LWS [[Seecamp]] pistol, the AMT Automag II, and the Kimball .30 Carbine pistol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[SIG SG 510]] rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder which is used to avoid bolt-bounce rather than a delay element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hesitation locked===
[[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]]'s patented system incorporates a breech block independent of the slide or bolt carrier. When in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder located in the frame of the firearm. When the cartridge is fired, the cartridge case, bolt and slide move together a short distance until the breech block strikes the locking shoulder and stops. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase while the breech remains locked. This allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels once the bullet departs the barrel. The continuing motion of the slide lifts the breech block from its recess and pulls it rearward, continuing the firing cycle. The Pedersen [[Remington Model 51]] pistol, [[SIG MKMO]] submachine gun and [[Remington R51|R51]] pistol are the only production firearms to have used this design.

===Toggle-delayed===

In toggle-delayed blowback firearms, the rearward motion of the breechblock must overcome significant mechanical leverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbinesforcollectors.com/pedersen.html Cliff Carlisle, ''Japanese Pedersen Semi Auto Rifles &amp; Carbines''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819195244/http://www.carbinesforcollectors.com/pedersen.html |date=2007-08-19 }}, www.carbinesforcollectors.com article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corporation2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=How It Works: Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYCNNYgNAAYC&amp;pg=PA194|year=2003|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7314-5|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 Automatic Weapons], [[United States Army Materiel Command|AMC]] pamphlet no. 706-260, February 1970, page 2{{hyphen}}40&lt;!-- this not a page range; but a single page number --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bolt is hinged in the middle, stationary at the rear end and nearly straight at rest. As the breech moves back under blowback power, the hinge joint moves upward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findpatent.ru/patent/252/2529303.html Система запирания канала оружейных стволов Patent RU2529303]&lt;/ref&gt; The leverage disadvantage keeps the breech from opening until the bullet has left the barrel and pressures have dropped to a safe level. This mechanism was used on the [[Pedersen rifle]] and [[Schwarzlose machine gun|Schwarzlose MG M.07/12]] machine gun.&lt;ref name="Corporation2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Julian, ''Hatcher's Notebook'', The Military Service Press Company (1947), pp. 38-44. {{ISBN|0-8117-0795-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off-axis bolt travel===
[[John Browning]] developed this simple method whereby the axis of bolt movement was not in line with that of the bore.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1457961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that a small rearward movement of the bolt in relation to the [[bore-axis]] required a greater movement along the axis of bolt movement, essentially magnifying the resistance of the bolt without increasing its mass. The French [[MAS-38]] submachine gun of 1938 utilizes a bolt whose path of recoil is at an angle to the barrel. The [[Jatimatic]] and [[KRISS Vector]] use modified versions of this concept.

===Radial-delayed===
CMMG introduced the [[CMMG Mk 45 Guard|Mk 45 Guard rifle]] incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses the [[Rotating bolt|rotation]] of the bolt head to accelerate the bolt carrier of an [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]] pattern rifle. The bolt locking lugs are adapted to incorporate angles that rotate the bolt as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the bolt rotates, it must accelerate the bolt carrier to the rear through an adapted cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the bolt carrier, slowing the speed of the bolt head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180142972A1/ Radial delayed blowback operating system, such as for ar 15 platform US20180142972A1]&lt;/ref&gt; This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier bolt carrier assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2017/4/25/cmmg-introduces-mkg45-guard-pistol-caliber-carbine/ CMMG Mk45]&lt;/ref&gt; The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the bolt carrier moving at a faster rate than the bolt head to delay the action from opening.

===Screw-delayed===
First used on the Mannlicher Model 1893 rifle, the bolt in screw-delayed blowback was delayed by angled interrupted threads delayed by a quarter twist to unlock.&lt;ref&gt;Repetier- und Automatische Handfeuer Waffen, Der systeme Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher&lt;/ref&gt; [[John T. Thompson]] designed an [[Thompson Autorifle|autorifle]] that operated on a similar principle around 1920 and submitted it for trials with the US Army. This rifle, submitted multiple times, competed unsuccessfully against the [[John Pedersen (arms designer)|Pedersen]] rifle and [[John Garand|Garand]] primer-actuated rifle in early testing to replace the [[M1903 Springfield]] rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hatcher |first=Julian |date=1983 |title=Book of the Garand |publisher=Gun Room Pr. |isbn=0-88227-014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation is one of the most simple forms of delayed blowback but unless the ammunition is lubricated or uses a fluted chamber, the recoil can be volatile especially when using full length rifle rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance, The Thompson Autorifle Caliber .30 by H. E. Hartney, 1921, P150&lt;/ref&gt; Rotation of the bolt should be at least 90° to prevent ruptured cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance, Volume 3-4, American Defense Preparedness Association 1922. THE PROBLEM OF AN INFANTRY RIFLE. Page 153&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of this operation was developed by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] who later developed a prototype submachine gun in 1942 that operated by a screw-delayed blowback principle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Солдат удачи |volume=9 |issue=72 |date=2000 |first=Д. |last=Ширяев |title=Кто изобрел автомат Калашникова |language=ru |trans-title=Who invented the Kalashnikov?}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also found on the [[Demro TAC-1|Fox Wasp carbine]]. A pair of telescoping screws delayed rearward movement of the operating parts during the firing cycle. This weapon was ultimately not selected for production.

==Other blowback systems==
===Floating chamber===
[[David Marshall Williams]] (a noted designer for the U.S. Ordnance Office and later [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]]) developed a mechanism to allow firearms designed for full-sized cartridges to fire .22 caliber rimfire ammunition reliably. His system used a small 'piston' that incorporates the chamber.  When the cartridge is fired, the front of the floating chamber is thrust back by gas pressure impinging on the front of the chamber as in a traditional piston.  This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone.  Often described as '''accelerated blowback''', this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the .22 rimfire cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_50/ai_112646118 Charles E. Petty, ''Delightful diversion'', Guns Magazine, March, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams designed a training version of the [[John Moses Browning|Browning]] machine gun and the [[Colt Service Ace]] .22 long rifle version of the [[M1911]] using his system. The floating chamber is both a blowback and [[Gas-operated reloading#Floating chamber|gas operated]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blue Book of Gun Values, 13th Ed. |author=S. P. Fjestad |year=1991 |page=291 |isbn=0-9625943-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primer actuated===
Primer actuated firearms use the energy of [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] setback to unlock and cycle the firearm. [[John Garand]] developed the system in an unsuccessful bid to replace the M1903 bolt-action rifle in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Hatcher1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian S. Hatcher|title=Hatcher's Notebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yESNUKSg5aMC&amp;pg=PA63|year=1962|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-0795-4|pages=63–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garand's prototypes worked well with US military .30-06 ammunition and uncrimped primers, but then the military changed from a fast burning gunpowder to a progressive burning Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powder.  The slower pressure rise made the primer actuated prototypes unreliable, so Garand abandoned the design for a gas operated rifle that became the [[M1 Garand]].&lt;ref name="Hatcher1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Experimental semi-automatic rifles by John Garand, 1919-1936 |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/spar/historyculture/experimental-rifles-by-john-garand-1919-36.htm |quote=the primer actuated device was doomed to failure as the .30 caliber cartridge did not lend itself to this type of operation |accessdate=2014-12-28}}&lt;!-- ref does not state why the cartridge did not lend itself to primer actuation.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; AAI Corporation used a primer piston in a rifle submitted for the SPIW competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cruffler.com/trivia-May00.html ''Flirting With Flechettes: The US Army's Search for the Ideal Rifle Projectile''] Cruffler.com May 2000 article&lt;/ref&gt; Other rifles to use this system were the [[Project Abakan|Postnikov APT]] and Clarke carbine as described in {{US Patent|2401616}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forgottenweapons.com/light-rifle-program/clarke-carbine/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system is used in the spotting rifles on the [[LAW 80]] and [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon]] use a 9mm, [[.308 Winchester]] based cartridge with a [[.22 Hornet]] [[blank cartridge]] in place of the primer.  Upon firing, the Hornet case sets back a short distance, unlocking the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=9 x 51mm SMAW - International Ammunition Association |url=http://cartridgecollectors.org/cmo/cmo05oct.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case setback===
The case cartridge itself has been used experimentally to actuate the action similar to Garand's primer-actuation. Known prototypes using this method of operation include two 1936 rifle designs, one by Mihail Mamontov and another by Makar Goryainov at [[TsKB-14]], and a 1980s design by A.F. Barishev. The Mamontov and Goryainov rifles are only partially automatic; only the bolt unlocking is powered by the gases pushing the cartridge back, while the rest of the cycle (ejection, reloading) is done manually as in a traditional bolt-action rifle. A major problem with using the case cartridge as piston is that its motion is much faster (about 1 ms) compared to tapping gas further down the bore through a piston—about 5 ms in the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], which used the same cartridge as Mamontov's rifle. Barishev made a fully automatic, but rather bulky mechanism that used a mechanical delay. In his system, the case cartridge pushed back a tilting bolt face, that upon reaching a certain angle pushes backwards an unlocking lever that continues farther before unlocking the bolt. The [[GRAU]] however still gave a negative evaluation of Barishev's gun, pointing out that the main problems with reliability of firearms using the cartridge case as a piston were known since the 1930s and still unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;Р.

==Limited-utility designs==
===Blish lock===
{{main article|Blish lock}}
The Blish Lock is a breech locking mechanism designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement with a force greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is called static friction, or ''[[stiction]]''. His locking mechanism was used in the [[Thompson submachine gun]], [[Thompson Autorifle|Autorifle]] and [[Thompson Light Rifle|Autocarbine]] designs. This dubious principle was later eliminated as redundant in the M1 and M1A1 versions of the submachine guns at the insistence of the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Submachine Guns Of World War II. Chris McNab, Osprey Publishing,2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubrication or fouling would completely defeat any delay. Whatever actual advantage a clean, unlubricated Blish system could impart could also be attained by adding a mere ounce of mass to the bolt.&lt;ref&gt;Army Ordnance, December 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savage rotating barrel===
The Savage system employed the theory that the rifling in the barrel caused a rotational force that would hold the gun locked until the projectile left the barrel.  It was later discovered that the bullet had left the barrel long before any locking could occur. Savage pistols were in fact operating as simple blow back firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hatcher |first=Julian |title=Hatchers Notebook |publisher=The Military Service Press Company |year=1947 |pages=259–261 |isbn=0-8117-0795-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French [[MAB PA-15 pistol|MAB PA-15]] and PA-8 9mm pistols feature a similar design.

==Other autoloading systems==
Other autoloading systems are:
* [[Blow forward]] where the barrel is the only moving component of the weapon that is dragged forward by the friction of the bullet until it leaves the barrel.
* [[Recoil operation]] uses the rearward movement of parts of the weapon counter to the ejecta (bullet and propellant) moving forward, as described by [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]].
* [[Gas-operated reloading]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">'''Cultural pessimism''' arises with the conviction that the culture of a nation, a civilization, or humanity itself is in a process of irreversible decline.  It is a variety of [[pessimism]] formulated by a [[cultural critic]].

==Contemporary proponents==

Towards the end of the 20th century, cultural pessimism surfaced in a prominent way. The very title of [[Jacques Barzun]]'s ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present'' (2000) challenges the reader to be hopeful. On [[Matthew Arnold]], a major cultural critic of the Victorian era, Barzun writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;''According to Arnold, the behaviour of the English social classes was touched neither by spiritual nor by intellectual forces; the upper orders were barbarians, the middle classes philistines.'' (op. cit. p.573)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The end of the millennium saw in the United States concerns rather specific to the conservative view on the [[culture war]]s and [[university education]].{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}

Western Europe, on the other hand, struggled towards self-definition in the face of limiting [[demography]], and [[postmodernism]] as at least journalistically predominant—the difference primarily lying in the political prominence of the issues.

==Traditional versions==

It has been significant presence in the general outlook of many historical cultures: things are "going to the dogs", the [[Golden age]] is in the past, and the current generation is fit only for [[dumbing down]] and cultural careerism. Some significant formulations have gone beyond this, proposing a universally-applicable [[cyclic history|cyclic model of history]]—notably in the writings of [[Giambattista Vico]].

==Nineteenth century==

The pessimistic element was available in [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy and Matthew Arnold's cultural criticism. The tide of [[Whiggish optimism]] (exemplified by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]]) receded somewhat in the middle of the reign of Queen Victoria.

Classical culture, based on traditional classical scholarship in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] literature, had itself been under attack externally for two generations or more by 1900, and had produced in [[Nietzsche]], a model pessimistic thinker.

==Early twentieth century==

Cultural pessimism of the [[Oswald Spengler]] epoch might be seen as a refusal, of the rather intellectual and secular choice between [[nihilism]] and [[modernism]]. Politically this tended to squeeze [[Liberalism|liberal]] thought.

Specific criticism of the West, in the first years of the twentieth century, is usually taken as of the Old World of [[Europe]], excluding therefore North America in particular. The classic source for this is Spengler's ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918–1923), often cited in the years following its publication. The tone of much of the critical writing, for example, of [[T. S. Eliot]], and the historical writing of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] from the 1920s onwards, is identifiable. It was fashionable to say that Spengler had at least formulated some truths about the cultural situation of Europe after [[World War I]]. Eliot's major early work ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) was commonly and directly interpreted in those terms.

An '''earnest payment'''  is a specific form of [[security deposit]] made in some major transactions such as [[real estate]] dealings or required by some official [[procurement]] processes  to demonstrate that the applicant is serious and willing to demonstrate [[good faith (law)|an earnest of good faith]] about wanting to complete the transaction.

In ancient times, the earnest payment was called variously an '''earnest penny,  Arles penny,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finedictionary.com/Arles%20penny.html|title=Arles penny|publisher=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''' or '''God's silver''' (in [[Latin]]  '''Argentum Dei'''). It was either money or a valuable [[coin]] or [[Exonumia|token]] given to bind a [[Financial transaction|bargain]], notably for the purchase or hiring of a servant. According to Black's Law Dictionary (sixth ed.), ''Et cepit de praedicto Henrico tres denarios de Argento Dei prae manibus'' ("And he took it from the aforesaid Henry [sealed by a] [[Threepence (British coin)#Early threepences|silver three pence [piece] ]] handed over [in the sight of] God").

A potential buyer of property of high value such as residential real estate  generally signs a contract and pays a sum acceptable to the seller by way of earnest money.  The amount varies enormously, depending upon local custom and the state of the local market at the time of contract negotiations.

In very competitive markets 'the earnest'  may represent a substantial portion of the completion cost. In the USA, between about 2000 and 2005 real estate purchase earnest money deposits reached  about  5% of the sales price.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  In other situations, a significant token payment (equivalent to around one week or one month's salary)  may be acceptable. (In the USA during 2008 typically $500 or $1000 was acceptable){{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

If the seller accepts the offer, the earnest money is held  in [[Trust (law)|trust]] or [[escrow]].

These funds may be held directly by the [[real estate broker]] (as in the State of New York) or by a [[settlement (closing)|settlement]] or [[title company]] (as in states like California, Florida, and Texas).

When the transaction is settled then the deposit is applied to the buyer's portion of the remaining costs. If the offer is rejected, the earnest money is usually returned, since no binding contract has been entered into. Laws vary as to what happens with the deposit should the buyer fail to perform on the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homebuying.about.com/od/buyingahome/qt/EarnestMoney.htm |title=Earnest Money Deposits |publisher=Homebuying.about.com |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legaldictionary.net/earnest-money/|title=Earnest Money Definition, Examples, Cases, Processes|date=2015-02-07|website=Legal Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andean Languages.png|350px|thumb|Pre-Inca languages in the 16th century.]]
The [[Marañón River]] basin, at a low point in the [[Andes]] which made it an attractive location for trade between the [[Inca Empire]] and the [[Amazon basin]], once harbored numerous [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|languages]] which have been poorly attested or not attested at all. Those of the middle reaches of the river, above the Amazon basin, were replaced in historical times by [[Aguaruna language|Aguaruna]], a [[Jivaroan language]] from the Amazon which is still spoken there. The languages further upriver are difficult to identify, due to lack of data. The region was multilingual at the time of the Conquest, and the people largely switched to Spanish rather than to Quechua, though Quechua also expanded during Colonial times.

In [[Ecuador]], at the province of [[Loja Province|Loja]], were [[Palta language|Palta]], [[Malacato language|Malacato]], [[Rabona language|Rabona]], [[Bolona language|Bolona]], and [[Xiroa language|Xiroa]]. Historical sources suggest these were closely related, and there is some evidence that Palta (see) was a [[Jivaroan language]]. The name ''Xiroa'' may be a variant of ''Jivaro''. Rabona is attested by a few words, some of which seem to be Jivaroan, but others of which appear to be [[Candoshi language|Candoshí]]; since these are plant names, they say little about the classification of the language, and Adelaar (2004:397) leaves it unclassified. Bolona is essentially unattested.

North of the basin were [[Puruhá language|Puruhá]] (scarcely attested), [[Cañari language|Cañar]] (known primarily from characteristic place names), [[Panzaleo language|Panzaleo]] (sometimes classified as [[Paezan languages|Paezan]]), [[Caranqui language|Caranqui]] (until the 18th century, seemingly Barbacoan), and [[Pasto language|Pasto]] (Barbacoan). Apart possibly from Panzaleo, these languages have elements in common, such as a final syllable ''-pud'' and onsets ''mwe-, pwe-, bwe-''. Those suggest that they may have been related, and possibly were all Barbacoan. Adelaar (2004:397) finds this more likely than a proposal that Puruhá and Cañar were [[Chimuan languages]] (see).

In [[Peru]], and further up in the Andes there were also numerous languages. Apart from [[Mochica language|Mochica]] and [[Cholón language|Cholón]], the languages of northern Peru are largely unrecorded; the attested Marañón languages are Patagón (''Patagón de Perico''), Bagua (''Patagón de Bagua''), Chacha (Chachapoya), Copallén, Tabancale, Chirino, and Sácata (Chillao).

==Patagón==
{{Infobox language
|name=Patagón
|nativename=Patagón de Perico
|states=[[Peru]]
|region=[[Marañón River]] basin
|extinct=?
|familycolor=American
|fam1=[[Cariban languages|Cariban]]
|fam2=?
|iso3=none
|glotto=pata1255
|glottorefname=Patagon
}}

Patagón (''Patagón de Perico'', not to be confused with the [[Chonan languages]] of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and [[Patagonia]]): Four words are recorded, ''tuná'' 'water', ''anás'' 'maize', ''viue'' 'firewood', ''coará'' 'sheep' (evidently the word for '[[sloth]]'). These suggest that Patagón was one of the [[Cariban languages]], and therefore, like Aguaruna, from the Amazon (Adelaar 2004:405–406).

==Bagua==
Bagua (''Patagón de Bagua'') is attested by three words, ''tuna'' 'water', ''lancho'' 'maize', ''nacxé'' 'come here'. ''Tuna'' 'water' suggests it may be a Cariban language, like Patagón de Perico, but is insufficient evidence for classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|bagu1249|Bagua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chacha==
''Chacha'' is the name sometimes given to the language of the [[Chachapoya culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|chac1253|Chacha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chachapoya, originally from the region of [[Kuelap]] to the east of the Marañón, were conquered by the Inca shortly before the Spanish conquest, and many were deported after the Inca Civil War. They sided with the Spanish and achieved independence for a time, but were then deported again by the Spanish, where most died of introduced disease. Their language is essentially unattested apart from toponyms and several hundred family names. Family names are mostly short and have been distorted through adaptation to Quechua; the only one which can be identified is ''Oc'' or ''Occ'' {{IPA|[ox]}}, which according to oral history means 'puma' or 'bear' (Adelaar  2004:407).

Chachapoya toponyms ending in ''-gach(e), -gat(e), -gote'' are found near water. Between the town of [[Cajamarca]] and the Marañón river is a similar typonymic element, attested variously as ''-cat(e), -cot(e), -gat(e), -got(e)'', with ''-cat'' found further across a wider area of northern Peru. This may be the [[Cholón language|Cholón]] word for water; the place name ''Salcot'' or ''Zalcot'' is found three times in Cajamarca, as well as being the name of a Cholón village meaning 'black water'.

==Copallén==
Four words are attested from Capallén ([[Copallín]]): ''quiet'' {{IPA|[kjet]}} 'water', ''chumac'' 'maize', ''olaman'' 'firewood', ''ismare'' 'house'. The word for water resembles the typonymic element ''-cat''. However, this is insufficient to identify Copallén as a Cholón language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|copa1238|Copallen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tabancale==
{{Infobox language
|name=Tabancale
|nativename=Aconipa
|states=[[Peru]]
|region=[[Marañón River]] basin
|extinct=?
|familycolor=American
|family=unclassified
|iso3=none
|glotto2=taba1269
|glottorefname2=Tabancale
}}

Five words are recorded: ''yema'' 'water', ''moa'' 'maize', ''oyme'' 'firewood', ''lalaque'' {{IPA|[lalake]}} 'fire', ''tie'' 'house'. These do not correspond to any known language or family, so Tabancale (Tabancal) is unclassified and potentially a [[language isolate]].

==Chirino==
{{Infobox language
|name=Chirino
|nativename=
|states=[[Peru]]
|region=[[Marañón River]] basin
|extinct=?
|familycolor=American
|fam1=[[Candoshi language|Candoshi]]
|iso3=none
|glotto=none
}}

The [[Chirino people|Chirino]] were one of the principal peoples of the area. Based on the four words which were recorded, ''yungo'' 'water', ''yugato'' 'maize', ''xumás'' 'firewood', ''paxquiro'' {{IPA|[paʃˈkiɾo]}} 'grass', their language would appear to be related to [[Candoshi language|Candoshi]] (Torero 1993, Adelaar 2004:406).

==Sácata==
Three words of the language of Sácata (Zácata), apparently that of the [[Chillao people]], are recorded: ''unga'' 'water', ''umague'' {{IPA|[umaɡe]}} 'maize', ''chichache'' 'fire'. Connections have been suggested with [[Candoshi language|Candoshí]] (the word for water is similar to that of Chinino) and [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]], but the evidence is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|saca1239|Sacata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SectorCombo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diagram of a fused grid district showing four neighbourhoods and a mixed use zone]]
The '''fused grid''' is a [[street network]] pattern first proposed in 2002 and subsequently applied in [[Calgary, Alberta]] (2006) and [[Stratford, Ontario]] (2004). It represents a synthesis of two well known and extensively used network concepts: the "[[grid plan|grid]]" and the "[[Radburn design housing|Radburn]]" pattern, derivatives of which are found in most city suburbs. Both concepts were self-conscious attempts to organize urban space for habitation. The grid was conceived and applied in the pre-automotive era of cities starting circa 2000 BC and prevailed until about 1900 AD. The Radburn pattern emerged in 1929 about thirty years following the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]] powered automobile and in anticipation of its eventual dominance as a means for mobility and transport. Both these patterns appear throughout North America. "Fused" refers to a systematic recombination of the essential characteristics of each of these two network patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Fanis Grammenos and Gordon Lovegrove, 2015.

Hippodamus Rides to Radburn- A new Model For the 21 century, Journal of Urban Design, Vol. 13. No. 2, 163–176, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and history==
[[File:Radburn Cellular Street Pattern.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A diagram showing the street network structure of Radburn and its nested hierarchy. (The shaded area was not built)]]
Modern urban planners generally classify street networks as either organic or planned. Planned networks tend to be organized according to geometric patterns, while the organic networks are believed to emerge from spontaneous, unorganized growth.

Architectural historian [[Spiro Kostof]] writes that "The word 'grid' is a convenient, and imprecise, substitute for 'orthogonal planning'. 'Gridiron' in the US implies a pattern of long narrow blocks, and 'checkerboard' a pattern of square blocks."&lt;ref&gt;Spiro Kostof, 1991: ''The City Shaped'', Thames and Hudson Ltd., London&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the right angle being a key characteristic, a second attribute of equal importance is its imputed openness and unconstrained expandability. Loosely interpreted, the term "grid" can be applied to plans such as the Vitruvian octagonal plan for an ideal city, resembling a spider web, or to plans composed of concentric circles. These are all grids in that a regularly spaced armature leaves recurring openings and that they could, conceivably, expand outward.

The emergence of the pure, rectilinear, orthogonal grid, or Hippodamian grid, is explained by the natural tendency of people to walk in a straight line, particularly in the absence of obstacles and on level land.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro Kostof. 1991. The City Shaped. Thames and Hudson Ltd. London, Ch X&lt;/ref&gt; This intuitive explanation leaves the question of pre-grid and post grid non-rectilinear city patterns to be better understood, particularly those on plane territory such as Marrakech. Another potential influence may have been exerted by the second frequent user of city streets – horses. Horses also tend to move in a straight line, particularly at trotting, canter or galloping pace. When horses serve a city and draw chariots singly or in pairs, or, similarly, carts for a variety of transportation and processional functions, straight line travel becomes imperative; turns force a sluggish pace and cumbersome manoeuvres that reduce their efficiency of movement. The need for speed is accentuated by city size; distances to the public functions at the centre increase and, consequently, the need for quick access is intensified. Speed in turn implies straight lines. It is plausible that the drivers for rectilinear layouts may have been man's horses, mules, and carts as much as man himself, spurred by the growth of settlements.
The creation of the Radburn pattern is attributed to [[Clarence Stein]] but has a lineage of ideas that preceded it in [[Raymond Unwin]] and Barry Parker's work that included the use of [[cul-de-sac]] and [[Crescent (architecture)|crescent]] street types. In contrast to the scarcity of records that obscures the original rationale for the grid, the reasons for the Radburn pattern have been articulated clearly in Stein's writings and those of his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, C. (1957). Towards new towns for America. Cambridge, MA:MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Unwin, Town Planning in Practice (London: Fisher Unwin, 1909) 393&lt;/ref&gt;
 
"Radburn" (after a place in [[New Jersey]]) now denotes a street network configuration. It signifies a departure from the strict orthogonal geometry and regularity of the grid and a distinct approach to laying out new districts. As a system, it can be described more accurately as a "cellular" network that has a characteristic [[hierarchy of streets]] as distinct from identical streets intersecting at regular intervals. Its derivatives and idiosyncratic imitations are often characterized as "cul-de-sac and loop" patterns highlighting the distinguishing street types that are used systematically in this network. A second term equally uncharacteristic is "suburban". This association of a pattern with a location is inaccurate and unintentionally misleading: entire early cities such as Cairo and Fez are structured on this pattern whose newer suburbs follow the grid reversing the urban/suburban relationship. "Suburban" is also devoid of geometric descriptors of the pattern. These shorthand expressions conceal the variety of patterns that emerged in the 20th century that are decidedly neither grids nor "Radburn"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Southworth and Peter Owens, 1993: The evolving Metropolis: Studies of Community, Neighbourhood, and Street From at the Urban Edge, JAPA 59,3:271-288&lt;/ref&gt; and the "system" aspect of the pattern. The "loop and lollipop" label may be a more applicable descriptor of later interpretations of the Radburn model that appear to lack structure and to overlook key elements of the original concept such as its emphasis on pedestrian priority, for example. The pattern's systematic use of the cul-de-sac and loop is decidedly linked to automotive mobility as a means of controlling and guiding its flow. The Radburn pattern is a complex system; more than a series of identical orthogonal city blocks in a linear progression. It rests on a functional program plus an intentional picturesque aesthetic: it avoids straight lines, limits four-way intersections and shuns repetitive blocks all of which enhance its picturesque imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Howe, The Garden Cities of England, Scribner's Magazine, July 1912&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate the discussion, the name "Radburn-like" or "Radburn-type" will be used in the subsequent sections.

==Criticisms of the prevailing network patterns==
[[File:Grid Pattern on Piraeus Hill.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of several streets of the grid that was applied to the hilly site of Piraeus.]]
[[File:Street Wall Early Cities.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A street in the Medina of Marrakech, showing the "wall" effect of agglutinated buildings and the absence of lower floor windows.]]
The two dominant network patterns, the grid and Radburn, have been debated by planners, transportation engineers and social observers on grounds that include issues of defence, aesthetics, adaptability, sociability, mobility, health, safety, security and environmental impact.

===Defence, aesthetics, and adaptability===
The first known criticism of the grid was put forward on the grounds of defence that became irrelevant following the prevalence of the [[cannon]] (1500s). Aristotle argued that the old maze-like street pattern which preceded the grid, made it difficult for invading troops to find their way in and out of the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/CityPlan.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825042419/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/CityPlan.htm |archive-date=2011-08-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also expressed the same view 1500 years later and added the advantage of a superior visual effect of the organic pattern over the grid.&lt;ref&gt;Southworth, M. &amp; Ben-Joseph, E. (2003) Streets and the Shaping of Towns and Cities (Washington DC: Island Press) p23&lt;/ref&gt;
A second criticism was put forward most forcefully by [[Camillo Sitte]] on aesthetic grounds. He argued that grids lack variety and, consequently, are uninteresting and can become oppressive by their monotony.&lt;ref&gt;Camillo Sitte, City Planning According to Artistic Principles, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been undermined first by the potential variety of grid dimensions that can be used in combinations such as appear in many city plans. More importantly, ground observation of cities shows that the mix of buildings and their varied street alignments as well as open spaces with their size variations coupled with constant redevelopment, suppress the monotony of the grid. Nonetheless, 20th century planners shunned pure grids and implicitly endorsed C. Sitte's ideas on the need for a picturesque streetscape. This tendency is generally based on an intuitive aesthetic ground; that people dislike long open street vistas and prefer those that terminate.&lt;ref&gt;Duany, A. and E. Plater-Zyberk. "The Second Coming of the American Small Town", Wilson Quarterly, 16:1, 1992, 19-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent subdivision or town layouts such as [[Poundbury]](1993), Seaside(1984) and Kentlands(1995) consciously avoided the homogenous grid and its open vistas. 
A further criticism of the grid focuses on its unsuitability for uneven, variegated terrain. Its application in sites such as [[Priene]] (350 BC), [[Piraeus]] (circa 400 BC), San Francisco (1776), Saint John, NB (1631) and others severely limits general accessibility by inadvertently introducing steep slopes or, in certain cases, stepped road sections and creates construction difficulties. In cities with intemperate climates this limitation is accentuated. Moving in a straight line uphill becomes arduous or, occasionally, impossible, particularly for non-motorized wheeled means of transport.
A Radburn-type network inherently includes a variety of city blocks and terminating vistas and, consequently, pre-empts criticism centered on monotony and lack of end-closure. Its unconstrained geometry adapts easily to topographical irregularities and geographical features such as streams, woodlots and natural ponds. As neither the alignment nor the length of neighbourhood streets need to remain constant, this model gives planners considerable latitude in laying out a network.

Two newer aesthetic criticisms of the Radburn model emerged in the 1980s: the absence of a street "wall" or "enclosure" and the repetitiveness of housing unit forms as found in suburban districts. Both these criticisms can be understood as a misapplication of aesthetic norms on socio-economic outcomes. {{dubious|date=November 2011}} The spaciousness of housing developments at the city's edge echoes the spaciousness of contemporary houses and are both driven not by aesthetic intent but by economic prosperity. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Judging the visual outcome of prosperity using historic streetscape criteria of cities with a different socioeconomic makeup would make the verdict predictable and practically meaningless.
Moreover, the "street wall" and "enclosure" criticism of the Radburn pattern applications are undermined by observation of city districts new and old. Close examination would reveal that these spatial qualities are inextricably linked to housing unit and population density as well as construction technology and are not necessarily the outcome of a street pattern: The higher the habitation density of the street (and town) the closer and taller the buildings have to be to accommodate more people. A street pattern does not induce either unit density or the visual wall effect. For example, in earlier cities with labyrinthine street layouts, analogous to some contemporary suburban districts, residential buildings were agglutinated creating an entire perimeter wall around the city block with few perforations for reasons of security, safety and a heightened sense of privacy, not streetscape aesthetic. Conversely, early founded cities in North America, where land was almost free but construction costly, are depicted with generous lot dimensions and very small houses on them (e.g. [[Salt Lake City]]) that created a weak "enclosure" vertically and horizontally. At both ends of the streetscape scale, very proximate and very sparse buildings, socio-economic factors drive the outcome.
[[File:Platslc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Surveyor's plan of Salt Lake City, circa 1870s - an example of a uniform square grid]]
[[File:Grid Street-Low Density.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A straight street of a grid pattern in a 1950s suburb exhibiting low density, single family detached housing]]
Regarding repetitiveness of housing form, ground observation shows no relation to street pattern. Homogeneity correlates better with methods of production. Early agglutinated housing forms as in Pompeii and Tunis, with vastly different street patterns, presented no face on the street by which design differences could be discerned; plain and luxurious houses had the same nondescript, blank street face. In recent times, older streets of more recent cities with a grid show considerable replication, based on vernacular and pattern books, as do newer streets on the fringe, based on industrialization. What has impacted the urban landscape appreciably is the scale of production: many single operators in earlier periods with small yearly output versus few large corporations by mid-20th century with high annual production volumes. Inevitably, the larger the operation is, the greater the economies of repetition are. Similar house models can be found not only in the same subdivision but across states and even nations. For example, veterans housing that was built in Canada consists of two or three models that were repeated in neighbourhoods and across the country. The most impressive effect of large-scale production is starkly visible in [[Levittown, New York]] (1947) and in social housing projects, where the State also aims at economies of scale. In the case of early Huguenot settlements, sameness of houses on identical grid patterns was pursued as a means of expressing the social equality of all inhabitants – a community goal.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, S. (1991). The city shaped: Urban patterns and meanings through history. New York: Bulfinch Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing unit density===
Derivatives and variations of the Radburn street network pattern, collectively "the suburbs", have been criticized on the grounds of their relative low density. The low density criticism appears to be based on a historical coincidence mistaken for [[causality]]: most low density housing developments occurred in the 20th century at the periphery of existing cities after 1950 and intentionally incorporated cul-de-sac or looped streets (Radburn-inspired street types) regularly. By contrast, dense development occurred earlier (and continues) in city central areas most of which were laid on a grid pattern in the 19th century or earlier. This topological coincidence of pattern and density can be easily mistaken as a causal relationship. Radburn (1929), a suburb, was built at a density (19 persons per acre) higher than subsequent suburbs such as Kentlands (14 persons per acre) that were laid out on a grid-type pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, C-M., &amp; Ahn, K-H. (2003). "Is Kentlands better than Radburn? The American garden city and new urbanist paradigms." ''Journal of the American Planning Association'', 69 (1), 50–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many early grid-plan towns and suburbs such as [[Windermere, Florida]], [[Dauphin, Manitoba]], and [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick]] exhibit grid layouts and very low densities. Conversely, incidental cul-de-sac and crescent streets in central areas show high densities. Examples of unusual, unconventional associations of density and street type demonstrate that street patterns are coincidentally, not causally, related to housing density. Any given street pattern can be built at a predetermined density.

===Security===
Questions have been raised about the potential effect that the street patterns of a neighbourhood may play a role in the frequency that its homes are targets of theft and property damage. These questions were prompted by the apparent higher concentration of such events in certain neighbourhoods over the general average. This potential connection has been debated extensively. Factors such as sample size, analytical methods and the inclusion or omission of socio-demographic profiles of offenders, victims and neighbourhoods can confound the research outcomes. Yet some tentative correlations have been discerned.

Experiments are rarely possible in existing neighbourhoods where the street pattern, the properties and the residents are given and inalterable. One such rare experiment, however, was tried in Five Oaks, Dayton, Ohio. A "troubled" neighbourhood's street pattern was converted from the regular grid to an interrupted grid resembling the Radburn pattern. The transformed layout was made discontinuous for cars but continuous for pedestrians through the use of connected cul-de-sacs. Following the change, the drop in antisocial incidents was substantial and immediate suggesting that the Radburn-like pattern contributed to it since all other factors remained practically unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Newman, Creating Defensible Space,1990&lt;/ref&gt; Observational studies rest on cross-sectional statistical analysis of neighbourhoods to derive potential correlations between street patterns and the level of antisocial incidents. One such study &lt;ref&gt;An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once? Bill Hillier, Ozlem Sahbaz March 2008 Bartlett School of Graduate Studies University College London&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that:
#flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters;
#density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level;
#local movement is beneficial, larger scale movement not so;
#relative affluence and the number of neighbours has a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street.
#As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The over-provision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard.

It also re-established that simple, linear cul-de-sac streets with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. 
Of the five concluding observations three are unrelated to network pattern, indicating the overriding role of socio-economic factors. The consensus among researchers is that streets patterns in themselves cannot be seen as crimino-genic. The genesis of crime rests elsewhere. Of the factors that assist the intent for crime, however, unconstrained permeability appears the most influential. The Radburn pattern restricts permeability while the uniform grid enables it.

==Transportation, traffic, and their effects==
More significant criticisms of the grid and the Radburn patterns were put forward based on the new urban transportation context of unprecedented levels of motorised mobility that raises issues of [[traffic congestion]], collisions, accessibility, connectivity, legibility for pedestrian and driver, noise disturbance, car travel extent, air and water pollution, and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The importance of these criticisms rests on judging the functional adequacy of alternative networks regarding these aspects. Dysfunctional systems could entail heavy economic and social burdens that may be avoidable.

===Mobility and congestion===
The introduction of mechanized personal transport in large numbers during the 20th century tested every existing network's characteristics and their capacity to function satisfactorily for mobility and for city living in general. And since most cities where the motorcar first appeared had a grid layout,(e.g. New York, Chicago, and London) it was inevitably the first network pattern to experience its impact.

The grid's emergence in a pedestrian world, in which wheeled traffic of horse-drawn carts was limited, along with its extensive replication, attest indirectly to its functional adequacy for pedestrian movement. The new question about its adequacy for serving motorized movement and for serving both prime modes, motorized and non-motorized in combination, continues to be debated.

Early signs of a potential drawback of the orthogonal grid layout in serving wheeled traffic were discovered in Pompeii, Italy;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pompeiana.org/Research/Streets_Research/AIA_2001/EEP_AIA2001_Text.htm&lt;/ref&gt; at certain intersections left turns were prohibited and some streets or sections of others were decreed one-way. Contemporary traffic engineering recommends these measures to decrease congestion and improve flow in Centertown grids and have been applied extensively. It is worth noting that, the Pompeii restrictions occurred at horse and wagon speeds in the range of 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;km/hr, far below car speeds. Definitive proof of this deficiency, however, appeared 20 centuries later, when speeds and volumes of traffic reached critical thresholds and analysis of large numbers of data became computerized. However, a new complicating factor surfaced through adaptation.

Operational methods to control the flow of traffic and avoid collisions were introduced and grew steadily in sophistication, from traffic signs to computer-controlled, time-orchestrated systems. While the necessity of these adaptations provides practical proof of the grid's inadequacy to serve motorized transport unaided, their introduction made theoretical proof harder. Highly advanced computer modeling of traffic flows overcame this difficulty.
Another complicating factor in the early stages of motorization was the absence of a characteristic and typical alternative network pattern for a comparative analysis. Unlike the clear geometry of the grid, idiosyncratic, peculiar and site specific layouts, that have no obvious elements of a 'pattern' or 'stencil', cannot be accurately described and generalized. The only distinguishing element of current alternatives is their loose dendrite configuration, which is inherently hierarchical, that could be contrasted with the grid's inherent absence of hierarchy. Since in built districts neither of these networks appears in pure form, another level of complexity is introduced that tempers the certainty of analytical findings.

Of two studies that have attempted the comparison between "Radburn-type" and "grid-type" networks, one is based on two hypothetical layouts for a specific site and the second on an existing district layout and two hypothetical overlays. The relationship of congestion to layout geometry and density have been tested using computer-based traffic modeling. The first study, reported in 1990&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kulash, Joe Anglin and David Marks (1990), "Traditional Neighborhood Development: Will the Traffic Work?" Development 21, July/August 1990, pp. 21-24; available at http://www.walkablestreets.com/kulash.htm&lt;/ref&gt; compared the traffic performance in a 700-acre (2.8 km2) development that was laid out using two approaches, one with a hierarchical street layout that included cul-de-sac streets and the other a traditional grid. The study concluded that the non-hierarchical, traditional layout generally shows lower peak speeds and shorter, but more frequent intersection delays than the hierarchical pattern. The traditional pattern is not as friendly to the long trips as the hierarchical but friendlier to short trips. Local trips in it are shorter in distance but about equivalent in time with the hierarchical layout.

A second extensive comparative traffic study &lt;ref&gt;IBI Group (June 2007), Assessment of the Transportation Impacts of Current and Fused Grid Layouts, report prepared for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation www.cmhc.ca&lt;/ref&gt; of a subdivision about 830 acres (3.4 km2) tested three network models. It also tested the resilience of the layouts to an increased traffic load generated by higher residential densities. This study confirmed the previous findings that up to a density of 70 ppha{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} (including jobs), which is above the average range of subdivision densities of 35 to 55 ppha, the grid layout had a marginally higher or equal delay per trip to the Radburn-type network. At a 90 ppha, the conventional pattern showed marginally higher delay per trip than the grid. This outcome suggests that within the normal range of residential subdivision densities the grid has a slight disadvantage, but under very dense conditions the slight advantage reverses in favour of the grid-type and that both may be subject to improvement.

===Traffic safety===
[[File:Traffic-Circle-Vancouver-Grid.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A traffic circle applied to a four-way intersection as a means of improving its safety. This device, with a proven record of collision reductions and traffic flow improvement, turns the cross-intersection into four virtual three-way intersections.]]
The grid's traffic safety performance in comparison to other network types has been studied extensively and a general consensus is emerging both in theory and practice that, in general, it is the least safe of all currently used network patterns. A 1995 study&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Joseph, E. (1995). Livability and safety of suburban street patterns: A comparative study (Working Paper 642). Berkeley: Institute of Urban and Regional Development, University of California&lt;/ref&gt; found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighbourhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included cul-de-sacs and crescents. The frequency of accidents was measurably higher in the grid neighbourhoods.

Two subsequent studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one 2006 study,&lt;ref&gt;Lovegrove, G. &amp; Sayed, T. (2006) Macro-level collision models for evaluating neighbourhood traffic safety, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 33, pp. 609–621&lt;/ref&gt; cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one. A second 2008 study&lt;ref&gt;Sun, J. &amp; Lovegrove, G. (2008). Research Study on Evaluating the Level of Safety of the Fused Grid Road Pattern, External Research Project for CMHC, Ottawa, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt; found the grid plan to be the least safe by a significant margin with respect to all other street patterns in the set. A 2009 study &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eric Dumbaugh and Robert Rae. Safe Urban Form: Revisiting the Relationship Between Community Design and Traffic Safety. Journal of the American Planning Association, Vol. 75, No. 3, Summer 2009&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While land use matters, intersection types also affect traffic safety. Intersections in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes due to reductions in speed, but four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase total and injurious crashes significantly, all other things being equal. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.

Improved traffic safety has been shown to result from modifications to existing neighbourhoods laid out on a grid, indirectly suggesting its weakness with respect to safety. One study of the impacts of modifications&lt;ref&gt;Zein, S. R., Geddes, E., Hemsing, S., &amp; Johnson, M. (1997). Safety benefits of traffic calming. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1578, 3–10&lt;/ref&gt; found that Area-wide urban traffic-calming schemes reduce the number of injury accidents by about 15 percent on average. The largest reduction of accidents is found for residential streets (about 25 percent); a somewhat smaller (about 10%) reduction is found for main roads.

===Vulnerable road users===
Following the introduction of motorized transport, pedestrians do not fare well in cities. Their space and freedom of movement has gradually been curtailed and the risk of injury increased. They are now seen and studied as Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) along with bicycle riders because of their overwhelming disadvantage in the case of a collision.

Pedestrians experience stress and delay at every intersection, particularly when their mobility has been compromised either temporarily or through the aging process. A delay is unwelcome to pedestrians given that their slow speed and limited range of reach; the more frequent the intersections the higher the delay. 
Given the grid's origin as a network for pedestrian movement, it is important to understand how it serves pedestrians when it must synchronously serve vehicular traffic. A 2010 study concluded that of seven network patterns, including the Radburn-type pattern, the grid was the least safe for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;Ms Vicky Feng Wei, BASc and Gord Lovegrove PhD (2011), Sustainable Road Safety: A New Neighbourhood Road Pattern that saves VRU Lives, University of British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legibility===
[[File:Paris Street Network Segment.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A 2X2 km square segment of the street network of Paris with an approximate scale bar. It shows the highly irregular city blocks and the range of street orientations, both common attributes of many historic cities]]

Uniform grids with fixed cardinal directions can be mapped as easily on paper as on the mind. This quality — legibility — assists people in finding destinations and prevents the apprehension of being lost. However, this benefit is felt more by visitors to a district than by its residents. Many historic cities with labyrinthine plans, particularly in the medieval period and in the Islamic-Arab world, cause no anxiety to their permanent residents. (Some visitors, equipped with maps, see them as a delightful journey of discovery.) Many parts of Paris, France, for example, exhibit a highly irregular block dimensions and a wide range of street orientations not easily grasped by visitors. Residents quickly acquire many perceptual clues of direction and position without ever seeing printed maps of their domains and, in earlier times, without even the benefit of street signs. Legibility can be an advantage but it is not a necessary condition for a neighbourhood or a town to function well for its residents. While the uniform grid offers utmost legibility, mutated grids and other patterns can function adequately for finding directions.

===Walkability===
[[Walkability]], a [[neologism]], refers to those characteristics of an area which enable or hinder one's ability to walk around. More specifically, "[[walkable]]" means close; barrier-free; safe; full of pedestrian infrastructure and destinations; and upscale, leafy, or cosmopolitan.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Forsyth and Michael Southworth: Cities Afoot – Pedestrians, Walkability and Urban Design, Journal of Urban Design, Vol 13 #1&lt;/ref&gt; Of these characteristics some are related to the street network configuration, such as "close" and "pedestrian infrastructure" while others relate to land use and level of amenity such as destinations and sidewalks. The uniform grid's inherent high frequency and openness makes closeness easily achievable as the chosen routes can be direct. In its central city expression blocks are generally short and equipped with a sidewalk on each side. Suburban grids, however, often depart from the classic square block and include long orthogonal blocks and sidewalks only on one side or none at all. Similarly contemporary versions of the classic Radburn and [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] do not always include pedestrian linkages that were present in the original. They too lack sidewalks, mostly to reduce costs but also on the assumption that resident traffic is low enough for the road pavement to be shared by all without risk.

Published studies examined the relative connectivity of neighbourhoods built following the grid stencil or the Radburn-type pattern. 
A 1970 study compared Radburn to two other communities, one, Radburn-type (Reston, Virginia) and a second, a nearby unplanned community. It found that 47% of Radburn's residents shopped for groceries on foot, while comparable figures were 23% for Reston and only 8% for the second community. A 2003 study also compared Radburn (1929) to a neo-traditional development (1990). It found that the rates of connectivity differed with the destination. Shopping was considerably more direct and closer in Radburn while the elementary school was just as direct in both but at a marginally longer distance in Radburn. Accessibility to the park was virtually the same.&lt;ref&gt;Chang-Moo Lee and Kun-Hyuck Ahn : Is Kentlands Better than Radburn? APA Journal, Winter 2003, Vol. 69, No1&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, walkability was marginally better in the Radburn neighbourhood.

A 2010 study, compared eight neighbourhoods of which four followed the grid network rules while the remainder adhered to the Radburn-type network structure. Connectivity, values ranged between 0.71 and 0.82, with the upper limit being 1.00. The grid-like set had two samples above the 0.76 average and one below, while the Radburn-type set had one above average and two below. The amount of walking did not correlate well with the connectivity values indicating that other factors were at play.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Tomalty and Murtaza Haider, 2010; Comparing Canadian New Urbanist and conventional Suburban Neighbourhoods, Canada Mortagage and Housing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; Walking correlated better when the additional pedestrian infrastructure, independent paths was included. These results confirmed previous findings that while connectivity, the essential characteristic of the grid, is a necessary condition for walkability it is not sufficient by itself to entice walking.

A third study compared seven neighbourhoods by examining their walking and driving activity as an indicator or a network's propensity to entice walking. Using the [[agent-based modeling]] method it calculated the amount of walking under identical land use conditions. The traditional uniform grid, two Radburn-type patterns and one neo-traditional grid had lower levels of walking activity than a second version of the neo-traditional grid and the fused grid. Overall the Radburn-type networks had lower average walking scores and higher driving activity.&lt;ref name="Xiongbing Jin 2010"&gt;Xiongbing Jin (2010) Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods. PhD thesis at Memorial University of Newfoundland&lt;/ref&gt; These results show that the influence of the street network on walkability is clearly evident but also dependent on the specific characteristics of its geometry.

===Transit accommodation===
Although the grid was introduced long before any system of public transit would become necessary or available, its strict regularity provides sufficient flexibility for mapping transit routes. By contrast, derivatives of the Radburn-type network, particularly the non-cellular and strictly dendrite variety, are inflexible and force transit routes that are often long and circuitous resulting in an inefficient and costly service.

==Environmental issues==
Until the second half of the 20th century, the prime purpose of linking people to places has also been the prime criterion for judging a network's performance. New criteria surfaced when questions about the impact of development on the environment were raised. In that new context, a network's [[land consumption]]; its adaptability to the land's natural features; the degree of [[impervious surface|water impermeability]] it introduces; whether it lengthens trips and how it affects the production of [[greenhouse gas]]es constitute part of a new set of criteria.

===Adaptability===
Typical, uniform grids are unresponsive to topography. [[Priene]]'s plan, for example, is set on a hillside and most of its north-south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots, and loaded animals. Cities established more recently have utilized a similar approach to Priene's, for example: San Francisco, Vancouver, and Saint John, New Brunswick. In a modern context, steep grades limit [[accessibility]] by car and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates. The strict orthogonal geometry forces roads and lots over [[creek (stream)|creeks]], [[marsh]]es, and woodlots, thus disturbing the local ecology. It is said of the 1811 NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way.
By contrast, the unconstrained geometry of the Radburn-type networks provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate natural features.

===Land consumption and conservation===
Depending on the choice of street pattern and the cross section of the street space, streets consume an average 26% of the total [[developed land]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Gallion and Simon Eisner 1986 The Urban Pattern: City Planning and Design&lt;/ref&gt; They can range from 20% to over 40%. For example, the Portland grid consumes 41% of the development land in street Right-of-Ways (ROW). At the low end of usage, Stein's Radburn neighbourhood uses about 24% of the total. Villages and towns with narrow streets (2 to 3 m wide) consume much less.

Actual layouts of specific districts show variability within that range due to site-specific conditions and network pattern idiosyncrasies. Land taken up by streets becomes unavailable for development; its use is inefficient since it stays empty for most of the time. Were it to be developed, less land would be required for the same number housing units, resulting in lowering the pressure to consume more of it.

A 2007 study &lt;ref&gt;IBI Group 2007 - Comparing Current and Fused Grid Neighbourhood Layouts for mobility, infrastructure and emissions costs, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; compared alternative layout plans for a 3.4 square kilometre subdivision and found that the traditional grid layout had 43 percent more land dedicated to [[road]]s than the conventional Radburn-type network.

===Water cycle and water quality impacts===
All new development, irrespective of its network pattern, alters the pre-existing natural condition of a site and its ability to absorb and recycle [[rain|rain water]]. [[Road]]s are a major factor in limiting absorption by the sheer amount of impermeable surfaces they introduce. They affect water usability by the generation of [[road surface]] [[pollutant]]s that [[Surface runoff|end up downstream]] making it unfit for direct use.

The grid's inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of impermeable surfaces in street pavement and sidewalks. In comparison to networks with discontinuous street types, that are characteristic of the Radburn pattern, grids can have up to 30% percent more impermeable surface attributable to roads. One study compared alternative layouts on a 155 ha (383 acre) site and found that the grid-type layout had 17% more impermeable surface area in total compared to the Radburn-type layout.

===Vehicle kilometres traveled and exhaust emissions===
[[Exhaust gas|Emissions]] from all [[transportation]] account for about 30% of the total from all sources and personal car use amounts to about 60% percent of that share that translates to about 18% percent of the total GHG production. Three factors that affect emissions from personal travel relate to network configuration and function: a) trip length b) speed of travel c) propensity for congestion. Studies have shown that Radburn-type networks could add up to 10 percent to the length of local, short trips. As was seen earlier under congestion, grid-type patterns induce longer trip times that are primarily due to stops at the characteristic and frequent four-way intersections.

A 2007 study &lt;ref&gt;IBI Group (2007), Assessment of the Transportation Impacts of Current and Fused Grid Layouts, report prepared for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation www.cmhc.ca&lt;/ref&gt; compared total traveled kilometres and total estimated emissions. Regarding the trip length, it confirmed previous studies by finding a 6% increase in local VKTs in the Radburn-type layout. The emissions comparison excluded CO2 and focused on three noxious (criteria) gases. Totalling the estimated cost of these emissions for ease of comparison, it found a 5% increase in costs for the conventional Radburn type layout.

===Development and lifecycle costs===
With the prevalence of [[motorization|motorized]] [[:wikt:mobility|mobility]], street infrastructure represents the single largest component of capital outlays for building a new neighbourhood. Until the end of the 19th century most city streets were unpaved, had no [[drainage sewer]]s, few were lit, and hardly any had signage. Also, the majority were narrow by contemporary standards, frequently without sidewalks. Consequently, they consumed few resources for construction and maintenance. By contrast, current street design standards necessitate a large investment for construction and significant city budget allocations for their maintenance.
A 2008 engineering study compared network patterns for the same district and found that the traditional, modified grid network (TND) pattern had about 46% higher costs for road infrastructure compared to the Radburn-type of the existing layout.

These figures exclude the opportunity cost attributable to land that becomes unavailable for private use. The Radburn-type layout has approximately 30% less land dedicated to roads than the Neo-traditional layout. When accounting for this land and using a cost of $162,000 per hectare ($40,000/acre (2007 Dollars), land costs for roadways increase the relative cost for road infrastructure from a difference of 46% to 53% between the two layouts.

The same study examined the lifecycle costs for the two network options and found that, similar to the capital costs, roads remain the key cost component of a community when accounting for on-going operations, maintenance and replacement costs.

===Summary of positive attributes===
In judging the two currently disputed network concepts it would appear that neither has all the requisite elements needed for adequately responding to the new urban transportation context of extensive motorized mobility. The Radburn pattern fares better overall since it was consciously designed "for the motor age". Similarly, the weaker overall performance of the grid can be understood as innate, given its origin in a predominantly pedestrian world.

Advantages of a '''Radburn-like''' pattern:
*less costly to construct and maintain
*more flexible in adapting to the topography
*greater ground permeability 
*lower trip delay
*safer for cars and pedestrians, all other things equal
*more picturesque all other things being equal
*may provide a more sociable environment, particularly for children
*may be more secure, all other factors being equal

Advantages of a '''grid-like''' network:
*reduces local distances due to its frequency of intersections
*more walkable
*accommodates transit easily
*more legible, when it maintains the orthogonal directions
*easy to lay out as city blocks and plots

==The need for an alternative==
[[File:Street Network Adaptations-closures.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An adaptation to the grid street network (closure) that prevents through car traffic while permitting full access to pedestrians and bicycles]]
To function well, a contemporary network must include these advantages from the contrasting patterns thus reducing frictions and conflicts in urban environments. The need for an alternative has been evident since the middle of the 20th century for practical and theoretical considerations.
In practice, in the second half of the 20th century citizens of many American and European cities have protested against the intrusion of through traffic in their neighbourhoods. Its side-effects were unwelcome as being detrimental to peace, tranquility, health, and safety. In response, cities introduced an armoury of controls to ensure that residential districts retained a high standard of life quality. Among these controls were one-way streets, closures, half-closures, traffic circles, and a liberal use of stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;R Ewing (1999) Traffic Calming: The State of Practice (ITE/FHWA)&lt;/ref&gt; These measures being improvised retrofits implied the need for a network pattern in which techniques such as these would be obviated by innovative design.
On the theoretical level, planners analysed the conflicts caused by the new urban mobility, proposed alternative schemes and, in some cases, applied them. [[Christopher Alexander|Alexander]] proposed (1977) a genetic code of 10 "[[design pattern|pattern]]s" &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. et al. A Pattern Language. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; which, when combined would resolve identified conflicts and would produce a convivial, gratifying district milieu. A central idea among them is a traffic impermeable neighbourhood area of about 10 ha, reminiscent of the Radburn plan principle but smaller in size.
[[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Doxiadis]] emphasized the importance of mobility and designed a large orthogonal grid (2&amp;nbsp;km by 2&amp;nbsp;km) of arterials to expedite circulation, as seen in [[Islamabad]]. He also recognized the need to separate "man from machine"&lt;ref&gt;Doxiadis, C. A (1975) Anthropopolis: City for Human Development (W. W. Norton &amp; Co )&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced traffic-impermeable neighbourhoods also generally resembling the Radburn plan.

==The fused grid model==
[[File:FusedGridDistrict.png|thumb|400px|right|District with four neighbourhoods and mixed use zone, showing the twin connectors]]
Based on these sets of issues, the identified advantages of alternative patterns and the ideas of 20th century theorists, the fused grid assembles several elements from these precedents into a complete stencil. Just as the grid stencil and the Radburn pattern did, it sets up a geometric structure that exhibits the key characteristics of a functioning system. It consists of a large-scale open grid of collector streets, carrying moderate speed motorized traffic. This grid forms precincts (quadrants, neighbourhoods) that are normally about 16 ha (40 acres) in size (400 m by 400 m). Within each precinct, the layout uses crescents or cul-de-sacs or a combination of both to eliminate through traffic. In addition, a continuous open-space and pedestrian path system provides direct access to parks, public transit, retail, and community facilities. Residents can cross a quadrant block on foot in about five minutes. The most intensive land uses such as schools, community facilities, high-density residential uses, and retail are located in the center of the plan, reached by twinned roads which connect longer, district destination points.

This synthesis of inherited network traditions and ideas is accomplished through the application of two practical means: a rectilinear, orthogonal geometry, a key characteristic of the grid, and the use of two street types that have generally been associated with the Radburn-type subdivisions. 
[[File:Fused Grid Nested Hierarchy of Roads.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A diagram showing the nested hierarchy of roads in the fused grid transportation network]]

The orthogonal geometry serves two purposes: a) to enhance the navigability of the network structure particularly at the district and regional scale. This is important at car speeds where decisions about destinations and turns have to be made promptly. b) to maintain a good level of safety at road intersections, as recommended by traffic engineering manuals. 
The grid's second essential characteristic, connectivity, is recaptured through a third element that completes the "system" – pedestrian-only connectors between regular streets that are intended for all movement modes. These connectors (paths) are typically routed through open spaces that occupy central points in a neighbourhood cell. Thus the neighbourhood street network comprises a mixture of streets; some pedestrian dominant and others car dominant. 
A fourth element is the nested hierarchy of streets that distinguishes between connectivity and permeability at the neighbourhood level. This idea reflects the fact the longer the linked destinations the higher the level of mobility must be. A dendrite configuration, such as a river, takes progressively wider expanses of land to accommodate the flow. A nested hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, S. (2005) Streets And Patterns: The Structure of Urban Geometry (London and New York: Spon Press) Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand distributes the flow at each volume level to alternative paths. The complete system, though it may appear unfamiliar, is composed of entirely familiar and extensively used elements in contemporary development.

==Proof of concept==
[[File:Saddlestone Community Development Plan.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An approved Community Development Plan in Calgary, Alberta that is based on the fused grid model]]
The model has been applied in two new communities, one in Stratford, ON and the other in Calgary, Alberta. The potential merits of the concept so far have been tested through research; site observations or measurements will await full build-out. The aspects of the model that have been tested correspond to the key criteria of performance, listed above, such as mobility, safety, cost, and environmental impact.

===Mobility===
A study on the transportation impacts of the fused grid &lt;ref&gt;IBI Group (2007), Assessment of the Transportation Impacts of Current and Fused Grid Layouts, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation www.cmhc.ca&lt;/ref&gt; asserted through comparative analysis using computer-based traffic modeling that the fused grid produces the least total delay in all four density scenarios tested and performed progressively better as the density increased. Taking the fused grid as 100 (base), the delay was 32% more for the conventional Radburn-type pattern and 27% higher for the grid-type pattern. At the next higher density level the difference between patterns increased and they were correspondingly 100 (fused grid), 152 (Radburn-type) and 126 (grid -type). Traffic modeling shows the potential of the fused grid to reduce time delay during peak hours and, therefore, congestion.

===Traffic safety===
In a fused grid, three-way intersections are more common than four-way, which have been shown by traffic studies to be less safe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, H. (1957). Subdividing for traffic safety. Traffic Quarterly, 11(3), 308–325.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovegrove, G. &amp; Sayed, T. (2006) Macro-level collision models for evaluating neighbourhood traffic safety, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 33, pp. 609–621.&lt;/ref&gt;
One study found that for each probable collision in the fused grid there would be 2.55 collisions in a standard grid, 2.39 in a layout designed to Dutch "sustainable road safety" guidelines, 1.46 in a cul-de-sac layout and 0.88 in a 3-way Offset layout.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, J. &amp; Lovegrove, G. (2009). Evaluating the Level of Safety of the Fused Grid Road Pattern, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Ottawa,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walkability===
An extensive study of neighbourhoods based on geo-coded trips to local destinations found that a fused grid type of layout increases home-base walking trips by 11.3% in comparison to the conventional grid and it is associated with a 25.9% increase in the odds that residents will meet the recommended physical activity levels. Its 10% increase in relative connectivity for pedestrians is associated with a 23% decrease in vehicle kilometres of local travel.
&lt;ref&gt;Frank, L. &amp; Hawkins, C. (2008) Assessing Travel and Environmental Impacts of Contrasting Levels of Vehicular and Pedestrian Connectivity: Assessing Aspects of the Fused Grid, Ottawa: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study compared seven neighbourhoods of different street network layouts for the daily travel patterns including the amount of walking that occurred. It found that the fused grid had considerably more walking activity. The set of network patterns included two versions of the traditional grid, two versions of post-war suburbs, two versions of the Traditional Neighbourhood Development (i.e. modified grid) and the fused frid. The lowest amount of walking was found to happen in one of the post-war conventional subdivision. Setting this as the base (100) for the purpose of comparison, the two classic grids registered 11%, one conventional subdivision 109%, one TND neighbourhood 108%, the second TND 137% and the fused grid 143%.&lt;ref&gt;Xiongbing Jin (2010) Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods. PhD thesis at Memorial University of Newfoundland&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the total distance walked, the fused grid registered 23% larger distance than the lowest of the seven in the set which was also reflected in the lowest amount of local driving.

The fused grid anticipates the location of convenience shopping and amenities at the periphery of the four-quadrant neighbourhood. In such a configuration any part of the neighbourhood is a five-minute walk to the periphery and a ten-minute walk across the entire neighbourhood. Closeness of destinations is inherent in the structure of the network. The same structure, based on 400 m intervals, coincides with current practices for transit route location.
Consequently, the street network pattern, the anticipated land use distribution and the location of transit stops are all conducive to walking.

===Health outcomes===
Neighbourhood layouts may indirectly influence the health and wellbeing of residents through their effect on factors such as noise, air quality, and physical activity. Noise levels and duration of exposure correlate with traffic volume and speed. According to a traffic analysis study&lt;ref&gt;IBI Group 2007 - Comparing Current and Fused Grid Neighbourhood Layouts for mobility, infrastructure and emissions costs, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; neighbourhood streets in the fused grid layout exhibit the lowest traffic volumes when compared to alternative layouts. By inference, low volumes imply lower duration of exposure to noise. Frequent turns in the streets (see drawing of approved development plan) result in speed reduction which lowers noise intensity. As a consequence of low traffic volumes, its residential streets show low air pollution levels.&lt;ref name="Xiongbing Jin 2010"/&gt; The high walking levels registered by the fused grid layout, mentioned above, indicate the potential of increased physical activity.

In addition to these three factors that may impact on resident's health - noise, air quality, and physical activity - a fourth one, proximity to natural open spaces, has emerged as a significant contributor. Previous studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of frequent contact with nature and some have investigated the probable mechanism of the effect via stress abating biochemical processes,.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Ward et al. More green space is linked to less stress in deprived communities: Evidence from salivary cortisol patterns Landscape and Urban Planning, 105 (2012) 221-229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, T., Evans, G. W., Jamner, L. D., Davies, D. S., &amp; Gärling, T. (2003). Tracking restoration in natural and urban field settings. Journal of Environmental Psychology,23, 109–123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, S. (1995). The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework Journal of Environmental Psychology, 15, 169–182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, A., Maas, J., Verheij, R. A., &amp; Groenewegen, P. P. (2010). Green space as a buffer between negative life events and health. Social Science &amp; Medicine,70(8), 1203–1210&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, links were established to specific biota (microorganisms) found in nature and their direct influence on building immune system strength.&lt;ref&gt;Hanski et al. Environmental biodiversity, human microbiota, and allergy are interrelated April 4, 2012 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1205624109 Freely available online through the PNAS open access option.&lt;/ref&gt;
From these studies it can be inferred that a neighbourhood layout based on the fused grid model may confer these health and well-being benefits to residents because it incorporates green open spaces as integral parts of its pedestrian circulation network. Inclusion of green spaces is possible in any layout as an option; in the fused grid it is a necessary component of its configuration.

===Site adaptability===
The virtual grid mesh that underlies the fused grid network structure is expressed at 400 m intervals, five times the size of the traditional city block (about 80 m). At this scale there is greater flexibility to adapt the network elements to the topography and to specific site boundary constraints that are common in property configurations. Within the 16 ha quadrant, the discontinuous character of the streets and the possible combination of cul-de-sac and loop types provide sufficient latitude to the site plan designer to lay out an adapted version of the fused grid. There are at least 15 variations of the quadrant design that can be moulded to fit specific conditions. 
The site adaptability of the model has been demonstrated in the two approved layout plans.

===Ground permeability===
One study &lt;ref&gt;A Plan for Rainy Days: Water Runoff and Site Planning, 2007. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; quantified the relative permeability of three alternative site plans for the same site. The analysis results show that the impermeable areas of the three layouts - assuming roads, building foot prints and sidewalks to be [[impervious surface]]s - ranged from 34.7% of fused grid to 35.8% of the conventional suburban to 39% of the grid-like pattern. Streets were the single most influential factor in the amount of the water runoff. They account for an impermeable surface which is up to three times that of the building footprint. Of the total impermeable area in the three layouts the portion attributable to streets ranges from 48 to 65 percent with the fused grid occupying the low end. The reduction in street length and the systematic use of open spaces as structural elements of the layout increase the potential of greater water permeability in the Fused Grid.

===Development and municipal costs===
A study compared the cost efficiency of three network patterns in improving the traffic performance of a district. It first established the cost of the network system of each before evaluating the efficiency ratio for the resulting traffic improvement.&lt;ref&gt;IBI Group 2008. Comparing Current and Fused Grid Neighbourhood Layouts: mobility, infrastructure and emission costs. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis showed that the most significant capital cost of development is for roads. The conventional layout has the lowest capital costs for roads followed by the fused grid at 12% higher and the Neo-traditional (grid) layout at 46% higher. 
When considering the opportunity cost for land dedicated to right-of-ways (ROW), the fused grid allocated 9% more land to roads than the conventional grid, while the neo-traditional grid allocated 43% more. Similar to capital costs, roads remain the key cost component of community development after accounting for on-going operations, maintenance, and replacement costs.

The study showed that there are significant differences in costs related to travel delay for the total road network particularly at the desirable transit-supportive densities. The delay costs incurred by the conventional layout are 12% higher than the fused grid followed by the Neotraditional grid at 3% higher. The conventional layout is less cost-efficient than the fused grid network since they have similar infrastructure costs but the latter delivers significant savings in travel time costs. The travel time benefits of the neo-traditional grid layout are disproportional to the required infrastructure investment. The obvious benefits of saving time for pedestrians and the enticement of more walking have not so far been monetized.

==Applications of the fused grid==
Retroactive application of the fused grid model can be seen in the centres of old European cities, such as Munich, Essen, and Freiburg and in newer railway towns or suburbs such as [[Vauban, Freiburg]] and [[Houten]] in the Netherlands. In most of these cases, acknowledging the constrains of an existing built environment, the key fused grid characteristic of a traffic impermeable centre is evident along with the primacy and continuity of pedestrian-only links to the remainder of the inherited street system. The fused grid is promoted in Canada by the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]].

A similar debate has also been taking place in Europe and particularly the UK, where the term '''filtered permeability'''&lt;ref name="melia"&gt;[http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/articles.htm MELIA, S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819142835/http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/articles.htm |date=2008-08-19 }}, 2007. Eco Town Mobility. Town and Country Planning, November. and Melia, S. 2008. Neighbourhoods Should be Made Permeable for Walking and Cycling But Not Cars. Local Transport Today, Jan 23rd 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was coined to describe urban layouts which maximise ease of movement for pedestrians and cyclists, but seek to restrain it for motor vehicles.

He began his diplomatic career in the mid-1980s when he joined the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Samuels |title=Grand Illusions |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200706/condoleezza-rice/9 |publisher=The Atlantic |date=June 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead up to the [[Gulf War]], Helal interpreted for Secretary of State [[James A. Baker III]] and Iraqi emissary [[Tariq Aziz]] at a meeting in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], at which time Aziz was presented with an ultimatum to withdraw troops from [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

By 1993 he was a senior diplomatic interpreter, and later senior policy adviser to [[Dennis Ross]], then the special Middle East coordinator under President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; Ross, reflecting on his engagement in the [[Israeli-Palestinian peace process]], stated that "Most of my meetings with Yasser Arafat would start off with my delegation, but the real work would be done with just Arafat, me and Gamal."&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;  At the end of Clinton's term, Helal interpreted between him and Yasser Arafat during peace talks at [[Camp David]], and was once tasked to speak alone with Arafat to try and convince him of the opportunity of the Israeli offer.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; 

Helal continued to work under President [[George W.

'''Gauḍapāda''' (c.6th century CE),{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}} also referred as '''{{IAST|Gauḍapādācārya}}''',{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}} was an early medieval era [[Hindu]] philosopher and scholar of the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}&lt;ref&gt;TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-0-415-46118-4}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; While details of his biography are uncertain, his ideas inspired others such as [[Adi Shankara]] who called him a ''Paramaguru'' (highest teacher).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=125-126}}

Gaudapada was the author or compiler of the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'', also known as ''Gaudapada Karika''.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=308}} The text consists of four chapters (also called four books{{Sfn|Potter|1981|pp=106-111}}), of which Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology thereby showing it was influenced by Buddhism.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; However, doctrinally Gaudapada's work is Vedantin, and not Buddhist.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}&lt;ref name=trvmurti116/&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=311}} The first three chapters of  Gaudapada's text have been influential in the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition.  Parts of the first chapter that include the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'' have been considered a valid scriptural source by the [[Dvaita]] and [[Vishistadvaita]] schools of Vedanta,{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=280}} but nothing from chapter four with Buddhist flavor has found acceptance or use in the Vedanta school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt;

==Dates==
The century in which Gaudapada lived and his life details are uncertain.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt; Estimates vary from early 6th{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}}{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}} to 7th century CE.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=3}} He is generally dated from estimates for [[Adi Shankara]], whose teacher [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]] is presumed to be the direct disciple of Gaudapada. Shankara in some texts, refers to Gaudapada as the "teacher's teacher" who knows the tradition of the Vedānta (sampradāya-vit). Assuming how long each lived and when, Gaudapada is estimated to have lived sometime in the 7th century CE.{{sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}} Alternatively, states Potter, the phrase "teacher's teacher" should not be taken literally, and more in the sense of another phrase he uses for Gaudapada, namely ''Paramaguru'' (highest teacher).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}} He may have been the guru of Sankara's teacher, but was likely a more distant guru, states Michael Comans (aka [[Vasudevacharya]]).{{Sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=2, 163}}

Another estimate places him around the early 6th century.&lt;ref name=iepgauda&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/gauḍapad/ Gaudapada], Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=125-126}} This estimate is based on Buddhist literature, and particularly those of scholars Bhavaviveka, Santaraksita and Kamalasila who cite ''Gauḍapada kārikās''.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt;{{Sfn|Michael Comans|2000|pp=45-46}} Bhavaviveka was a contemporary of [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapala]], states Karl Potter, while Chinese texts and travel accounts place Dharmapala in the mid 6th century CE.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt; Assuming the Buddhist and Chinese records are reliable, and for Bhavaviveka to have quoted ''Gauḍapada kārikās'', Gaudapada must have lived around 500 CE, or sometime in the first half of 6th century CE. But, it is certain that Gaudapada lived after the 4th century because he cites some Buddhist views of Nāgārjuna and [[Asanga]], the latter of whom various accounts place in 4th century India.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt;

==Mandukya Karika==
[[File:Gaudapada Mandukya Karika manuscript page sample i, Sanskrit, Devanagari script.jpg|thumb|left|The Mandukya Karika is an influential Vedanta text. Above: a manuscript page (Sanskrit, Devanagari script)]]
===Authorship===
Gaudapada wrote or compiled{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=308}} the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'', also known as the ''{{IAST|Gauḍapāda Kārikā}}'' and as the ''{{IAST|Āgama Śāstra}}''.{{refn|group=note|Nakamura notes that there are contradictions in doctrine between the four chapters.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=308}}}} Some scholars, states Karl Potter, doubt that ''Gaudapada Karika'' was written by one author.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=103}}

The ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' is a concise explanation, in verse form,{{refn|group=note|Karika is defined by Monier-Williams as "concise statement in verse of (esp. philosophy and grammar) doctrines" in the Indian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1899), Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 2nd Ed, Oxford University Press, कारिका&lt;/ref&gt;}} of the doctrines in ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'', one of the shortest but a profound [[Upanishad]], consisting of just 12 sentences.{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|p=126}} Even before the time of Adi Shankara, Mandukya Upanishad was considered to be a [[Śruti]], but not one particularly important during his era.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=280}} In later periods it acquired a higher value, and expressing the Upanishadic essence. {{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=280}} The Karika, notably, presents rational arguments from dream states, infinitude and finitude, space and time, causality, disintegration, and generation in support of the advaita doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See Introduction of ''Mandukya Upanishad with the Karika of Gaudapada and the Commentary of Shankaracharya'' (trans.Swami Gambhirananda. Calcutta: Advaita Ashrama, 1995) and Domenic Marbaniang, "The Advaitin Search for Unity in Diversity", ''Epistemics of Divine Reality: An Argument for Rational Fideism'', PhD Dissertation (Bangalore: ACTS Academy of Higher Education, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' is the earliest extant systematic treatise on {{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}},&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not the oldest work to present Advaita views,{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=211}} nor the only pre-Sankara work with the same type of teachings.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=211}} According to Hajime Nakamura, not only was the ''Gaudapada Karika'' treasured in the Advaita tradition, the text was revered and highly respected in [[Vishistadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]] Vedanta schools of Hinduism as well.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=280}} Gaudapada's text, adds Nakamura, was treasured but not considered a Sruti by Advaita scholars, while [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya]] of non-Advaita schools considered its first chapter to be a Sruti.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=280}}

===Contents===
The Gaudapadiya Karika has 215 [[Sanskrit prosody|metered verses]] which are divided into four chapters:&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt;
# Chapter One (29 verses)&amp;nbsp;— [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agama, or Agama Prakarana]] (Traditional doctrine, includes 12 verses of the Mandukya Upanishad){{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|p=126}}
# Chapter Two (38 verses)&amp;nbsp;— Vaitathya Prakarana (Unreality){{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=107}}
# Chapter Three (48 verses)&amp;nbsp;— Adavaita Prakarana (Nonduality){{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=108}}
# Chapter Four (100 verses)&amp;nbsp;— Alatasanti Prakarana (The Peace of the Firebrand){{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=110}}

Chronologically, according to [[Hajime Nakamura]], the Buddhist texts that quote from ''Gaudapada Karikas'' imply that the Vedantic ideas in the first three chapters are of greater antiquity. Most of Chapter Three of the compilation of ''Gaudapada Karika'' was complete by 400–500 CE, states Nakamura.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=309}} He estimates that most of Chapter One was complete by 300–400 CE, while Chapter Two which presupposes Chapter One can be dated to have been mostly complete after Chapter One but before Chapter Three.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=310}} Most of the Chapter Four was written sometime between 400 and 600 CE.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=309}}

The [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]] resides in one's body in three forms: waking state, sleeping dreamy state and in deep sleep state, according to Potter's translation. When awake, the Self experiences the [[Vishva]] – the external objects and the visible; when dreaming, it experiences the [[Taijasa]] – the internal mind objects and what appears in the dreams; when in deep sleep, the Self experiences [[Prajñā (Hinduism)|Prajna]] – the unpolarized, the fruits of the heart and bliss.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}}&lt;ref name="Sharma2012p41"/&gt; The description of these states of self are similar, states Arvind Sharma, to those found in [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] and other ancient Hindu texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVc5Deglvb8C |year=2012| publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8430-2|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudapada presents the competing traditional theories about life in vogue, before and in his times, in Karika 6 through 9. Some claim creation is the result of the expansion of the Self, some claim it is a mere magic show, some claim the creation is from God's desire, some claim ''Kala'' (time) creates all beings.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}} In Karika 10, the text states there is a fourth state of the Self, called Turiya, one of ''Advaita'' (nonduality), all pervading, unchanging and without ''Dukkha'' (sorrow).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}}&lt;ref name="Sharma2012p41"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVc5Deglvb8C |year=2012| publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8430-2|pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fourth state of Self in ''Gaudapada Karika'' is found in chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which discusses the "four states of consciousness" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep.&lt;ref name=ptrajuchandogya&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 32-33; '''Quote''': "We can see that this story [in Chandogya Upanishad] is an anticipation of the Mandukya doctrine, (...)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n289/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad - Eighth Prathapaka, Seventh through Twelfth Khanda], Oxford University Press, pages 268-273&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vishva'' and ''Taijasa'' state of Self – states Gaudapada – can be a source of cause and effect, the ''Prajna'' is only cause, while ''Turiya'' state is neither.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}} It is the waking state and dream state that lead to awareness, errors and unawareness. The perceived duality of the world is [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], when in reality there is only nonduality.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}} Chapter One ends with the discussion of the [[Om]] and its symbolism for Brahman, and the Atman within the heart of all living beings.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=106}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar9/&gt;{{Sfn|Isaeva|1995|p=30-34}}

====Chapter Two: Unreality (Vaitathya)====
Unreal are the dream objects during sleep, states Gaudapada, because the one who dreams never actually goes to place he dreams of, and because whatever situation he dreams about is something he leaves upon waking up. This is in the scripture [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=107}}

In the same sense, the true reality is covered up for man even in his waking state, state Karikas 4-6 of Chapter Two, because, translates Potter, "any object nonexistent in the beginning and in the end is also nonexistent in the middle".{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n67/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, page 10-11 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

When we sleep, we feel the external things we dream about are real and the internal states as unreal, but in the awakened state we realize both are unreal. In the same way, in our waking state whatever we apprehend to be real and unreal are both unreal, covering up the true reality, state Karikas 10-15.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=107}} But this assertion leads to the obvious question, states Gaudapada, that if both internal and external are not true reality, who is it that imagines, who apprehends them and who cognizes?{{Sfn|Isaeva|1995|p=43}} Gaudapada submits his answer as the Atman (Self, soul).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=107}}{{Sfn|Isaeva|1995|p=43}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n69/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, page 12 with footnotes 11-12; Quote:&lt;br&gt; उभयोरपि वैतथ्यं भेदानां स्थानयोर्यदि ।&lt;br&gt;क एतान्बुध्यते भेदान्को वै तेषां विकल्पकः ॥ ११ ॥&lt;br&gt;कल्पयत्यात्मनाऽऽत्मानमात्मा देवः स्वमायया |&lt;br&gt;स एव बुध्यते भेदानिति वेदान्तनिश्चयः ॥ १२ ॥&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaudapada Karika'' states that while we do grasp objects, we perceive, we think, but this does not connote the nature of reality and unreality, just like our fear of "a rope for a serpent in darkness".{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and an alternate translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n71/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, page 13-14 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; We construct realities, states Gaudapada, and imagine ''Jivatman'' to be various things such as ''prana'' (brreath), ''loka'' (world), ''deva'' (gods), ''bhoktr'' (enjoyer), ''bhojya'' (enjoyables), ''sukshma'' (subtle), ''sthula'' (gross), ''murta'' (material), ''amurta'' (nonmaterial) and so on.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=108}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar16&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n73/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 15-17 with footnotes, 77-84&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Isaeva|1995|pp=44-45}}

We imagine things in our mind, we create things in our mind, we destroy things in our mind, says Gaudapada; yet all these things are not different from It, the Atman (gender neutral).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=108}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar16/&gt; All such constructions create dualities in our imagination, are [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. The true reality, state Karikas 33-36, is nondual and it is Atman.&lt;ref name=karmarkar18/&gt;{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=108}} Those who have mastered and grown past all attachments, past all fear and past all anger, they are past all dualities, know their Self, have secured the nonduality within. According to Karika 36-38, such wise individuals, do not care about praise from anyone, are beyond all rituals, are homeless wanderers, for they have realized the true inside them and outside; they, translates Potter, "remain steadfastly true to nature".{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=108}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar18&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n75/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 18-19 with footnotes, 85-88&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudapada opens this chapter by criticizing devotional worship of any form, and states that this assumes that the Brahman-Atman is born.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=108}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar19/&gt; He states that the nondual Brahman-Atman (Self) can give rise to apparent duality (''Jivas'', individual souls), while remaining unaffected in the process. To this end he gives the analogy of space and jars.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|pp=108-109}} Self is like space and the Jivas are like space in jars. Just as space is enclosed in a jar, so is the Self manifested as Jivas. When the jar is destroyed the space in the jar merges into space so likewise, are the Jivas one of the Self.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|pp=108-109}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar19&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n77/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 20-21 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudapada states that the Upanishads such as the ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' teach this, that one's own Atman (self) is identical to the Atman in other beings, and all Atman are identical with the Brahman.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=109}} While some Upanishads, acknowledges Gaudapada, imply a difference between individual soul and the Brahman, those texts are discussing the apparent distinction (duality) when one believes in apparent creation. In reality, states Gaudapada, there is no creation of souls from Brahman as they are identical.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=109}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n79/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 21-23 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; We must not confuse passages meant for spiritual instruction. According to Karikas 3.17-18, Gaudapada admits that dualists disagree with this view, but the ancient texts admit duality in the context of appearances, while "nonduality is indeed the highest reality", translates Karmarkar.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=109}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n81/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 23-24 with footnotes 17 &amp; 18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter's translation of Karikas 3.33-36, an awareness that is without conceptual construction is unborn, and this is identical to the object of that awareness called [[Brahman]]. This awareness is not a metaphor, nor born, it is real. Such awareness shines forth without fear, beyond words and thought, is calm and unwavering, equanimous, and full of light.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=110}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar27&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n85/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 27-29 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; This inner contactless concentration (Asparsha yoga) is difficult for most including the [[yogis]], who see fear in what is fearlessly blissful.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=110}}{{Refn|group=note|Adi Shankara interprets this Karika somewhat differently, according to Comans.{{Sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=166}}}} Such is the awareness that comes from self-reflection, understanding, giving up attachment to ''Dukkha'' (frustration) and ''Sukha'' (pleasure), where the mind rests in indescribable calmness within.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=110}}&lt;ref name=karmarkar29&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n85/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 29-31 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|दुःखं सर्वमनुस्मृत्य कामभोगान्निवर्तयेत् । अजं सर्वमनुस्मृत्य जातं नैव तु पश्यति ॥ ४३ ॥(...)&lt;br&gt;नाऽऽस्वादयेत्सुखं तत्र निःसङ्गः प्रज्ञया भवेत् । निश्चलं निश्चरच्चित्तमेकीकुर्यात्प्रयत्नतः ॥ ४५ ॥(...)&lt;br&gt;स्वस्थं शान्तं सनिर्वाणमकथ्यं सुखमुत्तमम् । अजमजेन ज्ञेयेन सर्वज्ञं परिचक्षते ॥ ४७ ॥&lt;ref name=karmarkar29/&gt;}}

====Chapter Four: The Peace of The Firebrand (Alatasanti)====
The last chapter of ''Gaudapada Karika'' has a different style than the first three, and it opens by expressing reverence for all "the greatest of men", who are like the cosmic space through their awareness of nonduality, free from self-contradictions and confusion, and who understand [[Dharma]].{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=110}} Karikas 3–10 repeat some content from previous chapters, but with some word substitutions.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=111}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n89/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 32-33 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Karikas 11–13 quote the key duality premise of [[Samkhya]] school of Hindu philosophy, cross examines it, then asks how and why is cause eternal? The text states that the Samkhya premise "cause is born as its effect" leads to infinite regress, which is not persuasive.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=111}}

''Gaudapada Karika'' then acknowledges the theory of [[Ajativada]] or non-origination of the ''Buddhas'' (Buddhists).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=111}} Like Samkhya premise, the text praises and cross examines it, in three ways: first, non-origination premises makes sense when neither the point of origin nor the end of something is known, but we know the point of origin of any example of something produced and there ''Ajativada'' premise does not follow; secondly, the ''Ajativada'' premise commits the ''Sadhyasama'' fallacy of reasoning by offering examples of what is yet to be proved.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=111}} Thirdly, state Karikas 29–41, neither [[samsara]] nor [[moksha|mukti]] has a beginning or end, because if something is born it must have an end, and something that is unborn has no end.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=112}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n97/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 39-41 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Karikas 45–52 state that  only (''Vijnana'') consciousness is real, explaining it with an example of fire stick before and during the time it burns, and adding we construct and deconstruct our state of awareness.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=112}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n101/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 43-44 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Karikas 53–56 assert that there is no causation, no effects, and repeats that consciousness is the only one real thing.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|pp=112-113}} Everything is [[impermanence|impermanent]], nothing is eternal and everything is also without origination by nature, state Karikas 57–60.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=113}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n103/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 45-46 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Karikas 61–81 repeat text on four states from earlier chapters to re-emphasize the premises about impermanence and non-origination.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=113}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n105/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 47-52 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment to unreality causes desire, sorrow (Dukkha) and fear, while detachment leads to freeing from such states and to ''samadhi''.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=113}} There are three stages of understanding state Karikas 87–89: ''Laukika'' (ordinary. which cognizes object and subject as real), ''Shuddha laukika'' (purified ordinary, perceiving is considered real but not the objects) and ''Lokottara'' (supramundane, where neither objects nor perceiving are cognized as real).{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=113}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n111/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 53-54 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Karikas 90–100 presents ''Agrayana'' (vehicle) to knowing. The text states, "all dharmas are without beginning, without variety, and are consciousness only".{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=113}} Duality is for the unwise, nonduality and undifferentiated Reality is for the wise and difficult to grasp. The last ''Karikas'' of the Chapter Four add, translates Karl Potter, "this the ''Buddhas'' understand, the Buddha instructs us that consciousness does not reach the dharmas, yet the Buddha said nothing about either consciousness or dharmas!"{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=114}}&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n113/mode/2up Gaudapada Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 55-56 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Buddhism===
The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}{{Sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=2}}

One school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]]{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}}{{refn|group=note|It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only''.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}} and "that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation, which is the structure of Māyā".{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=126, 143-144}}{{refn|group=note|1. Something is. 2. It is not. 3. It both is and is not. 4. It neither is nor is not.{{sfn|Garfield|Priest|2003}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}} The 'four-cornered negation' is an English gloss of the Sanskrit, [[Catuṣkoṭi|Chatushkoti]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}}} Gaudapada "wove [both doctrines] into the philosophy of ''Mandukaya Upanisad'', which was further developed by Shankara".{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177-178}}{{refn|group=note|The influence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the [[Visuddhimagga]] – a Theravada Buddhist tradition, contains "some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the [[Yogacara|Yogacarins]]".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206}}}}

Of particular interest is Chapter Four, in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and the term ''Asparsayoga'' is borrowed from Buddhism.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} According to Murti, "the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Vedanta philosopher, is attempting an advaitic interpretation of Vedanta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them."&lt;ref name=trvmurti114&gt;TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-0-415-46118-4}}, pages 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; While the first three chapters discuss [[Brahman]] and Atman (soul, Self), Chapter Four doesn't. This, according to Murti,&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; may be because this was authored by someone else and not Gaudapada, a position shared by Richard King.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt; Further, state both Murti and King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt; According to Sarma, Chapter Four may well have been written by Gaudapada assuming he was fully conversant with Mahayana school's teachings, yet "to mistake him to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd".{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=145-147}} The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti:&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;

{{Quote|
We have been talking of borrowing, influence and relationship in rather general terms. It is necessary to define the possible nature of the borrowing, granting that it did take place. (...) The Vedantins stake everything on the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Brahman) and accept the authority of the Upanishads. We have pointed out at length the [[Anatta|Nairatmya]] standpoint of Buddhism and its total opposition to the Atman (soul, substance, the permanent and universal) in any form.

Advaitins particularly have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}

==Other works by Gaudapadacharya==
A number of additional works are attributed to Gaudapada, but their authenticity is uncertain.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=104}} The attributed works are:{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=104}}{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=311}}

* ''Sri Vidyaratna Sutra'' bhasya
* ''Subhagodaya on Sri Vidya''
* ''Uttara Gita Bhashya''

Gaudapada is also credited with a commentary on ''Samkhyakarikas''. According to Potter, the naive nature of this commentary is in sharp contrast to the depth of reflection in ''Gaudapada Karikas'', and the commentary on ''Samkhyakarikas'' is unlikely to be one by Gaudapada.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=104}}

'''Grower Champagnes''' are those   [[Champagne]]s  that are produced by the same estate that owns the vineyards where the grapes are grown. ''Récoltant-Manipulant'' is the term in [[French language|French]], and Grower Champagnes can be identified by  "RM"  on the [[wine label]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 170-172"&gt;T. Stevenson, ed. ''The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition)'' pg 170-172 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7513-3740-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While large [[Champagne house]]s, such as [[Mumm]],  [[Moët et Chandon]], [[Veuve Clicquot]] and others may use grapes sourced from as many as 80 different vineyards in the [[Champagne region]] to create a consistent house style, Grower Champagnes tend to be more ''[[terroir]]''-focused, being sourced from a single vineyard or closely located vineyards around a village, and made with grapes which vary with each vintage.&lt;ref name="Pitcher"&gt;S. Pitcher, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/12/16/WIG49ABV121.DTL&amp;type=wine Grower-made Champagnes are an elegant alternative to big-house bubblies] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', December 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are over 19,000 independent growers in the Champagne region,{{fact|date=January 2018}} accounting for nearly 88% of all vineyard land in the region; around 5,000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes.{{fact|date=January 2018}} Of the Champagne imported into the US in 2014, only 5%  was grower Champagne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winefolly.com/review/grower-champagne-guide/ Getting into Grower Champagne] [[Wine Folly]], December 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wine styles==
Grower Champagnes have been described as "[[artisanal]] [[winemaking]]" with ''terroir'' being at the forefront for each wine,&lt;ref name="Pitcher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;A. Cortese, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/business/yourmoney/23bubbly.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;ex=1198645200&amp;en=53e3b0b2a49502b8&amp;ei=5087%0A Champagne Beyond the Big Names] ''[[New York Times]]'', December 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an emphasis on a consistent "house style" that can be made year after year.&lt;ref name="Gregutt"&gt;P. Gregutt ''"[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2004082996_pacificptaste23.html Bottling Their Own]"'' Seattle Times, December 23rd 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While large [[Champagne houses]], such as [[Moët et Chandon]] may source grapes from the entire [[Champagne region]], the vineyards owned by a Grower Champagne maker are generally clustered around a single village. Some growers will craft their wine to reflect the ''terroir'' of that village, especially if they own vineyards in one of [[Champagne's Grand crus]]. Grower Champagnes are often released younger than their large house counterparts due, in part, to the greater financial resources that would be needed for long term [[aging (wine)|aging]] and storage.&lt;ref name="Pitcher"/&gt; Many also show a lower [[dosage (wine)|dosage]], and occasionally no dosage at all, than most negociant manipulant bottlings.

==RM Champagne producers==
Producers of RM Champagne include [[Tarlant]], [[Chartogne-Taillet]], [[David Léclapart]], [[Benoît Lahaye]], [[Roses de Jeanne]], [[Marie-Courtin]], [[Vilmart &amp; Cie]], [[Pierre Péters]], [[Agrapart &amp; Fils]], and 
[[Marc Hébrart]].&lt;ref name="10 top"&gt;[http://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews-tastings/10-top-grower-champagnes-to-try-270410/ 10 top grower Champagnes to try: Champagne resident and expert Peter Liem picks out 10 top grower Champagnes to try] [[decanter.com]]  August 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent vintages==
The 2011 vintage saw difficult conditions which created uneven wines.&lt;ref name="10 top" /&gt; The 2009 vintage  was warm enough to ripen the fruit, resulting full, fruity Champagnes.&lt;ref name="10 top" /&gt; 2008 was an outstanding vintage, showing both high ripeness and high acidity.&lt;ref name="10 top" /&gt;

==Sales market==
[[File:Champagne Blanc de Blancs 1er Cru Naveau.jpg|thumb|Champagne Blanc de Blancs 1er Cru Naveau]]
The popularity of Grower Champagne is a relatively recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bonne"&gt;J. Bonne ''"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/11/WI9B14K51T.DTL  The Chronicle Wine Selections: Grower Champagne]"'' San Francisco Chronicle, December 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 18th century, Champagne houses have dominated the business dynamic in the region. These private houses or ''[[negociant]]s'' would buy grapes from the owners of several vineyards to blend and make Champagne.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 330-341"&gt;H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 330-341 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, there were over 3,700 brands of Grower Champagnes available for purchase within [[France]] but only around 130 brands in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Pitcher"/&gt;  As of 2008, these wines accounted for less than 3% of Champagne market, with that market growing as the wines continue to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name="Bonne"/&gt; Distributors and wine retailers tend to tout the comparative value and lower cost of Grower Champagnes versus the wines of larger Champagne houses, due to the larger Champagne houses' costs of mass market advertising.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; The smaller Growers leave it up to the importer and wine retailer to market their wines.&lt;ref name="Pitcher"/&gt;

==Criticism==
A common criticism of Grower Champagnes is the potential for variable quality,&lt;ref name="Bonne"/&gt; especially from [[vintage]] to vintage. While the larger Champagne houses and ''negociants'' have the flexibility to buy grapes from all over the Champagne region, Grower Champagne makers are limited to only their vineyard holdings. Conversely, advocates of Grower Champagnes say that the blending of many ''[[terroir]]s'' by the larger houses makes those wines "underflavored" and non-distinctive.&lt;ref name="Gregutt"/&gt;

==Vineyard lands==
There are over 19,000 independent growers in the Champagne region, accounting for nearly 88% of all vineyard land in the region. Around 5000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes. The larger Champagne houses have holdings in only 12% of the region's vineyards, making it a necessity for them to buy grapes from independent growers.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 170-172"/&gt; Under current ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) regulations, there are strict limitations on planting. Some growers are seeing an economic advantage in making wine from their own grapes, especially if they have land in one of Champagne's Grand cru villages, rather than selling them to the larger houses where they become part of a generic blend.&lt;ref name="Gregutt"/&gt;

==Identifying Champagnes==
[[File:Blanc de blanc grand Cru champagne.jpg|right|thumb|A Grand Cru grower Champagne with the "RM" visible on the lower right corner.]]
Champagnes can be identified by the initials that appear before a number on the wine label. The initials most commonly associated with Grower Champagnes is '''RM''' (meaning ''Récoltant-Manipulant'') but there are other initials that may appear on the label. 

Other initials:&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 170-172"/&gt;
*The initials '''NM''' (meaning ''Négociant-Manipulant'') appear on the labels of large Champagne houses that source the majority of their grapes rather than growing them.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 170-172"/&gt;
*'''CM''' (meaning ''Coopérative-Manipulant'') is a [[co-operative]] of growers who blend the product of their collective vineyards to sell under one or more brands. In this situation the individual grower may have some involvement in the winemaking process.
*'''RC''' (meaning ''Récoltant-Coopérateur'') is a wine sourced from a single grower but made entirely for him by a co-operative winemaking facility. While the wine is sold under the grower's own brand, he will often have had very little if any involvement in the winemaking process.
*'''SR''' (meaning ''Société de Récoltants'') is a registered firm set up by two or more growers who share the same winery which they use to make wine to sell under their own label. This designation differs from a CM in that the growers almost always have significant involvement in the winemaking process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5097">'''Interpreting notes''' are used by some [[Language interpretation|interpreters]], who re-express oral communications (such as [[Public speaking|speeches]]) in whole or in part. Such notes may be used when the interpreter is working in "[[Language interpretation#Consecutive|consecutive mode]]."

Interpreting notes are not part of any conventional graphic system, and practitioners are free to develop their own techniques. However, some basic rules facilitate the recording of details in order to aid the interpreter in coping with large amounts of information.

==Theory==
The purpose of interpreting notes is not to [[wikt:transcribe|transcribe]] the [[Public speaking|speech]] verbatim. Interpreting notes are not a form of [[shorthand]]. Their purpose is to write minimal notes which will, at a quick glance, elicit in the interpreter's mind the intent of an oral communication so that it can be re-expressed in a different language.

It is not appropriate to document a speech in [[shorthand]], as this would result in task duplication.

==Practice==
[[Image:Interpreting notes.JPG|thumb|250px|Typical interpreting notes.]]
The interpreter should listen with utmost concentration to the speaker and write only the information which he judges sufficient to render the meaning. Numbers, names, and the [[title]]s of persons must be retained in the interpretation.

Interpreting notes are typically written in a [[notebook]] with each note being separated from the others by a horizontal line. After interpreting a sentence with the aid of a note, some interpreters might make a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] over it, if they have the time. This has an important psychological effect — it is similar to erasing data on a computer. Others might consider it too time-consuming to do so when a fast pace of interpretation is required or they might think that it detracts from the pace of their delivery. 

The interpreter is required to decipher his notes and to re-express their content in the target language. Following analysis of the speech, the interpreter may write the information in [[Abstract (summary)|abstract form]].

===Ideograms===
[[Ideogram]]s are an important tool used by interpreters. For example, the letter “E” laid on its side (like the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[Sha (Cyrillic)|''sha'', Ш]]) may represent Europe. Then one can specify whether eastern, western, or central Europe is meant by slashing the relevant upward leg. A horizontal bar with two vertical bars beneath it might represent a table, which would indicate a meeting or a conference.  A bracket before an action indicates that the action will take place in the future, and vice versa.

These ideograms are linked by a system of arrows and brackets that show the structure of a sentence that is to be interpreted. Using this system, one can note, for instance, that a sum has increased or decreased by a certain percentage (according to the arrow’s direction).

For example, the notes in the illustration might be interpreted to mean : 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are particularly glad to inform you about an important increase in our company’s revenues, which rose by 10 percent from 3.5 to 3.85 billion dollars.(*) This derives from huge sales of helicopters. The United States of America bought 50 and South Africa 20 of them. On the other hand, we must relocate parts of our production in these countries.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (bn) is called a milliard (mrd or Md) in most languages.)*&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Some interpreters have devised complete systems of abbreviations, which include all academic titles, administrative titles, military ranks, etc. Such a system has the drawback that, like shorthand, it may be useful only for a particular language.

Some think that he's one of the pioneers of his generation and stands among the nation's most talented poets and novelists.

Other Occitan analysts say that he had a very negative impact over the occitanist movement during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s. Particularly, his anti-scholar positions led to the split of the [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans|IEO]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robèrt Lafont|LAFONT Robèrt]] (1979) ''Nani Monsur'', Valdériès: Vent Terral.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robèrt Lafont|LAFONT Robèrt]] (1991) ''Temps tres'', coll.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Jaesusaeng''' ({{Korean|hangul=재수생|hanja={{linktext|再|修|生}}|lit="restudy student"}}) is a [[Korean language|Korean]] term for [[high school]] students who decide to spend a year studying to re-take the [[College Scholastic Ability Test]], hoping to get a higher score and enter the university of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent term in [[Education in Japan|Japan]] is ''[[Rōnin (student)|rōnin]]''.

== Social context ==
Gaining entrance to the extremely competitive and prestigious [[SKY (universities)|SKY universities]] in [[Seoul]] requires that some students become ''jaesusaeng'' after an initial less-than-stellar performance on the [[College Scholastic Ability Test|national exam]]. Korea is "prepossessed by social status and reputation," and a SKY education is the main way to gain [[social status]].&lt;ref name="koreatimes Goh-Grapes"&gt;{{cite news  
| last=  Goh-Grapes
| first=  Agnes

| publisher=  [[Korea Times]]
| date=   2009-02-22
| accessdate= 28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Generally, the public education system is not enough to prepare students for the exam, so most students attend after school lessons at various ''[[hagwon]]'' ([[cram school]]s). The fierce competition for enrollment at prestigious universities is called "entrance exam war" ({{korean|labels=no|hangul=입시전쟁|hanja={{linktext|入|試|戰|爭}}|rr=ipsi jeonjaeng}}). 

==Effects==
The [[stress (biological)|stress]] from constant study and limited [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]] as a student have contributed to an increase in [[suicide in South Korea]]; for children aged 10 to 19 years old, suicide is the second most common cause of death in the country.&lt;ref name="koreatimes Goh-Grapes" /&gt;

==Related term==
When a student fails to earn an adequate score over 3 or more years, he may be derisively referred to as a ''jangsusaeng'' ({{korean|labels=no|hangul=장수생|hanja={{linktext|長|壽|生}}|lit=literally "long life student"}}) a [[Pun|play on words]] from the expression "Please live a long life" said to elders (장수 하세요). However, since 2010, the word "N susaeng" ({{korean|labels=no|hangul=엔수생|hanja=N壽生}}) is in common use. Although the definition of the word and the use of it is identical to the formerly used vocabulary, the Chinese character ''jang'' (長, meaning "long") is replaced with the Latin letter 'N', which stands for the undefined number of time the student is taking the test.

The term '''jay driver''' originated to refer to carriage drivers who drove on the incorrect side of the road. While the term may generally refer to an individual operating a vehicle in a manner not consistent with traffic laws, it was used more specifically to individuals who drive a vehicle on the incorrect side of the road. [[Merriam-Webster]] indicates that the first known use of the term is by ''The Junction City Union'' newspaper on June 28, 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-is-it-called-jaywalking|title=Why is it called Jay-Walking|last=|first=|date=|website=Merriam-Webster|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to "jaywalker"==
Most sources indicate that the term "jay driver" came before "[[jaywalker]]" there being numerous article headlines from 1905 through the next decade that include the term "Jay Driver." Peter Norton's book ''Fighting Traffic'' on 78  indicates that in 1922 use of the term "jay driver" was an attempt by George A. Davies to use the known meaning of "jay walker" and apply it to drivers of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norton |first1=Peter D |title=Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City |date=2008-04-18 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262141000 |pages=409 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/fighting-traffic |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an opinion piece attributed to "A MAN BOOSTER" from the January 17, 1907 ''Salt Lake Telegram'' titled "Oh yes, there's the 'Jay Driver'" describes in it both jay walkers and jay drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=19031446|title=Oh, Yes, There's the "Jay Driver"|last=|first=|date=1907-01-17|work=Salt Lake Telegram|accessdate=10 August 2018|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another article from November 11, 1919 in ''The Pittsburgh Gazette Times'' cites from the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' the text: "There are so many jay walkers and so many jay drivers that it hardly behooves any driver to talk about jay walkers, or any walkjer to mention jay drivers," clearly demonstrating that the term existed prior to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1856231446?pq-origsite=summon|title=[untitled]|last=|first=|date=1919-11-11|work=The Pittsburgh Gazette Times|accessdate=10 August 2018|publisher=|issue=vol-134, iss-106|page=6|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
A 1939 instructional video overdubbed by the voice of an official from a British agency indicates that the term was not isolated to the United States. Titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peIZtd-ZJ8M School For Jay-Drivers!] the video provides an example of a motorcycle rider in Vienna failing to give the proper signal who is then required to attend a Sunday morning class in which an instructor explains what he did incorrectly and what the rules indicate he should have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School for Jay Drivers! |url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/school-for-jay-drivers |website=British Pathe |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007-11-24 camacho.JPG|thumb|Jorge Camacho in 2007]]
'''Jorge Camacho Cordón''' (born 18 November 1966, [[Zafra]]) is a writer in [[Esperanto]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

Camacho was born in [[Zafra]], [[Spain]] and learned Esperanto in 1980. He was a member of the Academy of Esperanto from 1992 until 2001. Since 1995 he has worked in [[Brussels]] as an interpreter for the [[European Union]] from [[English language|English]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] into Spanish.

Camacho was elected to the [[Academy of Esperanto]] in 1992, but on 15 August 2001 he announced his resignation due to disappointment with the Esperanto movement. However, he remains active in Esperanto and continues to review literary works.

== Works ==
Camacho became famous for his poems and short stories in the late 1980s, for which he received several prizes in the ''Belartaj Konkursoj de UEA''. In 1992 he won the [[Grabowski Prize]], a prize for young authors writing in Esperanto. The prize is named after [[Antoni Grabowski]].

Camacho was in the early 1990s considered a member of the so-called ''Ibera Skolo'' ("Iberian School") of Esperanto writers along with three other inhabitants of the [[Iberian peninsula]].

In the 1990s, Camacho began to publicly oppose [[Giorgio Silfer]] for his interpretation of the political view "[[Raumism]]". He wrote ''La Majstro kaj Martinelli'' ("The Master and Martinelli"), a biting satire of Silfer (inspired by [[The Master and Margarita|the similarly titled novel]] of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]), and criticised his ideology in ''La liturgio de la foiro'' ("The Liturgy of the Fair").

=== Poetry ===
* ''Ibere libere'' (with [[Miguel Fernández (poet)|Miguel Fernández]], [[Gonçalo Neves]] and [[Liven Dek]], pseudonym of Miguel Gutiérrez, 1993)
* ''Celakantoj'' (''Coelacanths''; poems written in Esperanto c. 1989-1995, 2004)
* ''Saturno'' (''Saturn''; bilingual collection of poems written both in Spanish and Esperanto c. 1995-2004, 2004)
* ''Eklipsas'' (''[It] eclipses''; collection of poems written mainly in Esperanto 2004-2006, with translations into Spanish, 2007)
* ''Koploj kaj filandroj'' (poems written in Esperanto, 2009)

== Editorial work ==
Until December 2014 Jorge Camacho was editor-in-chief of the literary almanac ''[[Beletra Almanako]]'', which was first issued in the autumn of 2007.

The [[Marathi language]] has a long history of literature and culture. The first Marathi newspaper, ''Darpan'', was started on 6 January 1832 by [[Balshastri Jambhekar]]. The paper was bilingual fortnightly also published in English as ''The Bombay Darpan'' and stopped publishing in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBU6pN7toHsC&amp;pg=PA57 | title=Mass Communication In India: A Sociological Perspective | publisher=Sage | author=J V Vilanilam | year=2005 | pages=57 | isbn=9780761933724 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kidambi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2O76-0buuUC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Darpan+marathi+newspaper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB7oXMxeLJAhVRTo4KHWQ2Bd4Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Darpan%20marathi%20newspaper&amp;f=false | title=The Making of an Indian Metropolis: Colonial Governance and Public Culture in Bombay, 1890-1920 | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Prashant Kidambi | year=2007 | pages=165, 172 | isbn=9780754656128 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1881 by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], the daily ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'' was a prominent newspaper of the pre-Independence era with a large readership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54765">The '''Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set''' ('''LMBCS''') is a proprietary [[Multi Byte Character Set|multi-byte]] [[character encoding]] originally conceived in 1988 at [[Lotus Development Corporation]] with input from Bob Balaban and others.&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; Created around the same time and addressing some of the same problems, LMBCS could be viewed as parallel development and possible alternative to [[Unicode]].&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; For maximum compatibility, later issues of LMBCS incorporate [[UTF-16]] as a subset.&lt;ref name="IBM_CDRA_LMBCS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherer_2000" /&gt;

Commercially, LMBCS was first introduced as the default character set of [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3]] for [[DOS]] in March 1989&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lotus_1989_Compatibility" /&gt; and [[Lotus 1-2-3/G Release 1]] for [[OS/2]]&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; in 1990 replacing the 8-bit [[Lotus International Character Set]] (LICS) and [[ASCII]] used in earlier DOS-only versions of Lotus 1-2-3 and [[Lotus Symphony (DOS)|Symphony]].&lt;ref name="Kamenz_1992_DB" /&gt; LMBCS is also used in [[IBM]]/[[Lotus Corporation|Lotus]] [[Lotus SmartSuite|SmartSuite]], [[Lotus Notes|Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino|Domino]],&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; as well as in a number of third-party products.

LMBCS encodes the characters required for languages using the [[Latin script|Latin]],&lt;ref name="Lotus_2000_Inside" /&gt; [[Arabic script|Arabic]], [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]], [[Greek script|Greek]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]&lt;ref name="Lotus_2000_Inside" /&gt; scripts, the [[Thai script|Thai]], [[Chinese writing system|Chinese]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]]&lt;ref name="Lotus_2000_Inside" /&gt; and [[Korean writing system|Korean]] writing systems, and technical symbols.

== {{anchor|Canonical|Compressed|1|2|3|4|5|6|8|11|16|17|18|19}}Encodings ==
Technically, LMBCS is a [[lead byte|lead-byte]] encoding where code point 00&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; as well as code points 20&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; (32) to 7F&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; (127) are identical to [[ASCII]]&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; (as well as to LICS).&lt;ref name="Kamenz_1992_DB" /&gt;

Code point 00&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; is always treated as [[NUL character]] to ensure maximum code compatibility with existing software libraries dealing with [[null-terminated string]]s&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; in many programming languages such as [[C (language)|C]].&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_C" /&gt;

Code points 01&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; to 1F&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;, which serve as control codes in ASCII, are used as lead bytes to switch the definition of code points above 7F&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; between several ''code groups'' (similar to [[code page]]s) and at the same time determine either a single- or multi-byte nature for the corresponding code group.&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt;

For example, code group 1 (with group byte 01&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; is almost identical to the [[SBCS]] [[code page 850]], whereas code group 16 (with group byte 10&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; is similar to the Japanese [[MBCS (encoding)|MBCS]] [[Code page 932 (IBM)|code page 932]]. Multi-byte characters can thus occupy two or three bytes.&lt;ref name="IBM_2016_UCNV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lotus_2000_Inside" /&gt;

In '''canonical LMBCS''', each character starts with its group byte.&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt;
To reduce the length, in '''optimized''' or '''compressed LMBCS''' a ''default code group'' or ''optimization group code'' can be defined on a per application or process basis (ideally chosen according to the highest likelihood of occurrence)&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; and must be communicated to the interpreting code in some way (f.e. by specifying the corresponding "LMBCS-''n''" name).&lt;ref name="Batutis_2001_ICU" /&gt; Thereby, the group byte can be omitted for these characters.&lt;ref name="Balaban_2001_LMBCS" /&gt; Lotus 1-2-3 retrieves the optimization group code from the file header of the corresponding source file,&lt;ref name="IBM_2016_UCNV" /&gt; whereas for Lotus Notes the optimization group code is fixed to be always 01&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="IBM_CDRA_LMBCS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM_2016_UCNV" /&gt;

The '''McConnell–Laubach orthography''' is the revised form of a previously proposed [[Orthography|orthographic system]] for [[Haitian Creole]]. It was first developed by Ormonde McConnell in 1940, and then later revised by him and Frank Laubach in 1943.&lt;ref name = S&amp;D&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schiefelin |first1=B. B. |last2=Doucet |first2=R. C. |date=February 1994 |title=The 'real' Haitian Creole: ideology, metalinguistics, and orthographic choice |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=176–200 |doi=10.1525/ae.1994.21.1.02a00090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===McConnell===
In 1940, a Protestant missionary by the name of [[Ormonde McConnell]] developed and proposed the first widely recognized [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] system of writing for the Haitian Creole language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Déjean |first=Y. |year=1980 |title=Comment écire le créole d'Haïti Québec |publisher=Collectif Paroles |oclc=123192539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to McConnell's attempt at creating a system of orthography, however, the Haitian diplomat [[Georges Sylvain]] had developed a small number of materials for the French-Haitian Creole bilingual elites, from his own French-based system of writing. Because it was largely unavailable to the masses, McConnell determined to create a system everyone could use.&lt;ref name = Albert&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valdman |first1=Albert |last2=Foster |first2=Charles Robert |last3=Hartford |first3=Beverly |year=1982 |title=Issues in international bilingual education: the role of the vernacular |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-40998-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This original writing system contained 33 symbols:

Oral Vowels:       a, è, é, i, o, ò, u

Nasal Vowels:    â, ê, ô

Semi-Vowels:     i/y, w, u

Consonants:      b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z

Digraphs:            sh, gn &lt;ref name = S&amp;D /&gt;

===McConnell-Laubach===
[[Frank Laubach]] was not a speaker of Creole, though he was an expert in American literacy. In 1943, he helped McConnell to revise his orthographic system, which resulted in what's known as the McConnell–Laubach Orthography. This contained two major changes: /ou/ instead of /u/, as in ''dou'' (''Eng.'' 'gentle'), and /ch/ instead of /sh/, as in ''chante'' (''Eng.'' 'to sing').&lt;ref name = S&amp;D /&gt;

==Criticisms of the McConnell-Laubach system==

=== Charles Pressoir ===
The greatest opponent to this new orthography was a Haitian scholar named [[Charles Pressoir]]. He, along with a number of Haitian intellectuals, claimed that the use of "[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]" letters in Haitian orthography looked "too American" and reminded the people of Haiti of the recent [[United States occupation of Haiti|American occupation]]. More linguistically, he also heavily criticized the lack of [[Front rounded vowel|front-rounded vowels]], and was concerned that the method of transcribing nasal vowels could make it difficult for Haitians to learn French; something that he attributed to McConnell and Laubach's unfamiliarity with the French language and [[French orthography|orthography]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;D" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pressoir"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pressoir |first=C. F. |year=1947 |title=Débat sur le créole et le folklore |location=Port-au-Prince |publisher=Imprimerie de l'Etat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Pressoir and L. Faublas, the Haitian minister of education, responded with their own revised version of the McConnell–Laubach orthography, making several substantial changes in favor of "Frenchifying" the writing system. This was the [[Faublas-Pressoir]] system, and later called 'alphabet ONAAC' when it was adopted by the Haitian government.&lt;ref name="Albert" /&gt;

=== Political and cultural tensions ===
The backlash against the proposed McConnell-Laubach system was, at its heart, a fight for the cultural identity of Haiti. While the McConnell–Laubach orthography was an uncomfortable reminder of the American/Protestant occupation, Pressoir's alternative was a return to French control.&lt;ref name="Albert" /&gt; 
Some years after the Faublas-Pressoir system was developed, however, a group of French Linguists from the [[University of Paris]] developed yet another orthography, adopted by the Institut Pédagogique National (IPN), that was more consistent than its predecessors and seen as a better representation of the language. In 1979, the IPN orthography was declared the official orthography of Haitian Creole.&lt;ref name = Albert /&gt;

'''Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing''' was a writing system and memory aid used by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], a [[First Nations]] people of the east coast of Canada.

The missionary-era glyphs were [[logogram]]s, with phonetic elements used alongside (Schmidt &amp; Marshall 1995), which included [[logograph]]ic, [[alphabet]]ic, and [[ideogram|ideographic]] information.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} They were derived from a [[pictograph]] and [[petroglyph]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Brandan Frederick R. ''Paper Talk: A History of Libraries, Print Culture, and Aboriginal Peoples in Canada before 1960''. Toronto: The Scarecrow Press, Inc. 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5113-9}} p.11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7MnFLVRdOk4C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=Paper+Talk:+A+history+of+libraries,+print+culture,+and+Aboriginal+peoples+in+Canada+before+1960&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5-MTEYgJXb&amp;sig=lOZ9gC5cDCHgoGiE0BppPkl_W6Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lp25TPGdD9So4Ab9uomZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pictograph&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In Mi'kmaq the glyphs are called ''komqwejwi'kasikl,'' or "sucker-fish writings", which refers to the tracks the [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] leaves on the muddy river bottom.

==Classification==
Scholars have debated whether the earliest known Mi'kmaq "hieroglyphs" from the 17th century qualified fully as a [[writing system]], rather than as a [[pictograph]]ic [[mnemonic]] device. In the 17th century, French missionary [[Chrétien Le Clercq]] adapted the Míkmaq characters as a logographic system for [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] purposes.

In 1978, [[Ives Goddard]] and William Fitzhugh of the Department of [[Anthropology]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], contended that the pre-missionary system was purely mnemonic, as it could not be used to write new compositions. Schmidt and Marshall argued in 1995 that the missionary system of the 17th century was able to serve as a fully functional writing system. This would mean that Mi'kmaq is the oldest writing system for a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native language]] north of Mexico.

==History==
Father Le Clercq, a [[Roman Catholic]] missionary on the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] in New France from 1675, claimed that he had seen some Míkmaq children 'writing' [[birch bark document|symbols on birchbark]] as a memory aid. This was sometimes done by pressing porcupine quills directly into the bark in the shape of symbols. Le Clercq adapted those symbols to writing prayers, developing new symbols as necessary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

This adapted writing system proved popular among Mi'kmaq, and was still in use in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Since there is no historical or archaeological evidence of these symbols from before the arrival of this missionary, it is unclear how ancient the use of the mnemonic glyphs was. The relationship of these symbols with Mi'kmaq [[petroglyph]]s is also unclear.

[[Pierre Maillard]], Roman Catholic priest, during the winter of 1737–38&lt;ref name="DCB"&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Micheline D. |last=Johnson |title=Maillard, Pierre |volume=3 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/maillard_pierre_3E.html |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; perfected a system of [[hieroglyphics]] to transcribe Mi'kmaq words.  He used these symbols to write formulas for the principal prayers and the responses of the faithful, in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|catechism]], so his followers might learn them more readily. There is no direct evidence that Maillard was aware of Le Clercq's work; in any event Maillard's work is outstanding in that he left numerous works in the language, which continued in use among the Mi'kmaq into the 20th century.

An unknown number of birch scrolls containing mi'kmaq writings were destroyed by missionaries in New England, before the writing system was adapted to aid conversion of community members to Christianity.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

'''Montenegrin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɒ|n|t|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|ɡ|r|ᵻ|n}}; {{lang|cnr-Cyrl|црногорски}} / {{lang|cnr-Latn|crnogorski}}) is the [[variety (linguistics)#Standard varieties|normative variety]] of the [[Serbo-Croatian]] language mainly used by [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] and the official language of [[Montenegro]]. Montenegrin is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]], more specifically on [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]], which is also the basis of Standard [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Serbian_Croatian_Bosnian_or_Montenegrin_Many_In_Balkans_Just_Call_It_Our_Language_/1497105.html Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Or Montenegrin? Or Just 'Our Language'?], ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'', February 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Montenegro's language has historically and traditionally been called Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Roland Sussex]], Paul Cubberly, ''The Slavic Languages'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2006; esp. v. pp. 73: "Serbia had used Serbian as an official language since 1814, and Montenegro even earlier.".&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Montenegrin standard language separate from [[Serbian language|Serbian]] appeared in the 1990s during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], through proponents of [[Montenegrin independence]] from Serbia. Montenegrin became the [[official language]] of Montenegro with the ratification of a new [[Constitution of Montenegro|constitution]] on 22 October 2007.

The Montenegrin standard is still emerging. Its [[orthography]] was established on 10 July 2009 with the addition of two letters to the [[Montenegrin alphabet|alphabet]]. Their usage remained controversial and they achieved only limited public acceptance, along with some proposed alternative spellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:456735-CG-Niko-nece-crnogorska-slova |title=CG: Niko neće crnogorska slova |publisher=[[Večernje Novosti]] |date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been used for official documents since 2009, but in February 2017, the [[Assembly of Montenegro]] removed them from any type of governmental documentation.&lt;ref name=Sputnik&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rs-lat.sputniknews.com/regioni/201702021109869979-crna-gora-skuptina-slova/ |title=Crnogorska skupština odustala od upotrebe slova ś i ź |publisher=Sputnik News Serbia |date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language standardization ==
In January 2008, the [[government of Montenegro]] formed the [[Council for the Codification of the Montenegrin Language]], which aims to standardize the Montenegrin language according to international norms. Proceeding documents will, after verification, become a part of the educational programme in Montenegrin schools.

The first Montenegrin standard was officially proposed in July 2009. In addition to the letters prescribed by the Serbo-Croatian standard, the proposal introduced two additional letters, {{angle bracket|ś}} and {{angle bracket|ź}}, to replace the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|sj}} and {{angle bracket|zj}}.&lt;ref name="crnogorski-dva-nova-slova"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwide.rs/vesti/53-dva-nova-slova-u-crnogorskom-pravopisu |title=Dva nova slova u crnogorskom pravopisu |publisher=Worldwide.rs |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education has accepted neither of the two drafts by the Council for the Standardization of the Montenegrin language, but instead adopted an alternate third one which was not a part of their work. The Council has criticized this act, saying it comes from "a small group" and that it contains an abundance of "methodological, conceptual and linguistic errors".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120804174002/http://www.mondo.rs/v2/tekst.php?vest=142385 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2010, the Council for General Education adopted the first ''Montenegrin Grammar''.

First written request for the assignment of international code was submitted to the technical committee ISO 639 in July 2008. Complete paperwork was forwarded to Washington in September 2015. After the long procedure, the request was finally approved on Friday, December 8, 2017 and [[ISO 639-2]] and [[ISO 639-3|-3]] code '''[cnr]''' was assigned to the Montenegrin language, effective December 21, 2017.&lt;ref name=iso6392 /&gt;&lt;ref name=iso6393 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senat.me/en/montenegrin-language-iso-code-cnr-approved/|title=Montenegrin language ISO code [cnr] assigned • SENAT.me - MeP|date=11 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official status and speakers' preference ==

[[File:MontenegroLanguage2011.PNG|thumb|left|Linguistic structure of Montenegro by settlements, 2011. Red is Montenegrin.]]

The language remains an ongoing issue in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8520466.stm |title=Montenegro embroiled in language row |accessdate=2010-03-01 |date=2010-02-19 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the previous census of 1991, the vast majority of Montenegrin citizens, 510,320 or 82.97%, declared themselves speakers of the then official language: [[Serbo-Croatian]]. The 1981 population census also recorded a Serbo-Croatian-speaking majority. However, in the first Communist censuses, the vast majority of the population declared Serbian their native language. Such is also the case with the first recorded population census in Montenegro in 1909, when approximately 95% of the population of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] declared Serbian their native language. According to the [[Constitution of Montenegro]], the official language of the republic since 1992 is [[Serbian language|Serbian of the Ijekavian standard]].

After [[World War II]] and until 1992, the official language of Montenegro was Serbo-Croatian. Before that, in the previous Montenegrin realm, the language in use was called Serbian. The [[Serbian language]] was the officially used language in Communist Montenegro until after the 1950 [[Novi Sad Agreement]],{{fact|date=May 2016}} and Serbo-Croatian was introduced into the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro in 1974. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, organizations promoting Montenegrin as a distinct language appeared only since 2004 when the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] regime introduced the term to usage. The new constitution, adopted on 19 October 2007, deemed Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro.

The most recent [[Demographic history of Montenegro|population census]] conducted in Montenegro was in 2011. According to it, 36.97% of the population (229,251) declared Montenegrin their native language, and 42.88% (265,895) declared Serbian their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/popis2011/saopstenje/saopstenje(1).pdf | title=Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Montenegro 2011 | work=Monstat | accessdate=July 12, 2011 | pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mijat Šuković]], a prominent Montenegrin lawyer, wrote a draft version of [[Constitution of Montenegro|the constitution]] which passed the parliament's constitutional committee. Šuković suggested Montenegrin as the official language of [[Montenegro]]. The [[Venice Commission]], an advisory body of the [[Council of Europe]], had a generally positive attitude towards the draft of the constitution but did not address the language and church issues, calling them symbolic. The new constitution was ratified on 19 October 2007, declaring Montenegrin as the official language of Montenegro, as well as recognising Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian.

The ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] stand for nothing but plainly renaming the country's official language into Montenegrin, meeting opposition from the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]], the [[People's Party (Montenegro)|People's Party]], the [[Democratic Serb Party]], the [[Bosniak Party of Montenegro|Bosniak Party]], the [[Movement for Changes]] as well as the [[Serb List (2006)|Serb List]] coalition led by the [[Serb People's Party (Montenegro)|Serb People's Party]]. However, a referendum was not needed, as a two-thirds majority of the parliament voted for the Constitution, including the [[Coalition for a European Montenegro|ruling coalition]], [[Movement for Changes]], the [[Bosniak Party|Bosniaks]] and the [[Liberal Party of Montenegro|Liberals]], while the pro-Serbian parties voted against it and the Albanian minority parties abstained from voting. The Constitution was ratified and adopted on 19 October 2007, recognizing Montenegrin as the official language of Montenegro.

According to a poll of 1,001 Montenegrin citizens conducted by [[Matica crnogorska]] in 2014, linguistic demographics were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pobjeda.me/2014/07/03/matica-crnogorska-crnogorskim-jezikom-govori-411-odsto-gradana-srpskim-391/#.VEJZhvmUca4 |title=Pobjeda |publisher=Pobjeda.me |date= |accessdate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022053115/http://www.pobjeda.me/2014/07/03/matica-crnogorska-crnogorskim-jezikom-govori-411-odsto-gradana-srpskim-391/ |archivedate=2014-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{flowlist|
* 41.1% Montenegrin
* 39.1% Serbian
* 12.3% Serbian, Montenegrin, Bosnian, Croatian and Serbo-Croatian are one and the same
* 3.9% Serbo-Croatian
* 1.9% Bosnian
* 1.7% Croatian}}

According to an early 2017 poll, 42.6% of Montenegro's citizens have opted for Serbian as the name of their native language, while 37.9% for Montenegrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/u-crnoj-gori-za-sfrj-zali-63-odsto-gradana-928817|title=U Crnoj Gori za SFRJ žali 63 odsto građana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Note that not only Montenegrins by ethnicity declare Montenegrin as their native language. According to the 2011 census, other ethnic groups in Montenegro have also declared their language Montenegrin by a certain percentage. Most openly, Matica Muslimanska called on [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]] living in Montenegro to name their native language as Montenegrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102101253/http://www.maticamuslimanska.me/mcg/|title=MUSLIMANI CRNE GORE - MATICA MUSLIMANSKA CRNE GORE|date=2 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic considerations ==
[[File:Montenegrin dialects.jpg|thumb|left|Shtokavian subdialects in Montenegro.]]
Montenegrins speak [[Shtokavian]] subdialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]], some which are shared with the neighbouring Slavic nations:

* {{colorbox|#ffffb3}} [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] (in the west and northwest).

=== Montenegrin alphabet ===
{{Main|Montenegrin alphabet}}
The proponents of the separate Montenegrin language prefer using the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]] over the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]]. In both alphabets there are two additional letters (bold), which are easier to render in [[digital typography]] in the Latin alphabet due to their existence in [[Polish alphabet|Polish]], but which must be created ''ad hoc'' using [[combining character]]s when using Cyrillic.

=== Grammar ===
{{Main|Serbo-Croatian phonology|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}

== Literature ==
Many literary works of authors from [[Montenegro]] provide examples of the local Montenegrin vernacular. The medieval literature was mostly written in [[Old Church Slavonic]] and its [[recension]]s, but most of the 19th century works were written in some of the dialects of Montenegro. They include the folk literature collected by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] and other authors, as well as the books of writers from Montenegro such as [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Petar Petrović Njegoš]]'s ''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'' (''Gorski vijenac''), [[Marko Miljanov]]'s ''The Examples of Humanity and Bravery'' (''Primjeri čojstva i junaštva''), etc. In the second half of the 19th century and later, the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]], which served as a basis for the standard [[Serbo-Croatian]] language, was often used instead of the [[Shtokavian dialect#Zeta–South Raška|Zeta–South Raška dialect]] characteristic of most dialects of Montenegro. Petar Petrović Njegoš, one of the most respectable Montenegrin authors, changed many characteristics of the Zeta–South Raška dialect from the manuscript of his ''Gorski vijenac'' to those proposed by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić as a standard for the [[Serbian language]].

For example, most of the [[accusative]]s of place used in the Zeta–South Raška dialect were changed by Njegoš to the [[locative]]s used in the Serbian standard. Thus the stanzas ''"U dobro je lako dobar biti, / na muku se poznaju junaci"'' from the manuscript were changed to ''"U dobru je lako dobar biti, / na muci se poznaju junaci"'' in the printed version. Other works of later Montenegrin authors were also often modified to the East Herzegovinian forms in order to follow the Serbian language literary norm. However, some characteristics of the traditional Montenegrin Zeta–South Raška dialect sometimes appeared. For example, the poem ''[[Onamo namo]]'' by [[Nikola I Petrović Njegoš]], although it was written in the East Herzegovinian Serbian standard, contains several Zeta–South Raška forms: ''"Onamo namo, za brda ona"'' ([[accusative]], instead of [[instrumental case]] ''za brdima onim''), and ''"Onamo namo, da viđu'' (instead of ''vidim'') ''Prizren"'', and so on.

== Language politics ==
[[File:Original montenegrin language alphabet.gif|thumb|A proposed Montenegrin alphabet which contains three more letters than the Serbian counterpart — Ś, З and Ź]]
Most mainstream politicians and other proponents of the Montenegrin language state that the issue is chiefly one of self-determination and the people's right to call the language what they want, rather than an attempt to artificially create a new language when there is none. The Declaration of the [[Montenegrin PEN Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montenet.org/language/pen-decl.htm |title=Declaration of Montenegrin P.E.N. Centre |publisher=Montenet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the "''Montenegrin language does not mean a systemically separate language, but just one of four names (Montenegrin, Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) by which Montenegrins name their part of [the] Shtokavian system, commonly inherited with [[Bosniaks|Muslims]], Serbs and Croats''". The introduction of the Montenegrin language has been supported by other important academic institutions such as the [[Matica crnogorska]], although meeting opposition from the [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Some proponents go further. The chief proponent of Montenegrin is [[Zagreb]]-educated Dr. [[Vojislav Nikčević]], professor at the Department of Language and Literature at the [[University of Montenegro]] and the head of the [[Institute for Montenegrin Language]] in the capital Podgorica. His dictionaries and grammars were printed by Croatian publishers since the major Montenegrin publishing houses such as [[Obod]] in [[Cetinje]] opted for the official nomenclature specified in the Constitution (Serbian until 1974, Serbo-Croatian to 1992, Serbian until 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Pravopis crnogorskog jezika, Vojislav Nikčević. Crnogorski PEN Centar, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Nikčević advocates amending the Latin alphabet with three letters Ś, Ź, and З and corresponding Cyrillic letters С́, З́ and Ѕ (representing IPA {{IPAblink|ɕ}}, {{IPAblink|ʑ}} and {{IPAblink|dz}} respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montenet.org/language/letters.htm |title=Language: Montenegrin Alphabet |publisher=Montenet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents acknowledge that these sounds can be heard by many Montenegrin speakers, however, they do not form a language system and thus are [[allophone]]s rather than phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Politika]]: [http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/Crnogorci-dopisali-Vuka.sr.html Црногорци дописали Вука]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are speakers in Montenegro who do not utter them and speakers of Serbian and Croatian outside of Montenegro (notably in Herzegovina and Bosanska Krajina) who do. In addition, introduction of those letters could pose significant technical difficulties (the Eastern European character encoding [[ISO/IEC 8859-2]] does not contain the letter З, for example, and the corresponding letters were not proposed for Cyrillic).

Montenegro's current prime minister [[Milo Đukanović]] declared his open support for the formalization of the Montenegrin language by declaring himself as a speaker of Montenegrin in an October 2004 interview with Belgrade daily ''[[Politika]]''. Official Montenegrin government communiqués are given in ''English and Montenegrin'' on the government's webpage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.me/eng/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215000303/http://www.gov.me/eng/ |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the government of Montenegro changed the school curriculum so that the name of the mandatory classes teaching the language was changed from "Serbian language" to "Mother tongue (Serbian, Montenegrin, Croatian, Bosnian)". This change was made, according to the government, in order to better reflect the diversity of languages spoken among citizens in the republic and to protect human rights of non-Serb citizens in Montenegro who declare themselves as speakers of other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/Serbian/archive/2004-03/a-2004-03-26-9-1.cfm Slobodan Backović potpisao odluku o preimenovanju srpskog u maternji jezik], ''[[Voice of America]]'', 26 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision resulted in a number of teachers declaring a [[Strike action|strike]] and parents refusing to send their children to schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{sr icon}} [http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2004/09/17/srpski/D04091602.shtml "Počelo otpuštanje profesora srpskog"], Glas Javnosti, 17 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities affected by the strike included [[Nikšić]], [[Podgorica]], [[Berane]], [[Pljevlja]] and [[Herceg Novi]].

The new letters had been used for official documents since 2009, but in February 2017, the [[Assembly of Montenegro]] removed them from any type of governmental documentation.&lt;ref name=Sputnik/&gt;

'''Mutual exclusivity''' is a word learning constraint that involves the tendency to assign one label/name, and in turn avoid assigning a second label, to a single object.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, E. V. (2009). Lexical meaning. In E. L. Bavin (Ed.), The Cambridge Handbook of Child Language (pp. 283-300). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual exclusivity is often discussed as one of three main lexical constraints, or [[word learning biases]], that are believed to play major roles in word learning, the other two being the [[word learning biases|whole-object]] and [[word learning biases|taxonomic]] constraints. This assumption is typically first seen in the early stages of word learning by toddlers, but it is not limited to young childhood. Mutual exclusivity is often discussed by domain-specific accounts of language as limiting children’s hypotheses about the possible meanings of words.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh-Pasek, K., Golinkoff, R. M., &amp; Hollich, G. (2000). An emergentist coalition model for word learning: Mapping words to objects is a product of the interaction of multiple cues. In R. M. Golinkoff, K. Hirsh-Pasek, L.

New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that mutual exclusivity alone cannot account for the complexity of word learning but is instead “more like heuristics in problem-solving."&lt;ref name=Golinkoff1992&gt;Golinkoff, R.M., Hirsh-Pasek, K., Bailey, L.M., &amp; Wenger, N.R. (1992). Young children and adults use lexical principles to learn new nouns. Developmental Psychology, 28, 99-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Research on mutual exclusivity as a lexical constraint first began in the 1980s. Markman and Wachtel (1988) designed what some consider to be the seminal study of mutual exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, E.M., &amp; Wachtel, G.F. (1988). Children’s use of mutual exclusivity to constrain the meanings of words. Cognitive Psychology, 20, 121-157.&lt;/ref&gt; It involved six studies that analyzed children's willingness to assign an unfamiliar label to familiar or unfamiliar objects. In their first study, they placed two objects in front of 3- to 4-year-old children, one that had a label known to the children (familiar object) and one that did not have a known label (novel object). Once shown both objects, the children were then told "show me the [nonsense syllable]" to see which object the children would assign this new label. The children had a significant tendency to "reject a second label for [a familiar] object, treating it, instead, as a label for a novel object." This is often referred to as a simple disambiguation task. In their remaining five studies, they examined whether familiarity to an object would [mediate?] whether or not children would assign a new label to the object as a name for the object itself or a label of a part of it. For example, Study 2 involved a familiar condition and unfamiliar condition. In the familiar condition, children were presented with a familiar object (in this case "fish") and asked whether a novel label ("dorsal fin") applied to the whole object or "just this part" (pointing to the fin). In the unfamiliar condition, children were presented with an unfamiliar object ("lung") and asked whether a novel label ("trachea") applied to the whole object or a part of it. Methods of studies 3-6 were general variations of this design and ultimately found similar results. When the object was familiar to the children, they overwhelmingly assigned the novel part label to a part of the object, rather than the whole object itself. When the object was unfamiliar to the children, they overwhelmingly assigned the novel part label to the whole object itself, rather than one of its parts. These studies set a precedent for how many researchers have studied mutual exclusivity to date.

== Function ==
Merriman and Bowman (1989) offered a list of ways in which mutual exclusivity may influence infants’ word learning.&lt;ref name=Merriman1989&gt;Merriman, W. E., Bowman, L. L., &amp; MacWhinney, B. (1989). The mutual exclusivity bias in children’s word learning. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 54(3-4, Serial No. 220).&lt;/ref&gt; First, mutual exclusivity might influence the infant's decision about the reference of a new word. For example, if a child is faced with a familiar object for which they already have a label, and an unfamiliar object, which they have not yet labeled, they are likely to map a novel word onto the unfamiliar object. This is called the disambiguation effect. Next, the bias might cause an infant to change the extension of a familiar word. In this case, a child might remove 'wolf' from their extension of 'dog' upon hearing an animal labeled a 'wolf.' This can be called the correction effect. As well, the bias might compel an infant to reject a new word, for instance, rejecting 'wolf' in favor of 'dog.' This is the rejection effect. Lastly, mutual exclusivity might influence word generalization. In this case, if a child knows an object to have a particular name, the child should not generalize other names to it. This is known as the restriction effect.

== Associations with vocabulary learning ==
Some studies have found positive correlations between children’s use of mutual exclusivity and their learned vocabulary, while others have found the opposite. In Callanan’s and Sabbagh’s (2004) study on parents’ facilitation of mutual exclusivity with their 12- to 24-month-olds, they found that having parents who gave two labels for an object to their child was positively correlated with having a productive vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Callanan2004&gt;Callanan, M.A., &amp; Sabbagh, M.A. (2004). Multiple labels for objects in conversations with young children: parents' language and children's developing expectations about word meanings. Developmental Psychology, 40, 746-763.&lt;/ref&gt; Markman, Wasow, and Hansen (2003) found that “lexical constraints enable babies to learn words even under non-optimal conditions.”&lt;ref name=Markman2003&gt;Markman, E.M., Wasow, J.L., &amp; Hansen, M.B. (2003). Use of the mutual exclusivity assumption by young word learners. Cognitive Psychology, 47, 241-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

One study (Stevens &amp; Karmiloff-Smith, 1997) examined the use of lexical constraints in word learning in children with Williams syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, T., &amp; Karmiloff-Smith, A. (1997). Word learning in a special population: do individuals with Williams syndrome obey lexical constraints? Journal of Child Language, 24, 737-765.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they did not abide by other constraints such as the whole object or taxonomic constraints, they did exhibit [[fast mapping]] and mutual exclusivity.

== Age and mutual exclusivity ==
Halberda (2003) was one of the first studies to examine the limiting role of age on children’s exhibition of mutual exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Halberda, J. (2003). The development of a word-learning strategy. Cognition, 87, B23-B34.&lt;/ref&gt; He found a linear relationship between age and performance; that is, the older the child, the more likely they were to use mutual exclusivity in word learning. Grouped by age, 14-, 16-, and 17-month-olds were tested in a preferential looking paradigm in which they were presented with a familiar object and novel object, asked to “look at the dax,” and were recorded based on which object they looked at longest. The 17-month-olds looked at the novel object more than their original baseline preferences. The 16-month-olds looked at rates no higher than chance. The 14-month-olds actually looked at the familiar object (a car) after being asked to find the “dax.” 

Other studies have offered different timelines for different areas of development of this constraint in children. Bion, Borovsky, and Fernald (2013) claimed that their findings suggested that “the ability to find the referent of a novel word in ambiguous contexts is a skill that improves from 18 to 30 months of age.”&lt;ref name=Bion2013&gt;Bion, R.H., Borovsky, A., &amp; Fernald, A. (2013). Fast mapping, slow learning: Disambiguation of novel word-object mappings in relation to vocabulary learning at 18, 24, and 30 months. Cognition, 126, 39-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The 18-month-olds in their sample did not reliably look at the novel object after labeling, whereas 24-month-olds did. Liittschwager and Markman (1994) found evidence of 16-month-olds exhibiting mutual exclusivity, suggesting that differences in methods could account for this discrepancy in results across studies.&lt;ref name=Liitt1994&gt;Liittschwager, J.C., &amp; Markman, E.M. (1994). 16-month-old and 24-month-old – Use of mutual exclusivity as a default assumption in 2nd-label learning. Developmental Psychology, 30, 955-968.&lt;/ref&gt; They also found age differences in which children can override mutual exclusivity and give second labels to objects. They presented 16- and 24-month-olds with an object, familiar or unfamiliar, which was given a novel label. It was hypothesized that the children presented with a familiar object would have more trouble accepting the new label than those presented with the unfamiliar object. They found that their hypothesis was correct for the 16-month-olds but not the 24-month-olds. As the researchers put it, the 24-month-olds were able to “override this default assumption” of mutual exclusivity and give a second label to an object. However, they also learned that the 24-month-olds were only able to do this when the information load was low; that is, when they were given multiple objects to learn the labels of, they had similar rates of difficulty in learning the second label as the 16-month-olds. It is well known that adults have less difficulty in overriding the assumption of mutual exclusivity, but this research suggests that this ability to override it may begin as early as age 2.

A number of studies have shown that mutual exclusivity is not a bias exhibited in children alone.  Halberda (2006) is one such study which showed that adults also exhibit mutually exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Halberda, J. (2006). Is this a dax which I see before me? Use of the logical argument disjunctive syllogism supports word-learning in children and adults. Cognitive Psychology, 53, 310-344.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they found that adults systematically avoided assigning the novel label to a known distractor and instead showed a significant looking preference to assigning said label to novel objects. Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, Bailey, and Wenger (1992) also sought to determine whether adults would exhibit mutual exclusivity at similar rates to children.&lt;ref name=Golinkoff1992 /&gt; They found that every adult chose the novel object as the referent for the novel term in every trial. The adults’ performance was better than the 2.5-year-olds of their study, who performed slightly worse but still well above chance.

Bialystok and colleagues (2010) found that the younger children in their sample of 3- and 4.5-year-olds showed a higher tendency of exhibiting mutual exclusivity than the older children.&lt;ref name=Bialystok2010&gt;Bialystok, E., Barac, R., Blaye, A., &amp; Poulin-Dubois, D. (2010). Word mapping and executive functioning in young monolingual and bilingual children. Journal of Cognition and Development, 11, 485-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bion, Borovsky, and Fernald (2013) claimed that their findings suggested that “the ability to find the referent of a novel word in ambiguous contexts is a skill that improves from 18 to 30 months of age.”&lt;ref name=Bion2013 /&gt; The 18-month-olds in their sample did not reliably look at the novel object after labeling, whereas 24-month-olds did. The 24-month-olds did not show evidence of having remembered, or retained, the novel label after a waiting period, whereas 30-month-olds showed some signs of retention. 

Less research has been conducted specifically on children’s and adults’ retention of word-object relations learned through fast mapping. Horst and Samuelson (2008) found that 2-year-olds were able to assign a novel label to a novel object, but after a 5-minute waiting period, the children failed to remember the label.&lt;ref&gt;Horst, J., &amp; Samuelson, L. (2008). Fast mapping but poor retention in 24-month-old infants. Infancy, 13, 128–157.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the study done by Bion, Borvesky, and Fernald (2013).&lt;ref name=Bion2013 /&gt; In addition to examining 18- and 24-month-olds’ ability to map a new word to a new object, they also tested 24- and 30-month-olds’ retention of the novel labels. They found that 24-month-olds failed to remember the novel labels after a 5-minute waiting period. The 30-month-olds, however, did remember the label. 

One study examined 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds, and adults who were given a novel label to a novel object.&lt;ref name=Markson1997&gt;Markson, L., &amp; Bloom, P. (1997). Evidence against a dedicated system for word learning in children. Nature, 385, 813-815.&lt;/ref&gt; They were tested three times on whether they successfully mapped the label to the object, once immediately after being presented with the word-object relation, once a week later, and once a month later. They found that the adults were more successful than the 3- and 4-year-olds during the immediate assessment, but all groups performed similarly during the second and third assessments. Furthermore, there was no significant decline in performance by any of the age groups throughout all three assessments. Although not specifically related to mutual exclusivity, this research provides support for the hypothesis that individuals ages 2.5 and up who exhibit mutual exclusivity via fast mapping are able to retain the information they learned for extended periods of time.

== Number of languages learned ==
When tested by a simple disambiguation task, children who learned one language tended to rely on mutual exclusivity more often than children who learned multiple languages.&lt;ref name=ByersHeinlein2009 /&gt; Some evidence suggests that the more languages a child is taught, the less likely they are to exhibit the constraint. Byers-Heinlein and Werker (2009) was one of the first studies to examine the differences between the uses of mutual exclusivity in 17- and 18-month-old [[monolingualism|monolingual]], [[multilingualism|bilingual]], and [[multilingualism|trilingual]] children.&lt;ref name=ByersHeinlein2009&gt;Byers-Heinlein, K., &amp; Werker, J.F. (2009). Monolingual, bilingual, trilingual: infants' language experience influences the development of a word-learning heuristic. Developmental Science, 12, 815-823.&lt;/ref&gt; Their monolingual subjects exhibited mutual exclusivity more often than their bilingual counterparts. Likewise, their bilingual subjects exhibited the constraint more often than their trilingual counterparts, who showed no reliance on mutual exclusivity. The number of languages learned, rather than vocabulary size, was predictive of children’s use of the constraint. 

Other studies have built upon this research by examining monolingual and bilingual children’s use of mutual exclusivity at ages older than 17 months. A 2017 study examined 2- to 4-year-olds and found that the bilingual children tended to rely less on mutual exclusivity than their monolingual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Verhagen, J., Grassmann, S., &amp; Kuntay, A. (2017). Monolingual and bilingual children’s resolution of referential conflicts: Effects of bilingualism and relative language proficiency. Cognitive Development, 41, 10-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, and Poulin-Dubois (2010) reported a continuation in this trend in 4.5-year-olds,&lt;ref name=Bialystok2010 /&gt; and a 1997 study by Davidson, Jergovic, Imami, and Theodos found similar trends in 6-year-old monolingual and bilingual children.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, D., Jergovic, D., Imami, Z., &amp; Theodos, V. (1997). Monolingual and bilingual children's use of the mutual exclusivity constraint. Journal of Child Language, 24, 3–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Au and Glusman (1990) reported that the monolingual and bilingual children in their study knew enough about language to accept two names for the same object if the labels were from different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Au, T.F., &amp; Glusman, M. (1990). The principle of mutual exclusivity in word learning – To honor or not to honor. Child Development, 61, 1474-1490.&lt;/ref&gt; The separation in their use of mutual exclusivity appeared to occur when the two labels were from the same language. 

These studies used a disambiguation task in which the children were presented with a familiar and unfamiliar object and asked to assign a novel label to one or the other. Another line of research using different methodology has yielded different results in monolingual, bilingual, and trilingual children’s use of mutual exclusivity. Yow and colleagues (2017) examined 4.5-year-olds’ use of the constraint, but they did not simply present the children with novel objects and labels or teach them the word-object association.&lt;ref&gt;Yow, W., Li, X., Lam, S., Gliga, T., Chong, Y., Kwek, K., &amp; Broekman, B. (2017). A bilingual advantage in 54-month-olds’ use of referential cues in fast mapping. Developmental Science, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the experimenters looked at the novel object when saying the novel label, so the children needed to use the speaker’s gaze to exhibit mutual exclusivity. The bilingual and trilingual children in this study did significantly better in the mutual exclusivity task than the monolingual children. The researchers suspected that this “bilingual advantage” was a result of their increased sensitivity to communicative contexts compared to monolingual children. Results from this study and others have challenged the way researchers understand the mechanisms involved with mutual exclusivity and the way the constraint is operationalized in research designs.

== Mutual exclusivity and animals ==

Evidence suggests that mutual exclusivity is not solely a human bias. Kaminski, Call, and Fischer (2004) tested a dog's ability to fast map new names to new objects.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, J., Call, J., &amp; Fischer, J. (2004). Word learning in a domestic dog: evidence for “fast mapping”. Science, 304, 1682-1683.&lt;/ref&gt; Rico, a border collie, reliably knew over 200 names for over 200 toys. Researchers placed 7 familiar toys and 1 novel toy in a room, and Rico was asked to the room and retrieve some. When told to retrieve the new toy, which was referred to with an unfamiliar label, Rico brought the novel toy to the researcher 7 out of 10 sessions. Four weeks later, they tested his retention of the relation between the novel toy and name. They placed one of the unfamiliar toys that Rico successfully mapped in the original sessions in a room with four familiar toys and four novel toys. When asked to retrieve these target toys based on their original novel label, Rico successfully retrieved them in 3 out of 6 sessions. The researchers of this study noted that this retention is comparable to the performance of 3-year-olds.&lt;ref name=Markson1997 /&gt;

== Caregivers’ facilitation of mutual exclusivity ==
One study found that parents reliably facilitate the use of mutual exclusivity in their children.&lt;ref name=Callanan2004 /&gt; In two studies, 12- to 24-month old children and their parents were recorded while doing free-play. In both studies, parents reliably preferred to give their children only one label for an object rather than two. When they did offer two, they often also gave clarifying information to explain why two labels were appropriate.

== Criticisms and opposing perspectives ==
There exist several criticisms of mutual exclusivity.

Some theorists believe that children possess this bias from the start of word learning, whereas others argue that it is slowly acquired throughout early childhood.&lt;ref name=Merriman1989 /&gt;

Diesendruck and Markson (2001) argued that children’s avoidance of lexical overlap may actually be caused by the way researchers speak to them.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendruck, G., &amp; Markson, L. (2001). Children’s avoidance of lexical overlap: A pragmatic account. Developmental Psychology, 37, 630-641.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of their studies, they found that children interpret speakers’ requests based on shared knowledge between them. In other words, speakers’ communicative intentions help clue children in on what the speaker wants them to say. 

Some researchers argue that examples of children learning second labels for objects, which violates the assumption of mutual exclusivity, is a telling sign that mutual exclusivity is not a significant constraint. Others have argued that documented use of mutual exclusivity being mostly exhibited by older children lessens the scope of the assumption.&lt;ref name=Liitt1994 /&gt;

Liittschwager and Markman (1994) responded to these criticisms by arguing that mutual exclusivity assumes that it is more difficult to learn second labels for objects than first labels, not that learning second labels is an impossible feat.&lt;ref name=Liitt1994 /&gt; When they tested this, they found that the amount of information given to the children impacted their ability to learn second words for objects. When 2-year-olds only had one word to learn, they learned second labels as easily as first labels. However, when given an additional word to learn, 2-year-olds had more difficulty learning second labels for objects, but not first labels.

McMurray, Horst, and Samuelson (2012) offered an alternative assumption in researching lexical constraints and biases.&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, B., Horst, J.S., &amp; Samuelson, L.K. (2012). Word learning emerges from the interaction of online referent selection and slow associative learning. Psychological Review, 119, 831-877.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than accepting the assumption that determining the referent of a novel word is isomorphic to learning, they argue in favor of the assumption of understanding referent selection as an online process that is independent of long-term learning. 

Some researchers have criticized the indirect role of mutual exclusivity in word learning because an alternative explanation could account for children’s motivation to assign novel labels to novel objects. They may simply be motivated to fill the lexical gap created by a novel object rather than avoiding second labels. In other words, children may be motivated to give a name to objects that they do not already have a name for. 

Markman, Wasow, and Hansen (2003) sought to address this criticism by eliminating the use of a novel object in their design.&lt;ref name=Markman2003 /&gt; In Study 1, the researchers placed a familiar object (a bottle, for example) next to a bucket and asked some children to search for an object using a familiar label ("find the bottle") or a novel label ("find the press"). In Study 2, they used the same procedures except the familiar object was in the children's hands rather than near the bucket, and in Study 3, they removed the bucket entirely. Because the mutual exclusivity constraint assumes that children will be less willing to accept a second label for an object, the researchers hypothesized that children who were told to search for the press would spend more time searching than those who were asked to find the bottle. They found support for their hypothesis; in general, children in the Novel Label condition spent significantly more time searching than the other children. The researchers concluded that children are motivated to avoid assigning multiple labels to an object, thus supporting mutual exclusivity and eliminating the alternative explanation that filling lexical gaps is their primary motivator.

'''Pitjantjatjara''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|p|ɪ|tʃ|ən|tʃ|ə|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|r|ə}};{{Sfnp|Bauer|2007|p=?}} {{IPA-aus|ˈpɪɟanɟaɟaɾa}} or {{IPA-aus|ˈpɪɟanɟaɾa|}}&lt;ref&gt;Through a process of [[haplology]], the name ''Pitjantjatjara'' is usually pronounced (in normal, fast speech) with one of the repeated syllables ''-tja-'' deleted, thus: ''pitjantjara''. In slow, careful speech all syllables will be pronounced {{Harvcol|Goddard|1985|p=?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[dialect]] of the [[Western Desert language]] traditionally spoken by the [[Pitjantjatjara people]] of Central Australia. It is [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with other varieties of the Western Desert language, and is particularly closely related to the [[Yankunytjatjara dialect]]. The names for the two groups are based on their respective words for 'come/go.'{{Sfnp|Goddard|1996|p=?}} 

Pitjantjatjara is a relatively healthy [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal language]], with children learning it. It is taught in some [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] schools. The literacy rate for [[first language]] speakers is 50–70%; and is 10–15% for [[second language|second-language]] learners. There is a Pitjantjatjara [[dictionary]] and translated portions of the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, from 2002.

Some features distinctive to the Pitjantjatjara dialect, as opposed to other Western Desert Language dialects, include ''-pa'' endings to words that simply end in a consonant in other dialects (this is reflective of a general aversion in PItjantjatjara to words ending with a consonant), and a reluctance to have ''y'' at the beginning of words.

===Nouns and noun phrases===
Pitjantjatjara uses [[grammatical case|case marking]] to show the role of nouns within the clause as subject, object, location, etc. Pitjantjatjara is a language with [[split ergativity]], since its nouns and pronouns show different case marking patterns.{{sfnp|Bowe|1990|pp=9–12}}

Consider the following example, where the subject of a transitive verb is marked with the [[ergative case]] and the object with the [[absolutive case]]:{{sfnp|Bowe|1990|pp=10}}

{|class='wikitable'
|{{lang|pjt|Minyma-ngku}} ||{{lang|pjt|tjitji}}|| {{lang|pjt|nya-ngu.}}
|-
|woman (ergative)||child (absolutive)||see (past tense)
|-
| colspan="3" |'The woman saw the child.'
|}

It can be contrasted with the following sentence with an intransitive verb, where the subject takes the absolutive case:
{|class='wikitable'
|{{lang|pjt|Tjitji}}|| {{lang|pjt|a-nu.}}
|-
|child (absolutive)||go (past tense)
|-
| colspan="2" |'The child went.'
|}

In contrast to the ergative-absolutive pattern that applies to nouns, pronouns show a nominative-accusative pattern. Consider the following examples, with pronoun subjects:{{sfnp|Bowe|1990|p=11}}

{|class='wikitable'
|{{lang|pjt|Ngayu-lu}} ||{{lang|pjt|tjitji}}|| {{lang|pjt|nya-ngu.}}
|-
|I (nominative)||child (absolutive)||see (past)
|-
|colspan='4'|'I saw the child.'
|}

{|class='wikitable'
|{{lang|pjt|Ngayu-lu}}|| {{lang|pjt|a-nu.}}
|-
|I (nominative)||go (past)
|-
|colspan='4'|'I went.'
|}

===Verbs and verb phrases===
Pitjantjatjara verbs inflect for [[grammatical tense|tense]]. Pitjantjatjara has four different [[verb conjugation|classes of verbs]], each of which takes slightly different endings (the classes are named according to their imperative suffixes): ∅-class verbs, {{sm|la}}-class verbs, {{sm|wa}}-class verbs, and {{sm|ra}}-class verbs.

===Derivational morphology===
It also has systematic ways of [[derivation (linguistics)|changing words from one part of speech to another]]: making nouns from verbs, and vice versa. However, words formed may have slightly different meanings that cannot be guessed from the pattern alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In the [[social science|social sciences]] and [[philosophy]], a '''positive''' or '''descriptive statement''' concerns what "is", "was", or "will be", and contains no indication of approval or disapproval (what should be). Positive statements are thus the opposite of [[normative statement|normative statements]]. Positive statement is based on empirical evidence. For examples, "An increase in taxation will result in less consumption" and "A fall in supply of petrol will lead to an increase in its price". However, positive statement can be factually incorrect: "The moon is made of green cheese" is empirically false, but is still a positive statement, as it is a statement about what is, not what should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive and normative economics|website=http://www.soas.ac.uk/cedep-demos/000_P570_IEEP_K3736-Demo/unit1/page_16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive statements and normative  statements ==
Positive statements are distinct from normative statements. Positive statements are based on empirical evidence, can be tested, and involve no value judgements. Positive statements refer to '''what is''' and contain no indication of approval or disapproval. When values or opinions come into the analysis, then it is in the realm of normative economics. A '''normative''' statement expresses a judgment about whether a situation is desirable or undesirable, which can carry value judgements. These refer to '''what ought to be.'''

== Use of positive statement ==
Positive statements are widely used to describe something measurable, like the rate of  inflation in an economy. They are mainly used in explanations of theories and concepts. Using a positive statement does not mean you can't have your own opinions on issues. However, when you are writing academic essays it's important to use positive statements to support an argument, since it can be verified by evidence.

'''Pransukh Manilal Nayak''' (23 April 1910 – 12 March 1989) was an Indian [[Gujarati theatre]] actor, director, manager, and playwright from [[Gujarat]], India. Born into a family of traditional theatre actors, he joined theatre troupes at a young age and rose to fame for his comic roles and female impersonations. His performances as a woman from [[Varanasi|Banaras]] in ''Kumali Kali'' and as Jivram Bhatt in ''Mithyabhiman'' were acclaimed. During his long career, he worked with many theatre companies and gave 22,455 performances, earning a listing in the 1989 ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]''.

== Early life ==
Pransukh Nayak was born on 23 April 1910 in a village called Jagudan,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ગુજરાતી વિશ્વકોશ|last=Nayak|first=Chinubhai|publisher=Gujarat Vishwakosh Trust|year=1998|isbn=|editor-last=Thaker|editor-first=Dhirubhai|editor-link=Dhirubhai Thaker|edition=1st|volume=X|location=Ahmedabad|pages=94–95|language=gu|trans-title=Gujarati Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt; which is now in [[Mehsana district]], Gujarat, to a family of traditional [[Bhavai]] actors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0433#|title=The Oxford companion to Indian theatre|last=Jani|first=Dinkar B.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=|year=2004|isbn=9780199861248|editor-last=Lal|editor-first=Ananda|location=New Delhi|pages=|oclc=607157336|via=Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/citation_popup.php?id=909&amp;at=1|title=Pransukh Manilal Nayak|last=|first=|date=|website=sangeetnatak.gov.in|publisher=[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623064652/http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/citation_popup.php?id=909&amp;at=1|archive-date=23 June 2018|dead-url=|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Manilal Mulchand was a popular Bhavai actor and the people of nearby villages flocked to see his performances in ''vesha''s (acts) of ''[[Ramapir]]'' and ''[[Chhelbatau]]''. Pransukh had participated in one performance when he was around seven or eight years old. He studied two levels in a Gujarati school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":x"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ગુજરાતી રંગભૂમિ: રિદ્ધિ અને રોનક (Gujarati Rangbhoomi: Riddhi Ane Ronak)|last=|first=|publisher=Gujarat Vishwakosh Trust|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Choksi|editor-first=Mahesh|location=Ahmedabad|pages=214–216|trans-title=Compilation of Information regarding professional theatre of Gujarat|editor-last2=Somani|editor-first2=Dhirendra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Nayak was inspired by a performance by female impersonator [[Jaishankar Sundari]] to join a Bhavai troupe at the age of nine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gujaratsamachar.com/gujaratsamachar.com/20110724/purti/ravipurti/lokjivan.html|title=રંગભૂમિના ઈતિહાસનું એક ઝળહળતું સુવર્ણપૃષ્ઠ સ્વ. પ્રાણસુખ નાયક|last=Jadav|first=Joravarsinh|date=24 July 2011|publisher=[[Gujarat Samachar]]|language=gu|trans-title=The Golden Page of the History of Gujarati Theatre: Late Pransukh Nayak|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Deshi Natak Samaj{{efn|''Natak Samaj'' and ''Natak Mandali'' can be translated as 'drama society' and 'theatre group' (lit. 'circle').}} in [[Surat]], where he played female impersonator roles. He later worked with Aryaniti Natak Samaj—owned by [[Motilal Nandwana|Motiram Nandwana]]—and Vidyavinod Natak Samaj owned by Pyarelal Viththalrao Mehta.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt; He later joined Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, where he was trained under Surajram Nayak, Jaishankar Sundari and [[Bapulal Nayak]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Mumbai, he appeared in a supporting female role as Kashi—a woman from [[Varanasi|Banaras]]—in ''Kumali Kali'' (Delicate Bud, 1926), and later in ''College Kanya'' (College Girl, 1925), which brought him fame in the Bombay theatre circuit (now Mumbai) at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He received his nickname ''Lucknowri Tetar'' due to his role in ''Kumali Kali''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He later diversified his performances, mostly in comic roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also acted in ''Jugal Jugari'' (Jugal the Gambler, 1902), ''Vijya Kalyani'', ''Pavitra Leelavati'', ''Sattano Mad'', ''Uma Devdi'', ''Ramviyog'', ''Veenaveli'', ''Santanona Vanke'', ''Rukshamani Haran'', ''Sati Damayanti'' and ''Vijayavijay''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He played several comedic duos with Chhagan Romeo.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt;

When Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali became defunct, Nayak joined Palitana Bhaktipradarshak Mandali and Prabhat Kalamandal. When these troupes also became defunct, he went to [[Ahmedabad]] and joined Natmandal, which was operated by [[Gujarat Vidhya Sabha]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here he was guided by [[Rasiklal Parikh]], Jaishankar Sundari and [[Dina Pathak]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He received acclaim for his performance as a [[Brahmin]] in Rasiklal Parikh's ''Mena Gurjari'' (Mena of Gujarat, 1953) and as a comic role of Jivram Bhatt in [[Dalpatram]]'s ''Mithyabhiman'' (False Vanity, 1955).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt; He also briefly worked with [[Darpana Academy of Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He taught theatre at Shreyas Foundation in Ahmedabad for some time.&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt; During the last years of his life, Nayak started a theatre troupe called Pran Theatre, which performed educational plays for schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt;

Nayak acted as a royal astrologer in the [[Gujarati cinema|Gujarati film]] ''[[Bhavni Bhavai]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Apart from acting and direction, Nayak wrote eight plays including ''Balotiyana Balela'', ''Bandh Chheepna Moti'', ''Birbalni Chhatri'' and ''Balbhakta Prahalad''. His notes on commercial theatre and its history, documentation on Bhavai acts and notes of his experiences are archived in the Theatre Media Centre. His few images are also archived in the Gujarat Lokkala Foundation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In ''Pransukh Nayak: Flashback'', Jitendra Thakkar notes that Pransukh Nayak made 1,050 performances with Deshi Natak Samaj, 400 with Vidhyavinod Natak Samaj, 205 with Aryaniti Natak Samaj, 325 in Hindi and 7,978 in Gujarati with Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, 1,248 with Prabhat Kalamandal, 30 with Rangmandal, 531 with Natmandal, 412 with Darpana, 338 with Pran Theatre and 9,938 with other theatre companies—totalling 22,455 performances. The record was recorded in the 1989 ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahuja2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahuja|first=Chaman|title=Contemporary Theatre of India: An Overview|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=YDSHSkYp6M0C&amp;q=Nayak|year=2012|publisher=[[National Book Trust]], India|isbn=978-81-237-6491-7|pages=146, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[theatre]], the '''prompt corner''' or '''prompt box''' is the place where the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]]—usually the [[Stage management|stage manager]] in the US or [[Stage management#Deputy stage manager|deputy stage manager]] in the UK—stands in order to coordinate the performance and to remind performers of their lines when required.&lt;ref name=ken/&gt;&lt;ref name=hart&gt;Phyllis Hartnoll and Peter Found, Ed. (1996),  ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-282574-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally located at [[Blocking (stage)#Stage directions|stage left]].

==Location==
Historically, the prompt corner was situated at stage left.  ''Prompt side'' (abbreviated to PS) and ''opposite prompt'' (abbreviated to OP, sometimes called ''off prompt'') are widely used terms for stage left and stage right.&lt;ref name=ken&gt;Dennis Kennedy, Ed. (2010) ''The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-19-957419-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some theatres choose to install prompt corner in a discrete area of the auditorium. Certain theatres which locate their prompt corner on stage right would inform cast and crew that they were operating on a bastard prompt system. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrecrafts.com/pages/home/topics/stage-management/theatre-building/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Opera house|opera houses]], the prompt box is traditionally located [[downstage]] centre; see [[prompter (opera)]].

==Prompt desk==
The prompt corner is usually equipped with a ''prompt desk'' to facilitate the coordination of a performance.  This can vary from a small table in the wings to an elaborate installation in a dedicated booth, being equipped with all the necessary aids for the specific production and venue. The prompt desk minimally holds a carefully annotated copy of the performance [[Manuscript|script]], with [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] and other stage directions and, in professional theatres:

* A communications [[intercom]] [[headphones|headset]], or  'cans', to talk to the rest of the technical team during a show;
* Red and green [[cue light]]s. (In some theatres a computerised cue light system is used);
* [[Telephone]]s to [[FOH (theatre)|front of house]] areas;
* A [[public address]] system so that the stage manager and deputy stage manager (normally the person calling the show) can make announcements, or give calls, to the foyer ('front of house'), auditorium ('house'), dressing rooms or other 'back of house' areas in the theatre;
* A silent [[fire alarm]] indicator, such as a [[strobe light]]; and,
* Controls for the [[safety curtain]] and other emergency measures.

'''Riva Nyri Prècil''' (born March 28, 1989, [[Brooklyn, New York]]) is a Haitian-American singer, songwriter, and author.

==Early life and education==
Riva Nyri Précil was born in Brooklyn. Her mother, Michelle Karshan, is an American of Russian Jewish and Irish descent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikimizik.com/browse-by-artist?artist=Riva%20Nyri%20Pr%C3%A9cil|title=Songs by Riva Nyri Précil|website=wikimizik.com|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a radio station in the 1980s, called “Sak Pase” while her father, Privat Précil was a Haitian who worked in the US as a journalist and lawyer. Riva and her family moved to Haiti she was five years old as her mother got a job in Haiti. Her mother worked for the Haitian government specifically on foreign press liaising, using her foreign heritage as an advantage to manage the foreign press who visited Haiti.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

While growing up in Haiti, Riva was exposed to and studied under many of the great masters of Haiti's cultural and artistic scene. She was in a theatre troupe, Ateliee Edoision, and took various dancing with [[Viviane Gauthier]] and Artcho Danse— sculpting, painting, and singing classes, which will later develop her as a wholesome artist skilled in several aspects of art. Riva learned her sculpting and painting skills from renowned Haitian artist, [[Jean-Claude Garoute|Jean-Claude "Tiga" Garoute]]. In her early teens, Riva already started to teach art classes to young children who were in her neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

She was already musically influenced by her mother as she listened to exotic and various genres of music from all over the world starting from [[jazz]] and [[soul (music)|soul]], to Indian and Arabic music. As her family was very open-minded to experience, she visited lots of [[Haitian Vodou]] ceremonies, learning both the beautiful and eerie parts of the Vodou culture. When Riva was fifteen she had to leave Haiti and return to New York because of the dangerous condition of Haiti due to a [[2004 Haitian coup d'état]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

While back in New York, she attended [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School|LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts]] as a sophomore where she majored in vocal performance. She soon graduated in 2007 and continued her education at Loyola University of New Orleans. She received her BA in Music Therapy from Loyola University of New Orleans in 2011 then completed her one-year residency in New York at Beth Israel Hospital.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

She returned to the United States as a teenager and attended [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School|LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts]]. After graduating from LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts, she received her BA in Music Therapy from the [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University of New Orleans]] in 2011 and continued on to complete her one-year residency in New York at Beth Israel Hospital.

During her time in Loyola University, she became skillful in playing guitar and piano and continued singing. When the 2010 Haiti earthquake happened, Riva and few other Haitian students, who were less than ten people, organized a giant fundraiser to support people back in Haiti.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Career==
===Singer===
After Riva graduated Loyola University Riva came back to New York. In 2014, Riva realized the lack of [[Haitian Creole]] contents in the world and felt a “sense of duty to dedicate herself to keep the Haitian art alive and conserve it for her ancestors and for her country.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeon, Yunil. Personal Interview, May 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This led her to start working on her first album “Perle De Culture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/5CQBrI9Et8iG1yECGwbRf0?play=true&amp;play=true|title=Riva Nyri Precil|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By meeting her present fiance in the end of 2013, Monvelyno Alexis, who also is a prominent musician, Riva worked with him to create an album independently.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The songs were mainly traditional Haitian music with a modern twist. The songs were newly arranged in a jazz style by her fiance, Alexis. Riva worked during the daytime and recorded songs at night at a studio in Brooklyn called “Kamoken Studio”. The studio was owned by Chico Boyer, who was a pioneer of Haitian roots music. He even personally participated in a few songs on the album as a bass player. In 2015, the album was completed and released through [[CD Baby]] which allowed Riva to officially launch herself and put her music out to the public.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Ever since her album was released, she is constantly gigging around the world to promote Haitian culture and its beauty. She has performed at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival —alongside [[Emeline Michel]] —Carifesta XII hosted in Haiti, the Haitian Flag Day Celebration at Brooklyn's Borough Hall, and various other ceremonies. Recently, she has been working with a label, “[[Strictly Rhythm]]” to musically expand her horizon and work in different styles of music such as Afro House and dance music.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Author===
Her career as an author also started in 2014. Her interest in writing Haitian books initially started from translating children’s books in Haitian Creole from a non-profit organization, '''Li Li Li''', organized by Riva and her mother to translate various children's book in Haitian Creole and to train people to read the books to children in Haiti after the collapse of a lot of schools in Haiti (2011–12).

In 2014, Riva decided to write a children’s book about mermaids and their world underwater, which was set in [[Jacmel]]. She submitted her work to a Haitian short story competition hosted by Educa Vision, and by winning the competition her book, ''Anaëlle Ak Lasirèn'', was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anaëlle Ak Lasirèn|last=Prècil|first=Riva|publisher=Educa Vision|year=2015|isbn=1626323569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles and influences===
Ever since she was young, she was influenced by various genres of music originating from all parts of the world. However, she was primarily influenced by Haitian music, and jazz, which allowed her to grow up to be the musician she is now.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Her style of music and vocals came through as she successfully merged [[jazz]] and [[Music of Haiti|Haitian music]]. Her muses, who influenced her ever since she was young, are [[Billie Holiday]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]]. She actually performed Holiday’s and Fitzgerald's pieces for her audition to enter LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Other ventures==
After Riva graduated from Loyola University, she introduced [http://lovenyri.com/ "Love, Nyri"], a modern handmade jewelry line, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lovenyri.com|title=Home|website=Love, Nyri|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the jewelry is very much inspired by a traditional Haitian jewelry style. Nowadays, most of her products are custom order. The materials used range from brass, gold, silver, crystals, to various gems.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

As Riva has been taking dance classes since she was young and has taught several dance classes for the 2010 Haiti earthquake fundraiser, she continues to teach traditional Haitian dance in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://haiticulturalx.org/ti-atis-introducing-teaching-artist-riva-nyri-precil-by-tassiana-larochelle-hcx-fundraising-intern|title=Introducing Teaching Artist Riva Nyri Précil|work=Haiti Cultural Exchange|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her current dance class “tout se pa” which means “no wrong steps” covers traditional Haitian dances such as Yanvalou, Congo, Nago, Ibo, Mayi, Rabonday, and Banda. Her dance class is targeted towards Haitians in New York City who never had a chance to experience their own culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

She is a prominent performer and has performed at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, Carifesta XII hosted in Haiti, and the Haitian Flag Day Celebration at Brooklyn's Borough Hall. She was a panelist and performer at the Women's Empowerment Luncheon hosted by the Haitian American Student Association at Syracuse University in February 2016. Riva performs in New York City alongside her band Bohio Music.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Sambahsa''' or '''Sambahsa-Mundialect''' is an [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL) devised by [[French people|French]] Dr. Olivier Simon.&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/10183084/FrontPage|title=The Official Website of Sambahsa |author=Dr. Olivier Simon |year=2010| accessdate= 2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among [[international auxiliary languages|IAL]]s it is categorized as a [[wikt:worldlang|worldlang]]. It is based on the [[Proto Indo-European]] language (PIE), with a highly simplified grammar.&lt;ref name="Mithridates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pagef30.com/2009/05/why-you-should-keep-your-eye-on.html|title=Why You Should Keep an Eye on Sambahsa |author=Mithridates |date =2009-05-14 |accessdate =2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The language was first released on the Internet in July 2007; prior to that, the creator claims to have worked on it for eight years. According to one of the rare academic studies addressing recent auxiliary languages, "Sambahsa has an extensive vocabulary and a large amount of learning and reference material".&lt;ref&gt;"The Representation of Korean and Other Altaic Languages in Artificial International Auxiliary Languages" in ''Journal of Universal Language'', March 2012, p.153, by Alan Reed Libert.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the name of the language, Sambahsa, is taken from two [[Malay Language|Malay]] words, ''sama'' and ''bahsa'' which mean 'same' and 'language' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tuttle's Concise Indonesian dictionary: English-Indonesian, Indonesian-English|author=A. L. N. Kramer, Willie Koen|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Company, Inc. of Rutland, Vermont &amp; Tokyo, Japan |isbn=0-8048-1864-9|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mundialect, on the other hand, is a result of combining two [[Romance languages|Romance]] words, ''mondial'' (worldwide) and ''dialect'' (dialect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's French-English dictionary|author=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-917-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sambahsa tries to preserve the original spellings of words as much as possible and this makes its orthography complex, though still kept regular.&lt;ref&gt;A full analysis of Sambahsa (written in Esperanto) has been made by S.Auclair in ''La Riverego'' n°104, pp. 11-16, http://www.esperanto.qc.ca/files/riverego/Riverego-104.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are four [[grammatical case]]s: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[genitive case|genitive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/27871608/Foreword-to-the-Sambahsa-Grammar-in-English|title=Foreword to the Sambahsa Grammar in English|author=Dave MacLeod|year=2010|accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Some language enthusiasts have said Sambahsa would have resulted had a kingdom been formed several millennia ago with PIE as its official tongue and remained intact until the present times.&lt;ref name="Mithridates" /&gt; --&gt;
Sambahsa, though based on PIE, borrows a good proportion of its vocabulary from languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which belong to various other [[language family|language families]].&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

==Phonology==
Sambahsa's phonology [http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/27811711/Sambahsa-pronunciation-in-English] has little to do with [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]], though the majority of its vocabulary comes from PIE.
The changes from PIE are not regular, since the creator of Sambahsa has tried to avoid [[homophones]], which would have become common after the elimination of some PIE sounds like [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] or some [[aspiration (phonetics) |aspirated]] consonants. However, any person proficient with [[Proto-Indo-European root]]s will easily recognize them when they appear in Sambahsa.
Unlike some [[auxlang]]s like [[Esperanto]], Sambahsa does not use the "one letter = one sound" principle, nor [[diacritic]]s, but instead relies on a regular and complex system that combines the 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;"The strange quest for a universal "Earth Standard" language" by Esther Inglis-Arkell, 08-17-2012 : http://io9.com/5935563/the-strange-quest-for-a-universal-earth-standard-language&lt;/ref&gt; This system was chosen to preserve the recognizability of words taken from West-European languages, where [[orthography]] plays a key role. For example, according to the rules of Sambahsa, ''[[wikt:fr: bureau|bureau]]'' is pronounced as in [[French language|French]], and ''[[wikt: point|point]]'' as in [[English language|English]].

Sambahsa has nine [[vowel]]s (not counting the lengthened form of these vowels), two [[semi-vowel]]s ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [j] and [w]) and twenty [[consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;However, different versions of pronunciation of "r" are admitted, and the "ng" sound (as in English "sing") could be counted as a new sound, distinct from the conjunction of [n] + [g].&lt;/ref&gt;  To help language learners, and because [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols cannot be written with all keyboards, a special simpler system has been developed, called ''Sambahsa Phonetic Transcription'', or ''SPT''.

Compared to other [[conlang]]s, Sambahsa words are short, often as short as English words, and highly consonantic.&lt;ref&gt;See this link on a French-speaking forum : http://aphil.forumn.net/t844p15-analyse-phonotactique-kotava-esperanto-uropi-et-autres?highlight=analyse+phon%E9tique&lt;/ref&gt; This latter point is in accordance with the PIE background of Sambahsa, where roots have often a consonant-vocal-consonant structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emile Benveniste]], ''Origine de la formation des noms en Indo-Européen'': https://books.google.com/books?id=OD4IAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Sambahsa's [[Stress (linguistics)|accentuation]] rules are complex but regular, and tend to follow what is often found in [[German language|German]] or [[Italian language|Italian]]. This predictability implies that all words with the same orthography are pronounced and stressed the same way as each other. Thus, for example, while German [http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A4sident Präsident] and Italian [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/presidente#it presidente] are stressed on the "ent" syllable, Sambahsa ''president'' is stressed on the "i", since ''president'' can also mean "they preside", and a final "ent" never bears the stress. This regularity of accentuation can be compared with English [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/President "president"] and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preside "to preside"], two words that bear the stress on different syllables, though they share the same origin.

==Grammar==
===Declensions===
In Sambahsa, [[declension]]s are only compulsory for [[pronoun]]s. The declensions of these pronouns (demonstrative/interrogative &amp; relative/personal) are mostly parallel, and often show similarities with their [[Proto-Indo-European pronoun|Proto-Indo-European]] ancestors. Thus, in all Sambahsa declensions, the neuter nominative and accusative are identical, as it was the case in PIE.&lt;ref&gt;R.S.P. Beekes, ''Comparative Indo-European Linguistics'', J.Benjamins.Pub., p.195&lt;/ref&gt; There are identical forms for the relative and interrogative pronouns,&lt;ref&gt;To the exception of the nominative singular masculine, as in [[Latin]], where the relative pronoun is ''qui'', and the interrogative form is ''quis''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well for the third person pronoun and the definitive article ("the" in English).&lt;ref&gt;But the genitive form serves only for the definitive article, while the possessive pronouns have special forms (otherwise, confusions could have arisen).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sambahsa has two numbers (singular and plural; the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] of PIE has not been preserved) and four [[grammatical gender]]s : masculine, feminine, neutral and "undetermined". This last gender, which is an innovation from PIE, is used when a noun of uncertain or unknown gender is referred to, and, in the plural, for groups containing elements of different genders. The creator of Sambahsa introduced this non-PIE element to avoid the "gender" dispute found in [[Gender reform in Esperanto|Esperanto]].

Gender is attributed in Sambahsa according to the "true nature" of the noun referred to, as [[English language|English]] speakers do with ''he'', ''she'' and ''it''.

Sambahsa has four [[grammatical case]]s: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[genitive case|genitive]]; however, their attribution tries to be as logical as possible, and not arbitrary as in many modern [[Indo-European languages]]. The nominative is the case of the [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]], and the form under which words are given in dictionaries. Except for verbs describing a movement or a position (where the required [[preposition]]s ought to be used), all [[transitive verb]]s must introduce the [[accusative case]] in the first place, before an eventual [[dative case]]. However, the [[dependent clause]] of [[indirect speech]] is considered as a direct [[Object (grammar)|object]], leading to verbs introducing an indirect object, even if there is no visible direct object.

Compare :
* ''Is mi antwehrdt od is ne gwehmsiet cras'' = "He answers (to) me that he won't come tomorrow"
* ''Is ne mi hat antwohrden'' = "He hasn't answered (to) me"

In Sambahsa, all [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] trigger the accusative.&lt;ref&gt;Under certain circumstances, the preposition ''bi'' can merge with the definite article in its dative form.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genitive case|genitive]] indicates possession, and is used after adjectives that can introduce a [[dependent clause]].

Compare :
* ''Som yakin od is ghehdsiet kwehre to'' = "I'm sure that he'll be able to do that".
* ''Som yakin eysen'' (genitive plural) ''imkans'' = "I'm sure of his abilities".

For substantives and adjectives, there are declined "free endings" (i.e. non-compulsory) used most often in literary context for [[euphonics]] or [[poetry]]. This system is inspired by the euphonic endings found in the Standard [[Arabic Language]].

=== Conjugation ===
In Sambahsa, all [[verb]]s are regular, except ''ses'' (to be), ''habe'' (to have), and ''woide'' ("to know", in the meaning of French ''[[wikt:savoir#French|savoir]]'' or German [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wissen#German wissen]). Sambahsa verbs are indicated in dictionaries not under their [[infinitive]] form, but their bare [[Word stem|stem]], because the whole conjugation can be deduced from the form of this stem.
The main [[Grammatical tense|tense]]s of Sambahsa are [[Present tense|present]] and
[[Past tense|past]], but many other tenses can be obtained through the use of affixes or [[auxiliary verb]]s. Sambahsa uses the following endings, which are close to those found in many [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;They can be compared to the data provided in ''Indo-European Linguistics : an introduction'' by J. Clackson, Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 127 &amp; 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sambahsa is unusual among [[auxlang]]s because of its use of a predictable [[Ablaut#Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] system for the past tense and passive past [[participle]]s. For example, ''eh'' within a verbal stem turns to ''oh''. Other verbs that cannot use ablaut can drop their [[nasal infix]], or use an improved version of the [[De Wahl's rule]]s. Finally, the remaining verbs simply add the past tense endings, which are optional for verbs of the categories described above.

Therefore, this system qualifies Sambahsa as a language belonging to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family of languages]], though it remains a [[constructed language]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Vocabulary ==

Because of its rather large vocabulary for an [[auxlang]] (as of August 2014, the full Sambahsa-English dictionary contained more than 15000 entries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39063111/Sambahsa-English-Dictionary|title=Sambahsa English Dictionary - Nature|website=Scribd|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it is difficult to assess the share of each language in Sambahsa's eclectic wordstock. However, the main layers are (either reconstructed or extrapolated) Indo-European vocabulary, Greco-Roman scientific and technical vocabulary (which is not discussed below, as it is more or less comparable to what is found in English) and multiple sources extending from Western Europe to Eastern Asia.

=== Indo-European vocabulary ===

The core of Sambahsa's vocabulary is undoubtedly of Indo-European origin. Only a few Sambahsa words can be traced back to pre-Indo-European times (as ''kamwns'', [[chamois]], cf. [[Basque language]] : [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ahuntz "ahuntz"]). Many basic Sambahsa words are thus very close to their reconstructed Indo-European counterparts. See (Sambahsa / Proto-Indo-European) : ''eghi / *H₁eghis'' (hedgehog), ''ghelgh / *ghelghe-'' (gland), ''pehk / *pek'' (to comb), ''skand / *skand'' (to jump), ''peungst / *pn̥kʷsti-'' (fist), ''wobhel / *wobhel-'' (weevil), ''gwah / *gweH₂'' (to go), ''tox / *tòksom'' ("yew wood" in Sambahsa; "yew" in PIE), ''treb / *trêbs'' (dwelling), ''oit / *H₁òitos'' (oath), ''poti / *potis'' (Sir, lord). But less attested Indo-European vocabulary is found in Sambahsa too. For example, the common Sambahsa word for "person" is ''anghen'', as in ''semanghen'' = "someone, somebody", and can be derived from PIE ''?*H₂enH₁ǵh'', only found in [[Old Armenian]] ''anjn'' (person) and [[Old Norse]] ''angi'' (smell). And ''motic'' (hoe) may be a cognate of [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''motyka'' and English [[Mattock#Etymology|"mattock"]].

===Further development from the Indo-European background===

Though Sambahsa, like any other conlang, has derivation rules, it sometimes uses [[backformation]] too. For example, the relation between [[Lithuania]]n ''bendras'' (companion), Old Greek ''pentheros'' (father-in-law) and Sanskrit ''bandhu-'' (companion) is uncertain;&lt;ref&gt;J.P Mallory &amp; D.Q. Adams, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; however Sambahsa "reconstructs" this root as ''behndwr'' from ''behnd'' 'to bind'. PIE has ''*dhéǵhom'' 'earth' and ''*dhinéǵh-'' (with nasal [[infix]]) 'to shape, to make pottery'; accordingly, Sambahsa has ''(di)ghom'' and ''dinegh'', but the latter can be understood as "to put earth on" if we refer to ''yug'' (yoke) and ''yuneg'' (to join), both from PIE ''*yugom'' and ''*yunég-''.

The Sambahsa word for 'ice pellet' is ''kersnit''; it rests on the word ''kersen'' 'frozen snow', itself from [[Old Norse]] ''hjarn'', Lithuanian ''šarma'' (frost) and Russian ''serën''.&lt;ref&gt;''ibidem'', p.287&lt;/ref&gt;  But the [[suffix]] ''-it'' was abstracted from PIE words like ''*sepit'' 'grain of wheat' and ''*H₂elbit'' 'grain of barley';&lt;ref&gt;''ibidem'', p.639&lt;/ref&gt; thus ''kersnit'' can be understood as 'a grain of frozen snow'.

===Words common to different language families===

A characteristic of Sambahsa is to include words found in different language families, while the most famous [[auxiliary languages]] tend to limit themselves to a compilation of [[Romance (love)|Romance]] vocabulary with some borrowings from the [[Germanic languages]]. For example:

* ''schkaf'' (cupboard) has cognates both in Germanic and [[Slavic languages]]: Russian [[:ru:Шкаф|Шкаф]], Polish [[:pl:Szafa|Szafa]], Ukrainian [[:uk:Шафа|Шафа]], Danish [[:da:Skab|Skab]], Icelandic [[:is:Skápur|Skàpur]], Franconian dialect [[:ksh:Schaaf|Schaaf]] and Swedish [[:sv:Skåp|Skåp]].
* ''Graf'' (count, as a nobility title) is a German word from Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Graf|title=Graf – Wiktionary|website=de.wiktionary.org|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "grapheùs" that has been borrowed into many languages including Azerbaijani [[:az:Qraf|Qraf]], Bulgarian [[:bg:Граф|Граф]], Czech [[:cs:Hrabě|Hrabě]], Danish [[:da:Greve (rang)|Greve]], Estonian [[:et:Krahv|Krahv]], Croatian [[:hr:Grof|Grof]], Hungarian [[:hu:Gróf|Gróf]], Finnish [[:fi:Kreivi|Kreivi]], Lithuanian [[:lt:Grafas (titulas)|Grafas]], Icelandic [[:is:Greifi|Greifi]] and Russian [[:ru:Граф (титул)|Граф]].
* ''Bicair'' (mug) is found in German [[:de:Becher|Becher]] and many other Germanic languages. It comes from [[Low Latin]] ''bicarium'' and is at the origin of Hungarian [[:hu:Pohár|Pohár]], Italian [[:it:Bicchiere|Bicchiere]] and Romanian [[:ro:Pahar|Pahar]], all meaning "glass".
* Sambahsa ''saray'' means "big hall, palace" and has the same Turkish and Persian origin as English ''[[Seraglio#cite note-0|seraglio]]'' but with a meaning closer to its etymology and to Russian [http://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9 сарай] (barn).

===The [[Balkan sprachbund]]===

Though they belong to different language families{{clarification needed|date=August 2017}}{{dubious|date=August 2017}}, the languages spoken in Southeast Europe share a number of common grammatical features and of loanwords due to their historical background{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. That's why Sambahsa includes words from this region.

* Sambahsa ''schut'' = "hornless" corresponds to Romanian [[:ro:Șut|Șut]], Bulgarian/Serbo-Croatian šut; also Albanian shut ‘hornless’.
* Sambahsa ''potire'' = "pitcher" comes from Old Greek ''ποτήρ'', like Serbo-Craotian [[:en:путир|путир]], Russian [[:ru:потир|потир]], Romanian and Albanian ''potir''.
* Sambahsa ''keramide'' = "coating" comes from Greek [[:el:κεραμίδα|κεραμίδα]], which has given, among others, Romanian [[:ro:cărămidă|cărămidă]] (brick) and Arabic قرميدة = qirmîda(t) = "tile".

===Words from Arabic and Persian===

A significant part of Sambahsa's vocabulary comes from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Both languages have extensively provided loanwords to a lexical continuum ranging from the Atlantic Ocean to Indonesia because, respectively, of the spread of [[Islam]] and the brilliance of the former Persian civilization. Sambahsa learning materials often call this stratum "Muslim".

* Sambahsa ''amlak'' (assets) comes from Arabic ''أملاك'' and is found in Turkish [[emlak]] (estate) and Persian [[:en:املاک|املاک]]. 
* Sambahsa ''zina'' (adultery) comes from Arabic زنا and is found in Persian and many other languages spoken by a majority of Muslims. 
* Sambahsa ''adarb'' (merlon) comes from Spanish [[:es:Adarve|Adarve]] and Portuguese [[:pt:Adarve|Adarve]] from Arabic درب and ultimately Persian در which has its origin in PIE [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/d%CA%B0wer-#Proto-Indo-European *dhwer] just like Sambahsa ''dwer'' = "door".

===Sinitic vocabulary===

[[Classical Chinese]] has heavily influenced the wordstock of neighbouring languages, mostly Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. As a result, Sambahsa incorporates some "Sinitic" vocabulary, but the phonetic differences between these various languages can be high.

* Sambahsa ''kjingyow'' (goldfish) correspond to 金魚, which is read ''jīnyú'' in Mandarin Pinyin and ''kingyo'' in Japanese.
* Sambahsa ''geong'' (fortified palace) corresponds to the Han character 城 read ''chéng'' in Mandarin Pinyin, ''jō'' in Japanese Goon reading, ''seong'' in Korean, and ''thành'' in Vietnamese.

Not all Sambahsa "Sinitic" words come from Classical Chinese. The [[Min Nan]] language of Southern China provided loanwords to some South-East Asian languages, and some of these borrowings are, in turn, found in Sambahsa.

* Sambahsa ''pangsit'' ([[wonton]]) is an Indonesian word from Min Nan ''pian sit'', while Mandarin Chinese (Pinyin) has ''húndùn''
* Likewise, Sambahsa ''loteng'' (attic) comes from Min Nan ''lauteng'' through Indonesian [[:id:Loteng|Loteng]].

&lt;center&gt; '''THE STORY SO FAR''' &lt;/center&gt;

{{quotation|In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai. There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.

The Kai monks are masters of their art, and the children in their charge love and respect them in spite of the hardships of their training. For one day when they have finally learnt the secret skills of the Kai, they will return to their homes equipped in mind and body to defend themselves against the constant threat of war from the Darklords of the west.

In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged war on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darklord armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called 'Sommerswerd', the sword of the sun. Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar.

Now it is in the morning of the feast of Fehmarn, when all of the Kai Lords are present at the monastery for the celebrations. Suddenly a great black cloud comes from out of the western skies. So many are the numbers of the black-winged beasts that fill the sky, that the sun is completely hidden. The Darklords, ancient enemy of the Sommlending are attacking. War has begun.

On this fateful morning, you, Silent Wolf (the name given to you by the Kai) have been sent to collect firewood in the forest as a punishment for your inattention in class. As you are preparing to return, you see to your horror a vast cloud of black leathery creatures swoop down and engulf the monastery.

Dropping the wood, you race to the battle that has already begun. But in the unnatural dark, you stumble and strike your head on a low tree branch. As you lose consciousness, the last thing that you see in the poor light are the walls of the monastery crashing to the ground.

Many hours pass before you awake. With tears in your eyes you now survey the scene of destruction. Raising your face to the clear sky, you swear vengeance on the Darklords for the massacre of the Kai warriors, and with a sudden flash of realization you know what you must do. You must set off on a perilous journey to the capital city to warn the King of the terrible threat that now faces his people. For you are now the last of the Kai--you are now the Lone Wolf.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">'''Secondary orality''' is a concept in the work of scholar [[Walter J. Ong]], as first described in his book ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'', published in 1982 (2nd ed. 2002), [[Walter J. Ong]] and discussing the differences between oral and literate cultures. 

In this book, Ong used the phrase ‘secondary orality’, describing it as “essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print” (Ong, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;133).&lt;ref&gt;Ong, W. J. (1982). ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing the Word''. New York: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his way of thinking, secondary orality is not primary orality, the [[orality]] of pre-literate cultures. Oral societies operated on [[polychronic time]], with many things happening at once—socialization played a great role in the operation of these cultures, memory and memorization were of greater importance, increasing the amount of copiousness and redundancy. Oral cultures were additive rather than subordinate, closer to the human life world, and more situational and participatory than the more abstract qualities of literate cultures. 

Secondary orality is orality that is dependent on literate culture and the existence of writing, such as a television anchor reading the news or radio. While it exists in sound, it does not have the features of primary orality because it presumes and rests upon literate thought and expression, and may even be people reading written material. Thus, secondary orality is usually not as repetitive, redundant, agonistic, etc. the way primary orality is, and cultures that have a lot of secondary orality are not necessarily similar to primarily oral cultures. Secondary orality should not be confused with "oral residue" in which a culture has not fully transitioned to literate / written culture and retains many of the characteristics of primary oral cultures. Secondary orality is a phenomenon of post-literacy era, whereas oral residue is a stage in the transition from pre-literate to literate.

==The Gutenberg Parenthesis==
Ong notes that human communication has been dominated by oral culture, and the first signs of literacy date only 6 000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Pettitt, Associate Professor of English at the University of Southern Denmark, agrees with Ong, ''et al.'', by considering literate learning more the anomaly than the rule.  He considers this to be a post-Gutenberg era where knowledge is formed through digital media, delivered over the internet.  Calling the previous 500 years a "Gutenberg Parenthesis", he explains that before Gutenberg, knowledge was formed orally and, now, in this post-Gutenberg era, knowledge is formed—increasingly—through "secondary orality" on the Internet. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, Tom ''Before the Gutenberg Parenthesis: Elizabethan-American Compatibilties'' https://www.academia.edu/2946207/Before_the_Gutenberg_Parenthesis_Elizabethan-American_Compatibilities&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Professor Lars Ole Sauerberg. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

==McLuhan's Global Village==
In [[The Gutenberg Galaxy]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] discussed his notion of the "[[Global Village (term)|global village]]", a concept that can be related to Ong's account of secondary orality.  Liliana Bounegru notes the emergence of social media (e.g. [[Facebook]]) and microblogging (i.e.[[Twitter]]) are re-[[Tribalism|tribalizing]] our cultures.  Conversations in these social spaces are written, but are more conversational in tone than written communications; they are "rapid communication with large groups of people in a speed that would resemble oral storytelling, without having to share the same physical space with your audience." &lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana 'Secondary Orality in Microblogging' at Masters of Media. [http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2008/10/13/secondary-orality-in-microblogging/]  Bounegru is Project Coordinator at the European Journalism Centre, Maastricht, NL and a MA candidate in Media Studies, University of Amsterdam.

'''Selfless service''' or '''Seva''' ({{lang-pa|ਸੇਵਾ}}) in [[Sikhism]], its [[History of Sikhism|ordained philosophy]], in [[Sikh scripture]], the [[Guru Granth Sahib|theology]], and [[:Category:Sikh scripture|hermeneutics]] is a service which is performed without any expectation of result or award for performing it. Such services can be performed to benefit other human beings or society. "Seva is an old Sanskrit term, which originally referred to the service performed by members of the low castes to those of the higher castes". A more recent interpretation of the word is "dedication to others".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Schlecker Markus |first= Fleischer Friederike |date= June 14, 2013 |title=Ethnographies of Social Support |url= |location= |publisher= |page=180 |isbn=1137330961 |author-link= } &lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
[[File:Kar Sewa at Durbar Sahib (5251781780).jpg|thumb|Kar Sewa at Durbar Sahib.]]
The idea of selfless service (''seva'' also ''sewa'') is an important concept in a number of religions because [[God]] is perceived as having an interest in the well-being of others as well as oneself; serving other people is considered an essential devotional practice of indirectly serving God and living a religious life that is a benefit to others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhphilosophy.net/sakhis/26236-sewa-selfless-service.html Sewa, Selfless Service] sikhphilosophy.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service." [[Bhagavad Gita]], 3.14&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-17/edit-page/29665924_1_service-divine-grace-master Selfless service] The Times of India, Jun 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The term is used in military awards such as, [[Ati Vishisht Seva Medal]] (AVSM), [[Param Vishisht Seva Medal]] (PVSM), and institutions like [[Seva Foundation]], [[Gandhi Seva Sadan]], Seva Development and [[Seva Bharati]].

[[File:Anger during a protest by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Two people in a shouting match over religion]]
A '''shouting match''' is an [[argument]] or [[debate]] characterized by the loud volume or intensity of the participants.

==Parliamentary procedures==
Large assemblies may easily degenerate into shouting matches as the participants raise their voices just in order to be heard.  To control this tendency towards chaos, rules of conduct such as [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 391-394}}"Decorum in Debate"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productive confrontation==
Some assemblies may choose this form of discourse deliberately so that creative contributions are not stifled by formal rules.  The [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] working parties to establish a definitive new reference work for [[mathematic]]s were conducted in this way, being described as “''Two or three monologues shouted at top voice, seemingly independently of one another''” by [[Armand Borel]], who attributed the success of this process to the commitment and hard work of the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199803/borel.pdf|format=PDF|title=Twenty-Five Years with Nicolas Bourbaki, 1949–1973|author=Armand Borel|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[General Electric]] company, the successful chief executive, [[Jack Welch]], forced his managers to justify their positions by intensive argument that often became shouting matches.  The result was to make the management confront reality and motivate them to make their proposals work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=341–2|title=General Electric: Life After Jack|author=RM Grant|publisher=Blackwell|url=https://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/16GE.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123020734/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/16GE.pdf|archivedate=2009-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In commerce==
Shouting matches should be avoided in commercial interactions between customers and suppliers because they tend to poison relations between the parties and so reduce the possibility of a productive deal.  Training and role-playing may be used to develop the [[emotional intelligence]] required to handle such situations effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Emotional intelligence – training people to be affective so they can be effective|author=Mike Bagshaw|journal=Industrial and Commercial Training|year=2000|volume=32|issue=2|pages=61–65|issn=0019-7858|doi=10.1108/00197850010320699|publisher=MCB UP Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In public situations such as a nightclub or bar, staff that get into shouting matches with patrons look badly unprofessional.  If they instead ignore the insults, the intoxicated customers will get frustrated and leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=St5L-UYiPD8C|title=The Nightclub, Bar and Restaurant Security Handbook|author=Robert McManus, Sean O'Toole|isbn=978-0-9647209-0-9|year=1995|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online==
Online communication in internet forums commonly takes the form of a shouting match, sometimes using ALL CAPS to denote shouting.  This is due to the anonymity which reduces the possibility of sanction for intemperate speech.  So, rather than a listening and rational exchange, the format fosters rage and aggression which results in extreme opinions and insults.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKqDnulJqDsC|pages=104–5|title=Crime and Punishment in Contemporary Culture|author=Claire Valier|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-28175-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As social ritual==
The [[Yanomamo]] people of the [[Orinoco]] are known as ''The Fierce People''.  When two tribes meet for a feast, their chiefs start by engaging in a ritualised shouting match in which they ostensibly engage in fierce conflict but, by their rhythmic interaction, establish a satisfying bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_prAAAAMAAJ|pages=255|title=Emotions and Psychopathology|author=Manfred Clynes, Jaak Panksepp|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-306-42916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=30|title=The Silent Pulse: A Search for the Perfect Rhythm That Exists in Each of Us|author=George Leonard|publisher=Gibbs Smith|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4236-0122-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_F0hhN3IrAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Summer Morning near the Angel Springs Trailhead of Myra-Bellevue Park.webm|thumb|Summer understory growing near the Angel Springs Trailhead of Myra-Bellevue Park]]

In [[forestry]] and [[ecology]], '''understory''' (or '''understorey''', '''underbrush''', '''undergrowth''') comprises plant life growing beneath the [[Canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] without penetrating it to any great extent, but above the [[forest floor]]. Only a small percentage of light penetrates the canopy so understory vegetation is generally [[Shade tolerance|shade tolerant]]. The understory typically consists of trees stunted through lack of light, other small trees with low light requirements, saplings, shrubs, vines and undergrowth. Small trees such as [[holly]] and [[Cornus (genus)|dogwood]] are understory specialists.

In [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|temperate deciduous forests]], many understory plants start into growth earlier than the canopy trees to make use of the greater availability of light at this time of year. A gap in the canopy caused by the death of a tree stimulates the potential emergent trees into competitive growth as they grow upwards to fill the gap. These trees tend to have straight trunks and few lower branches. At the same time, the bushes, undergrowth and plant life on the forest floor become more dense. The understory experiences greater humidity than the canopy, and the shaded ground does not vary in temperature as much as open ground. This causes a proliferation of ferns, mosses and fungi and encourages [[biogeochemical cycle|nutrient recycling]], which provides favorable [[habitat]]s for many [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s.

==Understory structure==
The understory is the underlying layer of vegetation in a forest or wooded area, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor. 
[[Plant]]s in the understory comprise an assortment of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees together with [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist]] understory [[shrub]]s and herbs. Young canopy [[tree]]s often persist in the understory for decades as suppressed juveniles until an opening in the forest overstory permits their growth into the canopy. In contrast understory [[shrub]]s complete their [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] in the shade of the forest canopy. Some smaller tree species, such as [[dogwood]] and [[holly]], rarely grow tall and generally are understory trees.

The canopy of a [[rainforest]] is typically about 10m (33ft) thick, and intercepts around 95% of the sunlight.&lt;ref name=Garden.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Light in the Rain Forest|url=http://assoc.garden.org/courseweb/course1/week4/page5a.htm |website=garden.org |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understory receive less intense light than plants in the canopy and such light as does penetrate is impoverished in [[wavelength]]s of light that are most effective for photosynthesis. Understory plants therefore must be [[shade tolerant]]&amp;mdash;they must be able to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] adequately using such light as does reach their leaves.  They often are able to use wavelengths that canopy plants cannot. In [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate deciduous forests]] towards the end of the leafless season, understory plants take advantage of the shelter of the still leafless canopy plants to "leaf out" before the canopy trees do. This is important because it provides the understory plants with a window in which to photosynthesize without the canopy shading them. This brief period (usually 1&amp;ndash;2 weeks) is often a crucial period in which the plant can maintain a net positive [[carbon cycle|carbon balance]] over the course of the year.

As a rule forest understories also experience higher [[humidity]] than exposed areas. The forest canopy reduces solar radiation, so the ground does not heat up or cool down as rapidly as open ground. Consequently, the understory dries out more slowly than more exposed areas do. The greater humidity encourages [[epiphyte]]s such as ferns and mosses, and allows [[fungi]] and other decomposers to flourish. This drives [[biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]], and provides favorable [[microclimate]]s for many [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s, such as the [[pygmy marmoset]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, D. M., G. Johnson, O. Kiirats, G. E. Edwards. 2004. New fluorescence parameters for the determination  of Q redox state and excitation energy fluxes. Photosynthesis Research 79:209-218&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[German language|German]], a '''Vorstadt''' is an area of a city, outside the [[Altstadt]] or the city centre, but tightly connected to it and densely populated, thus distinguished from ''[[Vorort]]e''.

Historically, a ''Vorstadt'' was a settlement outside the [[city wall]]s, sometimes dedicated to specific [[trade (profession)|trade]]s. Later, large Vorstädte appeared in [[Gründerzeit]] era. Places named ''Vorstadt'' include [[Vorstadt (Königsberg)]] and [[Oranienburger Vorstadt]].

Its French equivalent is ''[[faubourg]]''.

==Vienna==
In [[Vienna]], the historical ''Vorstädte'' need to be distinguished from the ''[[Vorort]]e''. The Vorstädte were located outside the city walls, but within the ''[[Linienwall]]'', a second ring of fortifications outside the city. The city walls were located in the place of the modern [[Ringstraße]], while the ''Linienwall'' has been removed to give way for the ''[[Gürtel, Vienna|Gürtel]]'' (both being rings of streets around the central city). Thus, the ''Vorstädte'' correspond to the so-called "inner districts" of Vienna ([[Leopoldstadt|2nd]] to [[Alsergrund|9th]] and [[Brigittenau|20th]] districts).

The '''Welsh Language Act 1993''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/38/contents Welsh Language Act 1993&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which put the [[Welsh language]] on an equal footing with the [[English language]] in [[Wales]] with regard to the [[public sector]].

The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]] had made English the only language of public administration in Wales. The Welsh Courts Act 1942&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/5-6/40/enacted Welsh Courts Act 1942]&lt;/ref&gt; removed any doubt about the right to use Welsh in courts providing that the Welsh speaker was under a disadvantage in having to speak English, but this was very narrowly defined by subsequent case law. The [[Welsh Language Act 1967]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/66/contents Welsh Language Act 1967 (repealed 21.12.1993)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; overturned these decisions and gave rise to the concept of 'equal validity' between the Welsh and English languages. As a result, Governmental Departments began preparing documents in Welsh, and following a campaign of destroying or vandalising unilingual English road signs by members of [[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]] (The Welsh Language Society), local councils were allowed to provide many bilingual signs in Wales. It was however the Welsh Language Act 1993 which established that 'in the course of public business and the administration of justice, so far as is reasonably practicable, the Welsh and English languages are to be treated on the basis of equality.' 

The Act achieved three things:

* setting up the [[Welsh Language Board]], answerable to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]], with the duty of promoting the use of Welsh and ensuring compliance with the other provisions.
* giving Welsh speakers the right to speak Welsh in court proceedings.
* obliging all organisations in the public sector providing services to the public in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis.

The powers given to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] under this Act were later devolved to the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. Delegated or secondary legislation has been made under this Act by the Secretary of State, and subsequently the National Assembly requiring more public bodies to prepare what are known as [[Welsh Language Schemes]] which show their commitment to the 'equality of treatment' principle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14194">'''Windows Glyph List 4''', or more commonly '''WGL4''' for short, also known as the ''Pan-European character set'', is a [[character (computing)|character]] repertoire on recent Microsoft operating systems comprising 657 [[Unicode]] characters. Its purpose is to provide an implementation guideline for producers of fonts for the representation of [[Languages of Europe|European]] [[natural language]]s; fonts that provide [[glyph]]s for the entire set of characters can claim WGL4 compliance and thus can expect to be compatible with a wide range of software.

{{As of|2004}}, WGL4 characters were the only ones guaranteed to display correctly on Microsoft Windows. More recent versions of Windows display far more glyphs.

Because many fonts are designed to fulfill the WGL4 set, this set of characters is likely to work (display as other than [[replacement glyph]]s) on many computer systems. For instance your browser is probably able to draw all the characters in the table below except for the two private use, compared to the many missing characters that may be seen in other articles about Unicode.

==Repertoire==
The repertoire, defined by [[Microsoft]], encompasses all the characters found in &lt;!--rework in progress but need to check all the character sets i'm adding.------ the following single byte [[windows code pages|code pages used by windows]].

It does not cover the combining diacritics used by Vietnamese-related [[code page 1258]], the Thai letters used in [[code page 874]], Hebrew and Arabic letters covered by code pages [[windows-1255|1255]] and [[windows-1256|1256]], or the ideographic characters used by code pages [[Code page 932 (Microsoft Windows)|932]], [[Code page 1386|936]], [[Windows-949|949]] and [[Code page 950|950]].

It also does not cover the Romanian letters [[Ș]], [[ș]], [[Ț]], and [[ț]] (U+0218–B), which were added to several of Microsoft’s fonts for [[Windows Vista]] (long after the WGL4 repertoire was originally defined).

In version 1.5 of the OpenType Specification (May 2008) four Cyrillic characters were added to the WGL4 character set: [[Ѐ]] (U+0400), [[Ѝ]] (U+040D), [[ѐ]] (U+0450) and [[ѝ]] (U+045D).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
