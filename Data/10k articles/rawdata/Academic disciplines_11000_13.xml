The dictionary contains 1285 entries  on 196 pages. The publication states that it was "designed to provide teachers and students with a concise collection of definitions and explanations of items that are mentioned in or are otherwise associated with the Bible."&lt;ref name = preface&gt;{{citation |publisher= LDS Church |title= Bible Dictionary |contribution-url= http://classic.scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/contents |contribution=Preface |year= 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS ''Bible Dictionary'' was created in the 1970s by the Scriptures Publications Committee of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Mortimer |first= William James |authorlink= William James Mortimer |contribution= Bible: LDS Publication of the Bible |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5508 |pages= 110–111 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

Monson]], then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]. The committee delegated the responsibility of creating an LDS bible dictionary to [[Robert J. Matthews]], a [[Brigham Young University]] Professor of Ancient Scripture.&lt;ref name = LFA&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Lavina Fielding Anderson |first= Lavina Fielding |last= Anderson |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/10/church-publishes-first-lds-edition-of-the-bible?lang=eng |title= Church Publishes First LDS Edition of the Bible |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=October 1979 |page= 9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews gained permission from [[Cambridge University Press]] to use their bible dictionary as the template for the LDS version.&lt;ref name = LFA/&gt;

Matthews adjusted many of the entries to reflect LDS modifications of traditional Christian beliefs and also added a number of entries to address doctrines taught exclusively by the LDS Church. However, the majority of the content of the ''Bible Dictionary'' is identical to the Cambridge publication. The secretary of the committee was [[William James Mortimer]].

The LDS ''Bible Dictionary'' is published in all English-language versions of the Bible printed by the church except for of the barebones KJV Bible distributed free of charge by [[Mormon missionaries]]. In other LDS-printed Bibles, it is found on pages 599 to 793 of the appendix materials, immediately following the Topical Guide and immediately preceding excerpts from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]. The LDS Church provides the complete contents of the [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/ Bible Dictionary online].

Despite being packaged with the LDS publication of the Bible, the ''Bible Dictionary'' is not part of the LDS Church's [[Standard Works|open canon of scripture]]. Its preface states, "It is not intended as an official or revealed endorsement by the Church of the doctrinal, historical, cultural, and other matters set forth."&lt;ref name = preface/&gt;

==Career==
King-Okumu has worked with the [[United Nations University]] (UNU),&lt;ref name="Daley"/&gt; [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD),&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt; and [[International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas]] (ICARDA).&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICARDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Caroline|title=Water &amp;  Livelihoods Initiative|url=http://www.icarda.org/wli/pdfs/FirthRegionalCoordinationMeeting/Introduction_WLIRegionalAgenda_11_05.pdf|website=ICARDA|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has consulted with the Ecosystems and Human Development Association (EHDA)&lt;ref name="Jaafar"/&gt; and has been a Visiting Research Associate at the School of Geography and Environment at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Jaafar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster-Wallace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuster-Wallace|first1=Corinne J.|last2=Grover|first2=Velma I.|last3=Adeel|first3=Zafar|last4=Confalonieri|first4=Ulisses|last5=Elliott|first5=Susan|title=Safe Water as the Key to Global Health|url=http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SafeWater_Web_version.pdf|publisher=United Nations University|date=2008|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently she is a senior researcher in the Climate Change Group of the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED)&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toulmin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toulmin|first1=Camilla|last2=Hesse|first2=Ced|last3=Tari|first3=Daoud|last4=King–Okumu|first4=Caroline|title=Investing in institutional ‘software’ to build climate resilience|url=http://www.aglobalvillage.org/journal/online/iied/|website=A Global Village|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[London, England]]. IIED is an international organization engaged in policy and action research to support sustainable local development in countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Pacific]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iied.org/about|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King-Okumu studies methods for the sustainable integrated management of water and land in dryland ecosystems, and economic and environmental assessment techniques for calculating the costs of groundwater degradation. She encourages initiatives for decision-making in the context of longer-term considerations of increasing variability and climate change.  She works to develop in-country partnerships engaging government, research institutions, civic groups and the private sector, to support sustainable practices and community-based adaptation and to increase climate change resilience.&lt;ref name="IIED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline King-Okumu|url=http://www.iied.org/users/caroline-king-okumu|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner"/&gt;

King-Okumu analyzes situations in terms of a nexus of interlinked water, energy, and food production concerns rather than focusing solely on water balance and food production.&lt;ref name="Jaafar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Caroline|last2=Jaafar|first2=Hadi|title=Rapid assessment of the water–energy–food–climate nexus in six selected basins of North Africa and West Asia undergoing transitions and scarcity threats|journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development|date=22 April 2015|volume=31|issue=3|pages=343–359|doi=10.1080/07900627.2015.1026436|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07900627.2015.1026436?src=recsys|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale for civic education in the United States ==

The promotion of a republic and its values has been an important concern for policy-makers – to impact people´s political perceptions, to encourage political participation, and to foster the principles enshrined in the Constitution (e.g. liberty, freedom of speech, civil rights). The subject of “Civics” has been integrated into the Curriculum and Content Standards, to enhance the comprehension of democratic values in the educational system. Civic literature has found that “engaging young children in civic activities from an early age is a positive predictor of their participation in later civic life”.&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"&gt;Bers, Marina Umaschi. (2008). “Civic Identities, Online Technologies: From Designing Civic Curriculum to Supporting Civic Experiences." ''Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth''. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008, pp. 139–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an academic subject, Civics has the instructional objective to promote knowledge that is aligned with self-governance and participation in matters of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen C. Lagemann &amp; Harry R. Lewis. (2012). “Renewing Civic Education: Time to Restore American Higher Education's Lost Mission” (Harvard Magazine, March-Apr).&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives advocate for an instruction that encourages active student participation in democratic decision-making environments, such as voting to elect a course representative for a school government, or deciding on actions that will affect the school environment or community. Thus the intersection of individual and collective decision making activities, are critical to shape “individual´s moral development”.&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"/&gt; To reach those goals, civic instructors must promote the adoption of certain skills and attitudes such as “respectful argumentation, debate, information literacy”, to support “the development of morally responsible individuals who will shape a morally responsible and civically minded society".&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"/&gt; In the 21st century, young people are less interested in direct political participation (i.e. being in a political party or even voting), but are motivated to use digital media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Digital media enable young people to share and exchange ideas rapidly, enabling the coordination of local communities that promote volunteerism and political activism, in topics principally related to human rights and  environmental subjects.&lt;ref name="Bennett, W. Lance 2008 pp.1"&gt;Bennett, W. Lance. (2008). “Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age." ''Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth''. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008, pp.1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people are constructing and supporting their political identities in the 21st century by using social media, and digital tools (e.g. text messaging, hashtags, videos) to share, post, reply an opinion or attitude about a political/social topic and to promote social mobilization and support through online mechanism to a wide and diverse audience. Therefore, civics' end-goal in the 21st century must be oriented to “empower the learners to find issues in their immediate communities that seem important to the people with whom they live and associate”, once “learners have identified with a personal issue and participated in constructing a collective framing for common issues”.&lt;ref name="Bennett, W. Lance 2008 pp.1"/&gt;

== Current state of civic education in the United States ==

According to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, one of the purposes of Civic Education is to “foster civic competence and responsibility”  which is promoted through the Center for Civic Education’s We the People and Project Citizen initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-110, § 115, Stat. 1425 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is a lack of consensus for how this mission should be pursued.  The Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning &amp; Engagement (CIRCLE) reviewed state civic education requirements in the United States for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Godsay, S., Henderson, W., Levine, P., Littenberg-Tobias, J., &amp; CIRCLE (The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and, E). (2012). State Civic Education Requirements. CIRCLE Fact Sheet. Center For Information And Research On Civic Learning And Engagement (CIRCLE).&lt;/ref&gt;  The findings include:
* All 50 states have social studies standards which include civics and government.
* 40 states require at least one course in government/civics.
* 21 states require a state-mandated social studies test which is a decrease from 2001 (34 states).
* 8 states require students to take a state-mandated government/civics test.
* 9 states require a social studies test as a requirement for high school graduation.
The lack of state-mandated student accountability relating to civics may be a result of a shift in emphasis towards reading and mathematics in response to the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Nora. (2011) "Few States Test Students on Civics." ''Education Week, 32 (08).''  Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/10/11/08civics.h32.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is a movement to require that states utilize the citizenship test as a graduation requirement, but this is seen as a controversial solution to some educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://civiceducator.org/tests-wont-fix-civics-education/|title=Hey Policy Makers! Tests Are Not the Answer for Better Civics Education|date=2017-09-13|work=The Civic Educator|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are also demonstrating that their civic knowledge leaves much to be desired.  A National Center for Education Statistics NAEP report card for civics (2010) stated that “levels of civic knowledge in U.S. have remained unchanged or even declined over the past century”. Specifically, only 24 percent of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders were at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in civics.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics (2011). The Nation’s Report Card: Civics 2010 (NCES 2011–466). Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, civic education has emphasized the facts of government processes detached from participatory experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, A. (2015). Citizenship education in American schools and its role in developing civic engagement: a review of the research.Educational Review, 67(1), 35–63. {{doi|10.1080/00131911.2013.813440}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an effort to combat the existing approach, the National Council for the Social Studies developed the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards.  The C3 Framework emphasizes “new and active approaches” including the “discussion of controversial issues and current events, deliberation of public issues, service-learning, action civics, participation in simulation and role play, and the use of digital technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS). (2013), The College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards: Guidance for Enhancing the Rigor of K–12 Civics, Economics, Geography, and History. Silver Spring, MD: NCSS.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civic education in the United States in the 21st century ==

According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, among teens 12–17 years old, 95% have access to the Internet, 70% go online daily, 80% use social networking sites, and 77% have cell phones.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2007"&gt;Jenkins, H. (2007). "Confronting the challenges of participatory culture: Media education for the 21st century." Chicago: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, participatory culture has become a staple for today’s youth, affecting their conceptualization of civic participation.  They use Web 2.0 tools (i.e. blogs, podcasts, wikis, social media) to: circulate information (blogs and podcasts); collaborate with peers (wikis); produce and exchange media; and connect with people around the world via social media and online communities.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Lenhart, Mary Madden, Aaron Smith, Kristen Purcell, Kathryn Zickuhr and Lee Rainie, Teens, Kindness and Cruelty on Social Network Sites: How American teens navigate the new world of “digital citizenship” (Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, November 2011),&lt;nowiki&gt;http://pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2011/PIP_Teens_Kindness_Cruelty_SNS_Report_Nov_2011_FINAL_110711.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed on October 8, 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;  The pervasiveness of participatory digital tools has led to a shift in the way adolescents today perceive civic action and participation. Whereas 20th century civic education embraced the belief of “dutiful citizenship” and civic engagement as a “matter of duty or obligation;” 21st century civic education has shifted to reflect youths' “personally expressive politics” and “peer-to-peer relationships” that promote civic engagement.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2007"/&gt;

This shift in students' perceptions has led to classroom civic education experiences that reflect the digital world in which 21st century youth now live, in order to make the content both relevant and meaningful.  Civics education classrooms in the 21st century now seek to provide genuine opportunities to actively engage in the consumption, circulation, discussion, and production of civic and political content via Web 2.0 technologies such as blogging, wikis, and social media.&lt;ref&gt;Don Tapscott, ''Growing up digital: The rise of the net generation'' ( New York: McGraw-Hill, 1997); W. Lance Bennett, Deen Freelon and Chris Wells, “Changing Citizen Identity and the Rise of a Participatory Media Culture,” in Lonnie R. Sherrod, Judith Torney-Purta and Constance A. Flanagan (Eds.), ''Handbook of Research on Civic Engagement in Youth'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these tools offer new ways for engagement, interaction, and dialogue, educators have also recognized the need to teach youth how to interact both respectfully and productively with their peers and members of online communities.  As a result, many school districts have also begun adopting Media Literacy Frameworks for Engaged Citizenship as a pedagogical approach to prepare students for active participatory citizenship in today’s digital age.  This model includes critical analysis of digital media as well as a deep understanding of media literacy as a “collaborative and participatory movement that aims to empower individuals to have a voice and to use it.”&lt;ref&gt;All Together Now: Collaboration and Innovation for Youth Engagement: The Report of the Commission on Youth Voting and Civic Knowledge (Medford, MA: Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, 2013),  www.civicyouth.org/about-circle/ commission-on-youth-voting-civic-knowledge/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihailidis, P., &amp; Thevenin, B.

[[File:Critica Botanica 1737.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|Title page of [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s ''Critica Botanica'' of 1737.]]
'''''Critica Botanica''''' ("Critique of botany", Leiden, July, 1737) was written by Swedish [[botanist]], [[physician]], [[zoologist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778). The book was published in Germany when Linnaeus was twenty-nine with a discursus by the botanist [[Johannes Browallius]] (1707–1755), bishop of Åbo. The first and only edition was published in July 1737 under the full title ''Critica botanica in qua nomina plantarum generica, specifica &amp; variantia examini subjiciuntur, selectoria confirmantur, indigna rejiciuntur; simulque doctrina circa denominationem plantarum traditur. Seu Fundamentorum botanicorum pars IV Accedit Johannis Browallii De necessitate historiae naturalis discursus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JHsZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT55&amp;dq=Critica+botanica&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crlrTIa1EY-iuQPW1pDaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Full view and pdf download]&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus’s principles of botanical nomenclature were first expounded in ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'' ("Foundations of botany") of 1736 chapters VII to X which contained the aphorisms (principles) 210 to 324 that outlined the rules for the acceptance and formation of names. These were later elaborated, with numerous examples, in his ''Critica Botanica'' of 1737.  The practical application of these rules was soon seen in subsequent publications such as ''[[Flora Lapponica]]'' ("Flora of Lapland", 1737), ''[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]'' ("In honour of Clifford's garden", 1738),  and ''[[Flora Svecica]]'' ("Flora of Sweden", 1746). Together the ''Fundamenta'' and ''Critica'' summarised Linnaeus's thoughts on plant [[nomenclature]] and [[plant classification|classification]] which he later revised and elaborated in his ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'' of 1751.

In the ''Critica'' Linnaeus presented a series of rules which guided him in his own publications, established standards of procedure for his followers, and led him to discard on a grand scale the names used by his predecessors. Many of his canons have long since been disregarded, but they ensured that modern botanical nomenclature at least began with a series of well-formed, euphonious and convenient names.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1983, pp. 283–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the objectives of the ''Critica'' it is first necessary to appreciate the state of botanical nomenclature at the time of Linnaeus. In accordance with the provisions of the present-day [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] the starting point for the scientific names of plants effectively dates back to the list of species enumerated in Linnaeus’s ''Species Plantarum'', ed. 1, published 1 May 1753.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"&gt;Sprague, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Species Plantarum'' was, for European scientists, a comprehensive global [[Flora]] for its day, and by the 10th edition had reached over 3000 species.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"/&gt; Linnaeus had learned plant names as short descriptive phrases (polynomials) known as ''nomina specifica''.  Each time a new species was described the diagnostic phrase-names had to be adjusted, and lists of names, especially those including synonyms (alternative names for the same plant) became extremely unwieldy. Linnaeus’s solution was to associate with the generic name an additional single word, what he termed the ''nomen triviale'', to designate a species. Linnaeus emphasized that this was simply a matter of convenience, it was not to replace the diagnostic ''nomen specificum''. But over time the ''nomen triviale'' became the “real” name and the ''nomen specificum'' became the Latin “diagnosis” that must, according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, accompany the description of all new plant species: it was that part of the plant description distinguishing that particular species from all others.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"/&gt; Linnaeus did not invent the binomial system but he was the person who provided the theoretical framework that lead to its universal acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1217341 | author = Svenson, Henry K. | year = 1953 | title = Linnaeus and the Species Problem | jstor = 1217341| journal = Taxon | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 55–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second word of the binomial, the ''nomen triviale'' as Linnaeus called it, is now known as the ''specific epithet'' and the two words, the ''generic name'' and ''specific epithet'' together make up the ''species name''.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, George H.M. 1951. ''Taxonomy of Vascular Plants''. New York: Macmillan. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context of Linnaean publications==
{{Main article| Carl Linnaeus}}
[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Carl Linnaeus]]  (1707–1778) who established the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] of [[plant nomenclature]].]]
''[[Systema Naturæ]]'' was Linnaeus’s early attempt to organise nature.&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1735. ''Systema naturae.'' Leiden: Theodor Haak.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in 1735 and in it he outlines his ideas for the hierarchical classification of the natural world (the “system of nature”) by dividing it into the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] (''Regnum animale''), the [[Plantae|plant kingdom]] (''Regnum vegetabile'') and the "[[mineral|mineral kingdom]]" (''Regnum lapideum'') each of which he further divided into classes, orders, genera and species, with [generic] characters, [specific] differences, synonyms, and places of occurrence. The tenth edition of this book in 1758 has been adopted as the starting point for [[zoological nomenclature]].&lt;ref name="Linn1758"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema Naturae. |publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |accessdate=2008-09-22 |language=Latin |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of 1735 was just eleven pages long, but this expanded with further editions until the final thirteenth edition of 1767 had reached over 3000 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1758. ''Systema naturae.'' Ed. 10. 2 vols. Stockholm: L. Salvius.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early eighteenth century colonial expansion and exploration created a demand for the description of thousands of new organisms. This highlighted difficulties in communication about plants, the replication of descriptions, and the importance of an agreed way of presenting, publishing and applying plant names. From about 1730 when Linnaeus was in his early twenties and still in Uppsala, Sweden, he planned a listing all the genera and species of plants known to western science in his day.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this could be achieved he needed to establish the principles of classification and nomenclature on which these works were to be based.&lt;ref&gt;Uggla, Arvid H. 1953. "The Preparation of the Species Plantarum." ''Taxon'' '''2'''(3): 60-62. p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''We can never hope for a lasting peace and better times till Botanists come to an agreement among themselves about the fixed laws in accordance with which judgment can be pronounced on names.''&lt;ref&gt;Hort, p. xxiii. (Preface)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Dutch period===
From 1735 to 1738 Linnaeus worked in the Netherlands where he was personal physician to [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] (1685–1760) a wealthy Anglo-Dutch merchant–banker with the [[Dutch East India Company]] who had an impressive garden containing four large glasshouses that were filled with tropical and sub-tropical plants collected overseas. Linnaeus was enthralled by these collections and prepared a detailed systematic catalogue of the plants in the garden, which he published in 1738 as ''Hortus Cliffortianus''. It was during this exceptionally productive period of his life that he published the works that were to lay the foundations for biological nomenclature. These were ''Fundamenta Botanica'' (1736) ("Foundations of botany"),&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1736. ''Fundamenta botanica.'' Amsterdam: Solomon Schouten.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]'' ("Botanical bibliography", 1736), and ''Critica Botanica'' (1737)&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1737. ''Critica botanica.'' Leiden: Conrad Wishoff.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon put his theoretical ideas into practice in his ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' ("Genera of plants", 1737),&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1737. ''Genera plantarum.'' Leiden: Conrad Wishoff.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Flora Lapponica]]'' (1737), ''[[Classes Plantarum]]'' ("Plant classes", 1738),&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1738. ''Classes plantarum.'' Leiden: Conrad Wishoff.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hortus Cliffortianus'' (1738). The ideas he explored in these works were revised until, in 1751, his mature thinking was finally published as ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]''&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1751. ''Philosophia botanica.'' Stockholm: R. Kiesewetter; Amsterdam: Z. Chatelain.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Science of botany") released simultaneously in Stockholm and Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species plantarum===
{{Main article|Species Plantarum}}
With the foundations of plant nomenclature and classification now in place Linnaeus then set about the monumental task of describing all the plants known in his day and, with the publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]''&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1753. ''Species plantarum.'' 2 vols. Stockholm: L. Salvius.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1753, his ambitions of the 1730s were finally accomplished. ''Species Plantarum'' was his most acclaimed work and a summary of all his botanical knowledge. Here was a global Flora that codified the usage of morphological terminology and acted as a bibliography of all the pre-Linnaean botanical literature of scientific importance. It presented his new 'sexual system' of plant classification and became the starting point for scientific botanical nomenclature for 6000 of the 10,000 species he estimated made up the world’s flora. Here too, for the first time, the species, rather than the genus, becomes the fundamental taxonomic unit. Linnaeus defined species as " ... ''all structures in nature that do not owe their shape to the conditions of the growth place and other occasional features''.”  There was also the innovation of the now familiar ''nomen triviale'' (pl. ''nomina trivialia'') of the binary name although Linnaeus still regarded the real names as the ''differentiae specificae'' or “phrase names” which embodied the diagnosis for the species – although be was eventually to regard the trivial name (specific epithet) as one of his great inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Sketches of the book are known from 1733 and the final effort resulted in his temporary collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Jørgensen, pp. 81–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamenta, Critica and Philosophia===
{{Main article|Philosophia Botanica}}
The ''Fundamenta Botanica'' (“The Foundations of Botany”) of 1736 consisted of 365 aphorisms (principles) with principles 210–324 devoted to nomenclature. He followed this form of presentation in his other work on nomenclature. Linnaeus apparently regarded these as  a “grammar and a syntax” for the study of botany.&lt;ref&gt;Ekedahl, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters VII to X comprised principles 210 to 324 to do with the nomenclature of genera, species and varieties and how to treat synonyms. The ''Critica Botanica'' was an extension of these nomenclatural chapters of the ''Fundamenta''. ''Critica Botanica'' which was published a year later in July 1737, the principles of the ''Fundamenta'' are repeated essentially unchanged but with extensive additions in smaller print.&lt;ref&gt;Morton p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this work, with its dogmatic, often amusing and provocative statements, that was to spread his ideas and enthrall intellects of the stature of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, dismissive of botanical work other than taxonomy and presented his principles as dogma rather than reasoned argument.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

These works established ground rules in a field which, at this time, had only “gentlemen's agreements”. Conventions such as: no two genera should have the same name; no universally agreed mechanisms. ''Genera Plantarum'' ran to five editions, the first in 1737 containing short descriptions of the 935 plant genera known at that time. Observing his own principle to keep generic names as short, euphonious, distinctive and memorable as possible he rejected many names that had gone before, including those of his fellow botanists which was not popular. In their place he used names that commemorated patrons, friends and fellow botanists as well as many names taken from Greek and Roman mythology.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1971, p. 246"&gt;Stearn 1971, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translation of some principles==
By far the most important section of the ''Critica'' is that dealing with generic names – here we clearly see the forces shaping the present-day provisions of the ''Botanical Code''.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"/&gt; In the ''Philosophia Botanica'' § 159 Linnaeus had stated that a genus of plants was a group of species possessing similarly constructed organs of fructification, i.e. flowers and fruits, and hence distinguishable by these from other genera.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1971, p. 246"/&gt;
Some examples of the aphorisms (principles) concerned with genera are given below:

:§ 213 All those plants which belong to one genus must be designated by the same generic name.
::''Quaecunque plantae genere conveniunt, eodem nomine generico designandae sunt''.
:§ 214 All those plants which belong to different genera must be designated by different generic names.
::''Quaecunque, e contrario, plantae genere differunt, diverso nomine generico designandae sunt.''
:§ 217 If one and the same generic name has been adopted to designate two different genera, it will have to be banished from one of the positions which it occupies.
::''Nominum genericum unum idemque, ad diversa designandum genera assumtum, altero loco excludendum erit.''
:§ 228 Generic names with a similar sound lead to confusion.
::''Nominum Genericorum terminatio &amp; Sonus, quantity fieri possit, facilitanda sunt.''
:§ 238 The pronunciation of the name should be made as easy as possible.
::''Nomina Generica Sesquipedalia, enunciatu difficilia, vel nausepsa, fugienda sunt.''
:§ 247 Greek generic names are to be written in Latin characters.
::''Nomina Generica Greaca Latinis literis pingenda sunt.''

Linnaeus considered that generic names should be apt in meaning, pleasant to hear, easy to say, and not more than 12 letters long.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates the use of commemorative personal names as botanical names, quoting his own name as an example:

{{cquote|''it is commonly believed that the name of a plant which is derived from that of a botanist shows no connection between the two ... ''[but]''  ...  ''Linnaea'' was named by the celebrated ''[[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Gronovius]]'' and is a plant of Lapland, lowly, insignificant, disregarded, flowering but for a brief space — after Linnaeus who resembles it.''&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Stafleu, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And in relation to specific names:
:§ 225 A plant is completely named when it is furnished with a generic and specific name.
:§ 256 The specific name should distinguish the plant from all others of the same genus.
:§ 258 The specific name will identify the plant which bears it at the first glance, since it expresses the differentia which is imprinted on the plant itself.

==Historical assessment==
Linnaeus's system of classification follows the principles of Aristotelian logic by which arranging subjects into classes is classification; distinguishing divisions of classes is logical division. The group to be divided is the genus; the parts into which it is divided are the species. The terms genus and species acquired their specialized biological usage from Linnaeus's predecessors, in particular [[John Ray|Ray]] and [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the question of whether plants should a) be put together or separated because they conform to a definition ([[essentialism]]) or b) put together with plants having similar characteristics generally, regardless of the definition ([[empiricism]]). Linnaeus was inclined to take the first approach using the Method of Logical Division&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Another example of Aristotelian logic is the ''Law of Excluded Middle'' (everything is either A or not A) used as the basis for dichotomous keys used in plant identification.&lt;/ref&gt; based on definition, what he called in ''Philosophia Botanica'' §152 the ''dispositio theoretica'' – but in practice he employed both methods.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical historian Alan Morton, though praising Linnaeus’s contribution to classification and nomenclature, is less complimentary about the theoretical ideas expressed in the publications discussed above:

{{cquote| ''Linnaeus was the master of the botany of his time, and his influence on the development of botanical science powerful and lasting … his work demonstrated the success of his improved methods of description, diagnosis and nomenclature, and made detailed systematic observation the guide and criterion in taxonomy. ... In his theoretical ideas, on the contrary, Linnaeus was a man of the past who never escaped from the restricting circle of idealist-essentialist thought in which his early high school training had confined him. This was the background to the contradictory statements in the ''Philosophia'', to his narrow view of botany, his blindness to the advances in plant physiology and anatomy, [and] his unquestioning acceptance of special creation.''&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linnaean historian, chronicler, and analyst [[Frans Stafleu]] points out that Linnaeus's training and background was scholastic. He excelled in logic ..."''which was almost certainly the [[Organon|Aristotelian]] and [[Thomism|Thomistic logic]]  generally taught in secondary schools all over Europe''".:&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Linnaeus's methods were based on philosophical principles and logical a priori assumptions which gradually lost their relevance to the natural sciences during the eighteenth century. Even so, the direct results of his work were salutary: descriptions were standardised, ranks fixed, names given according to precise rules and a classification proposed which permitted rapid and efficient storage and retrieval of taxonomic information. No wonder that much of what Linnaeus proposed stood the test of time. The designation of species by binary names which have the character of code designations is only one element out of many which show the profound practicality underlying Linnaeus's activities and publications''.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linnaeus's philosophical approach to classification is also noted by botanist David Frodin who observed that applying the ''methodus naturalis'' to books and people as well as plants, animals and minerals, was a mark of Linnaeus's ‘scholastic’ view of the world:

{{cquote| ''Most subsequent [to Linnaeus's ''Bibliotheca Botanica''] classifications of botanical literature, including geographical entities, would be more or less empirically based highlighting a recurrent conflict between essentialism, empiricism, [[nominalism]] and other doctrines in the theory and practice of any kind of classification''.&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, Linnaean scholar [[William T. Stearn]] has summarised Linnaeus's contribution to biology as follows:
{{cquote|''By the introduction of his binomial system of nomenclature Linnaeus gave plants and animals an essentially Latin nomenclature like vernacular nomenclature in style but linked to published, and hence relatively stable and verifiable, scientific concepts and thus suitable for international use. This was his most important contribution to biology.''&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An '''air diffuser''' or '''membrane diffuser''' is an [[aeration]] device typically in the shape of a disc, tube or plate, which is used to transfer air and with that oxygen into [[sewage]] or industrial [[wastewater]]. Oxygen is required by microorganisms/bacteria residents in the water to break down the pollutants. Diffusers use either rubber membranes or ceramic elements typically and produce either fine or coarse bubbles.

==Types==
Diffusers are generally referred to as either:

#[[fine bubble diffusers|Fine Bubble/Fine Pore]]
#[[coarse bubble diffusers|Coarse Bubble]]

Other diffused aeration devices include: [[jet aerators]], [[Aspirator (pump)|aspirators]], and U tubes.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C.(2009). [http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/upload/2002_06_28_mtb_fine.pdf "Fine Bubble Aeration."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document No. EPA-832-F-99-065.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design specifications==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
Typical efficiency of a full floor coverage diffused aeration system in clean water is 2%/ft submergence or 6.6%/m submergence.  When converted to mass transfer into process or dirty water, it is typically closer to about half of those figures. Manufacturers of fine bubble systems have supported claims that the type, number and size of "pores" have a great effect on efficiency of a diffused aeration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/142.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095534/http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/142.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of diffused aeration systems==
Diffusers are typically connected to a piping system which is supplied with pressurized air by a blower. This system is commonly referred to as a '''diffused aeration system''' or '''aeration grid'''.

There are two main types of diffused aeration systems, retrievable and fixed grid, that are designed to serve different purposes.  In the case of a plant with a single tank, a retrievable system is desirable, in order to avoid stopping operation of the plant when maintenance is required on the aeration system. Fixed systems, on the other hand, are typically less costly, and often more efficient because it is easier to make full use of the floor.

Automated software is available on the web to assist with drafting of aeration systems in CAD, as well as calculation software to help determine diffuser requirements for a given wastewater.

==Developments in membrane coatings==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
A developments in recent years has been surface coatings of [[PTFE]] on [[EPDM]] [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s.   This provides a buffer between the EPDM substrate and wastewater, hence reducing the likelihood of chemical attack and oxidation, and also providing better resistance to biological fouling and calcium scaling (manufacturers claim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stamfordscientific.com/ptfemembranes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052647/http://www.stamfordscientific.com/ptfemembranes.html |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11064">{{short description|Net transport of surface water perpendicular to wind direction }}
[[File:Ekman layer.jpg|thumb|350px|Ekman Transport is the net motion of fluid as the result of a balance between [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and turbulent drag forces. In the picture above, the wind blowing North creates a surface stress and a resulting [[Ekman spiral]] is found below it in the [[water column]].]]

'''Ekman transport''', part of Ekman motion theory first investigated in 1902 by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]], refers to the wind-driven net transport of the surface layer of a fluid that, due to the [[Coriolis effect]], occurs at 90° to the direction of the surface wind. This phenomenon was first noted by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who recorded that ice transport appeared to occur at an angle to the wind direction during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|Arctic expedition]] during the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard, p 101&lt;/ref&gt; The direction of transport is dependent on the hemisphere: in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]], transport occurs at 90° clockwise from wind direction, while in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]] it occurs at a 90° counterclockwise.&lt;ref name=Colling42-44&gt;Colling, pp 42-44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Ekman theory explains the theoretical state of circulation if water currents were driven only by the transfer of momentum from the wind. In the physical world, this is difficult to observe because of the influences of many simultaneous [[Ocean current|current]] driving forces (for example, [[pressure]] and [[density gradient]]s). Though the following theory technically applies to the idealized situation involving only wind forces, Ekman motion describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer.&lt;ref&gt;Colling p 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sverdrup p 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface currents flow at a 45° angle to the wind due to a balance between the Coriolis force and the [[Drag (physics)|drags]] generated by the wind and the water.&lt;ref&gt;Mann &amp; Lazier p 169&lt;/ref&gt; If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the [[Ekman Spiral|Ekman spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Knauss p 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the [[Ekman layer]]. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90° to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Colling42-44/&gt;

==Mathematical derivation==
Some assumptions of the fluid dynamics involved in the process must be made in order to simplify the process to a point where it is solvable. The assumptions made by Ekman were:&lt;ref&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
* no boundaries;
* infinitely deep water;
* [[Viscosity#Eddy viscosity|eddy viscosity]], &lt;math&gt;A_z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is constant (this is only true for laminar flow. In the turbulent atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer it is a strong function of depth);
* the wind forcing is steady and has been blowing for a long time;
* [[barotropic]] conditions with no geostrophic flow;
* the Coriolis parameter, &lt;math&gt; f\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is kept constant.

The simplified equations for the Coriolis force in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions follow from these assumptions:

:{{EquationRef|1|(1)}}{{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \tau_x}{\partial z} = -fv,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:{{EquationRef|2|(2)}}{{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \tau_y}{\partial z} = fu,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the wind stress, &lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the density, &lt;math&gt;u\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the East-West velocity, and &lt;math&gt;v\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the north-south velocity.

Integrating each equation over the entire Ekman layer:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_x=-M_yf,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_y=M_xf,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;M_x=\int^z_0 \rho u dz,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_y=\int^z_0 \rho v dz.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;M_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; represent the zonal and meridional mass transport terms with units of mass per unit time per unit length. Contrarily to common logic, north-south winds cause mass transport in the East-West direction.&lt;ref&gt;Knauss p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to understand the vertical velocity structure of the water column, equations {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can be rewritten in terms of the vertical eddy viscosity term.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \tau_x}{\partial z} = \rho A_z \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \tau_y}{\partial z} = \rho A_z \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial z^2},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient.

This gives a set of differential equations of the form

:&lt;math&gt; A_z \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}=-fv,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_z \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial z^2}=fu.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In order to solve this system of two differential equations, two boundary conditions can be applied:
* &lt;math&gt;{(u,v) \to 0}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;{z \to \infin},&lt;/math&gt;
* friction is equal to wind stress at the free surface (&lt;math&gt; z=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;).

Things can be further simplified by considering wind blowing in the ''y''-direction only. This means is the results will be relative to a north-south wind (although these solutions could be produced relative to wind in any other direction):&lt;ref name=P&amp;P108&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{EquationRef|3|(3)}}{{pad|2em}}&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u_E&amp;=\pm V_0 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right)\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right),\\
v_E&amp;= V_0 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right)\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right),\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; u_E\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v_E\,\!&lt;/math&gt; represent Ekman transport in the ''u'' and ''v'' direction;
* in equation {{EquationNote|3}} the plus sign applies to the northern hemisphere and the minus sign to the southern hemisphere;
* &lt;math&gt;V_0= \frac{\sqrt{2}\pi\tau_{y\eta}}{D_E\rho|f|};\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_{y\eta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the wind stress on the sea surface;
* &lt;math&gt;D_E = \pi\left(\frac{2A_z}{|f|}\right)^{1/2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the Ekman depth (depth of Ekman layer).

By solving this at ''z''=0, the surface current is found to be (as expected) 45 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. This also gives the expected shape of the Ekman spiral, both in magnitude and direction.&lt;ref name=P&amp;P108/&gt; Integrating these equations over the Ekman layer shows that the net Ekman transport term is 90 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere.

==Applications==
* Ekman transport leads to [[Upwelling#Coastal|coastal upwelling]], which provides the nutrient supply for some of the largest fishing markets on the planet&lt;ref name=Knauss125&gt;Knauss p 125&lt;/ref&gt; and can impact the stability of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic Ice Sheet]] by pulling warm deep water onto the continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=R.

From Ekman transport, surface water has a net movement of 90° to right of wind direction in the northern hemisphere (left in the southern hemisphere). Because the surface water flows away from the coast, the water must be replaced with water from below.&lt;ref&gt;Mann &amp; Lazier p 172&lt;/ref&gt; In shallow coastal waters, the Ekman spiral is normally not fully formed and the wind events that cause upwelling episodes are typically rather short. This leads to many variations in the extent of upwelling, but the ideas are still generally applicable.&lt;ref&gt;Colling p 43&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ekman transport is similarly at work in [[Upwelling#Equatorial|equatorial upwelling]], where, in both hemispheres, a [[trade wind]] component towards the west causes a net transport of water towards the pole, and a trade wind component towards the east causes a net transport of water away from the pole.&lt;ref name=Knauss125/&gt;
* On smaller scales, [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] winds induce Ekman transport which causes net divergence and upwelling, or Ekman suction,&lt;ref name=Knauss125/&gt; while [[Anticyclone|anti-cyclonic]] winds cause net convergence and downwelling, or Ekman pumping&lt;ref name=P&amp;P295&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard p 295&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ekman transport is also a factor in the circulation of the [[ocean gyre]]s. Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre in all locations, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating [[Geostrophic wind#geostrophic flow|geostrophic flow]] (Colling p 65). [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for this (see [[Sverdrup balance]]).&lt;ref name=P&amp;P295/&gt; See: [[Garbage Patch (disambiguation)|Garbage Patch]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">The '''European Space Information System''' (ESIS) project was initiated in 1988 as a service for homogeneous access to heterogeneous databases on the network. At the time, [[DECNET]], EARN and Bitnet were the main academic links. The project pre-dated the World Wide Web, which immensely pushed technology in 1993 to allow homogeneous access to data.

Initially, the ESIS project was to link databases of the [[European Space Agency]] together with centres of excellence that included the [[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] and its [[SIMBAD]] service, the [[European Southern Observatory]] and the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre (CADC), as well as the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] for Space Physics data &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m11524u2g46307u6/ The European Space Information System (ESIS) P. Giommi, S.G. Ansari, P. Donzelli, A. Micol, 1995, Experimental Astronomy Vol. 6 No. 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the project yielded a set of applications to browse catalogues, access images, spectra and lightcurves, as well as access to bibliographic information. The main astronomical missions that influenced ESIS at the time were the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[EXOSAT]] and [[International Ultraviolet Explorer|IUE]], while Space Physics was mainly focused on the [[Cluster mission]]. 

Having been a pioneer project in its days, many of the original concepts used then (such as catalogue browsing, searching in an area of the sky) were later embedded in other astronomical data services worldwide. ESIS provided the building blocks and the prototypes to what is today being implemented in the Virtual Observatory projects, such as the [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].

The greatest success of ESIS was the transfer of its Catalogue Browser to the CDS, which later became better known as the [[VizieR]] Catalogue Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet86/ansa86.htm Transfer of ESIS to scientific institutes S.G.

[[Image:Yagan's grave surface radar.png|thumbnail|right|[[Ground penetrating radar]] provided no information about the location of Yagan's head]]

The '''exhumation of Yagan's head''' was the result of a [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig at a grave site in the [[Everton Cemetery]], [[Liverpool]] in 1997.

==Background==
{{main|Yagan}}
[[Yagan]] was an [[indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian]] warrior of the [[Noongar]] nation who played a key part in early indigenous resistance to European settlement and rule around the area of [[Perth, Western Australia]].  He was shot dead by a young settler, James Keates in 1833. Yagan's head was removed, preserved by smoking, and taken to England by Robert Dale, who gave it to the Liverpool Institute for display in a museum.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turnbull, Paul|year=1998|title="Outlawed Subjects": The Procurement and Scientific Uses of Australian Aboriginal Heads, ca. 1803&amp;ndash;1835|journal=Eighteenth-Century Life|volume=22|issue=1|pages=156&amp;ndash;171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, Yagan's head was badly decomposed, and the decision was made to dispose of it.  The head was placed in a [[plywood]] box, along with a [[Peru]]vian [[mummy]] and a [[Mokomokai|Māori head]], and buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years, a number of burials were made around the grave, and in 1968 a local hospital buried 20 stillborn babies and two babies who had lived less than twenty-four hours, directly over the museum box.&lt;ref name="Fforde"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fforde, Cressida|year=2002|chapter=Chapter 18: Yagan|title=The Dead and Their Possessions: Repatriation in Principle, Policy, and Practice|editor1=Fforde, Cressida |editor2=Hubert, Jane |editor3=Turnbull, Paul |location=London | publisher=Routledge|pages=229&amp;ndash;241|isbn=0-415-23385-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yagan's grave surface EM data.png|thumbnail|right|A horizontal colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site.]]
For many years, members of Perth's Noongar community sought to have Yagan's head returned and buried according to tribal custom.  An application for exhumation of the head was made in 1994, but it was refused because [[next of kin]] permission to disturb the remains of the twenty-two babies could not be obtained.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

==The geophysical survey==
[[Image:Yagan's grave excavation pit.png|thumbnail|right|The excavation pit used for the exhumation of Yagan's head.]]
[[Image:Yagan's grave vertical EM data.png|thumbnail|right|A vertical colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site.]]
In 1997, two brothers, Dr Martin Bates of the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] and Dr Richard Bates of the [[University of St Andrews]], were commissioned by the [[Home Office]] to conduct a [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] of the grave site, with a view to exhuming the remains via an adjacent plot without disturbing any other remains.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

The pair conducted surface surveys using [[ground penetrating radar]] and ground conductivity techniques.  The ground penetrating radar yielded no information about the location of Yagan's head, as the highly disturbed graveyard soil contained many reflecting sources.  However, the ground conductivity measurements showed an anomaly in the electromagnetic signature that it was thought might be caused by metal artifacts buried with the head.  The apparent location of the remains confirmed the feasibility of accessing them via an adjacent plot.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web | title=Archaeological Geophysics: Yagan's Head | url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~crb/web/arch/yagan.htm | accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;Bates, C. R. (2005) ''pers. comm.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A pit was then dug in an adjacent plot, to a depth of around six feet, and a vertical ground conductivity test was conducted from within the pit.  This test failed to detect the anomaly recorded in the surface test, however the conductivity plot did show an anomaly at the centre of the grave, indicating that the grave was dug to its full depth of nine feet only at its centre.  This suggested the burial of a small box, confirming the memory of the grave digger who claimed to have constructed a small box to house the buried remains.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt;

==The exhumation==
After gathering evidence on the position and depth of Yagan's head, Bates reported the survey results to the Home Office, which eventually granted permission to proceed with the exhumation.  Yagan's head was exhumed by tunnelling horizontally into the grave from the adjacent pit.  The tunneling operation was "delicate and risky", as the tunnel passed underneath the remains of the babies, such that any collapse could potentially disturb them.  According to Richard Bates, "the first shovel of dirt from the grave showed signs of the decayed box and the Peruvian mummy came next followed by the Māori head and finally Yagan's head".&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt;

The following day, a [[forensics|forensic]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] from the [[University of Bradford]] positively identified the skull as Yagan's, by correlating the fractures with those described in an 1834 report by [[Thomas Pettigrew]].&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Later that year, Yagan's head was handed over to a delegation of Noongars, who took it back to Australia.  Reburial of the head was delayed, however, due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body and disagreement by elders about the importance of burying the head with the body.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt; They finally buried it in July 2010, in a traditional Noongar ceremony in the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]] in Western Australia, 177 years after Yagan's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm/ Warrior reburied 170 years after death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623230023/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm |date=2013-06-23 }}, Australian Geographic, 12 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Montenegro Faculty of Philosophy''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: '''Filozofski fakultet Univerziteta Crne Gore''' ''Филозофски факултет Универзитета Црне Горе'') is one of the educational institutions of the [[University of Montenegro]]. The building is located in [[Nikšić]], close to the city center.

== History ==

The Faculty's history can be traced back to 1947, when the '''Pedagogical College''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: '''Viša pedagoška škola''' ''Виша педагошка школа'') was founded in [[Cetinje]]. The College was moved to [[Nikšić]] in 1963, and renamed the '''Pedagogical Academy''' ('''Pedagoška akademija''' ''Педагошка академија''). Between 1977 and 1988, the school was called the '''Teaching Faculty''' ('''Nastavnički fakultet''' ''Наставнички факултет'').

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
The '''Global Learning Opportunities in Business Education''' ('''GLOBE''') program is an undergraduate business program that sends 54 elite students to study at [[Copenhagen Business School]] (CBS) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) in [[Hong Kong]], and the [[Kenan–Flagler Business School]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina| Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States]]. 

At each respective university, eighteen students are selected based on their academic achievements, personalities, and previous life experiences. After being selected, the students spend a year and a half traveling the world, networking internationally, and gaining a new perspective on the business world. During the first year of the program, students study at CBS in the fall and CUHK in the spring. Following the semester in Hong Kong, students generally pursue competitive internships with companies throughout the world. The final semester is then spent at the University of North Carolina. Following completion of the program, students return to their respective universities, where they spend one final semester completing their degree.

As of September 2017, 10 batches of GLOBE students have graduated the program. Batch 11 is in the midst of its third and final semester while batch 12 is in its first.

== Ranking and reputation ==
The GLOBE program combines international business studies with real-life international experience, giving GLOBE Scholars unique perspectives in their future business endeavors. At CBS, only students majoring in International Business are eligible for program admission. At UNC, sophomores apply for the GLOBE program when applying to the Kenan-Flagler Business School. At CUHK, only students majoring in Global Business Studies, one of the most competitive undergraduate programs in Hong Kong, are eligible to apply. At each university, the GLOBE administration team selects students through a rigorous application and extensive interview process to maximize student and program compatibility.

The three universities at which GLOBE students study all receive top rankings on their respective continents. In 2012, CUHK was ranked fifth in Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2012|title=QS University Rankings: Asia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS was ranked as the third-best international business school in the world after Harvard and London Business School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.cbs.dk/about_cbs_campus/quality/accreditation_ranking |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109113010/http://uk.cbs.dk/about_cbs_campus/quality/accreditation_ranking |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kenan-Flagler Business School at UNC was ranked sixth-best business school in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Programs/BSBA/careerServices/rank.cfm|title=HTML 404 - Page Not Found|website=www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206124015/http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Programs/BSBA/careerServices/rank.cfm|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==
During the course of the program all the GLOBE students live and study together. Students also take the opportunity to travel extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States.

== Study trips ==
The third batch (graduated December 9, 2009) visited Brussels, Berlin, Shanghai, Tokyo, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, and New York City on its study trips. The students visited companies such as Deutsche Bahn in Berlin, Toyota City in Japan, and Standard &amp; Poor's in New York City.
Batch eight (graduating December 14, 2014) has visited Brussels and Berlin, and 10 days are going to be spent in Indonesia visiting and solving local company issues. In the US, there will be a study trip to Research Triangle Park and a more extensive one in the late fall.

== Media coverage ==
Although still a young program, the GLOBE program has been featured in numerous major business publications around the world. The program was referenced in an article about students' perceptions of companies in the ''Financial Times'' and ''BusinessWeek''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/nov2009/bs2009116_361652.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The program has also been the focus of articles in business media such as the Danish newspaper ''Børsen''.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.cbs.dk/uddannelser/bachelor/bacheloruddannelser/bsc_in_international_business/hoejreboks/nyheder/globe_delivers_says_danish_business_daily/(language)/eng-GB&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlingske Business (Danish newspaper) ran a series of articles about the program in the fall, 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.business.dk/?article=27332801-Fremtidens-globale-topledere-er-samlet-paa-CBS|title=Berlingske Business - Seneste nyheder fra erhvervslivet på business.dk|website=Berlingske Business - Seneste nyheder fra erhvervslivet på business.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Higgins''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] project dedicated to giving individuals more control over their personal identity, profile and social network data.

The project is organized into three main areas:
#'''Active Clients''' - An active client integrates with a browser and runs on a computer or mobile device.
#* Higgins 1.X: the active client supports the OASIS IMI protocol and performs the functions of an [[Information Card]] ''selector''.
#* Higgins 2.0: the plan is to move beyond ''selector'' functionality to add support for managing passwords and Higgins relationship cards, as well other protocols such as [[OpenID]]. It also becomes a client for the Personal Data Store (see below) and thereby provides a kind of dashboard for personal information and a place to manage "permissioning"—deciding who gets access to what slice of the user's data.
#'''Personal Data Store (PDS)''' is a new work area under development for Higgins 2.0. A PDS stores local personal data, controls access to remotely hosted personal data, synchronizes personal data to other devices and computers, accessed directly or via a PDS client it allows the user to share selected aspects of their information with people and organizations that they trust.
#'''Identity Services'''  - Code for (i) an IMI and SAML compatible Identity Provider and (ii) enabling websites to be IMI and OpenID compatible.

==History==
The initial code for the Higgins Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/higgins/ Eclipse Higgins Project] - home page&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Paul Trevithick]] in the summer of 2003. In 2004 the effort became part of [http://socialphysics.org/ SocialPhysics.org], a collaboration between Paul and Mary Ruddy, of [http://azigo.com Azigo], (formerly Parity Communications, Inc.), and [http://Meristic.com Meristic], and John Clippinger, at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]]. Higgins, under its original name '''Eclipse Trust Framework''', was accepted into the [[Eclipse Foundation]] in early 2005. Mary and Paul are the project co-leads. [[IBM]] and [[Novell, Inc.|Novell]]'s participation in the project was announced in early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/19280.wss Open Source Initiative to Give People More Control Over Their Personal Online Information] - IBM press release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2151060/ibm-backs-open-source IBM/Novell unveil rival to Microsoft Infocard]&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins has received technology contributions from [[IBM]], [[Novell, Inc.|Novell]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Computer Associates|CA]], Serena, [[Google]], [http://eperi.de/ eperi GmbH] as well as from several other firms and individuals. Version 1.0 was released in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20080221_higgins.php Eclipse press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hospitality management''' is the study of the [[hospitality industry]]. A degree in the subject may be awarded either by a university college dedicated to the studies of  hospitality management or a [[business school]] with a relevant department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Hospitality management?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hospitality-management.htm|journal=http://www.wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://srihm.edu.in/ Degrees in hospitality management] may also be referred to as [[Hotel manager|hotel management]], hotel and tourism management, or hotel administration. Degrees conferred in this academic field include [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration]], [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science|BASc]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. Hospitality management covers [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[amusement parks]], [[destination marketing organization]]s, [[convention center]]s, and [[country club]]s.

==Curriculum==
In the USA, hospitality and tourism management curricula follow similar core subject applications to that of a [[business degree]], but with a focus on tourism development and hospitality management. Core subject areas include [[accounting]], [[administration (business)|administration]], [[finance]], [[information systems]], [[marketing]], [[human resource management]], [[public relations]], [[business strategy|strategy]], [[quantitative methods]], and sectoral studies in the various areas of hospitality business.

===Vegetarian option===
In 2016, Ministry of Tourism, [[Government of India]] started giving hospitality management students the option to choose only vegetarian cooking. This was introduced at three of the institutes (IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur) affiliated with the Ministry. This decision to offer a vegetarian option by IHMCTANs may be the first amongst any of the hospitality training institutes of the world. It is expected that all IHMCTANs in India will start offering a vegetarian cooking option from academic year 2018 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=IHMs-to-offer-3-yr-course-in-vegetarian-11072016013026|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nchmcounselling.nic.in/nchminfo/Public/View.aspx?page=79 |title=NCHM Counselling 2018 |publisher=Nchmcounselling.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankings of degree-granting programs ==
These top ten lists are specific to departments that specifically give degrees in the hospitality field itself.  For the more general type of degree, see the [[list of business schools in the United States]], and similar articles for other countries.  For restaurant-related hospitality industry degrees in nutrition, see list of universities with accredited dietetic programs.  For overall rankings of universities by various metrics, see [[college and university rankings|&lt;span dir="ltr" lang="ace"&gt;college&lt;/span&gt; and university rankings]].

=== Opinion surveys of employers in the hospitality industry ===
In a broad industry survey of senior managers from luxury hotels in 2013, conducted a [[market survey]] of hospitality employers regarding their opinions of the top ten hospitality management schools.   Laureate Hospitality Education, a division of Laureate Education Inc, commissioned TNS to conduct each of these surveys, and 2 schools out of 10 (numbers 6, 8) belong to Laureate Hospitality Education.
The result appeared as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Hospitality Management Schools: 2013 Worldwide Industry Ranking Survey |url= http://www.glion.edu/glion_education/en/en-en/file.cfm/document/tns_white_paper_2013_-_international.pdf?contentid=6276 |publisher=http://www.glion.edu |date=October 2013|accessdate=2014-08-2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vinylite and corrosion applied in a horse hoof.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Equine foot where the vinyl technique was applied followed by corrosion.]]
'''Injection of vinylite and corrosion''' is an [[anatomical technique]] used to visualize branching and pathways of the [[circulatory system]]. It consists of filling the circulatory system of the piece with [[vinyl acetate]] and its use of [[corrosion]] technique for the removal of the superposed matter, that is, the [[organic matter]]. The technique of vinylite followed by corrosion, besides having low cost, provides a long period of conservation, satisfying the need of undergraduate students as the study of anatomy.&lt;ref name="Scielo"&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/pdf/pvb/v33n5/22.pdf Técnicas anatômicas no ensino da prática de anatomia animal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of filling by vinilite is considered an [[angiotechnical]], which consists of the study of blood vessels. This is used to mark the circulatory system ([[arterial]] and [[venous]]) with the use of pre-pigmented vinyl acetate to fill the vessels of the part to be studied in order to be able to visualize the ducts and duly filled systems. For corrosion or semi-corrosion, [[hydrochloric acid]] is the most viable substance used to obtain templates for the vascularization of organs or parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Técnicas Anatômicas.|last=Rodrigues|first=H|publisher=GM Gráfica e Editora|year=2010|edition= 4th|place=Vitória, ES|page=269 p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citar periódico|last=RODRIGUES|first=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25317">[[Image:Odometer rollover.jpg|thumb|250px|Integer overflow can be demonstrated through an [[odometer]] overflowing, a mechanical version of the phenomenon. All digits are set to the maximum 9 and the next increment of the white digit causes a cascade of carry-over additions setting all digits to 0, but there is no higher digit to change to a 1, so the counter resets to zero. This is ''wrapping'' in contrast to ''saturating''.]]

In [[computer programming]], an '''integer overflow''' occurs when an [[arithmetic]] operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits – either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.

The most common result of an overflow is that the least significant representable digits of the result are stored; the result is said to ''wrap'' around the maximum (i.e. modulo a power of the radix, usually two in modern computers, but sometimes ten or another radix).

An overflow condition may give results leading to unintended behavior. In particular, if the possibility has not been anticipated, overflow can compromise a program's reliability and [[software security|security]].

For some applications, such as timers and clocks, wrapping on overflow can be desirable. The [[C programming language|C11]] standard states that for unsigned integers modulo wrapping is the defined behavior and the term overflow never applies: "a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO/IEC+9899:2011&amp;msclkid=2f0af3a2b5ca143c9285a9f8e8f6b3e1|title=ISO/IEC 9899:2011 Information technology - Programming languages - C|first=|last=ISO|date=|website=webstore.ansi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some processors like [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) and [[digital signal processor]]s (DSPs) which support [[saturation arithmetic]], overflowed results would be "clamped", i.e. set to the minimum or the maximum value in the representable range, rather than wrapped around.

== Origin ==
The [[register width]] of a processor determines the range of values that can be represented in its registers.  Though the vast majority of computers can perform multiple-precision arithmetic on operands in memory, allowing numbers to be arbitrarily long and overflow to be avoided, the register width limits the sizes of numbers that can be operated on (e.g. added or subtracted) using a single instruction per operation.  Typical [[Binary numeral system|binary]] register widths for unsigned integers include:

* 8 bits: maximum representable value 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 = 255
* 16 bits: maximum representable value 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 = 65,535
* 32 bits: maximum representable value 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 = 4,294,967,295 (the most common width for personal computers {{As of|2005|lc=on}}),
* 64 bits: maximum representable value 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (the most common width for personal computer [[CPU]]s, {{As of|2017|lc=on}}),
* 128 bits: maximum representable value 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455

When an arithmetic operation produces a result larger than the maximum above for an N-bit integer, an overflow reduces the result to [[modulo operation|modulo]] N-th power of 2, retaining only the least significant bits of the result and effectively causing a ''wrap around''.

In particular, multiplying or adding two integers may result in a value that is unexpectedly small, and subtracting from a small integer may cause a wrap to a large positive value (for example, 8-bit integer addition 255 + 2 results in 1, which is {{math|257 mod 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and similarly subtraction 0 − 1 results in 255, a [[two's complement]] representation of −1).

{{anchor|Security ramifications}}
Such wrap around may cause security problems&amp;mdash;if an overflowed value is used as the number of bytes to allocate for a buffer, the buffer will be allocated unexpectedly small, potentially leading to a buffer overflow which, depending on the usage of the buffer, might in turn cause arbitrary code execution.

If the variable has a [[Signed number representations|signed integer]] type, a program may make the assumption that a variable always contains a positive value. An integer overflow can cause the value to wrap and become negative, which violates the program's assumption and may lead to unexpected behavior (for example, 8-bit integer addition of 127 + 1 results in −128, a two's complement of 128). (A solution for this particular problem is to use unsigned integer types for values that a program expects and assumes will never be negative.)

==Flags==
Most computers have two dedicated processor flags to check for overflow conditions.

The [[carry flag]] is set when the result of an addition or subtraction, considering the operands and result as unsigned numbers, does not fit in the given number of bits. This indicates an overflow with a [[carry (arithmetic)|''carry'' or ''borrow'']] from the [[most significant bit]]. An immediately following ''add with carry'' or ''subtract with borrow'' operation would use the contents of this flag to modify a register or a memory location that contains the higher part of a multi-word value.

The [[overflow flag]] is set when the result of an operation on signed numbers does not have the sign that one would predict from the signs of the operands, e.g. a negative result when adding two positive numbers. This indicates that an overflow has occurred and the signed result represented in [[two's complement]] form would not fit in the given number of bits.

==Definition variations and ambiguity==

For an unsigned type, when the ideal result of an operation is outside the types representable range and the returned result is obtained by wrapping, then this event is commonly defined as an overflow. 
In contrast, the C11 standard defines that this event is not an overflow and states "a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

When the ideal result of an integer operation is outside the types representable range and the returned result is obtained by clamping, then this event is commonly defined as a saturation.
Usage varies as to whether a saturation is or is not an overflow.
To eliminate ambiguity, the terms wrapping overflow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/wrap-on-overflow.html?searchHighlight=overflow&amp;s_tid=doc_srchtitle|title=Wrap on overflow - MATLAB &amp; Simulink|author=|date=|website=www.mathworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and saturating overflow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/saturate-on-overflow.html?searchHighlight=overflow&amp;s_tid=doc_srchtitle|title=Saturate on overflow - MATLAB &amp; Simulink|author=|date=|website=www.mathworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
can be used.

The term underflow is most commonly used for floating-point math and not for integer math&lt;ref&gt;[[Arithmetic underflow]]&lt;/ref&gt;.
But, many references can be found to integer underflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/191.html|title=CWE - CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (3.1)|author=|date=|website=cwe.mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dzone.com/articles/overflow-and-underflow-data|title=Overflow And Underflow of Data Types in Java - DZone Java|author=|date=|website=dzone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@taabishm2/integer-overflow-underflow-and-floating-point-imprecision-6ba869a99033|title=Integer Overflow/Underflow and Floating Point Imprecision.|first=Tabish|last=Mir|date=4 April 2017|website=medium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-147/|title=Integer underflow and buffer overflow processing MP4 metadata in libstagefright|author=|date=|website=Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/BufferOverflows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002577-SW7|title=Avoiding Buffer Overflows and Underflows|author=|date=|website=developer.apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When the term integer underflow is used, 
it means the ideal result was closer to minus infinity 
than the output type's representable value closest to minus infinity.
When the term integer underflow is used, 
the definition of overflow may include all types of overflows
or it may only include cases where the ideal result was closer to positive infinity 
than the output type's representable value closest to positive infinity.

When the ideal result of an operation is not an exact integer, the meaning of overflow can be ambiguous in edge cases.
Consider the case where the ideal result has value 127.25 and the output type's maximum representable value is 127.
If overflow is defined as the ideal value being outside the representable range of the output type, then this case would be classified as an overflow.
For operations that have well defined rounding behavior, overflow classification may need to be postponed until after rounding is applied.
The C11 standard
&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
defines that conversions from floating point to integer must round toward zero.
If C is used to convert the floating point value 127.25 to integer, then rounding should be applied first to give an ideal integer output of 127.
Since the rounded integer is in the outputs range, the C standard would not classify this conversion as an overflow.

There are several methods of handling overflow:
# Avoidance: By allocating variables with data types that are large enough to contain all values that may possibly be computed and stored in them, it is always possible to avoid overflow.  Even when the available space or the fixed data types provided by a programming language or environment are too limited to allow for variables to be defensively allocated with generous sizes, by carefully ordering operations and checking operands in advance, it is often possible to ensure ''a priori'' that the result will never be larger than can be stored. [[Static program analysis|Static analysis]] tools, [[formal verification]] and [[design by contract]] techniques can be used to more confidently and robustly ensure that an overflow cannot accidentally result.
# Handling: If it is anticipated that overflow may occur, then tests can be inserted into the program to detect when it happens and do other processing to mitigate it.  For example, if an important result computed from user input overflows, the program can stop, reject the input, and perhaps prompt the user for different input, rather than the program proceeding with the invalid overflowed input and probably malfunctioning as a consequence.  For another example, it is possible to add two numbers each two bytes wide using just a byte addition in steps: first add the low bytes then add the high bytes, but if it is necessary to carry out of the low bytes this is arithmetic overflow of the byte addition and it becomes necessary to detect and increment the sum of the high bytes.  [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] generally have a way of detecting this to support addition of numbers larger than their register size, typically using a status bit; the technique is called multiple-precision arithmetic.  
# Propagation: if a value is too large to be stored it can be assigned a special value indicating that overflow has occurred and then have all successive operation return this flag value.  (Such values are sometimes called NaNs--Not A Number[s]).  This is useful so that the problem can be checked for once at the end of a long calculation rather than after each step.  This is often supported in Floating Point Hardware called [[floating point unit|FPUs]].

Programming languages implement various mitigation methods against an accidental overflow: [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Seed7]] (and certain variants of functional languages), trigger an exception condition on overflow, while [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (since 2.4) seamlessly converts internal representation of the number to match its growth, eventually representing it as &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; – whose ability is only limited by the available memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html Python documentation], section 5.1 Arithmetic conversions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Run-time overflow detection implementation &lt;code&gt;AddressSanitizer&lt;/code&gt; is also available for [[C compiler]]s.

In languages with native support for [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] and [[type safety]] (such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Common Lisp]]), numbers are promoted to a larger size automatically when overflows occur, or exceptions thrown (conditions signaled) when a range constraint exists.  Using such languages may thus be helpful to mitigate this issue.  However, in some such languages, situations are still possible where an integer overflow can occur.  An example is explicit optimization of a code path which is considered a bottleneck by the profiler.  In the case of Common Lisp, this is possible by using an explicit declaration to type-annotate a variable to a machine-size word (fixnum)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/d_type.htm |title=''Declaration'' '''TYPE''' | website=Common Lisp HyperSpec}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lower the type safety level to zero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/d_optimi.htm |title=''Declaration'' '''OPTIMIZE''' | website=Common Lisp HyperSpec}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a particular code block.&lt;ref name="reddy"&gt;{{cite web

In Java 8, there are overloaded methods, for example like {{Javadoc:SE|member=addExact(int, int)|java/lang|Math|addExact(int,int)}}, which will throw {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|ArithmeticException}} in case of overflow.

[[Computer emergency response team]] (CERT) developed the As-if Infinitely Ranged (AIR) integer model, a largely automated mechanism to eliminate integer overflow and truncation in C/C++ using run-time error handling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/09tn023.pdf As-if Infinitely Ranged Integer Model]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer graphics]] or [[signal processing]], it is typical to work on data that ranges from 0 to 1 or from −1 to 1. An example of this is a [[grayscale]] image where 0 represents black, 1 represents white, and values in-between represent varying shades of gray. One operation that one may want to support is brightening the image by multiplying every pixel by a constant. [[Saturated arithmetic]] allows one to just blindly multiply every [[pixel]] by that constant without worrying about overflow by just sticking to a reasonable outcome that all these pixels larger than 1 (i.e. [[high dynamic range imaging|"brighter than white"]]) just become white and all values "darker than black" just become black.

== Examples ==

Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of [[software bug|program errors]]. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which are less likely to be used in validation tests.

Taking the arithmetic mean of two numbers by adding them and dividing by two, as done in many [[search algorithm]]s, causes error if the sum (although not the resulting mean) is too large to be represented and hence overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html|title=Extra, Extra - Read All About It: Nearly All Binary Searches and Mergesorts are Broken|author=|date=|website=googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unhandled arithmetic overflow in the engine steering software was the primary cause of the crash of the 1996 maiden flight of the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501|Ariane 5]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleick|first=James|title=A Bug and A Crash|url=http://www.around.com/ariane.html|work=New York Times Magazine|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software had been considered bug-free since it had been used in many previous flights, but those used smaller rockets which generated lower acceleration than Ariane 5. Frustratingly, the part of the software in which the overflow error occurred was not even required to be running for the Ariane 5 at the time that it caused the rocket to fail&amp;mdash;it was a launch-regime process for a smaller predecessor of the Ariane 5 that had remained in the software when it was adapted for the new rocket. Furthermore, the actual cause of the failure was a flaw in the engineering specification of how the software dealt with the overflow when it was detected: it did a diagnostic dump to its bus, which would have been connected to test equipment during software testing during development but was connected to the rocket steering motors during flight; the data dump drove the engine nozzle hard to one side which put the rocket out of aerodynamic control and precipitated its rapid breakup in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Official report of Ariane 5 launch failure incident.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2015, the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] announced it will order [[Boeing 787]] operators to reset its electrical system periodically, to avoid an integer overflow which could lead to loss of electrical power and [[ram air turbine]] deployment, and Boeing deployed a [[software update]] in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= F.A.A. Orders Fix for Possible Power Loss in Boeing 787 |first=Jad|last=Mouawad|work= [[New York Times]] |date= 30 April 2015 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/business/faa-orders-fix-for-possible-power-loss-in-boeing-787.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] followed on 4 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/US-2015-09-07 |work= Airworthiness Directives |title= US-2015-09-07 : Electrical Power – Deactivation |date= {{date|2015-05-04}} |publisher= [[European Aviation Safety Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The error happens after 2³¹ centiseconds ({{#expr:2^31/100/3600/24}} days), indicating a 32-bit [[Signed number representations|signed]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]].

Overflow bugs are evident in some computer games. In the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', [[Kill screen|it is impossible to advance past level 22]] due to an integer overflow in its time/bonus. The game takes the level number a user is on, multiplies it by 10 and adds 40. When they reach level 22, the time/bonus number is 260, which is too large for its 8-bit 256 value register, so it resets itself to 0 and gives the remaining 4 as the time/bonus – too short to finish the level. In ''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'', when trying to calculate a number over 10000, it shows only the first 4 digits. Overflow is the cause of the famous [[kill screen|"split-screen" level]] in ''[[Pac-Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html|title=The Pac-Man Dossier|author=Pittman, Jamey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Nuclear Gandhi" in [[Civilization (video game)|''Civilization'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/why-gandhi-is-such-an-asshole-in-civilization-1653818245 |title=Why Gandhi Is Such An Asshole In Civilization |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |date=2016-03-02 |website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher= |access-date=2018-07-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also caused the "Far Lands" in ''[[Minecraft]]'' which existed from the Infdev development period to Beta 1.7.3; however, it was later fixed in Beta 1.8 but still exists in the Pocket Edition and Windows 10 Edition versions of ''Minecraft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Far_Lands|title=Minecraft Gamepedia Page|author=Minecraft Gamepedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Japan Atomic Energy Agency'''|日本原子力研究開発機構|Nihon genshiryoku kenkyū kaihatsu kikō|'''JAEA'''}} is an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] formed on October 1, 2005 by a merger of two previous semi-governmental organizations.  While it inherited the activities of both PNC and JAERI, it also inherited the nickname of JAERI, "Genken" 原研, an abbreviated word for "nuclear research".

On April 10, 2007, JAEA officially joined the [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership|GNEP]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2043547 Nuclear Engineering International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515185653/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2043547 |date=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other members in the alliance are [[Areva]], [[Washington Group International]] and BWX.  It is expected that the experience gained from the Rokkasho centrifuge enrichment plant will be a key contribution from JAEA.

On April 1, 2016, JAEA transferred some of its laboratories to the [[National Institute of Radiological Sciences]] (NIRS), and the NIRS body was renamed to the National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST) which includes existing laboratories of the NIRS.

'''Kinetic architecture''' is a concept through which buildings are designed to allow parts of the structure to move, without reducing overall structural integrity. 

A building's capability for motion can be used just to: enhance its aesthetic qualities; respond to environmental conditions; and/or, perform functions that would be impossible for a static structure.

The possibilities for practical implementations of kinetic architecture increased sharply in the late-20th century due to advances in mechanics, electronics, and robotics.

==History==
[[File:Drawbridge.gif|thumb|right|240px|An early instance of kinetic architecture – the ''drawbridge'']]
Rudimentary forms of kinetic architecture such as the [[drawbridge]] can be traced back to the Middle Ages or earlier. Yet it was only in the early 20th century that architects began to widely discuss the possibility for movement to be enabled for a significant portion of a buildings' [[superstructure]]. In the first third of the 20th century, interest in kinetic architect was one of the stands of thought emerging from the [[Futurism]] movement. Various papers and books included plans and drawings for moving buildings, a notable example being [[Yakov Chernikhov|Chernikhov's]] ''101 Architectural Fantasies'' (1933). For the first few decades of the 20th century kinetic architecture was almost entirely theoretical, but by the 1940s innovators such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] began experimenting with concrete implementations, though his early efforts in this direction are not regarded as totally successful.&lt;ref name = "Transformers"&gt;

|publisher= [[MIT Press]] 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 engineer/architect William Zuk published the book ''Kinetic architecture''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book  
|author = William Zuk
|title= Kinetic architecture

|asin= B0006CF8OU

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which helped inspire a new generation of architects to design an increasingly wide range of actual working kinetic buildings. Assisted by new concepts such as Fuller's [[Tensegrity]] and by developments in [[robotics]], kinetic buildings have become increasingly common worldwide since the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "Transformers"/&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:2010-06-03 Arena AufSchalke 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Veltins-Arena]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany is an example of a stadium with a retractable roof and a retractable pitch]]
By the early 21st century three interrelated themes had emerged. The first is for functional buildings such as bridges which can elevate their midsections to allow tall ships to pass, or stadiums with retractable roofs such as the [[Veltins-Arena]], [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff, or [[Wembley Stadium]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

A second theme is for fantastic structures that can perform [[Transformers|Transformer]] style changes of shape or which have a visually stunning appearance. 
The bird-like ''Burke [[Brise soleil]]'' at the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] is a well regarded example of this, though it also has a functional aspect in that its movement allows it to shade the crowds from the sun or protect them from storms.&lt;ref name = "Transformers"/&gt;

The third theme is for movement to occur on the surface of the building, creating what Buckminster Fuller called a "skin-like articulation" effect. A classic example of this is the [[Arab World Institute|Institut du Monde Arabe]].&lt;ref name = "Transformers"/&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Architects Sarah Bonnemaison and Christine Macy have suggested that movement can be an inspiring idea for architecture without the designs having to allow for actual movement – they can merely suggest it as was the case for some of the constructions of [[Antonio Gaudi|Gaudi]] or their own recent work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subtletechnologies.com/2006/symposium/Bonnmaison-Macy.html Symposium on ''Architecture and Movement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127153010/http://www.subtletechnologies.com/2006/symposium/Bonnmaison-Macy.html |date=27 November 2010 }} [[Dalhousie University]] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term ''Kinetic architecture'' can also refer to static buildings designed to accentuate human movement, such as the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/kinetic-architecture/oclc/502136203 ''Kinetic architecture''] by Alica Wolfard (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase has been chosen as a title for performing groups including a dance company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kineticarchitecture.org/company.html Kinetic architecture dance trope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726221610/http://www.kineticarchitecture.org/company.html |date=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 5.JPG|thumb|right|'''Kistvaen''' showing [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] and [[cist]] structure ([[Dartmoor]] in [[Drizzlecombe]])]]
[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 1.JPG|thumb|'''Kistvaen''' on the southern edge of Dartmoor in Drizzlecombe]]

A '''kistvaen''' or '''cistvaen''' is a [[tomb]] or [[burial chamber]] formed from flat stone slabs in a box-like shape. If set completely underground, it may be covered by a ''[[tumulus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'' (Courier Dover Publications, 1983), p. 118 with illustration [https://books.google.com/books?id=6n4JLmyooTwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=kistvaen&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1946&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=kistvaen&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] ''[[cist]]'' (chest) and ''maen'' (stone). The term originated in relation to [[Celts|Celtic]] structures, typically pre-[[Christian]], but in [[antiquarian]] scholarship of the 19th and early 20th centuries it was sometimes applied to similar structures outside the [[Celtic nations|Celtic world]].

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|Kistvaen to the south of the stone rows at [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] on [[Dartmoor]]]]

One of the most numerous kinds of kistvaen are the [[Dartmoor kistvaens]]. These often take the form of small rectangular pits about 3&amp;nbsp;ft. (0.9 m) long by 2 feet (0.6 m) wide. The kistvaens were usually covered with a mound of earth and surrounded by a circle of small stones. When a body was placed in the kistvaen, it was usually lain in a contracted position. Sometimes however the body was [[cremate]]d with the ashes placed in a [[cinerary urn]].

==Kistvaens and Celtic saints==
Kistvaens are also found associated with holy sites or burial places of early [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic saints]], who are often [[hagiography|semi-legendary]]. Saints associated with kistvaens include [[Callwen]] daughter of [[Brychan]], [[Gerent, Saint|Geraint]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''Multimedia fugacity model''' is a model in [[environmental chemistry]] that summarizes the processes controlling chemical behavior in environmental media by developing and applying of mathematical statements or "models" of chemical fate.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;

Most chemicals have the potential to migrate from the medium to medium. Multimedia fugacity models are utilized to study and predict the behaviour of chemicals in different environmental compartments.&lt;ref name="Mackay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The models are formulated using the concept of [[fugacity]], which was introduced by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1901 as a criterion of equilibrium and convenient method of calculating multimedia equilibrium partitioning.
The fugacity of chemicals is a mathematical expression that describes the rates at which chemicals diffuse, or are transported between phases. The transfer rate is proportional to the fugacity difference that exists between the source and destination phases.
For building the model, the initial step is to set up a mass balance equation for each phase in question that includes fugacities, concentrations, fluxes and amounts. The important values are the proportionality constant, called [[fugacity capacity]] expressed as Z-values (SI unit: mol/m3 Pa) for a variety of media, and transport parameters expressed as D-values (SI unit: mol/Pa h) for processes such as advection, reaction and intermedia transport. The Z-values are calculated using the equilibrium partitioning coefficients of the chemicals, [[Henry's law]] constant and other related physical-chemical properties.&lt;ref name="Mackay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Depending on the number of phases and complexity of processes different level models are applied. Many of the models apply to steady-state conditions and can be reformulated to describe time-varying conditions by using differential equations. The concept has been used to assess the relative propensity for chemicals to transform from temperate zones and “condense out” at the polar regions.
The multicompartmental approach has been applied to the “quantitative water air sediment interaction" or "QWASI" model designed to assist in understanding chemical fate in lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Mycotoxicology''' is the branch of [[mycology]] that focuses on analyzing and studying the [[toxins]] produced by [[fungi]], known as [[mycotoxins]].&lt;ref name=Bennett87&gt;Bennett, J. W. 1987. Mycotoxins, mycotoxicoses, mycotoxicology and mycopathology. Mycopathlogia 100:3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the food industry it is important to adopt measures that keep mycotoxin levels as low as practicable, especially those that are heat-stable. These chemical compounds are the result of secondary metabolism initiated in response to specific developmental or environmental signals. This includes biological stress from the environment, such as lower nutrients or competition for those available. Under this secondary path the fungus produces a wide array of compounds in order to gain some level of advantage, such as incrementing the efficiency of metabolic processes to gain more energy from less food, or attacking other microorganisms and being able to use their remains as a food source. 

Mycotoxins are made by fungi and are toxic to vertebrates and other animal groups in low concentrations. Low-molecular-weight fungal metabolites such as ethanol that are toxic only in high concentrations are not considered mycotoxins. Mushroom poisons are fungal metabolites that can cause disease and death in humans and other animals; they are rather arbitrarily excluded from discussions of mycotoxicology. Molds make mycotoxins; mushrooms and other macroscopic fungi make mushroom poisons. The distinction between a mycotoxin and a mushroom poison is based not only on the size of the producing fungus, but also on human intention. Mycotoxin exposure is almost always accidental. In contrast, with the exception of the victims of a few mycologically accomplished murderers, mushroom poisons are usually ingested by amateur mushroom hunters who have collected, cooked, and eaten what was misidentified as a harmless, edible species.&lt;ref name=Moss96&gt;Moss, M. O. 1996. Mycotoxins. Mycol. Res. 100:513-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycotoxins are hard to define and are also very difficult to classify. Mycotoxins have diverse chemical structures, biosynthetic origins, myriad biological effects, and produce numerous different fungal species. Classification generally reflects the training of the categorizer and does not adhere to any set system. Mycotoxins are often arranged by physicians depending on what organ they effect. Mycotoxins can be categorized as nephrotoxins, hepatoxins, immunotoxins, neurotoxins, etc. Generic groups created by cell biologist are teratogens, mutagens, allergens, and carcinogens. Organic chemists have attempted to classify them by their chemical structures (e.g., lactones, coumarins); biochemists according to their biosynthetic origins (polyketides, amino acid-derived, etc.); physicians by the illnesses they cause (e.g., St. Anthony's fire, stachybotryotoxicosis), and mycologists by the fungi that produce them (e.g., Aspergillus toxins, Penicillium toxins).None of these classifications is entirely satisfactory. Aflatoxin, for example, is a hepatotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, difuran-containing, polyketide-derived Aspergillus toxin. Zearalenone is a Fusarium metabolite with potent estrogenic activity; hence, in addition to being called (probably erroneously) a mycotoxin, it also has been labeled a phytoestrogen, a mycoestrogen, and a growth promotant.&lt;ref&gt;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2003 July; 16(3): 497–516.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Mycotoxins ==
'''[[Citrinin]]''': Citrinin was first isolated from Penicillium citrinum prior to World War II;&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, A. C., and H. Raistrick. 1931. Studies in the biochemistry of microorganisms. Part XIV. On the production and chemical constitution of a new yellow colouring matter, citrinin, produced from glucose by Penicillium citrinum Thom. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London Ser. B 220B:269-295.&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently, it was identified in over a dozen species of Penicillium and several species of Aspergillus (e.g., Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus niveus), including certain strains of Penicillium camemberti (used to produce cheese) and Aspergillus oryzae (used to produce sake, miso, and soy sauce).&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, M. 2001. Fermented foods and mycotoxins. Mycotoxins 51:25-28&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, citrinin has also been isolated from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus, industrial species used to produce red pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, P. J., M. O. Loret, and G. Goma. 1995. Production of citrinin by various species of Monascus. Biotechnol. Lett. 17:291-294.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Aflatoxins]]''': The aflatoxins were isolated and characterized after the death of more than 100,000 turkey poults ([[turkey X disease]]) was traced to the consumption of a mold-contaminated peanut meal.&lt;ref&gt;Blout, W. P. 1961. Turkey “X” disease. Turkeys 9:52, 55-58, 61, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, L. (ed.). 1969. Aflatoxin. scientific background, control, and implications. Academic Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; The four major aflatoxins are called B1, B2, G1, and G2 based on their fluorescence under UV light (blue or green) and relative chromatographic mobility during thin-layer chromatography. Aflatoxin B1 is the most potent natural carcinogen known &lt;ref&gt;Squire, R. A. 1981. Ranking animal carcinogens: a proposed regulatory approach. Science 214:877-880&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually the major aflatoxin produced by toxigenic strains. It is also the best studied: in a large percentage of the papers published, the term aflatoxin can be construed to mean aflatoxin B1. However, well over a dozen other aflatoxins (e.g., P1. Q1, B2a, and G2a) have been described, especially as mammalian biotransformation products of the major metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, J. G., and J. R. Hibbert. 1978. Aflatoxins: chemical and biological aspects. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The classic book Aflatoxin: Scientific Background, Control, and Implications, published in 1969, is still a valuable resource for reviewing the history, chemistry, toxicology, and agricultural implications of aflatoxin research. 

'''[[Fumonisins]]''': Fumonisins were first described and characterized in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Bezuidenhout, S. C., W. C. A. Gelderblom, C. P. Gorst-Allman, R. M. Horak, W. F. O. Marasas; G. Spiteller, and R. Vleggaar. 1988. Structure elucidation of the fumonisins, mycotoxins from Fusarium moniliforme. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1988:743-745.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezuidenhout, S. C., W. C. A. Gelderblom, C. P. Gorst-Allman, R. M. Horak, W. F. O. Marasas; G. Spiteller, and R. Vleggaar. 1988. Structure elucidation of the fumonisins, mycotoxins from Fusarium moniliforme. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1988:743-745.&lt;/ref&gt; The most abundantly produced member of the family is fumonisin B1. They are thought to be synthesized by condensation of the amino acid alanine into an acetate-derived precursor.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, M. J., and A. D. W. Dobson. 1999. Molecular biology of mycotoxin production. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 175:149-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Fumonisins are produced by a number of Fusarium species, notably Fusarium verticillioides (formerly Fusarium moniliforme = Gibberella fujikuroi), Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium nygamai, as well as Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici.&lt;ref&gt;Rheeder, J. P., W. F. Marasas, and H. F. Vismer. 2002. Production of fumonisin analogs by Fusarium species. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68:2102-2105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O., J. D. Miller, R. T. Riley, and A. Visconti. 2001. Fumonisins—occurrence, toxicology, metabolism and risk assessment, p, 332-359. In B. A. Summerell, J. F. Leslie, D. Backhouse, W. L. Bryden, and L. W. Burgess (ed.), Fusarium. Paul E. Nelson Memorial Symposium. APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.&lt;/ref&gt; These fungi are taxonomically challenging, with a complex and rapidly changing nomenclature which has perplexed many nonmycologists (and some mycologists, too).&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O., P. E. Nelson, and T. A. Toussoun. 1984. Toxigenic Fusarium species: identity and mycotoxicology. The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, Pa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. F. 1996. Introductory biology of Fusarium moniliforme, p. 153-164. In L. S. Jackson, J. W. DeVries, and L. B. Bullerman (ed.), Fumonisins in food. Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; The major species of economic importance is Fusarium verticillioides, which grows as a corn endophyte in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, often without causing disease symptoms in the plant. However, when weather conditions, insect damage, and the appropriate fungal and plant genotype are present, it can cause seedling blight, stalk rot, and ear rot.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, P. E., A. E. Desjardins, and R. D. Plattner. 1993. Fumonisins, mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species: biology, chemistry and significance. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 31:233-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Fusarium verticillioides is present in virtually all corn samples.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, E. 1983. Yellow rain experts battle over corn mold. Science 221:526-529.&lt;/ref&gt; Most strains do not produce the toxin, so the presence of the fungus does not necessarily mean that fumonisin is also present.&lt;ref&gt;Plumlee, K. H., and F. D. Galey. 1994. Neurotoxic mycotoxins: A review of fungal toxins that cause neurological disease in large animals. J. Vet. Intern. Med. 8:49-54&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is phytotoxic, fumonisin B1 is not required for plant pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O. 1996. Fumonsins: history, world-wide occurrence and impact, p. 1-17. In L. S. Jackson, J. W. DeVries, and L. B. Bullerman (ed.), Fumonosins in food. Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desjardins, A. E., and R. D. Plattner. 2000. Fumonisin B (1)-nonproducing strains of Fusarium verticillioides cause maize (Zea mays) ear infection and ear rot. J. Agric. Food Chem. 48:5773-5780&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Ochratoxin]]''': Ochratoxin A was discovered as a metabolite of Aspergillus ochraceus in 1965 during a large screen of fungal metabolites that was designed specifically to identify new mycotoxins.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Merwe, K. J., P. S. Steyne, L. F. Fourie, D. B. Scott, and J. J. Theron. 1965. Ochratoxin A, a toxic metabolite produced by Aspergillus ochraceus Wilh. Nature 205:1112-1113&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, it was isolated from a commercial corn sample in the United States &lt;ref&gt;Shotwell, L. L., C. W. Hesseltine, and M. L. Goulden. 1969. Ochratoxin A: occurrence as natural contaminant of a corn sample. Appl. Microbiol. 17:765-766&lt;/ref&gt; and recognized as a potent nephrotoxin. Members of the ochratoxin family have been found as metabolites of many different species of Aspergillus, including Aspergillus alliaceus, Aspergillus auricomus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus melleus, and Aspergillus niger.&lt;ref&gt;Abarca, M. L., M. R. Bragulat, G. Sastella, and F. J. Cabanes. 1994. Ochratoxin A production by strains of Aspergillus niger var. niger. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:2650-2652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayman, P., J. L. Baker, M. A. Doster, T. J. Michailides and, N. E. Mahoney. 2002. Ochratoxin production by the Aspergillus ochraceus group and Aspergillus alliaceus. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68:2326-2329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciegler, A., D. J. Fennell, H. J. Mintzlaff, and L. Leistner. 1972. Ochratoxin synthesis by Penicillium species. Naturwissenschaften 59:365-366&lt;/ref&gt; Because Aspergillus niger is used widely in the production of enzymes and citric acid for human consumption, it is important to ensure that industrial strains are nonproducers.&lt;ref&gt;Heenan, C. N., K. J. Shaw, and J. I. Pitt. 1998. Ochratoxin A production by Aspergillus carbonarius and A. niger isolates and detection using coconut cream agar. J. Food Mycol. 1:67-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teren, J., J. Varga, Z. Hamari, E. Rinyu, and F. Kevei. 1996. Immunochemical detection of ochratoxin A in black Aspergillus strains. Mycopathologia 134:171-186&lt;/ref&gt; Although some early reports implicated several Penicillium species, it is now thought that Penicillium verrucosum, a common contaminant of barley, is the only confirmed ochratoxin producer in this genus.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, J. I. 1987. Penicillium viridicatum, Penicillium verrucosum, and production of ochratoxin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53:266-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chu, F. S. 1974. Studies on ochratoxins. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2:499-524&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many mycotoxin reviews reiterate erroneous species lists.

'''[[Patulin]]''': Patulin, 4-hydroxy-4H-furo[3,2c]pyran-2(6H)-one, is produced by many different molds but was first isolated as an antimicrobial active principle during the 1940s from Penicillium patulum (later called Penicillium urticae, now Penicillium griseofulvum). The same metabolite was also isolated from other species and given the names clavacin, claviformin, expansin, mycoin c, and penicidin.&lt;ref&gt;Ciegler, A., R. W. Detroy, and E. B. Lillejoj. 1971. Patulin, penicillic acid and other carcinogenic lactones, p. 409-434. In A. Ciegler, S. Kadis and S. J. Ajl (ed.), Microbial toxins, vol. VI: fungal toxins. Academic Press. New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of early studies were directed towards harnessing its antibiotic activity. For example, it was tested as both a nose and throat spray for treating the common cold and as an ointment for treating fungal skin infections&lt;ref&gt;Ciegler, A. 1977. Patulin, p. 609-624. In J. V. Rodricks, C. W. Hesseltine, and M. A. Mehlman (ed.), Mycotoxins in human and animal health. Pathotox Publishers, Inc., Park Forest South, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1950s and 1960s, it became apparent that, in addition to its antibacterial, antiviral, and antiprotozoal activity, patulin was toxic to both plants and animals, precluding its clinical use as an antibiotic. During the 1960s, patulin was reclassified as a mycotoxin. 

'''[[Trichothecenes]]''': The trichothecenes constitute a family of more than sixty sesquiterpenoid metabolites produced by a number of fungal genera, including Fusarium, Myrothecium, Phomopsis, Stachybotrys, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, R. J., and R. H. Cox. 1981. Handbook of toxic fungal metabolites. Academic Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, P. M. 1989. The natural occurrence of trichothecenes, p. 1-26. In V. H. Beasley (ed.), Trichothecene mycotoxicosis: pathophysiologic effects, vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueno, Y. (ed.). 1983. Trichothecenes: chemical, biological and toxicological aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The term trichothecene is derived from trichothecin, which was the one of the first members of the family identified. All trichothecenes contain a common 12,13-epoxytrichothene skeleton and an olefinic bond with various side chain substitutions. They are commonly found as food and feed contaminants, and consumption of these mycotoxins can result in alimentary hemorrhage and vomiting; direct contact causes dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, V. R. (ed.). 1989. Trichothecene mycotoxicosis: pathophysiologic effects, vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joffe, A. Z. 1986. Fusarium species: their biology and toxicology. John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O., P. E. Nelson, and T. A. Toussoun. 1984. Toxigenic Fusarium species: identity and mycotoxicology. The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, Pa.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Zearalenone]]''': Zearalenone (6-[10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl]-B-resorcyclic acid lactone), a secondary metabolite from Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) was given the trivial name zearalenone as a combination of G. zeae, resorcylic acid lactone, -ene (for the presence of the C-1′ to C-2 double bond), and -one, for the C-6′ ketone.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, W. H., H. L. Wehrmeister, E. B. Hodge, and P. H. Hidy. 1966. The structure of zearalenone. Tetrahedron Lett. 27:3109-3114&lt;/ref&gt; Almost simultaneously, a second group isolated, crystallized, and studied the metabolic properties of the same compound and named it F-2.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, C. M., G. H. Nelson, and C. J. Mirocha. 1965. Effect on the white rat uterus of a toxic substance isolated from Fusarium. Appl. Microbiol. 13:653-659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirocha, C. J., C. M. Christensen, and G. H. Nelson. 1967. Estrogenic metabolite produced by Fusarium graminearum in stored grain. Appl. Microbiol. 15:497-503&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the early literature uses zearalenone and F-2 as synonyms; the family of analogues are known as zearalenones and F-2 toxins, respectively. Perhaps because the original work on these fungal macrolides coincided with the discovery of aflatoxins, chapters on zearalenone have become a regular fixture in monographs on mycotoxins (see, for example, Mirocha and Christensen &lt;ref&gt;Mirocha, C. J., and C. M. Christensen. 1974. Oestrogenic mycotoxins synthesized by Fusarium, p. 129-148. In I. F. H. Purchase (ed.), Mycotoxins. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; and Betina &lt;ref&gt;Betina, V. 1989. Bioactive molecules vol. 9. Mycotoxins: chemical, biological and environmental aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;). Nevertheless, the word toxin is almost certainly a misnomer because zearalenone, while biologically potent, is hardly toxic; rather, it sufficiently resembles 17β-estradiol, the principal hormone produced by the human ovary, to allow it to bind to estrogen receptors in mammalian target cells &lt;ref&gt;Kuiper-Goodman, T., P. M. Scott, and H. Watanabe. 1987. Risk assessment of the mycotoxin zearalenone. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 7:253-306&lt;/ref&gt; Zearalenone is better classified as a nonsteroidal estrogen or mycoestrogen. Sometimes it is called a phytoestrogen. For the structure-activity relationships of zearalenone and its analogues, see Hurd &lt;ref&gt;Hurd, R. N. 1977. Structure activity relationships in zearalenones, p. 379-391. In J. V. Rodricks, C. W. Hesseltine, and M. A. Mehlman (ed.), Mycotoxins in human and animal health. Pathotox Publications, Inc., Park Forest South, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shier.&lt;ref&gt;Shier, W. T. 1998. Estrogenic mycotoxins. Rev. Med. Vet. 149:599-604&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosco''' (Spanish: ''Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco'') is a [[higher education]] establishment in [[Patagonia]], southern [[Argentina]]. It was created on February 25, 1980, by law 22.713, as the merge of two national universities: the "Universidad de San Juan Bosco" and "Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia". It is named after [[John Bosco|San Juan Bosco]], patron saint of the area.

The university has four schools - [[Engineering]], [[Economy]], [[Humanities]], [[Legal]], and [[Natural Sciences]], spread over several cities in Patagonia: [[Puerto Madryn]], [[Trelew]], [[Esquel]], [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], and [[Ushuaia]]. The central faculty is located in Comodoro Rivadavia.
The University has {{As of|2005|lc=on}} 14,000 students, with 5000 in the main school.

In 2015, the university opened to the inhabitants of the [[Falkland Islands]]. The academic program was translated into English, language courses were designed and a system of special scholarship was established. Thus, National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosco became the first Argentine university to extend their academic offer to [[Falkland Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpatagonico.com/con-la-presencia-filmus-la-universidad-presenta-su-oferta-academica-los-habitantes-islas-malvinas-n1288000&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Wetlands Research Center''' (NWRC) was founded in 1975 as part of the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]'s (USFWS) Office of Biological Services.  Its headquarters are located in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

The NWRC is one of 16 science centers of the [[Biological Resources Division]] of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]]. The mission of the National Wetlands Research Center is to develop and disseminate scientific information needed for understanding the ecology and values of U.S. wetlands and for managing and restoring wetland habitats and associated plant and animal communities. Its mission's primary goal is to bridge the gap between researchers and decision makers, mostly by using geographic information systems and producing reports such as coastal characterizations, community and estuarine profiles, and species profiles.

==History==

'''Oligosaprobes''' are organisms that inhabit clean water or water that is only slightly polluted by organic matter. [[Oxidation]] processes predominate in such waters owing to an excess of dissolved oxygen. [[Nitrate]]s are among the nitrogen compounds present; there is little carbonic acid and no hydrogen sulfide.  Oligosaprobic environments are aquatic environments rich in dissolved oxygen and (relatively) free from decayed organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Basinger Maggenti, Armand R. Maggenti, and Scott Gardner,  '''Online Dictionary of Invertebrate Zoology: O''' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligosaprobes include some green and [[Diatom|diatomaceous algae]], flowering plants (for example, [[European white water lily|European white water lilies]]), some [[rotifers]], [[Bryozoa]], sponges, [[mollusk]]s of the genus [[Dreissena]], [[cladoceran]]s (daphnids, bithotrephes), dragonfly and [[mayfly]] larvae, sterlets, trout, minnows, and newts. Oligosaprobes also embrace a few saprophytes, including bacteria (scores and hundreds per 1 cu mm of water) and organisms that feed on bacteria. The term “oligosaprobe” is usually applied only to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overdetermination''' occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect. That is, there are more causes present than are necessary to cause the effect. In the [[philosophy of science]], this means that more evidence is available than is necessary to justify a conclusion. Overdetermination is in contrast to [[underdetermination]], when the number or strength of causes is insufficient. 

The term "overdetermination" ({{lang-de|Überdeterminierung}}) was also used by [[Sigmund Freud]] as a key concept in his [[psychoanalysis]].

==Freud and psychoanalysis==

Freud wrote in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' that many features of dreams were usually "overdetermined," in that they were caused by multiple factors in the life of the dreamer, from the "residue of the day" (superficial memories of recent life) to deeply repressed traumas and unconscious wishes, these being "potent thoughts".  Freud favored interpretations which accounted for such features not only once, but many times, in the context of various levels and complexes of the dreamer's psyche.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. chapter 6, "The Dream-Work", section b., "The work of displacement".&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was later borrowed for a variety of other realms of thought.

==In analytic philosophy==

In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] an event or state of affairs is said to be ''overdetermined'' if it has two or more distinct, [[sufficient causes]].   In philosophy of mind, the famous case of overdetermination is called mental-physical causal overdetermination. If we accept that a mental state (M) is realized by a physical state (P). And M can cause another mental state (M*) or another physical state (P*). Then, nomologically speaking, P can cause M* or P* too. In this way, M* or P* is both determined by M and P. In other words, both M* and P* are overdetermined. Since either M or P is sufficient for M* or P*, the problem of mental-physical causal overdetermination is the causal redundancy. 

Whereas there may unproblematically be recognised many different ''necessary'' conditions of the event's occurrence, no two distinct events may lay claim to be sufficient conditions, since this would lead to overdetermination. A much used example is that of [[firing squad]]s, the members of which simultaneously firing at and 'killing' their targets. Apparently, no one member can be said to have caused the victims' deaths, since he or she would have been killed anyway. Another example is that Billy and Suzy each throw a rock through a window, and either rock alone could have shattered the window. In this case, similar to the example of firing squads, Billy and Suzy ''together'' shatter the window and the result is not overdetermined. Or, we can say, even if these two examples are a kind of overdetermination, this kind of overdetermination is benign.

There are many problems of overdetermination. First, overdetermination is problematic in particular from the viewpoint of a standard [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] understanding of causation, according to which an event is the cause of another event if and only if the latter would not have occurred, had the former not occurred. In order to employ this formula to actual complex situations, implicit or explicit conditions need to be accepted to be circumstantial, since the list of counterfactually acceptable causes would otherwise be impractically long (e.g. the Earth's continued existence could be said to be the (necessary) cause of one drinking one's coffee). Unless a circumstance-clause is included, the putative cause to which one wishes to draw attention could never be considered sufficient, and hence not comply with the counterfactual analysis. Second, overdetermination is problematic in that we do not know how to explain where the extra causation "comes from" and "goes". This makes overdetermination mysterious.

==Richards and literature==

The [[New Critic]] [[I. A. Richards]] used the idea of overdetermination to explain the importance of [[ambiguity]] in [[rhetoric]], the [[philosophy of language]], and [[literary criticism]].

==Althusser and structuralist Marxism==

The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]] imported the concept into [[Marxist political theory]] in an influential essay, "Contradiction and overdetermination." Drawing from both Freud and [[Mao Zedong]], Althusser used the idea of overdetermination as a way of thinking about the multiple, often opposed, forces active at once in any political situation, without falling into an overly simple idea of these forces being simply "contradictory."  Brewster, in Althusser et al.'s ''[[Reading Capital]]'' defines overdetermination as such:

''"the representation of dream thoughts in images privileged by their condensation of a number of thoughts in a single image (condensation), or by the transference of psychic energy from  a particularly potent thought to apparently trivial things ... [For Althusser] overdetermination of a contradiction is the reflection in it of its conditions of existence within the complex whole."''

An instance of a popular riot calling for revolution could exemplify overdetermination.  The event has to it, in capitalist culture, an over-application (determination) of agitation. The determinant contradictions (the reasons for popular revolt) are not addressed and so their great mass is "displaced" onto the singular event.

The diagnostic category '''pervasive developmental disorders''' ('''PDD'''), as opposed to [[specific developmental disorder]]s (SDD), refers to a group of five [[mental illness|disorder]]s characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including [[socialization]] and [[communication]]. The pervasive developmental disorders are: All [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and [[Rett syndrome]].&lt;ref name="NICHCY"&gt;[[National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities]] (NICHCY) (October 2003) ''[http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs20txt.htm Disability Info: Pervasive Developmental Disorders (FS20).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309164405/http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs20txt.htm |date=2008-03-09 }}'' Fact Sheet 20 (FS20)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four of these disorders are commonly called the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s; the last disorder is much rarer, and is sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not.&lt;ref name="Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG 2000 355–63"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG |title= Autism spectrum disorders|journal=Neuron |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=355–63 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X |pmid=11144346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–215 |title= Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |vauthors= Johnson CP, Myers SM, ((Council on Children with Disabilities)) |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of pervasive developmental disorders occurs during infancy, but the condition is usually not identified until the child is around three years old. Parents may begin to question the health of their child when developmental milestones are not met, including age appropriate motor movement and speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Autism Health Center|title=Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) |url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/development-disorder|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.&lt;ref name="NICHCY" /&gt; Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS ([[Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]]).&lt;ref name="NICHCY" /&gt; Others use the general category label of PDD because they are hesitant to diagnose very young children with a specific type of PDD, such as autism.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt; Both approaches contribute to confusion about the term, because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms== 
Symptoms of PDD may include behavioral and communication problems such as:
* Difficulty using and understanding language.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;
* Difficulty relating to people, objects, and events;&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt; for example, lack of eye contact, pointing behavior, and lack of facial responses.
* Unusual play with toys and other objects.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;
* Difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypy|Repetitive body movements]] or behavior patterns,&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt; such as hand flapping, hair twirling, foot tapping, or more complex movements.
* Inability to cuddle or be comforted.
* Difficulty regulating behaviors and emotions, which may result in temper tantrums, anxiety, and aggression.
* Emotional breakdowns.

===Degrees===
Children with PDD vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors. Some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development. Repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident as well. Unusual responses to sensory information&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt; &amp;ndash; loud noises, lights &amp;ndash; are common too.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually made during early childhood. With the release of the DSM-5 in May 2013, the diagnosis for PDD has been removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorders. Distinction between the past disorders is implicated by a series of severity levels. Individuals who received diagnoses based on the DSM-IV should still maintain their diagnosis under the autism spectrum disorders. However, a editorial published in the October 2012 issue of American Journal of Psychiatry notes that, while some doctors argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the diagnostic distinction between ASD and PDD, multiple literature reviews found that studies showing significant differences between the two disorders significantly outnumbered those that found no difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychiatric Publishing|title=Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the recent release of the new diagnostic criteria, the shift in classification and diagnoses will be gradual. Additionally, the replacement of pervasive developmental disorders with autism spectrum disorders has faced great criticism from those with past diagnoses and their family members.

Before the release of the DSM-5, some clinicians used PDD-NOS as a "temporary" diagnosis for children under the age of five when, for whatever reason, they are reluctant to diagnose autism. There are several justifications for this. Very young children have limited social interaction and communication skills to begin with, so it can be tricky to diagnose milder cases of autism in toddlers. The unspoken assumption is that by the age of five, unusual behaviors will either resolve or develop into diagnosable autism. However, some parents view the PDD label as no more than a euphemism for autism spectrum disorders, problematic because this label makes it more difficult to receive aid for [[early childhood intervention]].

===Classification===
The pervasive developmental disorders are:&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt;
* [[Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS), which includes atypical autism, and is the most common (47% of diagnoses);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |title= Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 Sites, United States, 2008 |author= ((Jon Baio, EdS, National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, CDC)) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Autism]], the best-known;
* [[Asperger syndrome]] (9% of autism diagnoses);
* [[Rett syndrome]]; and
* [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]] (CDD).
The first three of these disorders are commonly called the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s; the last two disorders are much rarer, and are sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not.&lt;ref name="Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG 2000 355–63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

In May 2013, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]-Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, Autism, Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The American Psychiatric Association has concluded that using the general diagnosis of ASD supports more accurate diagnoses. The combination of these disorders was also fueled by the standpoint that Autism is characterized by common symptoms and should therefore bear a single diagnostic term. In order to distinguish between the different disorders, the DSM-5 employs severity levels. The severity levels take into account required support, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and deficits in social communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Autism Research Institute|title=DSM-V: What Changes May Mean|url=http://www.autism.com/index.php/news_dsmV|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PDD and PDD-NOS===
There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt; Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt; Others use the general category because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt;

PDD is not itself a diagnosis, while PDD-NOS is a diagnosis. To further complicate the issue, PDD-NOS can also be referred to as "atypical personality development", "atypical PDD", or "atypical Autism".

Because of the "NOS", which means "not otherwise specified", it is hard to describe what PDD-NOS is, other than its being an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some people diagnosed with PDD-NOS are close to having Asperger syndrome, but do not quite fit. Others have near full-fledged autism, but without some of its symptoms. The psychology field is{{when|date=July 2014}} considering creating several subclasses within PDD-NOS.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Treatment==
Medications are used to address certain behavioral problems; therapy for children with PDD should be specialized according to the child's specific needs.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;

Some children with PDD benefit from specialized classrooms in which the class size is small and instruction is given on a one-to-one basis. Others function well in standard special education classes or regular classes with support. Early intervention, including appropriate and specialized educational programs and support services, play a critical role in improving the outcome of individuals with PDD.&lt;ref name="NINDS"&gt;{{Include-USGov|agency=National Institutes of Health|article=NINDS Pervasive Developmental Disorders Information Page|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Pervasive-Developmental-Disorders-Information-Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, a '''plot hole''', '''plothole''' or '''plot error''' is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/plot_hole|title=plot hole {{!}} Definition of plot hole in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inconsistencies include such things as illogical or impossible events,&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/movies-plot-holes-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt; and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline. The term is more loosely also applied to "loose ends" in a plot – side-lined story elements that remain unresolved by the end of the plot.

{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=January 2013}} 

'''Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp.''' is a key United States legal case from 1961 in [[trademark infringement]] law. It is also cited in [[personality rights]] particularly around celebrities. The decision set out that trademark infringement is measured by the multi-factor "likelihood of confusion" test. That is, a new mark will infringe on an existing trademark if the new mark is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.&lt;ref name=polaroid&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Polaroid v. Polarad |vol=287 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=492 |pinpoint= |court=2nd Cir. |date=1961 |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&amp;case=2293827617926067028&amp;scilh=0 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors,&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; including:
* Strength of the plaintiff's trademark; 
* Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue; 
* Similarity of the goods and services at issue;
* Evidence of actual confusion; 
* Purchaser sophistication; 
* Quality of the defendant's goods or services; 
* Defendant's intent in adopting the mark:  

This multi-factor test was famously articularted by Judge [[Henry Friendly]] in Polaroid v. Polarad.&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; and are often referred to as the "Polaroid Factors."&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jdlitman/classes/SI519/PFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upcounsel.com/likelihood-of-confusion-factors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quimbee.com/keyterms/polaroid-factors&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privy digging''' is the process of locating and investigating the contents of defunct [[outhouse]] vaults.  The purpose of privy digging is the salvage of antique bottles and everyday household artifacts from the past.  Privy digging is a form of [[historical digging]] and is often conducted on private residential properties.  Construction sites and major developments around older areas of towns and cities are also likely places to look for evidence of privies.

Historical contractors (privy diggers who enter into contracts enabling them to investigate vaults on commercial or industrial properties) are also engaging in privy digging.  Privies are also called pits, holes, and chambers.  In some locations, like New York City, vaults are sometimes referred to as “wells”, due to their appearance and often considerable depth.  In these instances well digging is synonymous with privy digging.

== Academic controversies ==
There are controversies regarding who should be permitted to investigate private residential privies and the historical significance of what is found in them.  From a conventional academic perspective, it is assumed that all privies contain vital and unique information which cannot be found elsewhere and that a costly forensic approach is required.  Privy diggers who are not professional archaeologists are labeled “looters”, even while working on sites which are in the process of being destroyed or have already been examined and worked by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jordan, S.|title=Past Objects|publisher=Mark Batty Publisher|place=New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9820754-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While both parties are engaging in similar activities, each is confronted with very different logistics, constraints, and unique opportunities for genuine discovery.

US academics responding to the threat of privy digging, dump digging, metal detecting, and so on have helped create laws protecting objects of a certain age, usually only 50–100 years old, from exploitation by opportunistic looters and other thieves that disturb historic context in pursuit of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf |title= Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979| accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws intended to safeguard legitimate national and cultural treasures are applied to any item found while digging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandozzi|first1=Frank|title=Metal Detecting Laws Controversial &amp; Unconstitutional, But You Need To Follow Them|url=https://www.metal-detecting-ghost-towns-of-the-east.com/metaldetectinglaws.html|website=Metal Detecting Ghost Towns of the East}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Privies==
Privies can be constructed of stone, brick, or wood and vary considerably from place to place.&lt;ref name="Dantwell &amp; diZerega Wall"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Cantwell, A.  |author2=diZerega Wall, D. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Unearthing Gotham: The Archaeology of New York City|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-300-08415-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some privy vaults are less than 2 feet deep and others are more than 25 feet.  They can be as narrow as 2 feet or as wide as 10 feet, particularly in urban settings where a large privy shed with multiple doors and inner compartments once stood.  Some vaults are cylindrical, these are usually made of stone or brick.  Though there are cylindrical privies that are actual wooden barrels placed in the ground.  Others are rectangular and commonly made of stone, brick, or wood.  Many shallower rectangular vaults were only wood-lined.

Many privies were cleaned out periodically (“dipped”). This routine process addressed the growing concern for foul odors and airborne illnesses which was prevalent at the time.  Dipping also provided some of the necessary organic material for the fertilizer industry. Around the time that modern plumbing was installed, many were cleaned out and backfilled with newer material. These dipped vaults do not have an undisturbed night soil layer and the probability of one containing anything of major archaeological importance is extremely low.

== Sites ==
[[File:woodlined privy.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavating a small wood-lined privy located behind a residence which was built around 1876.]]
Most privies are located behind the building or buildings which they served.  In major urban areas, such as older cities on the US east coast, they are commonly found in the rear section of the residential lot and their size will vary considerably from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegal|first1=Nina|title=MAKING IT WORK; Through Bottles, Darkly, Glimpses of the Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/nyregion/making-it-work-through-bottles-darkly-glimpses-of-the-past.html?scp=274&amp;sq=dappled&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1|website=New York Times|date=May 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old fire insurance maps, such as [[Sanborn maps|Sanborn]], indicate that some properties were several lots wide and sometimes had two or more houses within the same boundary line.  In these instances only one privy vault may exist for all the houses being considered or one may exist for each.

In other cases structures apparently had no outlying property at all.  It is assumed that these particular vaults were incorporated into a neighboring lot or perhaps placed within the structure itself somewhere, possibly the basement.  Some insurance maps show outbuildings and sheds, and occasionally privy outlines too.  For example, 19th century insurance maps for New York City generally do not have markings indicating privy placements and some for New Jersey do. However, when researching the latter, privy diggers find no evidence that a privy ever existed where the map outline indicates one should be.

[[File:probing.jpg|thumb|300px|Investigating a barren wood-lined privy (ca. 1840).]]
Some privy diggers also research excavation sites where old houses and other buildings, such as factories, saloons, and hotels once were.  The use of heavy machinery can lead to indications of stone or brick structures and other subterranean anomalies being unearthed.  This in turn can lead to discoveries of privies, cisterns, root cellars, and trash pits.  Managers and owners of construction sites may not accommodate privy diggers on their missions to salvage on these sites.

Some of them are enthusiasts themselves and agreements can be formed allowing diggers to search for privy vaults and landfill deposits.  Some historical diggers focus exclusively on these kinds of sites and over time develop good relations with various development companies.  Permission to salvage on these sites can lead to remarkable discoveries with relatively little physical effort but this is the exception to the rule.

==Locating the privy vault==
When a property is determined to be old enough to have had an outhouse somewhere within its original boundaries, probing and test digging are the common methods for finding it.  The basic probe is made of [[spring steel]] and between 4’ and 6’ feet in length.  Many variations exist and each locale being probed has its own peculiarities regarding which equipment and what techniques should be applied.  Adept privy diggers develop considerable skill interpreting the faint residues which come up on the end of a probe and the subtle noise variations encountered while sliding it in and out of the ground.&lt;ref name=brater&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brater, E.|title=The Essentials of Privy Digging|publisher=e-Book|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test digging involves making a small hole, and going down a few feet, to determine that a probe reading is accurate.  Once something other than dirt and rocks are being encountered and man-made objects are buried deeply in a particular spot, the outline of the privy is carefully excavated.  This can take hours or days depending on its size and the materials being dug through.  Dug dirt or “fluff” as it is sometimes called, is systematically removed from the hole by shoveling.  Deeper holes require a rope and bucket setup and sometimes a tripod mechanism to assist with the removal of material.

==Privy maintenance and garbage disposal==
[[File:bricklined privy.jpg|thumb|300px|Near the bottom of a brick-lined urban privy awaiting demolition (ca. 1855). During the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] excavators encountered an array of antique bottles and other interesting items which were manufactured in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s.]]
Due to extreme odors and overfilling, a high percentage of privy vaults were cleaned out, to varying levels, while still in use.  This is commonly referred to as “dipping” among privy diggers.  The amount of dipping that occurred, how far down a well material was cleared and how frequently it was cleared, varied from privy to privy.  After plumbing was installed at the residence there was a final cleaning, which had a tendency of removing everything down to the deepest level of the vault.

Even at depths reaching 30 feet or more, some of the deepest vaults known to exist, many were cleaned to the base. Alternatively, a small percentage of shallow vaults extending down about 3 feet or less have contained noteworthy bottles, numerous fragments of dinner plates, cups, bowls, pitchers, tobacco pipes, clam and oyster shells, food bones and even sparse night soil pockets around the edges.

During the mid 19th century operators connected to the booming waste-generated fertilizer (night soil) business circulated cities and towns emptying vaults.  In rural areas where vaults are usually much smaller and shallower farmers and other property owners often conducted this task themselves.  Despite lying in human waste and other decaying refuse for years, many recyclable bottles of the time, and other reusable items, were retrieved during the dipping process.  Genuine garbage would be taken to landfills and other suitable locations and dumped, along with a never ending supply of stove and fireplace ashes.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{Cite book|author=Miller, B.|title=Fat of the Land: Garbage of New York-The Last Two Hundred Years|publisher=Basic Books|place=New York|year=2000|isbn=1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence suggests that not all dippers were equally concerned with being meticulous and periodically dozens of bottles, and even some night soil, can still be found while privy digging.  The many out of place bottles sometimes discovered in clusters near the top or bottom of a dipped out vault are referred to by diggers as “kick-backs”, or “throw-ins”, and were left intentionally by the workers who cleaned out the privy.

Throughout the decades of the middle and late 19th century, the years diggers tend to focus on due to rapid changes in bottle manufacturing, privies were only incidental or sporadic dumping spots for bottles, kitchen garbage and other refuse.  Some privies were never used for that purpose at all and for practical reasons only a very small percentage of a household’s total trash could ever be distributed there.  Due to the enormous quantities of everyday garbage being produced by this time in history, not to mention the hundreds of millions of bottles sold each year in the United States alone, the vaults would have filled up very quickly requiring constant maintenance instead of being emptied just every so often.

Moreover, it was generally acceptable to dump reeking trash just about anywhere then without worrying about legal consequences.  Preferred places were lowland areas near the edges of towns and cities, down embankments and into ravines, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, bogs, shorelines, backyard burning pits and other locales.  For example, New York City sent scows brimming with garbage out into the harbor everyday where very cheap labor shoveled it directly into the water without a second thought.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;  This process went on for centuries and an endless supply of collectable items, antiques and archaeological information alike remain in these dumping places to this day.

A sterile mixture of dirt, sand, rocks, ashes, brick bats and other worthless debris manufactured around 1880-1920 was used to backfill privies once plumbing was installed at a particular address.  With or without night soil deposits remaining down below there is no longer any offensive odor.

== Items recovered ==
[[File:Yale_bottle.gif|thumb|200px|An iron pontiled soda or beer bottle, ca. 1855.]]
Privy digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting. Glass or clay bottles are the most likely items to be found in an average 19th century privy. Yet, more often than not they are found prohibitively damaged. This may be due to the large number of brickbats and stones which are found at all levels of the privy.  Excavators have theorized that at least some of them were thrown in with the intention of crushing down the contents of the vault, so it could be used longer without needing to be cleaned.  The high percentage of broken items is one reason why privy digging is one of the most unpredictable and arduous methods of attempting to form a bottle collection.

Pontiled medicine bottles, ink bottles, beer and soda bottles, and many others, particularly those manufactured between the 1830s-1860s are among the most sought after and can sell for thousands of dollars each.  However, in reality an average pontiled find discovered while privy digging is worth less than twenty dollars.  Even these are not discovered consistently in most locations.

Not unlike old stamps and coins invariably they are required to be in mint or very good condition to be sufficiently interesting to a serious bottle collector.  An enormous quantity of rare bottles are known to exist in private collections, museums, museum and university basements, and elsewhere but these prime examples are seldom found on average privy digs.  In fact a high percentage of all valuable bottles and related containers were never buried in privies, dumps or elsewhere; these are known as “attic” bottles among privy diggers and bottle collectors.

There are exceptions and over time some groups of regularly active diggers, operating in good locations, will encounter thousands of antique bottles and other interesting things. The vast majority of items will be very common examples of nominal value and not very useful to serious collectors, historians, or archaeologists.

Not unlike dump diggers privy diggers may also encounter miscellaneous tableware (banded ware,&lt;ref name=sussman&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sussman, L.|title=Mocha, Banded, Cat’s Eye, and Other Factory-Made Slipware|publisher=Studies in Northeast Historical Archaeology|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; redware, mocha,&lt;ref name=rickard&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rickard, J.|title=Mocha and related dipped wares, 1770-1939 |publisher=University Press of New England|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other slipwares), stoneware, occasionally clay pipes, doll parts, tea set pieces, [[marble (toy)|marbles]], buttons, chamber pots, decorative porcelain pot lids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deantiques.com/PLG/|title=Antique Pot Lid Gallery|accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bases used for pomades and skin creams, bone or ivory toothbrush handles, hard-rubber combs and hair picks, ambrotypes, and other objects which are usually broken or damaged.&lt;ref name="jordan"/&gt;

Most of these items were valueless and intentionally discarded into the privy, others fell through the opening in the outhouse seat, and some were lost at the hands of small children.&lt;ref name="de sola mendez"&gt;{{Cite book|author=de Sola Mendez, E.|title=Tiny Treasures|publisher=Dollhouse Miniatures|page=28|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each instance the insides of active vaults were very caustic environments, the highly toxic ingredients causing most things to break down and rot very quickly.

== Related topics and history ==
Privy diggers, along with dump diggers and other historical diggers are enthusiastic about making their own discoveries and will get sufficiently dirty as a result.  Though there are some exceptions this work is usually done by hand and requires a remarkable degree of persistence and tenacity.  Career level diggers are obsessive by nature, sometimes achieving considerable skill with the various forms of privy digging techniques available.  Some privy diggers also use a metal detector to pinpoint old coins and other easy to miss metal objects. Some privy diggers are metal detectorists and some metal detectorists are also privy diggers, dump diggers and so on.  However, each designation is a specific subject on its own.

[[File:stone privy well.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavating a large stone-lined urban privy during a major property renovation (ca. 1851).]]
Privy digging has things in common with [[dump digging]] and to some degree treasure hunting and garbology but is none of these exclusively as it involves salvaging the contents of defunct privies more than anything else.  Privy digging and dump digging are equally concerned with antique bottles and related items.  Though many exceptions exist in most instances even the oldest dump-bottles are not as old as privy bottles can be.

Dumps are commonly associated with bottles and trash manufactured between the 1880s-1920s.  This was a time when everyday bottles were being mass-produced annually by the hundreds of millions.  They were reused less and often thrown away rather than recycled due to their relatively inexpensive production costs.

Many bottles were still being mouth-blown and their lips formed by assorted tooling devices as late as 1915-20.  The patent for the first fully automatic bottle machine, the Owens Automatic Bottle Machine, was not issued until 1903.  And by 1906 it was swiftly replacing the old method at glasshouses nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Bureau of Land Management and Society for Historic Archaeology: Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Early examples of machine made bottles manufactured between about 1906 and 1915 often resemble their predecessors in shape and color and can be nominally valuable for that reason.

Whether found in privies or dumps late period mouth-blown bottles manufactured between about 1880-1915 have a lesser amount of serious collectable potential depending on rarity, condition and color.  Dug bottles manufactured between 1880 and 1915 have sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars but statistically this is very rare.

Although privy diggers usually attempt to focus on the contents of vaults built before the Civil War, these too can also contain bottles made as late as the 1920s or later up near the top.  Depending on when a vault went into permanent disuse it could contain bottles and debris deposited as late as the second half of the 20th century.  According to a 1950 census 50 million homes reported no indoor plumbing. In 1990 more than 4 million old style privies were still in use coast to coast.&lt;ref name=barlow&gt;{{Cite book|author=Barlow, R.|title=The Vanishing American Outhouse|publisher=Studio|place=New York|year=2000|isbn=0-14-028868-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No matter what is encountered near the top assuming a given vault was active in 1850 its potential for older bottles lying at a lower section has a consistently strong draw for serious privy diggers.

Whether mold blown or free blown (both forms of mouth-blowing and considered hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base.  This mark is the result of removing the pontil rod.  Something which was temporarily fused to the base in order to handle them effectively while they were still exceedingly hot, as their necks and lips were being tooled at the glassworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Burea of Land Management and Society for Historic Archaeology: Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-11-26 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decades just prior to the absence of pontil rods from bottle-glass making were a time when endless variations pertaining to shape, size, style, color and embossing were being produced regularly in an unprecedented quantity.  Some of the most interesting bottles were manufactured during this time; 1830s-1860s.

Even after the pontil rod was replaced by assorted clamping mechanisms known as “snap cases”, many bottles were still being created in the same interesting molds and sold in huge quantities annually.  These are known as smooth base bottles and are sometimes found in privies which were in use after the 1860s and as late as the 1880s.  Visually, the difference between an early smooth base and a pontiled example of exactly the same bottle is insignificant but to a collector it often means everything.  Rare early smooth base bottles can occasionally be as valuable as rare pontiled bottles but statistically they are unlikely to be discovered with any regularity on average privy digs.

'''Repatriation''' is the process of returning an asset, an item of symbolic value or a person{{snd}}voluntarily or forcibly{{snd}}to its owner or their place of origin or citizenship. The term may refer to non-human entities, such as converting a foreign currency into the currency of one's own country, as well as to the process of returning [[military personnel]] to their place of origin following a [[war]]. It also applies to diplomatic envoys, international officials as well as [[expatriates]] and [[Human migration|migrants]] in time of international crisis. For [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|illegal migrants]], repatriation can mean either [[voluntary return]] or [[deportation]].

==Repatriation of humans==

===Overview and clarification of terms===

====Voluntary return vs. forced return====
[[Voluntary return]] is the return of eligible persons, such as refugees, to their [[country of origin]] or citizenship on the basis of freely expressed willingness to such return. Voluntary return, unlike expulsion and deportation, which are actions of sovereign states, is defined as a personal right under specific conditions described in various international instruments, such as the [[OAU Convention]], along with customary international law.

Some countries offer financial support to refugees and immigrants in order to facilitate the process of starting a new life in their country of origin. Examples of 21st century voluntary return include the Danish government, which began in 2009, offering £12,000 each to immigrants to return,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/6533845/Denmark-offers-immigrants-12000-to-return-home.html "Denmark offers immigrants £12,000 to return home"], The Telegraph. November 10, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland offering around 6,500 Francs, targeted for business startups upon returning home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nigeriaworld.com/feature/publication/ubochi/112809.html "Switzerland and Nigerians Abroad"], Temple Chima Ubochi. ''Nigeria World''. November 28, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/15/ireland-pay-immigrants-go-home "Irish government to pay immigrants to go home"], Henry McDonald. ''The Guardian''. November 14, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Germany in 2016 allocated €150 million over three years for migrants willing to return,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-to-pay-for-migrants-to-go-home-gerd-muller/ "Germany to pay for migrants to go home"], Cynthia Kroet. Politico EU. December 9, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swedish government began offering £3,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2016/08/29/thousands-of-migrants-paid-by-swedish-govt-to-leave "Thousands of migrants paid by Swedish gov't to leave"], Michael F. Haverluck. One News Now. August 29, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 544 Nigerians returned home from Switzerland in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/returning-asylum-seekers_a-fresh-start-in-nigeria--brought-to-you-by-switzerland/38687662 "A fresh start in Nigeria, brought to you by Switzerland"], Veronica DeVore. Swiss Info. June 6, 2014. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This financial support may also be considered as residency buyouts.

Two countries may have a re-admission agreement, which establishes procedures, on a reciprocal basis, for one state to return irregular non-nationals to their country of origin or a country through which they have transited.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt; [[Illegal immigrant]]s are frequently repatriated as a matter of government policy. Repatriation measures of [[voluntary return]], with financial assistance, as well as measures of [[deportation]] are used in many countries.

As repatriation can be voluntary or forced the term is also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to their country of origin under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected from [[refoulement]] and given, if possible, temporary or permanent [[Political asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"&gt;Perruchoud, Richard and Jillyanne Redpath-Cross (eds.), Glossary on Migration, Second Edition, International Organisation for Migration, International Migration Law, No. 25, Geneva, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as [[refoulement]], which is against international law.

====Repatriation vs. return====
While repatriation necessarily brings an individual to his or her territory of origin or citizenship, a return potentially includes bringing the person back to the point of departure. This could be to a third country, including a country of transit, which is a country the person has traveled through to get to the country of destination. A return could also be within the territorial boundaries of a country, as in the case of returning [[internally displaced persons]] and demobilized combatants.

===Types of human repatriation===

====Medical repatriation====
Repatriation is linked with health care due to the costs and resources associated with providing medical treatment to travelers and immigrants pursuing citizenship. For example, if someone is in the United States with a visa and becomes ill, the insurance that the visa holder has in his or her native country may not apply in the United States, especially if it is a country with universal health care coverage. This scenario forces hospitals to choose one of three options:  
* Limit their services to emergency care only (as per the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]])  
* Offer charity care free of charge or at a reduced rate  
* Repatriate the patient back to his or her native country where he or she will be covered according to that country's policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wack|first=Kevin J.|author2=Toby Schonfeld |title=Patient Autonomy and the  Unfortunate Choice between Repatriation and Suboptimal Treatment|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2012|volume=12|issue=9|pages=6–7|doi=10.1080/15265161.2012.692444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Determining which option is the most ethical is often very challenging for hospital administrators.

In some cases, a traveler's personal insurance company is required to repatriate the patient for medical treatment. The method of repatriation could be via regular flight, by ground, or by air ambulance. Medical repatriation is different from the act of [[medical evacuation]].

====Post–World War II====
In the 20th century, following all European wars, several repatriation commissions were created to supervise the return of war refugees, [[displaced person]]s, and [[prisoners of war]] to their country of origin. Repatriation [[hospital]]s were established in some countries to care for the ongoing medical and health requirements of returned military personnel. In the [[Soviet Union]], the refugees seen as traitors for surrendering were often killed or sent to [[Siberia]]n concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Paul|title=Ostarbeiters|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2005/6/po8.html|website=Coffee Lounge|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues surrounding repatriation have been some of the most heatedly debated political topics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Many [[Operation Keelhaul|forced back to the Soviet Union by Allied forces]] in [[World War II]] still hold this forced migration against the [[United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The term ''repatriation'' was often used by Communist governments to describe the large-scale state-sponsored [[ethnic cleansing]] actions and [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of national groups. [[Poland|Poles]] born in territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union,  although deported to the State of Poland, were settled in the annexed former [[Germany|German]] territories (referred to in Polish as the [[Regained Territories]]). In the process they were told that they had returned to their Motherland.

====Battlefield casualties====
The [[Korean War]] marked the first time that the United States or any nation began returning the bodies of battlefield casualties as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Sledge&gt;{{cite book |last=Sledge |first=Michael |title=Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen |orig-year=First published 2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231509374 |pages=78–80 |oclc= 60527603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Glory]], which followed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]], thousands of remains were exchanged by both sides.&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not all remains from the Korean War were returned to the home countries. Some 2,300 casualties are buried at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of immediately recovering casualties continued for United States during the [[Vietnam War casualties|Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;

===Repatriation laws===
{{See also|Right of Return}}
Repatriation laws give non-citizen foreigners who are part of the titular [[Ethnic majority|majority group]] the opportunity to immigrate and receive [[citizenship]]. Repatriation of their titular diaspora is practiced by most [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] states. Repatriation laws have been created in many countries to enable [[diaspora]]s to immigrate ("return") to their "kin-state". This is sometimes known as the exercise of the [[right of return]]. Repatriation laws give members of the diaspora the right to immigrate to their kin-state and they serve to maintain close ties between the state and its diaspora and gives preferential treatment to diaspora immigrants.

Most countries in central and eastern Europe as well as [[Armenia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Turkey]] have longstanding repatriation legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|title=Democratic Norms, Diasporas, and Israel’s Law of Return|last2=Rubinstein|first2=Amnon|authorlink2=Amnon Rubinstein|format=PDF|first1=Alexander|last1=Yakobson|authorlink1=Alexander Yakobson|work=ajc.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126182841/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]] also have repatriation laws for their diaspora populations. The number of countries with repatriation laws has mushroomed since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of Soviet communism]] and most independent nations that were [[Post-Soviet states|once part of the communist domain]] in [[Europe]] have since legislated repatriation laws. Many other countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Sweden]] have (or have had) generous immigration policies with regard to the nation's [[diaspora]] without having formally enacted repatriation laws. Such states can be described as practicing ''common law repatriation''.

In comparison, one of the central tenets of the [[Rastafari movement]] is the desirability of the repatriation of [[black people]] from the [[Americas]] and elsewhere back to [[Africa]]. While [[Ethiopia]] specifically has land available in [[Shashamane]] to encourage this project, black people who are citizens of countries outside Africa do not have the [[right of return]] to Africa, although as individuals they are free to try to [[emigration|emigrate]].

===Psychological aspects===
Repatriation is often the "forgotten" phase of the [[expatriation]] cycle; the emphasis for support is mostly on the actual period abroad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, many repatriates report experiencing difficulties on return: one is no longer special, practical problems arise, new knowledge gained is no longer useful, etc. These difficulties are highly influenced by a number of factors including [[Personal development|self-management]], [[Marriage|spouse's]] adjustment, time spent abroad and skill utilisation. What is crucial is that every individual perceives these factors in a different way. Reintegration is a process of re-inclusion or re-incorporation of a person into a group or a process, and may contribute to overcoming repatriation.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt;

Direct managers and [[Human resources|HR]] staff often notice the difficulties a repatriate experiences, but they are not always able to act on it. Budget shortcomings and time constraints are frequently cited as reasons why it fails to be an agenda priority. Solutions for repatriation difficulties do not have to be expensive and can lead to great benefits for the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Basic support can consist, for example, of good communication in advance, during and after the international assignment, or a mentor program to assist the repatriate. The expatriate and his/her family should feel understood by his or her company. Support can increase job satisfaction, thereby protecting the investment made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;Ripmeester, N. “Handle with care”, ''Graduate Recruiter'', Issue 22 (February) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repatriation of non-human entities==

===Human remains===
[[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|Return of human remains]] to their nation of origin. In the United States, Native Americans' human remains are uncovered and removed from their burial sites in the construction/land development process or as part of archaeological excavations. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) of 1990 established the process whereby federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations can request that federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funds return culturally affiliated human remains.  The NAGPRA also sets forth provisions that allow for the disposition of Native American human remains found on federal lands to the affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.  NAGPRA does not apply to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which is covered under the repatriation provisions of the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989. In previous eras it was common for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colony|colonial]] authorities to collect heads and other body parts of indigenous peoples such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] for display in British museums. The repatriation of these body parts is currently ongoing.  For an example of a successful body part repatriation, see [[Yagan]]. Another example can be seen through the dedicated work of the Karanga Aotearoa Repatriation Programme, established in partnership between Māori and the New Zealand government in 2003.  This programme is administered by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), and since 2003 has repatriated over 350 Māori and Moriori ancestral remains to Aotearoa New Zealand. Article 12 of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to repatriate their human remains. The declaration was passed in September 2007 with the support of 143 countries. The four opposing countries—Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States—subsequently endorsed the declaration.

=== Cultural artifacts===
Cultural or [[art repatriation]] is the return of cultural objects or works of art to their country of origin (usually referring to ancient art), or (for looted material) its former owners (or their heirs).

=== Economic repatriation===
Economic repatriation refers to economic measures taken by a country to reduce foreign capital investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Repatriation of currency===
Repatriation of currency is when foreign currency is converted back to the currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the payment of a dividend by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently hundreds of billions of dollars of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings. (See Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Economic Accounts, Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States, available at the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/ni_FedBeaSna/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&amp;FirstYear=1999&amp;LastYear=2006&amp;Freq=Year|title=U.S. Department of Commerce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1204">'''Return flow''' is surface and [[Groundwater|subsurface water]] that leaves the field following application of [[irrigation]] water. While irrigation return flows are [[point source]]s, in the United States they are expressly exempted from discharge permit requirements under the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, section 502(14), {{USC|33|1362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Return flows generally return to the irrigation centre after a period of about three to four weeks; due to this, the farmers usually need to pour [[bleach]] into the water to clean it of any [[organisms]] that have entered the stream. If this is not taken care of, [[diseases]] such as [[typhoid]] or [[cholera]] could enter the irrigation and pose a risk of [[epidemic]] [[disease]] to surrounding towns and cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Returned To Unit''' or '''RTU''' refers to a military member being returned to their home base or home unit, either due to their being medically unfit, their requesting to be withdrawn from training, or their being unfit for training or otherwise disorderly. As military members can only be [[court-martial]]ed at their home base or unit, being RTU'd for [[misconduct]] can often be a precursor to further judicial punishment.

RTU'ing is a concept used during a period of specialist training, whereby a service person has been extracted or detached from their home unit. For example, if a service person has been extracted to complete an instruction course run by a specialist unit within the armed forces such as a [[Physical Training Instructor|PTI]] or [[Shooting range|Range]] Control course. In the event of the service person wishing to withdraw from the course (e.g. for personal or medical reasons); or if the course [[supervisor]]s deem that the service person is unfit to complete the course, for either medical or disciplinary reasons, the service person may be returned to their home unit. If a candidate is RTU'd, the supervisor responsible for sending them home will supply a written report to the service person's [[Officer Commanding|OC]] detailing the reason why they have been RTU'd. If a service person is RTU'd on disciplinary grounds, their OC will decide if any further disciplinary action is needed, based on the RTU report from the course supervisor, and if necessary, by consultation with the course supervisors. The reason this is done is that, according to military law, disciplinary action such as a [[court-martial]] can only by issued against a service person by their home unit.

There are several reasons why a military member may be RTU'd. It can be for major or minor infractions of the rules, or disorderly behaviour. It may also be on compassionate grounds, such as RTU'ing an injured soldier (or other medical conditions).

The term ''Returned To Unit'' (''RTU'') is used in the [[Canadian Forces]] and the [[UK]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20948">'''Scientific literacy''' or '''Science literacy''' encompasses [[scientific writing|written]], [[mathematics|numerical]], and [[information technology|digital]] [[literacy]]  as they pertain to understanding [[science]], its [[scientific method|methodology]], [[observation]]s, and [[scientific theory|theories]].

== Definition ==

The OECD PISA Framework (2015) defines scientific literacy as "the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.oecd.org/callsfortenders/Annex%20IA_%20PISA%202015%20Science%20Framework%20.pdf |title=PISA 2015 Science Framework |date=March 2013 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person, therefore, is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science 
and technology which requires the competencies to:
* Explain phenomena scientifically &amp;ndash; recognize, offer and evaluate explanations for a range of natural and technological phenomena.
* Evaluate and design scientific inquiry &amp;ndash; describe and appraise scientific investigations and propose ways of addressing questions scientifically.
* Interpret data and evidence scientifically &amp;ndash; analyze and evaluate data, claims and arguments in a variety of representations and draw appropriate scientific conclusions.

According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics, "scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity".&lt;ref name=NCES&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person is defined as one who has the capacity to:

* Understand, [[experiment]], and [[reason]] as well as interpret scientific facts and their meaning.
* Ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences.
* Describe, explain, and predict [[natural phenomena]].
* Read articles with understanding of science in the [[popular press]] and engage in social conversation about the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the conclusions.
* Identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed.
* Evaluate the quality of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it.
* Pose and evaluate [[arguments]] based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific literacy may also be defined in language similar to the definitions of [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Climate Literacy]].&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a scientifically literate person can:
* Understand the science relevant to environmental and social issues.
* Communicate clearly about the science.
* Make informed decisions about these issues.

Finally, scientific literacy may involve particular attitudes toward learning and using science. A scientifically-literate citizen is capable of researching matters of fact for him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHQcXVp4F4 Noam Chomsky on what it means to be educated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reforms in [[science education]] in the United States have often been driven by strategic challenges such as the launch of the [[Sputnik program|Sputnik satellite]] in 1957 and the [[Japanese economic miracle|Japanese economic boom]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, scientific literacy is now taken to mean that everyone should have a working knowledge of science and its role in society. Science literacy is seen as a right of every person and a requirement for [[Citizenship|responsible members of society]], one that helps average people to make better decisions and enrich their lives. The shift occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the publication of ''Science for All Americans''&lt;ref name=Rutherford1991&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford |Ahlgren |1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Benchmarks for Science Literacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | American Association for the Advancement of Science |1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial definitions of science literacy included elaborations of the actual content that people should understand, and this content often followed somewhat traditional lines ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]). [[Earth science]] was somewhat narrowly defined as expanded geological processes. In the decade after those initial documents, ocean scientists and educators revised the notion of science literacy to include more contemporary, systems-oriented views of the natural world, leading to scientific literacy programs for the [[ocean]], [[climate]], [[earth science]], and so on. This shift has ensured that educators' views of science literacy stay in sync with the directions and advances of real science in the real world.

==Science, society, and the environment ==
The interdependence of humans and our natural environment is at the heart of scientific literacy in the Earth systems. As defined by nationwide consensus among scientists and educators, this literacy has two key parts. First, a literate person is defined, in language that echoes the above definition of scientific literacy. Second, a set of concepts are listed, organized into six to nine big ideas or essential principles. This defining process was undertaken first for [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; then for the [[Great Lakes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OSGCP|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estuary|estuaries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NOAA|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atmosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UCAR|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the types of literacy defined for Earth systems; the qualities of an Earth science literate person are representative of the qualities for all the Earth system literacy definitions.

According to the Earth Science Literacy Initiative, an Earth-science-literate person:
* understands the fundamental concepts of Earth’s many systems
* knows how to find and assess scientifically credible information about Earth
* communicates about Earth science in a meaningful way
* is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding Earth and its resources&lt;ref name=ESL/&gt;

All types of literacy in Earth systems have a definition like the above. Ocean literacy is further defined as "understanding our impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on us".&lt;ref name=OL/&gt;
Similarly, the climate literacy website includes a guiding principle for decision making; "humans can take action to reduce climate change and its impacts".&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Each type of Earth systems literacy then defines the concepts students should understand upon graduation from high school. Current educational efforts in Earth systems literacy tend to focus more on the scientific concepts than on the decision-making aspect of literacy, but environmental action remains as a stated goal.

The theme of science in a socially-relevant context appears in many discussions of scientific literacy. Ideas that turn up in the life sciences include an allusion to [[ecological literacy]], the "well-being of earth". Robin Wright, a writer for ''Cell Biology Education'', laments "will [undergraduates'] misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about science imperil our democratic way of life and national security?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of physics literacy includes [[energy conservation]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mission statement of the Chemistry Literacy Project &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CLP|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes environmental and social justice.
Technological literacy is defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space; on the knowledge axis, it is noted that technology can be risky, and that it "reflects the values and culture of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gamire|Pearson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy Literacy boasts several websites, including one associated with climate literacy&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;
and two advocacy organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELA|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELP|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes as part of scientific literacy==
Attitudes about science can have a significant effect on scientific literacy. In [[education theory]], understanding of content lies in the cognitive domain, while attitudes lie in the affective domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Engelhart|Furst|Hill|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negative attitudes, such as fear of science, can act as an [[affective filter]] and an impediment to comprehension and future learning goals. Studies of college students' attitudes about learning physics suggest that these attitudes may be divided into categories of real world connections, personal connections, conceptual connections, student effort and problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Perkins|Podolefsky|Dubson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision-making aspect of science literacy suggests further attitudes about the state of the world, one's responsibility for its well-being and one's sense of empowerment to make a difference. These attitudes may be important measures of science literacy, as described in the case of [[ocean literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cudaback|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting and measuring==
Proponents of scientific literacy tend to focus on what is learned by the time a student graduates from high school. Science literacy has always been an important element of the standards movement in education. All science literacy documents have been drafted with the explicit intent of influencing educational standards, as a means to drive curriculum, teaching, assessment, and ultimately, learning nationwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Programs to promote scientific literacy among students abound, including several programs sponsored by technology companies, as well as quiz bowls and science fairs. A partial list of such programs includes the [[Global Challenge Award]], the [[National Ocean Sciences Bowl]] and Action Bioscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AIBS|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have attempted to compare the scientific literacy of adults in different countries.  The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] found that scientific literacy in the United States is not measurably different from the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NCES|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science News reports "The new U.S. rate, based on questionnaires administered in 2008, is seven percentage points behind Sweden, the only European nation to exceed the Americans.  The U.S. figure is slightly higher than that for Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. And it’s double the 2005 rate in the United Kingdom (and the collective rate for the European Union)." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Science News|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University educators are attempting to develop reliable instruments to measure scientific literacy, and the use of [[Concept inventory|concept inventories]] is increasing in the fields of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klymkowsky|Underwood|Garvin-Doxas|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and earth science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikispaces|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libarkin|Ward|Andwerson|Kortemeyer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">{{Governance}}

'''Simulation governance''' is a managerial function concerned with assurance of reliability of information generated by [[numerical simulation]].  The term was introduced in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: New technical requirements for software tools in computational solid mechanics International Workshop on Verification and Validation in Computational Science University of Notre Dame 17–19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and specific technical requirements were addressed from the perspective of mechanical design in 2012 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: Technical requirements for mechanical design. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 249–252 158–168, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its strategic importance was addressed in 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Meintjes K.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/bm_jan_15_1/ Simulation Governance: Managing Simulation as a Strategic Capability]. NAFEMS Benchmark Magazine, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imbert J-F.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/nwc15_100/ Simulation Governance - Building confidence, a key dimension of simulation strategy]. NAFEMS World Congress NWC15 San Diego, June 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;.  At the [https://www.nafems.org/congress/ 2017 NAFEMS World Congress] in Stockholm simulation governance was identified as the first of eight “[https://www.nafems.org/congress/thebigissues/ big issues]” in [[numerical simulation]].

Simulation governance is concerned with (a) selection and adoption of the best available simulation technology, (b) formulation of [[mathematical models]], (c) management of experimental data, (d) data and solution [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models#Verification|verification]] procedures, and (e) revision of mathematical models in the light of new information collected from physical experiments and field observations &lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf WL and Pilch M. [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/r0121/ Simulation Verification and Validation for Managers]. NAFEMS, 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-910643-33-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A plan for simulation governance has to be tailored to fit the mission of each organization or department within an organization: If that mission is to apply established rules of design and [[certification]] then emphasis is on solution verification and [[standardization]]. If, on the other hand, that mission is to formulate design rules, or make condition-based maintenance decisions, then [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|verification, validation]] and [[uncertainty quantification]] must be part of the plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9524">The '''Spoken English Corpus''' ('''SEC''') is a [[speech corpus]] used in [[corpus linguistics]] consisting of a collection of recordings of spoken [[British English]] compiled during the period 1984-7 through a collaboration, funded by [[International Business Machines|IBM]], between the Unit for Computer Research on the English Language (UCREL) at the [[University of Lancaster]] and the IBM Scientific Centre in [[Winchester]].&lt;ref name="leech" /&gt; The corpus comprises 53 recorded passages, mainly recorded from the [[BBC]], spoken in the accent usually referred to as [[Received Pronunciation]], or RP. It covers categories such as commentary. news broadcast, lecture and dialogue.&lt;ref name="Xiao1" /&gt; The corpus contains 52,637 words, in a recording time of 339 minutes. The compilation of the corpus is described by Lita Taylor in her 1996 article "The Compilation of the Spoken English Corpus."&lt;ref name="taylor" /&gt; The whole corpus in print can be purchased at Routledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/A-Corpus-of-Formal-British-English-Speech-The-Lancaster-IBM-Spoken-English/Knowles-Taylor-Williams/p/book/9780582056398|title=A Corpus of Formal British English Speech: The Lancaster/IBM Spoken English Corpus (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcription of the recordings ==

A system was devised for transcription of the [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of the material in the recordings, and two transcribers, Gerry Knowles and Briony Williams, analysed the entire corpus. The transcription system is explained by Williams,&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; and an experiment was conducted by Brian Pickering to assess the degree of [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between the two transcribers on a section of the Corpus containing around 1000 [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]-units which was transcribed by both transcribers.&lt;ref name="pickering" /&gt; Good agreement was found.

==Other analysis==

[[Part-of-speech tagging|Grammatical tagging]] of each word was added to the text of the SEC by an automatic process;&lt;ref name="taylor2" /&gt; the fact that this tagging was in machine-readable form made it possible to relate [[grammatical]] and [[prosodic]] information in the texts. Subsequent work used probabilistic models to develop further the grammatical tagging and to produce automatic [[parsing]] techniques.&lt;ref name=sampson /&gt;

== Machine-Readable Spoken English Corpus (MARSEC) ==

Although the text and its associated tagging existed in machine-readable form, the recordings themselves existed only as tape-recordings. A collaboration, funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] in 1992-4, between speech scientists at the Universities of Lancaster and [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] in the United Kingdom set out to produce a version of the corpus which contained the recordings in digital form, time-linked to the text.&lt;ref name="roachetal" /&gt; The principal researchers were Gerry Knowles and Tamas Varadi (Lancaster) and Peter Roach and Simon Arnfield (Leeds). The outline of the project is set out in Knowles,&lt;ref name="knowles" /&gt; and the automatic time-alignment is described by Roach and Arnfield.&lt;ref name="roach" /&gt; The digitized recordings were recorded on [[CD-ROM]]; it was subsequently made available for downloading for research purposes from Leeds University, though this facility is no longer supported.

== Aix-MARSEC ==

The work on MARSEC in Lancaster and Leeds finished around 1995, but the corpus has subsequently been the object of a considerable amount of further development at the [[University of Aix-en-Provence]], France, under the direction of Daniel Hirst.&lt;ref name="hirst" /&gt; The database consists of two major components: the digitalized recordings from MARSEC and the annotations. Annotations have so far been undertaken at nine levels, including [[phoneme]]s, [[syllable]]s, [[word]]s, [[stress feet]], [[Rhythm#Linguistics|rhythm]] units and minor and major [[Turn construction unit|turn units]].  Two supplementary levels, the grammatical annotation by CLAWS and a Property Grammar system developed at Aix-en-Provence, are to be integrated soon.&lt;ref name="auron" /&gt; A possible disadvantage of this treatment is that the corpus can only be searched using specially written scripts.&lt;ref name="wichmann"/&gt; The database, together with tools, is available under [[GNU GPL]] licensing at the Aix-MARSEC project site.&lt;ref name="hirst2" /&gt;

'''Fir and spruce forests''' are greatly affected by slight fluctuations in climate. Temperature is the primary determinate for spatial patterns of fir and spruce.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Louis and Prasad. “Potential Changes in Tree Species Richness and Forest Community Types following Climate Change.” 2001. Ecosystems 4: 186-199. 20 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dominant trees in this type of forest are ''[[Picea engelmannii]]'' (Engelmann spruce) and ''[[Abies lasiocarpa]]'' (subalpine fir).&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987. Colorado State University Dissertation: 18 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thick-barked trees, such as the ''[[Pinus resinosa]]'', frequently survive fire, the thin bark of spruce make them more vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Trees such as the [[Douglas fir]] withstand much of the fire due to the thicker bark they have.&lt;ref&gt;Renkin, Roy A. and Despain. “Fuel moisture, forest type, and lightning-caused fire in Yellowstone National Park.” 1992. NRC Canada: 22(1): 37–45. 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the burn mosaic during a fire, relative to species niche requirements and mobility, can have major impacts on flora and fauna dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples and characteristics ==
Forests of the Southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] had covered approximately 140&amp;nbsp;km² on peaks and ranges. Today this forest type occupies less than 70&amp;nbsp;km². Much of this forest loss is due to [[logging]], followed by slash fires.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the Plott Balsam mountains, North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Waterrock Knob]] fire was composed of different group of plant species than are normally found in burned spruce and fir forests. The [[tree layer]] of this stand consists of fewer than expected stems and has low basal area. The [[shrub layer]] is very dense, which may reduce successful tree reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the [[Plott Balsam mountains]], North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[herbaceous layer]] growth is not typical of young, disturbed spruce and fir stands. These vegetation characteristics suggest that possibly a hot fire in conjunction with a steep rocky slope and shallow soils have been some of the reasons for the reduced development of a typical spruce and fir stand.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the Plott Balsam mountains, North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; Burned soil has been an important factor in determining earlier and present vegetation patterns and species composition.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981.

== Yellowstone fire effects study ==
Post fire effects of the western United States forests include an important study of the fire of [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1988. Historically, controlled burns had been utilized to thin forests. By the 1970s, Yellowstone started a natural fire management plan to allow the process of lightning caused fires to continue influencing wild land succession.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 248 fires were started in Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As for the animals that were killed by the fires, the U.S National Park Service tallied 345 elk, 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, 9 bison and 1 grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fish were also killed due to heated water. Surveys indicated that less than 1% of the soils were heated enough to burn below ground plant seeds and roots.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S Congress launched a massive study of the long term ecological effects caused by the Yellowstone fires. The short term effects proved most wildlife populations showed no effects or rebounded quickly. In the years following the fire, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] combined with short term ash and nutrient influx led to a stunning display of wild flowers on the burned areas.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fire ==
Because plants are immobile, they must develop resistances to disturbances through [[natural selection]]. Individual plant species vary their resistance to fire injury in predictable ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These resistances make it possible for the [[biodiversity]] to greatly increase during recolonization after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that in a spruce and fir forest, eleven years after a fire, there is a greater diversity of herbs than in a community where there was no fire.&lt;ref&gt;Gucker, Corey L. “Revegetation in a Subalpine Fir Forest after Logging and Fire in Central British Columbia.” USDA Fire Service. Fire Effects Information System. 22 November 2005     &lt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/research_project_summaries/Hamilton03/all.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrubs took longer to regenerate but soon there was greater diversity in the shrub population as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gucker, Corey L. “Revegetation in a Subalpine Fir Forest after Logging and Fire in Central British Columbia.” USDA Fire Service. Fire Effects Information System. 22 November 2005 &lt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/research_project_summaries/Hamilton03/all.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Spruce and fir forests have a greater biodiversity than most other forests because of their multiple layers of [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and dense [[understories]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a heterogeneous, diverse stand structure which leads to an assortment of fire types which usually leave patches of unburned trees.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the soil is oxidized by the fire, seed germination is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many herb species were present in burned areas but not areas that were unaffected by fire.&lt;ref&gt;Gucker, Corey L. “Revegetation in a Subalpine Fir Forest after Logging and Fire in Central British Columbia.” USDA Fire Service. Fire Effects Information System. 22 November 2005 &lt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/research_project_summaries/Hamilton03/all.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Fir and spruce trees are wind-dispersed, so the number of regenerated trees depends on the distance from the unburned stands to the sample location. 

== Spruce and fir regeneration ==
The time it takes for fir and spruce to regenerate varies greatly, but it takes a number of years if no [[root]]s or [[snags]] remain. Regeneration time depends on a number of environmental factors, such as species type, wind strength, and [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be much more difficult for fir and spruce to be established on a slope, not only because of the dispersion technique, but also because erosion is greatly increased by fire, making it harder for the seeds to take root. Also, fir and spruce differ in survival techniques. Fir uses rapid growth, short lifespan, and easy establishment to come back more quickly after a fire, while spruce relies on longer lifespan and larger [[basal area]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987.

== Fire, insect, fungus and worm threats ==
Fire has an interesting relationship with micro fauna in forests. Damage done to trees by fire hurts the [[vascular cambium]], thus leaving trees more susceptible to insectivorous and fungal attacks. Fungal infections are not as common as insect attacks, but can be just as deadly. The fungus ''[[Amylostereum areolatum]]'' weakens trees and allows insects such as the ''[[Sirex noctilio]]'' (European wood wasp) to take over massive numbers of forests. The most common problems in spruce and fir forests are bark beetles, budworms, and [[gall]]-forming insects, to which spruce is extremely susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Tracy. “Sprucing Up.” 2007. Tree Services Magazine. Tree Care/Landscape Contractors and Arborists. 28 September 2007 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201063857/http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several gall-forming insects are present in spruce forests, including the Eastern Spruce gall adelgid and the Cooley's Spruce gall adelgid, which normally would not harm forests, unless the trees are unusually vulnerable to them, as they are after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Tracy. “Sprucing Up.” 2007. Tree Services Magazine.

Bark beetles are the most common insect killer of spruce and fir forests because they can spread quickly, breed rapidly, and can easily devour thousands of acres before actions can be taken against them. During the 1990s, the bark beetles affected almost three million acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of spruce forests.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Tracy. “Sprucing Up.” 2007. Tree Services Magazine. Tree Care/Landscape Contractors and Arborists. 28 September 2007 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201063857/http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks of these insects, in turn, raise the mortality rate of trees in the burn area, which provides even more fuel for the next fire.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
A number of larger animals are supported by fir and spruce forests, such as moose, deer, elk, birds, snowshoe hares, and other small mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Louis and Prasad. “Potential Changes in Tree Species Richness and Forest Community Types following Climate Change.” 2001. Ecosystems 4: 186-199. 20 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Effects on [[bird]] populations after fire in fir and spruce forests varied. Of the 41 avian species observed in 3 or more studies comparing post fire and adjacent unburned forests, 22% are consistently more abundant in burned forests and 34% are more abundant in unburned forests.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981.

Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, woodpeckers and aerial foragers are more abundant in burned forests and foliage grazing species are more abundant in unburned forests.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981.

Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the spruce and fir community type, trees often lose their lower branches, becoming unavailable to [[hare]] and other small mammals for food or cover during the seven to nine months of winter. This makes larger mammals more densely populated in fir and spruce forests. Fire does not displace [[fauna]] that are dependent on fir and spruce forests. When fir and spruce begin sprouting, they are utilized for food and the patches of trees remaining provides shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the heterogeneity in fir and spruce forests, patches of trees are always left in nature. Fire suppression, on the other hand, alters the natural patch dynamics, thus greatly reducing the number of mammals present.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The trees all grow older, close the canopy, the understory is repressed, branches fall off during the winter, and for the majority of the year there is no available food. Also, if fire is suppressed for a number of years and then a [[crown fire]] breaks out in the area, it will quickly spread throughout the dense canopy. No patches will be left for shelter and the fir and spruce will take much longer to regenerate because of the distance from the remaining stands to the center of the burned site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17532">In [[computer architecture]], a '''transport triggered architecture''' ('''TTA''') is a kind of [[Processor_(computing)|processor]] design in which programs directly control the internal transport [[Bus (computing)|buses]] of a processor. Computation happens as a side effect of data transports: writing data into a ''triggering port'' of a [[functional unit]] triggers the functional unit to start a computation. This is similar to what happens in a [[systolic array]]. Due to its modular structure, TTA is an ideal processor template for [[application-specific instruction-set processor]]s (''ASIP'') with customized datapath but without the inflexibility and design cost of fixed function hardware accelerators.

Typically a transport triggered processor has multiple transport buses and multiple functional units connected to the buses, which provides opportunities for [[instruction level parallelism]]. The parallelism is statically defined by the programmer. In this respect (and obviously due to the large instruction word width), the TTA architecture resembles the [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) architecture. A TTA instruction word is composed of multiple slots, one slot per bus, and each slot determines the data transport that takes place on the corresponding bus. The fine-grained control allows some optimizations that are not possible in a conventional processor. For example, software can transfer data directly between functional units without using registers.

Transport triggering exposes some [[microarchitectural]] details that are normally hidden from programmers. This greatly simplifies the control logic of a processor, because many decisions normally done at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] are fixed at [[compile time]]. However, it also means that a binary compiled for one TTA processor will not run on another one without recompilation if there is even a small difference in the architecture between the two. The binary incompatibility problem, in addition to the complexity of implementing a full context switch, makes TTAs more suitable for [[embedded system]]s than for general purpose computing.

Of all the [[one instruction set computer]] architectures, the TTA architecture is one of the few that has had processors based on it built, and the only one that has processors based on it sold commercially.

== Benefits in comparison to VLIW architectures ==

TTAs can be seen as "exposed datapath" VLIW architectures. While VLIW is programmed using operations, TTA splits the operation execution to multiple ''move'' operations. The
low level programming model enables several benefits in comparison to the standard VLIW. For example, a TTA architecture can provide more parallelism with simpler register files than with VLIW. As the programmer is in control of the timing of the operand and result data transports, the complexity (the number of input and output ports) of the [[register file]] (RF) need not be scaled according to the worst case issue/completion scenario of the multiple parallel instructions.

An important unique software optimization enabled by the transport programming is called ''software bypassing''. In case of software bypassing, the programmer bypasses the register file write back by moving data directly to the next functional unit's operand ports. When this optimization is applied aggressively, the original move that transports the result to the register file can be eliminated completely, thus reducing both the register file port pressure and freeing a [[general purpose register]] for other temporary variables. The reduced [[register pressure]], in addition simplifying the required complexity of the RF hardware, can lead to significant [[CPU power dissipation#Reduction|CPU energy savings]], an important benefit especially in mobile embedded systems.&lt;ref name="GuzmaBypassing"&gt;V. Guzma, P. Jääskeläinen, P. Kellomäki, and J. Takala, “Impact of Software Bypassing on Instruction Level Parallelism and Register File Traffic”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

TTA processors are built of independent ''function units'' and [[register file]]s, which are connected with ''transport buses'' and ''sockets''.

[[Image:Transport Triggered Architecture.png|thumb|Parts of transport triggered architecture]]

=== Function unit ===
Each function unit implements one or more [[Operator (programming)|operations]], which implement functionality ranging from a simple addition of integers to a complex and arbitrary user-defined application-specific computation. Operands for operations are transferred through function unit ''ports''.

Each function unit may have an independent [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]. In case a function unit is [[Instruction pipeline|fully pipelined]], a new operation that takes multiple [[clock cycle]]s to finish can be started in every clock cycle. On the other hand, a pipeline can be such that it does not always accept new operation start requests while an old one is still executing.

[[Computer memory|Data memory]] access and communication to outside of the processor is handled by using special function units. Function units that implement memory accessing operations and connect to a memory module are often called [[load–store unit (computing)|load/store units]].

=== Control unit ===
{{main article | control unit }}
''Control unit'' is a special case of function units which controls execution 
of programs. Control unit has access to the instruction memory in order to fetch the instructions to be executed. In order to allow the executed programs to transfer  the execution (jump) to an arbitrary position in the executed program, control unit provides control flow operations. A control unit usually has an [[instruction pipeline]], which consists of stages for fetching, decoding and executing program instructions.

=== Register files ===
{{main article | register file }}
Register files contain [[general purpose register]]s, which are used to store variables in programs. Like function units, also register files have input and output ports. The number of read and write ports, that is, the capability of being able to read and write multiple registers in a same clock cycle, can vary in each register file.

=== Transport buses and sockets ===
[[Interconnect architecture]] consists of [[Computer bus|transport buses]] which are connected to function unit ports by means of ''sockets''. Due to expense of connectivity, it is usual to reduce the number of connections between units (function units and register files). A TTA is said to be ''fully connected'' in case there is a path from each unit output port to every unit's input ports.

Sockets provide means for programming TTA processors by allowing to select which bus-to-port connections of the socket are enabled at any time instant. Thus, data transports taking place in a clock cycle can be programmed by defining the source and destination socket/port connection to be enabled for each bus.

=== Conditional execution ===

Some TTA implementations support [[addressing mode#Conditional execution|conditional execution]].

[[Conditional execution]] is implemented with the aid of ''guards''. Each data transport can be conditionalized by a guard, which is connected to a register (often a 1-bit [[conditional register]]) and to a bus. In case the value of the guarded register evaluates to false (zero), the data transport programmed for the bus the guard is connected to is ''squashed'', that is, not written to its destination. ''Unconditional'' data transports are not connected to any guard and are always executed.

=== Branches ===

All processors, including TTA processors, include [[control flow]] instructions that alter the program counter, which are used to implement [[subroutine]]s, [[if-then-else]], [[for-loop]], etc.
The assembly language for TTA processors typically includes control flow instructions such as unconditional branches (JUMP), conditional relative branches (BNZ), subroutine call (CALL), conditional return (RETNZ), etc. that look the same as the corresponding assembly language instructions for other processors.

Like all other operations on a TTA machine, these instructions are implemented as "move" instructions to a special function unit.

TTA implementations that support conditional execution, such as the sTTAck and the first MOVE prototype, can implement most of these control flow instructions as a conditional move to the program counter.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef99/chapyzhenka99.pdf "sTTAck: Stack Transport Triggered Architecture"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

TTA implementations that only support unconditional data transports, such as the MAXQ, typically have a special function unit tightly connected to the program counter that responds to a variety of destination addresses.
Each such address, when used as the destination of a "move", has a different effect on the program counter—each "relative branch &amp;lt;condition&amp;gt;" instruction has a different destination address for each condition; and other destination addresses are used CALL, RETNZ, etc.

== Programming ==

In more traditional processor architectures, a processor is usually programmed by defining the executed operations and their operands. For example, an addition instruction in a RISC architecture could look like the following.
&lt;pre&gt;
add r3, r1, r2
&lt;/pre&gt;

This example operation adds the values of general-purpose registers r1 and r2 and stores the result in
register r3. Coarsely, the execution of the instruction in the processor probably results in translating the instruction to control signals which control the interconnection network connections and function units. The interconnection network is used to transfer the current values of registers r1 and r2 to the function unit that is capable of executing the add operation, often called ALU as in Arithmetic-Logic Unit. Finally, a control signal selects and triggers the addition operation in ALU, of which result is transferred back to the register r3.

TTA programs do not define the operations, but only the data transports needed to write and read the operand values. Operation itself is triggered by writing data to a ''triggering operand'' of an operation. Thus, an operation is executed as a side effect of the triggering data transport. Therefore, executing an addition operation in TTA requires three data transport definitions, also called ''moves''. A move defines endpoints for a data transport taking place in a transport bus. For instance, a move can state that 
a data transport from function unit F, port 1, to register file R, register index 2, should take place in bus B1. In case there 
are multiple buses in the target processor, each bus can be utilized in parallel in the same clock cycle. Thus, it is possible to 
exploit data transport level parallelism by scheduling several data transports in the same instruction.

An addition operation can be executed in a TTA processor as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
r1 -&gt; ALU.operand1
r2 -&gt; ALU.add.trigger
ALU.result -&gt; r3
&lt;/pre&gt;

The second move, a write to the second operand of the function unit called ALU, triggers the addition operation.
This makes the result of addition available in the output port 'result' after the execution latency of the 'add'.

The ports associated with the ALU may act as an [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]], allowing creation of [[macro instruction]]s that [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstract away]] the underlying TTA:
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
lda r1    ; "load ALU": move value to ALU operand 1
add r2    ; add: move value to add trigger
sta r3    ; "store ALU": move value from ALU result
&lt;/source&gt;

== Programmer visible operation latency ==

The leading philosophy of TTAs is to move complexity from hardware to software. Due to this, several additional hazards are introduced to the programmer. One of them is [[delay slot]]s, the programmer visible operation latency of the function units. Timing is completely the responsibility of the programmer. The programmer has to schedule the instructions such that the result is neither read too early nor too late. There is no hardware detection to lock up the processor in case a result is read too early. Consider, for example, an architecture that has an operation ''add'' with latency of 1, and operation ''mul'' with latency of 3. When triggering the ''add'' operation, it is possible to read the result in the next instruction (next clock cycle), but in case of ''mul'', one has to wait for two instructions before the result can be read. The result is ready for the 3rd instruction after the triggering instruction.

Reading a result too early results in reading the result of a previously triggered operation, or in case 
no operation was triggered previously in the function unit, the read value is undefined. On the other hand, 
result must be read early enough to make sure the next operation result does not overwrite the yet unread
result in the output port.

Due to the abundance of programmer-visible processor context which practically includes, in addition to
register file contents, also function unit pipeline register contents and/or function unit 
input and output ports, context saves required for external interrupt support can become complex and expensive to implement in a TTA processor. Therefore, interrupts are usually not supported by TTA processors, but their 
task is delegated to an external hardware (e.g., an I/O processor) or their need is avoided by using 
an alternative synchronization/communication mechanism such as polling.

'''Tripod Beta''' is an incident and accident analysis methodology made available by the Stichting Tripod Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publishing.energyinst.org/tripod|title=Tripod {{!}} Homepage|website=publishing.energyinst.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the Energy Institute in the UK.  The methodology is designed to help an accident investigator analyse the causes of an incident or accident in conjunction with conducting the investigation.  This helps direct the investigation as the investigator will be able to see where more information is needed about what happened, or how or why the incident occurred.

== Early development ==
Tripod Beta was developed by Shell International Exploration and Production B.V. as the result of Shell-funded academic research in the 1980s and 1990s.  Such research contributed towards the development of the [[Swiss cheese model|Swiss cheese]] model of accident causation, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s, towards the development of the [http://heartsandminds.energyinst.org/ Hearts and Minds] safety culture toolkit.

The research was based on the following hypothesis 
#Accidents happen because controls fail (now known as the Swiss Cheese model)
#The underlying causes of controls failing  are due to latent failures in the way we manage 
#Those latent  failures are present long before an accident occurs
#Those failures are known by some of the people before the incident occurs
#If we can identify those failures and take action to remove them we will reduce the probability of accidents
The early research focused on a predictive tool to identify underlying causes of incidents before they occurred rather than an incident investigation methodology This would later become the basis for [[Tripod Delta]].

The incident investigation methodology whilst always part of the research came later around 1990. initial Tripod Investigation followed a tabular approach as graphical programme was not available

Following the 1988 [[Piper Alpha]] disaster and Lord Cullen report in 1990, Shell International created a team to look at Safety management systems and Safety Cases. That team worked until 2004 they developed a number of approaches, the EP forum (later the Oil and Gas Producers Association) guidance on Safety cases was founded on work by that team. The team worked closely with Leiden and Manchester Universities to, utilising the understanding of accident causation that had been developed in the 1984-2000 research programme. In 1992 Mircosoft released windows version 3.1. That gave the team the ability for the first time to create graphical representations of the theories developed. Two software-based tools were developed: [[Bow Tie methodology|Bow Tie]]&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Primrose (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.)  |  P.D.

== Stichting Tripod Foundation ==
In 1998, following publicity of Tripod Beta, Shell International Exploration and Production B.V. transferred copyright of the Tripod Beta methodology to the Stichting Tripod Foundation, a charitable body under Dutch law.  The Foundation's purpose is to promote best practice in industry through the sensible usage of Tripod technologies to aid in the understanding and prevention of accidents and incidents.  In 2012 the Foundation partnered with the Energy Institute in the UK in order to help achieve this.  The Energy Institute currently publishes the official guide on using the Tripod Beta methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tripod Beta: Guidance on using Tripod Beta in the investigation and analysis of incidents, accidents and business losses|last=|first=|publisher=Energy Institute|year=2015|isbn=9780 8529 3728 0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stichting Tripod Foundation also accredits approved training courses, and assesses the competence of users of the Tripod methodology.  Users who are assessed as competent in Tripod Beta are accredited as 'Tripod Practitioners'.

== The methodology ==
Tripod Beta is a methodology that can be conducted via pen and paper or using specialized software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kelvintopset.com/software/investigator-3|title=Investigator 3 {{!}} Kelvin TOP-SET {{!}} Incident Investigation and Problem Solving {{!}} UK USA|website=www.kelvintopset.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology combines a number of theories of accident causation into generating a single model (a 'Tripod tree') of an accident or incident, most notably the Swiss cheese model (barrier-based risk management) and human factors-oriented theories such as GEMS (Generic Error-modelling system).&lt;ref&gt;James Reason, ''A Life in Error'' (2013), {{ISBN|9781472418418}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

A Tripod tree is divided into three sections.

=== What happened? ===
The sequence of events in an incident are shown in the tree as a series of 'trios', a simple logic (AND) gate that tells how the combination of two events led to an outcome.  The outcome can then become an event that can combine with another event to cause a subsequent outcome, and so on.

As the sequence of trios goes forward in time the tree ends when the last incident occurs, but can also take into account what happened after the incident (such as emergency response).  Potential events can also be investigated; these are events that did not happen either because of luck or because a 'barrier' prevented it from happening.

As the sequence goes backwards in time, the tree usually begins with the last 'normal' event, i.e. an event that was a normal part of operations.  This represents a logical place at which to start investigating an incident, as everything that happened after this was unusual and therefore worth investigating 'what went wrong?'.

A trio has three elements: the event (the outcome, a change in state to an object, such as an injury), the object (the person or thing that was changed/damaged), and the agent of change (the energy, force or hazard that caused change or damage to the object).  A logic test is used to ensure the correct identification of these elements: 'Agent of change' acts upon 'object' and results in 'event'.  For example, 'Fire' acts upon 'Person' and results in 'Person burnt by fire'.

The Tripod practitioner first models the incident by constructing a series of Trios that explain 'what happened'.

Trees usually have between two and five trios.

[[File:Swiss Cheese model.jpg|thumb]]

=== How did it happen? ===
In Tripod theory, accidents are managed through the usage of 'Barriers'.  Barriers are functions of a safety management system, such as automated trips, relief valves, etc. that prevent an agent or hazard from causing an unwanted change or incident.  Barriers are often people conducting critical tasks (such as responding to alarms) often described by rules and procedures but not necessarily.  Accidents are therefore 'allowed' to happen by the failure of one or more of these barriers.

Once the Tripod practitioner has created a series of Trios the next step is to identify the barriers that should have been in place to prevent the incident occurring.  This is done for each individual Trio.  Only barriers that could have actually mitigated or prevented the next event are considered.  Predominantly, 'Failed Barriers' are considered.  These are the barriers that should have prevented the incident but failed for various reasons.  For example, a barrier to prevent injury in a car is a seat belt; however, this barrier may fail because the driver did not wear a seat belt, or the seat belt mechanism itself was faulty.

'Missing Barriers' (barriers that should have been in place according to 'best practice' but had not been established by the organisation), 'Inadequate Barriers' (barriers that functioned as intended but could not achieve the required function to prevent the incident; for example, a seat belt will only prevent serious injury under certain circumstances) and 'Effective Barriers' (barriers that succeeded in preventing the subsequent event) are also considered. If the analysis is modelling a 'Potential Event', unless the event was only prevented through sheer luck, there will be one or more Effective Barrier within the incident trajectory. For example, a seat belt functions to prevent the death of the driver.

=== Why did it happen? ===
[[File:Annex 8 figure 12.jpg|thumb]]
Once the investigator has identified the sequence of events, and the Failed-, Missing-, and Inadequate- Barriers, the next step is to understand the causes of these being ineffective when needed.

==== Immediate causes ====
In Tripod theory, barriers fail because of human action or inaction.  This may be human action directly related to the barrier functionality (such as the driver not wearing the seat belt), but may also be indirect, such as a failure during the design or installation of the barrier, or the failure of management to consider implementing the barrier.  This human action or inaction is called the 'Immediate Cause'.   This is the substandard act or [[human error]].  Often, when (non-Tripod) investigations determine that the cause of an accident was due to human error, in Tripod-terms this would relate to the immediate cause only.

==== Preconditions ====
The reasons for substandard acts and human error cannot always be definitively known, however it is known that human errors have situation or psychological precursors.  These 'Preconditions' are aspects of the working environment that are likely to have contributed towards the substandard action or inaction.  For example, typical Preconditions may be: fatigue due to improper work-life balance; perception that a guard is not required, loss of situation awareness, improper motivation, poor supervision; rushing in order to complete a job quickly; noisy or dark environment; confusing procedures, incorrect understanding of work objective, etc.

Through interviews and investigation the investigator is able to identify a number of Preconditions that likely contributed towards the substandard action.

==== Underlying causes ====
In Tripod theory, Preconditions represent aspects of the working environment that organisations should try to manage, usually via good leadership, safety culture, and a well-documented and implemented safety management system.  For example: fatigue of the workforce can be managed by adequate shift rotas, and policies on shift length and overtime; rushing in order to complete a job quickly can be managed by leaders not sending conflicting messages that prioritize productivity over safety, etc. These weaknesses or failures of leadership, culture or management systems are the underlying causes of accidents and incidents.  They help create, or fail to correct, the Preconditions.

The investigator looks for evidence of management system-level failures that created or failed to control the Preconditions.  For example, this may be poorly worded, or lack of, written policy, unclear management-level responsibilities, apparent lack of visibility of leadership, ineffective risk management processes, etc.  Tripod Beta encourages the investigator to consider these aspects of the incident.

Importantly, Tripod Beta placed great emphasis on identifying the Underlying Causes of accidents and incidents because, whilst many aspects of an accident (such as the sequence of events, Barriers and Preconditions) may be quite specific to a particular accident or incident, Underlying Causes will be non-specific to an accident and likely will be the cause of, or potential cause of, many different accidents and incidents, even those that seem completely unrelated.

=== Recommendations ===
The outcome of a Tripod Beta analysis are usually a number of recommendations for improvements within the organisation in order to prevent the same or other incidents occurring.  Recommendations may or may not be formed by the person investigating.

Recommendations focus only on two aspects of the Tripod analysis: the Barriers and the Underlying Causes.

It is important to strengthen or reinstate the barriers so that the particular operation that was investigated can continue.  Recommendations for improving Barriers are to prevent the same (or similar) incident happening and may involve fixing equipment or putting in place extra checks and additional independent barriers where barriers overly rely on human performance.

As Underlying Causes can be causal in many different types of incident, tackling the Underlying Causes may have the greater benefit in the long-term at preventing multiple incidents. Recommendations to tackle Underlying Causes are often aimed at management system level and are sometimes much harder to implement.

Recommendations are not made for other aspects of the incident (such as the Immediate Causes) as such recommendations will be unlikely to be effective at preventing further incidents.  For example, recommendations for improving Immediate Causes (the substandard actions) often focus on retraining or punishing the person involved, which will be unlikely to prevent other people making the same error in future.

'''Télécom ParisTech''' (also known as '''ENST''' or '''Télécom''' or '''École nationale supérieure des télécommunications''') is one of the top French public institutions of higher education and research ([[grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]]) of engineering in France. Located in [[Paris]], it is also a member of the [[ParisTech]] Group and the [[Institut Télécom|Institut Telecom]].

In 1991, Télécom ParisTech and the [[EPFL]] collaborated and established a school named [[EURECOM]] located in [[Sophia-Antipolis]]. Students can now be admitted in two different curriculums, located either in the Paris or the Sophia-Antipolis campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/enseignement/cursus.html|title = Les cursus de la formation d'ingénieur|date = |accessdate = |website = Télécom ParisTech|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

*In 1845, Alphonse Foy, director of telegraphic lines, proposed a school specializing in telegraphy for Polytechnicians. His proposition was rejected.
*The school was founded on 12 July 1878 as the École professionnelle supérieure des postes et télégraphes (EPSPT).
*In 1912 the school's name was changed to École supérieure des postes et télégraphes (ESPT).
*In 1934 the ESPT moved to rue Barrault, in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]].
*In 1938 the school was renamed École nationale supérieure des postes, télégraphes et téléphones (ENSPTT), and in the same year, the [[President of France]], [[Albert Lebrun]] honored the school [[Legion of Honor]].
*During the [[Second World War]], in 1942, the school was divided into two schools: the ENSPTT and École nationale supérieure des télécommunications (ENST). The ENSPTT was closed on 31 December 2002.
*In 1971 the ENST passed under the direct guardianship of the ''Direction générale des télécommunications'', and the development of telecommunications during this period drove the state to create two associate schools: the [[ENST Bretagne]] in 1977 in [[Brest, France|Brest]], and the [[Telecom &amp; Management SudParis|INT]] in 1979 at [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]].
*In 1992 the ENST, together with the [[EPFL]], founded the [[EURECOM]] at [[Sophia-Antipolis]].
*On 26 December 1996 the [[Groupe des Écoles des Télécommunications]] (GET) was established. It consists of a group of telecommunications schools including the ENST, the [[ENST Bretagne|Telecom Bretagne]], the [[Telecom SudParis]], and [[EURECOM]].
*On 21 September 2009, the school's name was changed to Télécom ParisTech.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000021059936 Décret n° 2009-1136 du 21 septembre 2009 relatif à l'Institut Télécom]. Legifrance. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
There are two ways to get admitted into Télécom ParisTech as an undergraduate student:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/telecom-paristech-les-telecoms-en-heritage-le-web-en-destinee.N239204|title = Admission Process|date = |accessdate = |website = L'Usine Nouvelle|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Through a selective entrance examination ([[:fr:Concours commun Mines-Ponts|Concours Commun Mines Ponts]]) after at least two years of preparation in [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|Classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles]] curriculum following high school
* Through an application-based admission process for university students
** After a scientific bachelor's degree (Mathematics, Physics, Mechanics, Computer science etc.)
** After a [[:fr:Diplôme universitaire de technologie|DUT]] degree from a French university of technology
University students can also get admitted into Télécom ParisTech's [[Master of Science]] (MSc.) programme through an application-based admission process for university students from all over the world.

Télécom ParisTech is also one of the approved application schools for the [[École Polytechnique]], making it possible for fourth-year students to complete their studies with a one-year specialization at Télécom ParisTech. Télécom ParisTech also provides education for the [[Corps des télécommunications]].

Around 250 engineers graduate each year from Télécom ParisTech. Thirty to thirty-five percent of the graduates are foreign students coming from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/palmares-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs/telecom-paristech.html|title = Palmarès des Écoles d'ingénieurs|date = |accessdate = |website = L'Étudiant|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialization courses cover all aspects of computer science and communication engineering: Electronics, Signal processing, Software engineering, Networking, Economics, Finance etc.

==Research at Télécom ParisTech==
Research at Télécom ParisTech consists of:

*Optimization and transmission of information
*Improvements in Data processing
*Microelectronics, such as FPGA and DSP systems
*Image and Signal processing, wavelets
*Artificial intelligence, data mining, distributed and real-time systems
*User experience Design, Information visualisation and computer human interfaces

Télécom ParisTech has four research laboratories:

*The Department of Electronics and Communications: This laboratory consists of about one hundred researchers and teaching researchers (37 tenured) within 7 research groups
*The Department of Computer Science and Networking
*The Department of Signal and Image Processing
*The Department of Economic and Social Sciences

These departments are associated with the [[CNRS]] through the "Laboratory of the Communication and Processing of Information" and the "Interdisciplinary Institute for Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-3.fr/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training for engineering degrees==
*'''First year - Multidisciplinary studies'''
For undergraduate students, the core curriculum, commonly referred to as ''tronc commun,'' consists of courses in most areas of science (Mathematics, Economics, applied Mathematics, Computer science, Physics, etc.), as well as compulsory courses in the humanities (foreign languages, social sciences, liberal arts, etc.)

Taking place in the Paris campus of Télécom ParisTech, this primary year of multidisciplinary studies is common to both Paris curriculum students and Sophia-Antipolis curriculum students; and is followed by a one or two month mandatory summer internship. 
*'''Second and Third Year - Specialization in Paris or at Sophia-Antipolis (at [[EURECOM]])''' 
Starting from their second year, students have to choose a specialization in which they'll receive in-depth courses and that will conclude their engineering curriculum. Based on 13 specialization tracks more than 120 courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/enseignement/cursus/cycle-master-cursus-paris.html|title = Cycle Master: Campus Paris|date = |accessdate = |website = Télécom ParisTech|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; these two years eventually unfold into a six-month internship through which the engineering student will acquire their first real professional experience.

Third year students can also choose to complete their studies in an approved university in France or abroad, as part of a Double-Degree or a Master of Science program.

The '''values''' embodied in [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; are identified in order to assess significance, prioritize resources, and inform [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] decision-making. It is recognised that values may compete and change over time, and that heritage may have different meanings for different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].

==Origins==
[[Alois Riegl]] is credited with developing [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s concept of 'voicefulness' into a systematic categorization of the different values of a [[monument]]. In his 1908 essay ''Der moderne Denkmalkultus'' (The modern cult of monuments) he describes historical value, artistic value, age value, commemorative value, use value, and newness value. Riegl demonstrates that some of these values conflict and argues that they may be culturally [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage |author=Stanley Price, Nicholas ''et al.'' (edd.) |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |pages=18–21, 69–83 |ISBN=0-89236-398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charters and Conventions==
The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] addresses cultural sites of outstanding universal value, from a [[History|historical]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Science|scientific]], [[Ethnology|ethnological]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, and highlights the need for [[Authenticity (heritage)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide08-en.pdf |title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention |pages=13, 94) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussed in the 1964 [[Venice Charter]], values and the question 'why conserve?' are the focus of the 1979 [[Burra Charter]] (last revised 1999). Cultural significance is said to be 'embodied' in the fabric, setting, use, associations, and meanings of a place, and includes aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and spiritual values for past, present and future generations. In order to preserve such values a 'cautious approach' of [[minimum intervention]] is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/BURRA_CHARTER.pdf |title=Burra Charter (''vid.''

==Practice==
[[Significance assessment]] typically includes consideration of the rarity, representativeness, and communicative power of assets and their values. These are then managed in order to sustain and valorize that significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |pages=36f |author=Deacon, Harriet (et al.) |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|HSRC Press]] |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-7969-2074-4 |access-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012222850/http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/publications/docs/conservationprinciplespoliciesandguidanceapril08web.pdf |title=Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment |pages=21ff |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engagement with the economic value of heritage may help promote its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/econrpt.pdf |title=Economics and Heritage Conservation |page=54 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''villa''' was originally an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[upper-class]] country house. Since its origins in the [[Roman villa]], the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably.  After the fall of the [[Roman Republic]], villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in [[Late Antiquity]], sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a [[monastery]]. Then they gradually re-evolved through the [[Middle Ages]] into elegant upper-class country homes.  In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the [[suburb]]an [[semi-detached]] double villa to residences in the [[wildland–urban interface]].

[[File:060807-002-GettyVilla001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Getty Villa]], an adaptation of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]]]]{{Main|Roman villa}}

* the ''villa urbana'', a country seat that could easily be reached from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] or another city for a night or two
* the ''[[villa rustica]]'', the farm-house estate that was permanently occupied by the servants who had charge generally of the estate, which would centre on the villa itself, perhaps only seasonally occupied. The Roman ''villae rusticae'' at the heart of ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' were the earliest versions of what later and elsewhere became called [[plantation]]s.

Not included as ''villae'' were the ''[[domus]]'', a city house for the élite and privileged classes; and ''[[Insula (building)|insulae]]'', blocks of [[apartment building]]s for the rest of the population. In ''[[Satyricon]]'' (1st century CE), [[Petronius]] described the wide range of Roman dwellings. Another type of villae is the "villa marittima", a seaside villa, located on the coast.

A concentration of Imperial villas existed on the [[Gulf of Naples]], on the Isle of [[Capri]], at [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and at Antium ([[Anzio]]). Examples include the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]]; and the "[[Villa of the Mysteries]]" and "[[House of the Vettii|Villa of the Vettii]]" in [[Pompeii]].

Wealthy Romans also escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Tibur ([[Tivoand]] [[Frascati]], such as at [[Hadrian's Villa]]. [[Cicero]] allegedly possessed no fewer than seven villas, the oldest of which was near [[Arpino|Arpinum]], which he inherited. [[Pliny the Younger]] had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.

Roman writers refer with satisfaction to the self-sufficiency of their ''latifundium'' villas, where they drank their own [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and pressed their own [[Olive oil#History|oil]]. This was an affectation of urban aristocrats playing at being old-fashioned virtuous Roman farmers, it has been said that the economic independence of later rural villas was a symptom of the increasing economic fragmentation of the [[Roman Empire]].

===In Roman Britannia===
{{See also|List of Roman villas in England}}

Archaeologists have meticulously examined numerous [[Roman villa]]s in England.&lt;ref&gt;
[[List of Roman villas in England]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Italian counterparts, they were complete working agrarian societies of fields and [[vineyard]]s, perhaps even [[tile]]works or [[Quarry|quarries]], ranged round a high-status power centre with its baths and gardens. The grand villa at [[Woodchester]] preserved its [[mosaic]] floors when the [[Anglo-Saxon]] parish church was built (not by chance) upon its site. Grave-diggers preparing for burials in the churchyard as late as the 18th century had to punch through the intact mosaic floors. The even more palatial ''villa rustica'' at [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Fishbourne]] near [[Winchester]] was built (uncharacteristically) as a large open rectangle, with [[portico]]s enclosing gardens entered through a portico. Towards the end of the 3rd century, Roman towns in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] ceased to expand: like patricians near the centre of the empire, Roman Britons withdrew from the cities to their villas, which entered on a palatial building phase, a "golden age" of villa life. ''Villae rusticae'' are essential in the Empire's economy.

[[File:Fishbourne model.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Model of [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], a governor's villa on the grandest scale]]

Two kinds of villa-plan in Roman Britain may be characteristic of Roman villas in general. The more usual plan extended wings of rooms all opening onto a linking portico, which might be extended at right angles, even to enclose a [[courtyard]]. The other kind featured an aisled central hall like a [[basilica]], suggesting the villa owner's magisterial role. The villa buildings were often independent structures linked by their enclosed courtyards. [[Timber framing|Timber-framed]] construction, carefully fitted with [[Mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]] and [[dowel]]led together, set on stone footings, were the rule, replaced by stone buildings for the important ceremonial rooms. Traces of window [[Roman glass|glass]] have been found, as well as ironwork window [[grille]]s.

===Monastery villas of Late Antiquity===
With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline and collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the fourth and fifth centuries, the villas were more and more isolated and came to be protected by walls. In England the villas were abandoned, [[Looting|looted]], and burned by [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders in the fifth century. But the concept of an isolated, self-sufficient agrarian working community, housed close together, survived into Anglo-Saxon culture as the ''[[vill]]'', with its inhabitants - if formally bound to the land - as ''[[villein]]s''.

In regions on the Continent, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and territorial magnates donated large working villas and overgrown abandoned ones to individual [[monk]]s; these might become the nuclei of [[Monastery|monasteries]]. In this way, the Italian villa system of [[late Antiquity]] survived into the [[early Medieval]] period in the form of monasteries that withstood the disruptions of the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the [[Lombards]]. About 529 [[Benedict of Nursia]] established his influential monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] in the ruins of a villa at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]] that had belonged to [[Nero]].

From the sixth to the eighth century, [[Gallo-Roman]] villas in the [[Merovingian]] royal [[fisc]] were repeatedly donated as sites for monasteries under royal patronage in [[Gaul]] - [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]] and [[Fleury Abbey]] provide examples. In Germany a famous example is [[Echternach]]; as late as 698, [[Willibrord]] established an abbey at a Roman villa of Echternach near [[Trier]], presented to him by [[Adela and Irmina|Irmina]], daughter of [[Dagobert II]], king of the [[Franks]]. [[Kintzheim]] was ''Villa Regis'', the "villa of the king". Around 590, [[Saint Eligius]] was born in a highly placed [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] family at the 'villa' of Chaptelat near [[Limoges]], in [[Aquitaine]] (now France). The [[abbey]] at [[Stavelot]] was founded ca 650 on the domain of a former villa near [[Liège]] and the abbey of [[Vézelay]] had a similar founding.

==Post-Roman era==
In post-Roman times a ''villa'' referred to a self-sufficient, usually fortified Italian or [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] farmstead. It was economically as self-sufficient as a ''[[village]]'' and its inhabitants, who might be legally tied to it as [[serfs]] were ''[[villein]]s''. The [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] inherited the concept, followed by the Carolingian French but the later French term was ''basti'' or ''bastide.''

''Villa''/''Vila'' (or its cognates) is part of many Spanish and Portuguese placenames, like [[Vila Real (disambiguation)|Vila Real]] and [[Villadiego]]: a ''villa''/''vila'' is a town with a [[charter]] (''[[fuero]]'' or ''[[foral]]'') of lesser importance than a ''ciudad''/''cidade'' ("city"). When it is associated with a personal name, ''villa'' was probably used in the original sense of a country estate rather than a chartered town. Later evolution has made the Hispanic distinction between ''villas'' and ''ciudades'' a purely honorific one. [[Madrid]] is the ''Villa y [[Court|Corte]]'', the villa considered to be separate from the formerly mobile [[Noble court|royal court]], but the much smaller [[Ciudad Real]] was declared ''ciudad'' by the Spanish crown.

==Italian Renaissance==

===Tuscany===

[[Image:Villa Medicea di Poggio.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|The Villa di Medici by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]]-1470: [[Poggio a Caiano]], [[Tuscany]]]]

In 14th and 15th century Italy, a ''villa'' once more connoted a country house, like the first [[Medici villas]], the [[Villa del Trebbio]] and that at [[Cafaggiolo]], both strong fortified houses built in the 14th century in the [[Mugello region]] near [[Florence]]. In 1450 [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]] commenced on a hillside the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]], [[Tuscany]], probably the first villa created under the instructions of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who theorized the features of the new idea of villa in his ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]''.

[[Image:Pratolino utens.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Villa di Pratolino]] with lower half of the gardens: by [[Giusto Utens]]-1599. Museo Topografico, [[Florence]].]]These first examples of [[Renaissance]] villa predate the age of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who added the [[Poggio a Caiano#The Medici villa|Villa di Poggio a Caiano]] by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], begun in 1470, in [[Poggio a Caiano]], [[Province of Prato]], [[Tuscany]].

From Tuscany the idea of ''villa'' was spread again through [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] and Europe.

====Tuscan villa gardens====
The Quattrocento villa gardens were treated as a fundamental and aesthetic link between a residential building and the outdoors, with views over a humanized agricultural [[landscape]], at that time the only desirable aspect of ''[[nature]]''.  Later villas and gardens include the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and [[Boboli Gardens]], Florence; the [[Pienza#Palazzo Piccolomini|Villa di Pratolino]], [[Province of Siena]].

===Rome===
[[File:Villa Doria Pamphili giardini.JPG|250px|thumbnail|[[Villa Doria Pamphili]], Rome]]
Rome had more than its share of villas with easy reach of the small sixteenth-century city: the progenitor, the first ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' built since Antiquity, was the [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]] or ''palazzetto'', designed by [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]] and built on the slope above the [[Vatican Palace]].

The [[Villa Madama]], the design of which, attributed to Raphael and carried out by [[Giulio Romano]] in 1520, was one of the most influential private houses ever built; elements derived from Villa Madama appeared in villas through the 19th century. [[Villa Albani]] was built near the Porta Salaria. Other are the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]]; the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] (1650); the [[Villa Giulia]] of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550), designed by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]].  The Roman villas [[Villa Ludovisi]] and Villa Montalto, were destroyed during the late nineteenth century in the wake of the [[real estate bubble]] that took place in Rome after the seat of government of a united Italy was established at Rome.

The cool hills of [[Frascati]] gained the [[Villa Aldobrandini]] (1592); the [[Villa Falconieri]] and the [[Villa Mondragone]].  The [[Villa d'Este]] near [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] is famous for the water play in its terraced [[History of gardens|gardens]]. The [[Villa Medici]] was on the edge of Rome, on the [[Pincian Hill]], when it was built in 1540.  Besides these designed for seasonal pleasure, usually located within easy distance of a city, other Italian villas were remade from a ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]'' or castello, as the family seat of power, such as [[Villa Caprarola]] for the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]].

Near [[Siena]] in Tuscany, the [[Villa Cetinale]] was built by Cardinal [[Flavio Chigi (1631-1693)|Flavio Chigi]]. He employed [[Carlo Fontana]], pupil of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] to transform the villa and dramatic gardens in a [[Roman Baroque]] style by 1680. The [[Villa Lante]] garden is one of the most sublime creations of the Italian villa in the landscape, completed in the 17th century.

=== Venice===

{{Main|Palladian architecture|Palladian villas of the Veneto}}
In the later 16th century in the northeastern [[Italian Peninsula]] the [[Palladian villas of the Veneto]], designed by [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), were built in [[Vicenza]] in the [[Republic of Venice]]. Palladio always designed his villas with reference to their setting. He often unified all the farm buildings into the architecture of his extended villas. Examples are the [[Villa Emo]], the [[Villa Godi]], the [[Villa Forni Cerato]], the [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"]], and [[Villa Foscari]].

The Villas are grouped into an association (Associazione Ville Venete) and offer touristic itineraries and accommodation possibilities.

==Villas abroad==

===17th century===
Soon after in [[Greenwich]] England, following his 1613&amp;ndash;1615 [[Grand Tour]], [[Inigo Jones]] designed and built the [[Queen's House]] between 1615&amp;ndash;1617 in an early [[Palladian architecture]] style adaptation in another country. The Palladian villa style renewed its influence in different countries and eras and remained influential for over four hundred years, with the [[Neo-Palladian]] a part of the late 17th century and on [[Renaissance Revival architecture]] period.

[[File:Baederarchitektur-Binz 1658.jpg|thumb|Villa "Sea Greeting" (Meeresgruss) in [[Binz]], [[Rügen|Rügen Island]] - a typical villa in 19th-century German [[resort architecture]] style]]

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the early 18th century the English took up the term, and applied it to compact houses in the country,&lt;ref&gt;These are not to be confused with the [[English country house]]s, which were centres of political and cultural power and show surrounded by the estates that supported them, such as [[Holkham Hall]], [[Alnwick Castle]] or [[Woburn Abbey]]; in Ireland [[Castletown House]] and  [[Russborough House]] are comparable examples.&lt;/ref&gt; especially those accessible from London: [[Chiswick House]] is an example of such a "party villa". Thanks to the revival of interest in Palladio and [[Inigo Jones]], soon [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival|Neo-Palladian]] villas dotted the valley of the [[River Thames]] and English countryside. [[Marble Hill House]] in England was conceived originally as a "villa" in the 18th-century sense.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[John Summerson]], ''Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830'': ch. 22 "Palladian permeation: the villa" provides a standard overview of the building type.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways the late 18th century [[Monticello]], by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in [[Virginia]], United States is a [[Palladian Revival]] villa. Other examples of the period and style are [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]; and many pre-[[American Civil War]] or Antebellum [[Plantations]], such as [[Westover Plantation]] and many other [[List of James River plantations|James River plantations]] as well dozens of [[Antebellum architecture|Antebellum era plantations]] in the rest of the [[Old South]] functioned as the Roman [[Latifundium]] villas had.  A later revival, in the [[Gilded Age]] and early 20th century, produced [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], [[Filoli]] in [[Woodside, California]], and [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]; by architects-landscape architects such as [[Richard Morris Hunt]], [[Willis Polk]], and [[Beatrix Farrand]].

In the nineteenth century, ''villa'' was extended to describe any large [[suburb]]an house that was free-standing in a [[landscape]]d plot of ground. By the time 'semi-detached villas' were being erected at the turn of the twentieth century, the term collapsed under its extension and overuse.
[[File:060217-Luftaufnahme-Striesen.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of giant "villa colonies" (Villenkolonien) in [[Dresden]], Germany: [[Gründerzeit]] quarters of [[Blasewitz]] (incl. ''Tolkewitz'' and ''Striesen''), [[Gruna]] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Johannstadt Johannstadt].]]
The second half of the nineteenth century saw the creation of large "Villenkolonien" in the German speaking countries, wealthy residential areas that were completely made up of large mansion houses and often built to an artfully created masterplan. Also many large mansions for the wealthy German industrialists were built, such as [[Villa Hügel]] in [[Essen]]. The Villenkolonie of [[Lichterfelde West]] in Berlin was conceived after an extended trip by the architect through the South of England.
Representative [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] mansions in Germany include the [[Heiligendamm]] and other [[resort architecture]] mansions at the Baltic Sea, [[Rose Island (Lake Starnberg)|Rose Island]] and [[King's House on Schachen]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]], [[Villa Dessauer]] in [[Bamberg]], [[Wahnfried|Villa Wahnfried]] in [[Bayreuth]], [[Schloss Drachenburg|Drachenburg]] near [[Bonn]], [[Hammerschmidt Villa]] in [[Bonn]], the [[Liebermann Villa]] and [[Schloss Britz|Britz House]] in Berlin, [[Albrechtsberg Palace (Dresden)|Albrechtsberg]], ''Eckberg'', ''Villa Stockhausen'' and [[:de:Villa San Remo|Villa San Remo]] in [[Dresden]], [[:de:Künstlerhaus Villa Waldberta|Villa Waldberta]] in [[Feldafing]], [[:de:Villa Kennedy|Villa Kennedy]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Jenisch House]] and [[Budge-Palais]] in [[Hamburg]], [[:de:Villa Andreae|Villa Andreae]] and [[:de:Villa Rothschild|Villa Rothschild]] in [[Königstein im Taunus|Königstein]], [[Villa Stuck]] and [[:de:Pacelli-Palais|Pacelli-Palais]] in [[Munich]], [[Schloss Klink]] at [[Müritz|Lake Müritz]], [[Villa Ludwigshöhe]] in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Villa Haux]] in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Weinberg House (Waren)|Weinberg House]] in [[Waren (Müritz)|Waren]].

In France the [[Château de Ferrières]] is an example of the Italian [[Neo-Renaissance]] style villa - and in Britain the [[Mentmore Towers]] by [[John Ruskin]]. A representative building of this style in Germany is [[Villa Haas]] (designed by Ludwig Hofmann) in [[Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus F. Müller: Park und Villa Haas - Historismus, Kunst und Lebensstil. Verlag Edition Winterwork, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86468-160-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th - 21st centuries===

====Europe====
[[File:Villenanlage OID 69016.jpg|thumb|Typical Villa in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]]]
During the 19th and 20th century, the term "villa" became widespread for detached mansions in Europe. Special forms are for instance [[Spa architecture|spa villas]] (''Kurvillen'' in German) and [[Resort architecture|seaside villas]] (''Bädervillen'' in German), that became especially popular at the end of the 19th century. The tradition established back then continued throughout the 20th century and even until today.

Another trend was the erection of rather minimalist mansions in the [[Bauhaus]] style since the 1920s, that also continues until today.

In Denmark, Norway and Sweden "villa" denotes most forms of [[single-family detached home]]s, regardless of size and standard.

====Americas====
The villa concept lived and lives on in the [[hacienda]]s of Latin America and the [[estancia]]s of Brazil and Argentina. The oldest are original Portuguese and [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]; followed after independences in the Americas from Spain and Portugal, by the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style with regional variations. In the 20th century [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] villas were designed by [[Roberto Burle Marx]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Luis Barragán]], and other architects developing a unique Euro-Latin synthesized aesthetic.

Villas are particularly well represented in [[California]] and the West Coast of the United States, where they were originally commissioned by well travelled "upper-class" patrons moving on from the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] [[Victorian architecture]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]. Communities such as [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], and [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] in Southern California, and [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] and [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] are a few examples of villa density.

The popularity of [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]] in its various iterations over the last century has been consistently used in that region and in [[Florida]]. Just a few of the notable early architects were [[Wallace Neff]], [[Addison Mizner]], [[Stanford White]], and [[George Washington Smith (architect)|George Washington Smith]]. A few examples are the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Medici scale [[Hearst Castle]] on the [[Central Coast of California]], and [[Villa Montalvo]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] of [[Saratoga, California]], [[Villa Vizcaya]] in [[Coconut Grove, Miami]], [[American Craftsman]] versions are the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and the villas by [[Greene and Greene]] in [[Pasadena, California]]

====Modern villas====

====Other====
Today the term "villa" is often applied to [[vacation rental]] properties. In the United Kingdom the term is used for high quality detached homes in warm destinations, particularly [[Florida]] and the Mediterranean.  The term is also used in Pakistan, and in some of the Caribbean islands such as [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[British Virgin Islands]], and others. It is similar for the coastal resort areas of [[Baja California Sur]] and mainland Mexico, and for [[hospitality industry]] [[destination resort]] "luxury [[bungalow]]s" in various worldwide locations.

In Indonesia, the term "villa" is applied to Dutch colonial country houses (''landhuis''). Nowadays, the term is more popularly applied to vacation rental usually located in countryside area.

[[Image:Heritage Houses In Freemans Bay.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Heritage villas: late 19th century, [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]In Australia "villas" or "villa units" are terms used to describe a type of [[townhouse]] complex which contains, possibly smaller attached or detached houses of up to 3-4 bedrooms that were built since the early 1980s.

In New Zealand the term "villa" is commonly used to describe a style of wooden [[weatherboard]] house constructed before WW1 characterised by high ceilings (often 12&amp;nbsp;ft), [[sash window]]s, and a long entrance hall.

In Cambodia "villa" is used as a loanword in the local language of Khmer, and is generally used to describe any type of detached townhouse that features yard space. The term doesn't apply to any particular architectural style or size, the only features that distinguish a Khmer villa from another building are the yard space and being fully detached. The terms "twin-villa" and "mini-villa" have been coined meaning semi-detached and smaller versions respectively. Generally, these would be more luxurious and spacious houses than the more common row houses. The yard space would also typically feature some form of garden, trees or greenery. Generally, these would be properties in major cities, where there is more wealth and hence more luxurious houses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13148">In [[decision theory]] and [[game theory]], '''[[Abraham Wald|Wald's]] [[Minimax#Maximin|maximin]] model''' is a non-probabilistic decision-making model according to which decisions are ranked on the basis of their worst-case outcomes – the optimal decision is one with the least worst outcome. It is one of the most important models in [[robust decision making]] in general and [[robust optimization]] in particular.

It is also known by a variety of other titles, such as Wald's maximin rule, Wald's maximin principle, Wald's maximin paradigm, and Wald's maximin criterion. Often '[[minimax]]' is used instead of 'maximin'.

==Definition==
Wald's generic maximin model is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)}f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; denotes the decision space; &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of states associated with decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the payoff (outcome) associated with decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

This model represents a 2-person game in which the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; player plays first. In response, the second player selects  the worst state in &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt;, namely a state in &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the payoff &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt;. In many applications the second player represents uncertainty. However, there are maximin models that are completely deterministic.

The above model is the ''classic'' format of Wald's maximin model. There is an equivalent [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] (MP) format:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D,\,z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z \le f(d,s),\forall s\in S(d)\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the real line.

As in [[game theory]], the worst payoff associated with decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, namely

: &lt;math&gt;v(d):= \min_{s\in S(d)} f(d,s)\ , \ d \in D&lt;/math&gt;

is called ''the security level'' of decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

The minimax version of the model is obtained by exchanging the positions of the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt;   operations in the classic format:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\circ}:= \min_{d\in D}\max_{s\in S(d)}f(d,s).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent MP format is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\circ}:= \min_{d\in D,\,z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z \ge f(d,s),\forall s\in S(d)\}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Inspired by maximin models of game theory, [[Abraham Wald]] developed this model in the early 1940s &lt;ref name="wald39"&gt;Wald, A. (1939).  Contributions to the theory of statistical estimation and testing hypotheses. ''The Annals of Mathematics,'' 10(4), 299-326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wald45"&gt;Wald, A. (1945).  Statistical decision functions which minimize the maximum risk. ''The Annals of Mathematics,'' 46(2), 265-280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wald50"&gt;Wald, A.  (1950). ''Statistical Decision Functions,'' John Wiley, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; as an approach to situations in which there is only one player (the decision maker). The second player represents a pessimistic (worst case) approach to uncertainty. In Wald's maximin model, player 1 (the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; player) plays first and player 2 (the &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt; player) knows player 1's decision when he selects his decision. This is a major simplification of the [[Two-person zero-sum game|classic 2-person zero-sum game]] in which the two players choose their strategies without knowing the other player's choice. The game of Wald's maximin model is also a 2-person [[zero-sum game]], but the players choose sequentially.

With the establishment of modern decision theory in the 1950s, the model became a key ingredient in the formulation of non-probabilistic decision-making models in the face of severe uncertainty.&lt;ref name="resnik"&gt;Resnik, M.D. (1987). ''Choices: an Introduction to Decision Theory,''   University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="french"&gt;French, S. (1986). ''Decision Theory: An Introduction to the Mathematics of Rationality,'' Ellis Horwood, Chichester.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in diverse fields such as [[decision theory]], [[control theory]], [[economics]], [[statistics]], [[robust optimization]], [[operations research]], [[Maximin (philosophy)|philosophy]], etc.&lt;ref name="ms07"&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2007).  The art and science of modeling decision-making under severe uncertainty. ''Decision Making in Manufacturing and Services,''  1(1-2), 111-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ms08"&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2008). Wald's maximin model: a treasure in disguise! ''Journal of Risk Finance,'' 9(3), 287-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
One of the most famous examples of a Maximin/Minimax model is

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}} \max_{y\in \mathbb{R}}\ \{x^{2} - y^{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the real line. Formally we can set &lt;math&gt;D=S(d)=\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)=d^{2}-s^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The picture is this

[[Image:Saddle point.png|400px]]

The optimal solution is the  (red) [[saddle point]]  &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Decision tables==
There are many cases where it is convenient to 'organize' the Maximin/Minimax model as a 'table'. The convention is that the rows of the table represent the decisions, and the columns represent the states.

===Example===
Henri is going for a walk. The sun may shine, or it may rain. Should Henri carry an umbrella? Henri does not like carrying an umbrella, but he dislikes getting wet even more. His "[[payoff matrix]]", viewing this as a Maximin game pitting Henri against Nature, is as follows.

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
 !
 ! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sun &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
 ! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rain &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 |-
 ! No umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/center&gt;
 |-
 ! Umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 |}

{{Clear}}
Appending a ''Worst Payoff''&amp;nbsp;  column and a ''Best Worst Payoff''&amp;nbsp; column to the payoff table, we obtain

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
 !
 ! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sun &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
 ! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rain &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 ! Worst Payoff
 ! Best Worst Payoff
 |-
 ! No umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/center&gt;
 | 
 |-
 ! Umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 |}
{{Clear}}
The worst case, if Henri goes out without umbrella, is definitely worse than the (best) worst case when carrying an umbrella. Therefore, Henri takes his umbrella with him.

==Variations on a theme==
Over the years a variety of related models have been developed primarily to moderate the pessimistic approach dictated by the worst-case orientation of the model.&lt;ref name="resnik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="french" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kouvelis"&gt;Kouvelis P, and Yu G. (1997).  ''Robust Discrete Optimization and Its Applications,''  Kluwer, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-tal09"&gt;Ben-Tal, A,  El Gaoui, L, Nemirovski, A. (2009). ''Robust Optimization.''  Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sim04"&gt;Bertsimas D, and Sim, M. (2004). The price of robustness. ''Operations Research,''  52(1), 35-53.&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

===Savage's minimax regret===
[[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage's]] [[Minimax regret|minimax regret model]]&lt;ref name="savage51"&gt;Savage, L. (1951). The theory of statistical decision. ''Journal of the American Statistical Association,'' 46, 55–67.&lt;/ref&gt; is an application of Wald's minimax model to the 'regrets' associated with the payoffs. It can be formulated as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{d\in D}\max_{s\in S} r(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;r(d,s):= \max_{d\,'\in D} f(d\,',s) - f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

is the regret of payoff &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; associated with the (decision,state) pair &lt;math&gt;(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Deterministic models==
The sets of states &lt;math&gt;S(d),d\in D,&lt;/math&gt; need not represent uncertainty. They can represent (deterministic) variations in the value of a parameter.

===Example===
Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set representing possible locations of an 'undesirable'  public facility (e.g. garbage dump), and let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; denote a finite set of locations in the neighborhood of the planned facility, representing existing dwellings.

It might be desirable to build the facility so that its shortest distance from an existing dwelling is as large as possible. The maximin formulation of the problem is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S} dist(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dist(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. Note that in this problem &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt; does not vary with &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

In cases where is it desirable to live close to the facility, the objective could be to minimize the maximum distance from the facility. This yields the following minimax problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{d\in D}\max_{s\in S} dist(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

These are generic [[facility location]] problems.

==Maximin models in disguise==
Experience has shown that the formulation of maximin models can be subtle in the sense that problems that 'do not look like' maximin problems can be formulated as such.

===Example===
Consider the following problem:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 Given a finite set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a real valued function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, find the largest subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in this subset.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The maximin formulation of this problem, in the MP format, is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{Y\subseteq X} \ \{|Y|: g(x)\le 0,\forall x\in Y\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Generic problems of this type appear in robustness analysis.&lt;ref name="moffitt08"&gt;L. Joe Moffitt, John K. Stranlund, and Craig D. Osteen (2008). Robust detection protocols for uncertain introductions of invasive species. ''Journal of Environmental Management,'' 89(4), 293–299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenhead72"&gt;Jonathan Rosenhead, Martin Elton, Shiv K. Gupta. (1972). Robustness and Optimality as Criteria for Strategic Decisions. ''Operational Research Quarterly,'' 23(4), 413-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that the [[Stability radius|radius of stability]] model and [[info-gap decision theory|info-gap's robustness]] model are simple instances of Wald's maximin model.&lt;ref name="MS10"&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2010). A bird's view of info-gap decision theory. ''Journal of Risk Finance,'' 11(3), 268-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constrained maximin models==
Constraints can be incorporated explicitly in the maximin models. For instance, the following is a constrained maximin problem stated in the classic format

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)}\ \{f(d,s): g(d,s) \le 0, \forall s\in S(d)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its equivalent MP format is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D,\,z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z \le f(d,s), g(d,s) \le 0, \forall s\in S(d)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such models are very useful in [[robust optimization]].

==The price of robustness==
One of the 'weaknesses' of the Maximin model is that the robustness that it provides comes with a ''price''.&lt;ref name="sim04" /&gt;  By playing it safe, the Maximin model tends to generate conservative decisions, whose price can be high. The following example illustrates this important feature of the model.

===Example===
Consider the simple case where there are two decisions, d'  and d",  and where S(d')=S(d")=[a,b]. The Maximin model is then as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)} f(d,s) = \max_{d\,',d\,''}\ \min_{a\le s \le b}f(d,s) = \max\ \{\min_{a\le s \le b}f(d\,',s),\min_{a\le s\le b}f(d\,'',s)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider the instance shown by

[[Image:Maximin price.png|600px]]

Note that although the payoff associated with decision d'  is larger than the payoff associated with decision d" over most of the state space S=[a,b], the best worst case according to Wald's model is provided by decision d". Hence, according to Wald's model decision d" is better than decision d'.

==Algorithms==
There are no general-purpose algorithms for the solution of maximin problems. Some problems are very simple to solve, others are very difficult.&lt;ref name="ben-tal09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sim04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reemstem98"&gt;Reemstem, R. and R\"{u}ckmann, J. (1998). ''Semi-Infinite Programming,'' Kluwer, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rustem02"&gt;Rustem, B. and Howe, M. (2002). ''Algorithms for Worst-case Design and Applications to Risk Management,'' Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Consider the case where the state variable is an "index", for instance  let &lt;math&gt;S(d)=\{1,2,\dots,k\}&lt;/math&gt; for  all &lt;math&gt;d \in D&lt;/math&gt;. The associated maximin problem is then as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)} f(d,s) &amp;= \max_{d\in D}\min_{1\le s \le k} \{f_{1}(d),\dots,f_{k}(d)\}\\
&amp; = \max_{d\in D, z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z\le f_{s}(d),\forall s=1,2,\dots,k\}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_{s}(d) \equiv f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;d\in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, all the functions &lt;math&gt;f_{s}, s=1,2,\dots,k,&lt;/math&gt;  are [[linear]], and &lt;math&gt;d\in D&lt;/math&gt; is specified by a system of [[linear]] constraints on &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then this problem is a [[linear programming]] problem that can be solved by [[linear programming]] algorithms such as the [[simplex algorithm]].

A '''zoophyte''' is an [[animal]] that visually resembles a [[plant]]. An example is a [[sea anemone]]. The name is obsolete in modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers 20th Century Dictionary|editor=Kirkpatrick, E. M.|publisher=Chambers|location=Edinburgh|year=1983|pages=1524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western history ==

Zoophytes are common in medieval and renaissance era [[herbal]]s, notable examples including the [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Tartar Lamb]], a plant which grew sheep as fruit.&lt;ref name=royalsociety&gt;{{cite journal |last=Appleby |first=John H. |title=The Royal Society and the Tartar Lamb |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |year=1997 |jstor=532033 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1997.0003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoophytes appeared in many influential early medical texts, such as [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides's]] ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' and subsequent adaptations and commentaries on that work, notably [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli|Mattioli's]] ''Discorsi''. Zoophytes are frequently seen as medieval attempts to explain the origins of exotic, unknown plants with strange properties (such as [[cotton]], in the case of the Tartar Lamb).&lt;ref name="Large&amp;Braggins" &gt;{{cite book | last=Large | first=Mark F. |author2=John E. Braggins  | title=Tree Ferns | publisher=Timber Press | year=2004 | location=Portland, Oregon | page=360 | isbn=978-0-88192-630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of zoophytes continued into the seventeenth century and were commented on by many influential thinkers of the time period, including [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=royalsociety /&gt; It was not until 1646 that claims of zoophytes began to be concretely refuted, and skepticism towards claims of zoophytes mounted throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=royalsociety /&gt; However, the term was still used by [[Georges Cuvier]] in his ''[[Le Règne Animal]]'' in 1817, as the title of one of his four divisions (''Embranchements'') of the animal kingdom (called [[Radiata]] in English translations), and by Charles Darwin in his book ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' in 1845.

== Other cultures ==

In the Eastern cultures such as [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] fungi were classified as plants in the [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] texts, and [[cordyceps]], and in particular ''[[Ophiocordyceps sinensis]]'' were considered zoophytes.&lt;ref name="mm" &gt;{{Cite book | author = Halpern, Miller | title = Medicinal Mushrooms | pages = 64–65 | publisher = M.
