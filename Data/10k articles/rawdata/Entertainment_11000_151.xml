'''''1001 Ways to Beat the Draft''''' is a satirical [[Vietnam War]] [[political protest|protest]] [[pamphlet]] written in 1966 by Robert Bashlow and [[Tuli Kupferberg]]. It was also published in book format.

The text reels through dozens of ways that young men facing [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam War|conscription]] during the [[Vietnam War]] could avoid service. Kupferberg leaves no societal [[wiktionary:more|more]] unscathed in this anti-war pamphlet, which is considered one of the most notable antiwar publications.&lt;ref&gt;Charters, Ann. "Robert Bly". ''The Portable Sixties Reader'' Ed. Charters, Ann. Penguin Classics (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Donald L. Simons, in his autobiography ''I Refuse: Memories of a Vietnam War Objector'', wrote "It is not possible to determine how many men successfully fooled the system, but stories of attempts, and how to do it, became part of the Sixties culture. The most famous examples were [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s classic folk song, "[[Alice's Restaurant]]", and the book, ''1001 Ways to Beat the Draft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=I Refuse: Memories of a Vietnam War Objector
|author=Donald L. Simons
|year=1992
|publisher=Broken Rifle Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pamphlet was published originally by Oliver Layton Press, New York; Kupferberg also printed it under his publishing label, Birth Press, and an illustrated version from [[Grove Press]] came out in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. A. Levy]], ''The Buddhist Third Class Junkmail Oracle: The Art and Poetry of D.a.Levy''. Seven Stories Press (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Kupferberg published other humorous lists in the same format, including ''1001 Ways to Live Without Working'' and ''1001 Ways to Make Love''.  

An excerpt was included in Viking Press' ''Portable Beat Reader''&lt;ref&gt;Editor [[Ann Charters]], a professor of English at the University of Connecticut and acclaimed [[Beat generation|Beat]] researcher, included an excerpt of Kupferberg's ''1001 Ways to Beat the Draft'' for the [[Viking Press]] ''Portable Beat Reader'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excerpt ==
# Grope J. Edgar Hoover in the silent halls of Congress.
# Get thee to a nunnery.
# Fly to the moon and refuse to come home.
# Die.
# Become Secretary of Defense.
# Become Secretary of State.
# Become Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
# Show a li'l tit.
# Castrate yourself.
# Staple your eyelids shut.
# Move to Canada.
# Fake mental retardation.
# Fake a medical condition 
# Fake a severe medical condition
# Dig a hole and hide...

'''''Alive from Off Center''''', renamed '''''Alive TV''''' in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/26/news/tv-weekend-winning-his-heart-not-to-mention-his-gallbladder.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] arts anthology television series aired by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] between 1985 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/ktca/alive/season12.html |title=PBS |accessdate=2017-07-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961226095533/http://www.pbs.org/ktca/alive/season12.html |archivedate=December 26, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inbaseline.com/project.aspx?project_id=153235 Inbaseline.com]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film.com/tv/alive-tv/21327965 Film.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each week, the series featured experimental short films by a mixture of up-and-coming and established directors. Notable episodes included "As Seen on TV," starring comic actor [[Bill Irwin]] as an auditioning dancer who becomes trapped in a television, wandering among daytime dramas, MTV, and PBS's own ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and the atmospheric puppet melodrama "[[Street of Crocodiles]]," adapted by the [[Brothers Quay]] from the Bruno Shultz story.

Other installments included "Dances in Exile" directed by Howard Silver, a recorded dance piece with text by [[David Henry Hwang]] and choreography by Ruby Shang and another directed by [[Jonathan Demme]].

Arguably the series' best-known episode was ''[[What You Mean We?]]'' a short film written by, directed by, and starring [[Laurie Anderson]], which aired in 1986.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=TV: LAURIE ANDERSON PERFORMS|first=Walter|last=Goodman|date=September 6, 1986|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/arts/tv-laurie-anderson-performs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson later came back to host the 1987 season of the series, assisted by the Clone (who was eventually renamed Fenway Bergamot with a slightly different body shape), a masculine version of Anderson created by digitally altering her image and obscuring her voice that had been introduced in ''What You Mean We?'' Most episodes of the 1987 season opened with a brief skit by Anderson and the clone by way of introducing that week's piece.

Actress [[Ann Magnuson]] subsequently co-hosted the 1988 season, after which the series had no regular hosts.

[[File:Murphys Point-Bunkhouse.jpg|thumb|Bunkhouse]]
A '''bunkhouse''' is a [[barracks]]-like building that historically was used to house working [[cowboy]]s on [[ranch]]es in [[North America]]. As most cowboys were young single men, the standard bunkhouse was a large open room with narrow beds or cots for each individual and little privacy. The bunkhouse of the late 19th century was usually heated by a wood stove and personal needs were attended to in an [[outhouse]].
 
While the modern bunkhouse today is still in existence on some large ranches that are too far away from towns for an easy daily commute, it now has electricity, [[central heating]] and modern [[Plumbing|indoor plumbing]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], a bunkhouse provides accommodation with fewer facilities than a larger, staffed [[Hostel|youth hostel]]. Bunkhouses are found in mountainous areas, such as the [[Scottish Highlands]], as well as rural areas in England and Wales, for example at [[All Stretton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yha.org.uk/find-accommodation/heart-of-england/hostels/all-stretton/local_info.aspx YHA All Stretton Bunkhouse]&lt;/ref&gt;. Bunkhouses are very different to Hotels, Bunkhouses often just offer a basic accommodation with few amenities for passers-by such as hikers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bunkr.co.uk/expect-first-stay-in-a-bunkhouse-hostel/ Staying In A Bunkhouse]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crazy Frog''', originally known as '''The Annoying Thing''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] CGI-animated character created in 2003 by actor and playwright [[Erik Wernquist]]. Marketed by the [[ringtone]] provider [[Jamba!]] (later known as Jamster), he was originally created to accompany a sound effect produced by Australian singer and songwriter Sav Martino and Daniel Malmedahl in 1997 while attempting to imitate the sound of a [[two-stroke engine]].

The Crazy Frog spawned a worldwide hit single with a remix of "[[Axel F (Crazy Frog song)|Axel F]]", which reached the number one spot in Turkey, New Zealand, Australia and most of Europe. The subsequent album ''[[Crazy Hits|Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits]]'' and second single "[[Popcorn (instrumental)#Crazy Frog version|Popcorn]]" also enjoyed worldwide chart success, and a second album entitled ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits]]'' was released in 2006. The Crazy Frog has also spawned a range of merchandise and toys, and two video games.

== History ==
In 1997, 17-year-old Gothenburg student Daniel Malmedahl recorded himself imitating the noises produced by a two stroke engine. He posted this on a website and caught the attention of a Swedish television researcher, who convinced Daniel to perform the sound live on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4210407.stm|title='The Crazy Frog sound? That's my fault.' |publisher=BBC | date=27 January 2005|accessdate=27 July 2010 |first=Giles |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it debuted on television, recordings of his performance began appearing on file sharing networks and various websites under the filename "2TAKTARE.MP3" ("''Tvåtaktare''" is Swedish for "two stroker").{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

The sound was adopted as the sound of a Formula One car as early as 2001 in the form of "Deng Deng Form" and later "The Insanity Test" both of which were a static background of a Ferrari Formula One car accompanied by the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2005/01/the_evolution_o/ The Evolution of Crazy Frog – from Deng Deng to Ringtone]. Bloggerheads.com (16 January 2005). Retrieved on 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, another Swede, Erik Wernquist, encountered the sound effect and, not knowing about the previous incarnations of the sound, was inspired to create the 3D animated character he named "The Annoying Thing" to accompany it.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; Wernquist worked on the first animation in his spare time using the [[LightWave]] [[3D computer graphics#Modeling|3D modeling]] application, and the whole process took between 6 and 8 weeks.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; In October 2003 he posted it on his website and on the CGTalk forum.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt;

The animation was a popular attraction at Erik's website, but the sound was credited to "Anonymous". Eventually, word reached Malmedahl that his impressions had been used in a now well-known animation. He contacted Wernquist, apparently giving an impromptu performance to confirm his claims. Wernquist was convinced, and gave credit to Malmedahl for his creation.

The animation received attention through filesharing and word of mouth, and when [[Jamba!|Ringtone Europe]] and Jamster België (now both merged into Jamba!) got wind of this, realizing the monetary possibilities through capitalizing on the underground cult-status they licensed the rights to the creation, renaming it "Crazy Frog" and starting to market it in mid-2004.

In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Wernquist expressed his displeasure at the choice of name:

:"If I had known that this was going to be such a big thing I would not have allowed them to use that stupid name. It has nothing to do with the character. It's not a frog and it's not particularly crazy either."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_CrazyFrog.html |title='The Crazy Frog sound? That's my fault.' |publisher=BBC |date=27 January 2005 |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other media ==
On 1 July 2005, UK-based [[Video game publisher|publishers]] [[Digital Jesters]] announced that they had acquired the rights to the video game licence for the Crazy Frog. ''[[Crazy Frog Racer]] (featuring The Annoying Thing)'', released in December 2005 on [[PlayStation 2]] and PC as a [[racing game]]. A year later in 2006 a sequel was released, entitled ''[[Crazy Frog Racer 2]]''. Both were extremely panned by critics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022935/http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2011/01/gycw-crazy_frog_racer_2/ Crazy Frog Racer 2 video game Review by British Gaming Television Presenter Wesley Lock].

In 2005, the German production company The League of Good People was in talks with broadcasters about a TV series based on Crazy Frog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104192225/http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=79&amp;article=27019 |url=http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=79&amp;article=27019 |archivedate=4 January 2011 |title=Crazy Frog hops on to small screen |publisher=C21 Media |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=27 February 2015 |first=Jules |last=Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crazy Frog toured Australia in late 2005, beginning in Perth on 4 December and continuing through other major capital cities. He made appearances at numerous shopping centres and major hospitals around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cashmere |first=Paul |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825004918/http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2005/dec05/20051202_crazyfrog.html |url=http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2005/dec05/20051202_crazyfrog.html |archivedate=25 August 2007 |title=Crazy Frog Tour Dates |publisher=undercover.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Animation World Network wrote in connection with "The Annoying Thing" that there was a "planned feature film" to "be completed by the end of next year" into an animated feature film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awn.com/animationworld/cartoon-movie-2007-sneak-peeks-european-animated-features Cartoon Movie 2007: Sneak Peeks European Animated Features].

In 2017, a documentary called "The Not So Crazy Frog" was released, originally made in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8vVz1KoU2s]. www.youtube.com (22 December 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a trademark claim by Kaktus Films, the original owners alongside Erik Wernquist, that had music listed as one of many rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4805:251xqz.2.1]. US Trademark Search (24 May 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial controversies ==
In February 2005, viewers submitted a number of complaints to the United Kingdom's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) regarding [[Jamster!]]'s advertising campaign, complaining that Crazy Frog appeared to have a visible [[penis]] and [[scrotum]]. Some parents complained that this made inappropriate viewing for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/article/234073/crazy-frog-keep-ding-ding-di-di-ding-asa-says |title=Crazy Frog can keep his ding-ding di-di-ding ASA says – Brand Republic News |publisher=Brandrepublic.com |date=2 February 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also complaints regarding the frequency with which the advertisement appeared on television, reportedly up to twice an hour across most of the day,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/tv-viewers-driven-crazy-by-frog-ringtone-ad-1-712972 Scotsman.com News]. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; with some channels showing it more than once per commercial break.

The ASA did not uphold the complaints, pointing out that the advert was already classified as inappropriate for airing during children's television programmes as it contained a [[premium rate telephone number]], and that it was the broadcasters' decision how often an advertisement should be shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ECE03B9D-119D-4150-8F22-48ADADD9AC09/0/ASA_Broadcast_Rulings_2Feb05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113091721/http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ECE03B9D-119D-4150-8F22-48ADADD9AC09/0/ASA_Broadcast_Rulings_2Feb05.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamster! voluntarily [[censorship|censored]] the character's genital area (via [[pixelization]]) in later broadcasts of its advertisements. Similar action occurred in Australia, with similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertising Standards Board: Ref 18/05|url=http://www.advertisingstandardsbureau.com.au/PDF/05_18.pdf|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Advertising Standards Board|date=17 February 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050617121041/http://www.advertisingstandardsbureau.com.au/PDF/05_18.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, television viewers complained about misleading advertisements produced by Jamba!, trading as [[Jamster!]] and RingtoneKing. Viewers felt that it was not made sufficiently clear that they were subscribing to a service, rather than paying a one-time fee for their ringtone. The complaints were upheld; the full adjudication (PDF) is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Old%20Broadcast%20rulings/Broadcast_rulings_6_April_05.ashx |title=Broadcast Advertising Adjucations |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811220446/http://asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Old%20Broadcast%20rulings/Broadcast_rulings_6_April_05.ashx |archivedate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, viewers inundated the ASA with new complaints regarding the continuous airing of the latest Crazy Frog advertisements. The intensity of the advertising was unprecedented in British television history. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Jamster bought 73,716 spots across all TV channels in May alone&amp;nbsp;— an average of nearly 2,378 slots daily&amp;nbsp;— at a cost of about £8&amp;nbsp;million, just under half of which was spent on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 87% of the population saw the Crazy Frog adverts an average of 26 times, 15% of the adverts appeared twice during the same advertising break and 66% were in consecutive ad breaks. An estimated 10% of the population saw the advert more than 60 times. This led to many members of the population finding the Crazy Frog, as its original name suggests, immensely irritating.&lt;ref&gt;(source: ''Media Guardian'', 20 June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

As the authority had already adjudicated on the matter and confirmed the matter was not within its remit, the unusual step was taken of adding a notice to the ASA's online and telephone complaints system informing viewers that Jamster!-related complaints should be directed towards the broadcaster or the regulator, [[Ofcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rae|first1=Charles|title=Frog drives viewers crazy|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article107567.ece|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=The Sun|date=20 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2005, the ASA ruled that the Crazy Frog, along with other Jamba ringtone advertisements, could not be shown before 9&amp;nbsp;pm. This adjudication was revised on 25 January 2006, maintaining the 'upheld' decision but revising the wording of one of the points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F3CC87DF-2F2A-4754-9C40-2EC23F0EC54C/0/Broadcastreport25Jan06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029030132/http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F3CC87DF-2F2A-4754-9C40-2EC23F0EC54C/0/Broadcastreport25Jan06.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/21/crazy_frog_off_air/ |title=ASA stamps on Crazy Frog TV ads |publisher=The Register |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001090937/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/21/crazy_frog_off_air/ |archivedate=1 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, [[anti-virus]] vendors discovered the "&lt;code&gt;W32/Crog.worm&lt;/code&gt;" [[computer virus]] (a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of Crazy Frog), which spreads through [[file-sharing]] networks and [[MSN Messenger]], exploiting the ''Crazy Frog'''s notoriety with a promise of an animation depicting his demise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcafee.com/threat-intelligence/malware/default.aspx?id=132209 W32/Crog.worm].

'''''Dainichido Bugaku''''' ({{lang-ja|links=no|大日堂舞楽}}, literally: Important Day Dance) is a yearly set of nine sacred ritual [[Japanese traditional dance|dances]] and [[traditional Japanese music|music]], named for the imperial palace ensemble performances, "''[[bugaku]]''", and from the palace's ensemble's visit to [[Mount Hachimantai|Hachimantai]], [[Kazuno District, Akita|Kazuno District]], [[Akita Prefecture]], during the reconstruction of the local shrine pavilion, "''Dainichido''", in the early eighth century,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/dainichido-bugaku-00275 Dainichido Bugaku]", ''UNESCO.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; and their teaching of dances to the locals.

Instruments include the [[flute]] and [[taiko]]. The order and number of dances has changed over time, with the current order of seven dances being the Gongen-mai, Koma-mai, Uhen-mai, Tori-mai, Godaison-mai, Kōshō-mai, and Dengaku-mai dances. Masks include representations of shishi and [[Vairocana]].

The dances have a 1300-year history ([[Nara period]]),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/events/2014/12/30/things-to-do/traditional-festivals-things-to-do/dainichido-bugaku-dance-akita/#.V4hxGDXL_uM Dainichido Bugaku Dance in Akita]", ''JapanTimes.co.jp''.&lt;/ref&gt; and though interrupted for nearly sixty years in the late eighteenth century, the dances, some of which may include children or masks, are still practiced on January second from sunrise to noon in shrines throughout communities in Osato, Azukisawa, Nagamine, and Taniuchi,&lt;!--all in Kazuno District, Akita--&gt; including Hachimantai.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

Yamaji Kōzō&lt;!--(1984)--&gt; dates ''Dainichido Bugaku'' as arising during and after the [[Nara period|Nara]] (CE 710 to 794) and mid-[[Heian period]]s (CE 794 to 1185), after state support of Shinto temple complexes (originally ordered by [[Emperor Shōmu]] (CE 701 – 756)) began to decline and court and temple performers took residence in local communities, which then preserved genres such as ''Dainichido Bugaku'' as folk arts.&lt;ref&gt;Thornbury, Barbara E.

'''Diamond Tooth Lil''' was an American cultural figure popular in the early 20th century as an icon of wealth and libertine burlesque. Several individuals called themselves "Diamond Lil" or "Diamond Tooth", creating an amalgamated legacy clouded by myth. These individuals include a [[vaudeville]] entertainer in the [[Yukon]] during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], a [[madam (prostitution)|madam]] in the American West during the early 1900s, and the titular character of [[Mae West]]'s ''[[Diamond Lil (play)|Diamond Lil]]'', who embodied these traits and popularized the name in the 1920s.{{r|Ghosts}}

== Overview ==

Multiple women of the [[American West]] have used the name "Diamond Tooth" and "Diamond Lil".{{r|Rocky Mountains}} In the case of the two most prominent, historians have often confused the lives of Honora Ornstein and Evelyn Hildegard, who both went by the name Diamond Lil around the turn of the 20th century, both emigrants from Austria, with similar ages, careers in entertainment, and diamond-inset teeth.{{sfn|Oberding|2015|p=121}} They did differ, however, in where they lived: Ornstein in the Klondike and Seattle, and Hildegard in California and Nevada.{{sfn|Oberding|2015|pp=121–122}} Lil became known as enigmatic figure, and has been variously attributed as a "[[dance hall]] girl, gambler, prostitute, or madam who smoked cigars and carried a gun"—a legacy clouded with myth.{{r|Rocky Mountains}} By the 1920s, Diamond Tooth Lil was a [[celebrity|household name]].{{sfn|Oberding|2015|p=120}}

== Klondike Lil ==

Honora Ornstein was born in [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1882{{r|Rocky Mountains}} to a Jewish family. She also used the name Lilian Orinstein.{{r|WaPo 1936}} She became famous during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the [[Yukon]] before the turn of the century on the [[Pantages]] [[vaudeville]] circuit, where she was a star entertainer for the region's spendthrift "[[wikt:sourdough|sourdough]]" gold seekers.{{r|NYT obit|WaPo 1936}} A nearby gambling house owner said that Lil spent three or four years there.{{r|WaPo 1936}} Her [[stage name]], Diamond Tooth Lil, is based on her several [[diamond]]-inset [[dental fillings]],{{r|NYT obit}}&lt;ref name="several"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Diamond Tooth Lil' Dying: Seattle Hunts Relatives of Beauty of Alaska Gold Rush. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1936-07-01 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDA1330E13BBC4953DFB166838D629EDE |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ones in her [[front tooth|front]] and [[eye tooth|canine]] teeth.{{r|WaPo 1975}} She also collected and wore other diamond-studded jewelry, including a [[white gold]] snake bracelet studded with 125 real diamonds that scaled the length of her arm.{{r|Rocky Mountains|WaPo 1975}} Lil was also known to have come from a wealthy family prior to her time in the Klondike.{{r|WaPo 1936}} Around 1908, she had moved to Seattle and was remembered for ostentatiously throwing money during a Klondikers' parade. Shortly before she divorced her last husband around 1928, she lived in an apartment she had purchased in Seattle and inherited $150,000 from her mother, equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|150,000|1928}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{r|WaPo 1936}}

Lil made newspaper headlines in 1936{{r|Rocky Mountains}}&lt;!--1935 in NYT?--&gt; when she was committed to [[Western State Hospital (Washington)|Western State Hospital]], a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]],{{r|NYT obit}} and reported as [[near-death]].{{r|WaPo 1936}} By this time, she had sold the diamonds from her teeth but was thought to still have considerable wealth—only she was unable to speak and her relatives were not in contact.{{r|WaPo 1936}} Her reputation limited the market for her jewelry collection, which she struggled to sell in the 1950s.{{r|Rocky Mountains}} Lil's lawyer reported that her assets had been exhausted by 1961.{{r|WaPo 1975}} After spending the remainder of her life in state institutions, Lil died in a Yakima, Washington, nursing home on June 18, 1975.{{r|WaPo 1975}} She was buried in a simple grave{{r|NYT obit}} and had no known relatives.{{r|WaPo 1975}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' remembered Lil as a "[[dance hall]] queen" and "[[:wikt:toast of the town|the toast of the North]]".{{r|NYT obit}}

As a traveling dancer, she worked her way from Ohio across the West to [[San Francisco]], California.{{sfn|MacKell|2009|p=163}} After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] left the city in ruins, Hildegard moved to [[Goldfield, Nevada]], a [[boomtown]] of the [[California Gold Rush]]. Hildegard was paid handsomely for her exceptionally popular act at the town's Northern Saloon.&lt;!--${{inflation|US|800|1906}}/month--&gt; Though she ultimately spent less than a year in Goldfield, she quickly opened her own dance hall and had a relationship with [[prospecting|prospector]] [[Diamondfield Jack]]. Hildegard was said to have won her title of Diamond Tooth Lil in a successful bet with a Reno dentist, who set a diamond in her front tooth.{{sfn|Oberding|2015|p=121}}

Lil was said to have entertained and managed multiple profitable brothels across the West, including [[Death Valley, California]], [[Denver, Colorado]], and [[Boise, Idaho]], where her "Star Rooms" in Boise had amenities including steam heating and both hot and cold water.{{sfn|Oberding|2015|p=122}}{{r|Rocky Mountains}} She had reached Boise by the early 1940s.

==Biography==
Eduardo Cansino was born on March 2, 1895, in [[Castilleja de la Cuesta]], [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. His sister, Elisa, was also a dancer. He emigrated to the [[United States Of Amerca|United States]] and joined the [[Ziegfeld Follies]]. In 1917 he married [[Volga Hayworth]], his partner in the Follies.&lt;ref name="Volga Obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=Mrs. Eduardo Cansino.

They had three children: [[Rita Hayworth|Margarita Carmen]], Eduardo Jr. (October 13, 1919 – March 11, 1974), and Vernon (May 21, 1922 – March 23, 1974). After she began making films in Hollywood, Margarita Carmen Cansino took her mother's maiden name as her professional surname, becoming [[Rita Hayworth]].&lt;ref name="Volga Obit"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10995">In [[decision theory]] and quantitative [[policy analysis]], the '''expected value of including uncertainty (EVIU)''' is the expected difference in the value of a decision based on a [[probabilistic analysis]] versus a decision based on an analysis that ignores [[uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Morgan, M. Granger  |author2=Henrion, Max  |chapter=Chap. 12 |title=Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-36542-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |title=The value of knowing how little you know: The advantages of a probabilistic treatment of uncertainty in policy analysis |author=Henrion, M. |year=1982 |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund (RAGS) Volume III - Part A: Process for Conducting Probabilistic Risk Assessment |year=2001 |chapter=Appendix D: Advanced Modeling Approaches for Characterizing Variability and Uncertainty |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/rags3adt/pdf/appendixd.pdf |author=EPA |page=D-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Decisions must be made every day in the ubiquitous presence of uncertainty.  For most day-to-day decisions, various [[heuristics]] are used to act reasonably in the presence of uncertainty, often with little thought about its presence.  However, for larger high-stakes decisions or decisions in highly public situations, decision makers may often benefit from a more systematic treatment of their decision problem, such as through quantitative analysis or [[decision analysis]].

When building a quantitative decision model, a model builder identifies various relevant factors, and encodes these as ''input variables''.  From these inputs, other quantities, called ''result variables'', can be computed; these provide information for the decision maker.  For example, in the example detailed below, the decision maker must decide how soon before a flight's schedule departure he must leave for the airport (the decision).  One input variable is how long it takes to drive to the airport parking garage.  From this and other inputs, the model can compute how likely it is the decision maker will miss the flight and what the net cost (in minutes) will be for various decisions.

To reach a decision, a very common practice is to ignore uncertainty.  Decisions are reached through quantitative analysis and model building by simply using a ''best guess'' (single value) for each input variable.  Decisions are then made on computed ''point estimates''.  In many cases, however, ignoring uncertainty can lead to very poor decisions, with estimations for result variables often misleading the decision maker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Danziger, Jeff |author2=[http://www.drsamsavage.com Sam L. Savage] |title=The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=0-471-38197-7 |url=http://www.flawofaverages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to ignoring uncertainty in quantiative decision models is to explicitly encode uncertainty as part of the model. With this approach, a [[probability distribution]] is provided for each input variable, rather than a single best guess.  The [[variance]] in that distribution reflects the degree of [[Bayesian probability|subjective uncertainty]] (or lack of knowledge) in the input quantity.  The software tools then use methods such as [[Monte Carlo analysis]] to propagate the uncertainty to result variables, so that a decision maker obtains an explicit picture of the impact that uncertainty has on his decisions, and in many cases can make a much better decision as a result.

When comparing the two approaches—ignoring uncertainty versus modeling uncertainty explicitly—the natural question to ask is how much difference it really makes to the quality of the decisions reached.  In the 1960s, [[Ronald A. Howard]] proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Howard, Ron A. |title=Information value theory |journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics |volume=1 |pages=22–6 |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one such measure, the [[expected value of perfect information]] (EVPI), a measure of how much it would be worth to learn the "true" values for all uncertain input variables.  While providing a highly useful measure of sensitivity to uncertainty, the EVPI does not directly capture the actual improvement in decisions obtained from explicitly representing and reasoning about uncertainty.  For this, Max Henrion, in his Ph.D. thesis, introduced the ''expected value of including uncertainty'' (EVIU), the topic of this article.

== Formalization ==

Let

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ll}
d\in D &amp; \text{the decision being made, chosen from space } D 
\\
x\in X &amp; \text{the uncertain quantity, with true value in space } X
\\
U(d,x) &amp; \text{the utility function}
\\
f(x) &amp; \text{the prior subjective probability distribution (density function) on } x
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

When not including uncertainty, the optimal decision is found using only &lt;math&gt;E[x]&lt;/math&gt;, the expected value of the uncertain quantity.  Hence, the decision ''ignoring uncertainty'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{iu} = {\arg\max_{d}} ~ U(d,E[x]).
&lt;/math&gt;

The optimal decision taking uncertainty into account is the standard Bayes decision that maximizes [[expected utility]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
d^* = {\arg\max_d} {\int U(d,x) f(x) \, dx}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The EVIU is the difference in expected utility between these two decisions:
:&lt;math&gt;
EVIU = \int_{X} \left[ U(d^*,x) - U(d_{iu},x) \right] f(x) \, dx.
&lt;/math&gt;

The uncertain quantity ''x'' and decision variable ''d'' may each be composed of many scalar variables, in which case the spaces ''X'' and ''D'' are each vector spaces.

== Example ==

[[File:EVIU diagram.png|frame|[influence diagram of EVIU model]]

The diagram at right is an [[influence diagram]] for deciding how early the decision maker should leave home in order to catch a flight at the airport.  The single decision, in the green rectangle, is the number of minutes that one will decide to leave prior to the plane's departure time.  Four uncertain variables appear on the diagram in cyan ovals: The time required to drive from home to the airport's parking garage (in minutes), time to get from the parking garage to the gate (in minutes), the time before departure that one must be at the gate, and the loss (in minutes) incurred if the flight is missed.  Each of these nodes contains a probability distribution, viz:

 Time_to_drive_to_airport   := [[Lognormal Distribution|LogNormal]](median:60,gsdev:1.3)
 Time_from_parking_to_gate  := [[Lognormal Distribution|LogNormal]](median:10,gsdev:1.3)
 Gate_time_before_departure := [[Triangular Distribution|Triangular]](min:20,mode:30,max:40)
 Loss_if_miss_the_plane     := [[Lognormal Distribution|LogNormal]](median:400,stddev:100)

Each of these distributions is taken to be [[statistically independent]].  The probability distribution for the first uncertain variable, ''Time_to_drive_to_airport'', with [[median]] 60 and a [[geometric standard deviation]] of 1.3, is depicted in this graph:

[[File:EVIU time to drive to airport.png]]

The model calculates the cost (the red hexagonal variable) as the number of minutes (or minute equivalents) consumed to successfully board the plane.  If one arrive too late, one will miss one's plane and incur the large loss (negative utility) of having to wait for the next flight.  If one arrives too early, one incurs the cost of a needlessly long wait for the flight.

Models that utilize EVIU may use a [[utility function]], or equivalently they may utilize a [[loss function]], in which case the [[utility function]] is just the negative of the [[loss function]].  In either case, the EVIU will be positive.  The main difference is just that with a loss function, the decision is made by minimizing loss rather than by maximizing utility.  The example here uses a [[loss function]], Cost.

The definitions for each of the computed variables is thus:

 Time_from_home_to_gate := Time_to_drive_to_airport + Time_from_parking_to_gate + Loss_if_miss_the_plane
 Value_per_minute_at_home := 1

 Cost := Value_per_minute_at_home * Time_I_leave_home +
            (If Time_I_leave_home &lt; Time_from_home_to_gate Then Loss_if_miss_the_plane Else 0)

The following graph displays the expected value taking uncertainty into account (the smooth blue curve) to the expected utility ignoring uncertainty, graphed as a function of the decision variable.

[[File:EVIU comparison.png]]

When uncertainty is ignored, one acts as though the flight will be made with certainty as long as one leaves at least 100 minutes before the flight, and will miss the flight with certainty if one leaves any later than that.  Because one acts as if everything is certain, the optimal action is to leave exactly 100 minutes (or 100 minutes, 1 second) before the flight.

When uncertainty is taken into account, the expected value smooths out (the blue curve), and the optimal action is to leave 140 minutes before the flight.  The expected value curve, with a decision at 100 minutes before the flight, shows the expected cost when ignoring uncertainty to be 313.7 minutes, while the expected cost when one leaves 140 minute before the flight is 151 minutes.  The difference between these two is the EVIU:

:&lt;math&gt;EVIU = 313.7 - 151 = 162.7\text{ minutes} &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if uncertainty is explicitly taken into account when the decision is made, an average savings of 162.7 minutes will be realized.

==Linear-quadratic control==

In the context of centralized [[linear-quadratic control]], with additive uncertainty in the equation of evolution but no uncertainty about coefficient values in that equation, the optimal solution for the control variables taking into account the uncertainty is the same as the solution ignoring uncertainty. This property, which gives a zero expected value of including uncertainty, is called [[certainty equivalence]]. 

== Relation to expected value of perfect information (EVPI) ==

Both EVIU and [[EVPI]] compare the expected value of the Bayes' decision with another decision made without uncertainty.  For EVIU this other decision is made when the uncertainty is ''ignored'', although it is there, while for [[EVPI]] this other decision is made after the uncertainty is ''removed'' by obtaining perfect information about&amp;nbsp;''x''.

The [[EVPI]] is the expected cost of being uncertain about ''x'', while the EVIU is the additional expected cost of assuming that one is certain.

The EVIU, like the EVPI, gives expected value in terms of the units of the utility function.

{{Main |Censorship in South Korea}}
Like most other developed countries, South Korea’s film industry has had a great influence on the public. As films can affect the public with their great popularity and their vivid audio-visual effect, it has such influence that alarms the government to place strict regulations which the films must follow in order to be viewed by the public. This control on the film industry and filmmakers resulted in film censorship. The censorship often changed depends on the government's attitude toward the social structure and films. Thus, the filmmakers could not criticize the government in any aspect, instead, they could only promote and support the government. Consequently, the filmmakers were not allowed to freely express their creativity as well as their ideas and thoughts, and these restrictions lead to the decline of the film industry. There are 2 major time periods where film censorship strongly impacted on the growth of the film industry in South Korea, namely, the period during Colonial Korea which was under Japanese Rule [[Korea under Japanese rule|(Japanese occupation)]]  and the period when the film industry were under heavily surveillance from the new military regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreanfilm.or.kr/KOFIC/Channel?task=kofic.user.eng.d_publication.command.PublicationRetrieve1Cmd&amp;Gesipan_SCD=000000000000000004|title=Introduction|accessdate=2010-11-30 |work=Korean Film Council, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film censorship in Colonial Korea under Japanese rule==
Film was first introduced during the Chosun dynasty (1897–1910) and it gained popularity along with superfluous positive outcomes from its viewers. As a result, it could be the great introduction of Western culture and high technology as well. However, when Japan took over the country, they started to take control of the film industry by establishing film censorship regulations which prohibited to make scenes that might damage image of the Japanese Empire. And also, films that deterred war related objective or praised America were prohibited.
The film censorship laws such as the Motion Picture Censorship Regulation and the Chosun Motion Picture Law were introduced during the Colonial Period.

'''The Motion Picture Censorship Regulation includes:'''
# All foreign and domestic films needed for approval before screened
# Japanese police must attend at the time of screenings

'''The Chosun Motion Picture Law includes:'''
1)	Requirement to obtain license in the film industry
2)	Prior restraint of films
3)	Punishment for infractions of the law

The major reason for establishing such laws were to strengthen control of the public since such media were excellent vehicles to influence its viewers. They required filmmakers not to harm the image of the Japanese Empire nor praise their enemy in order to prevent any form of doubt on the Japanese dominance. They closed down several Korean film production companies and banned some of films that were disadvantageous to the Japanese Empire.

'''Major films influenced by censorship:'''
* ''Bloody Horse'' (1928) directed by Hong Kae-myung
* ''A Ferry Boat that No One Owns'' ([[Imjaeobtneun naleutbae]]) (1932) directed by Lee Kyu-hwan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreanfilm.org/history.html|title=Film censorship under Japanese rule|accessdate=2010-12-02 |work=Korean Film, march 1 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film censorship under the new military regime==
Film censorship had a tremendous impact on the South Korean film industry during the years between 1973 and 1992. Consequently, [[Cinema of Korea|Korean movies]] experienced its biggest hindrance which is now known to be the depression period. During this period, film censorship was strongly enforced under the military regime by Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan. They both realized that media was the most influential channel used at the time that affected how people viewed the government. Prior to 1987, the government enacted the First Motion Picture Law to take control of the film industry. This law did not allow the industry to freely produce the movie if the contents were not met to their criteria. President Park Chung Hee established the Motion Picture Promotion Corporation (MPPC) to support the film industry. However, Park’s main purpose was to safeguard antigovernment issues played in the movie more so than supporting the film industry.

'''Elements of MPPC:'''
1) License system
2) Import quotas to set a limitation on how many films to be produced
3) Strong censorship.
The filmmakers could only depict the positive side rather than negative side of Korean society, thus, the movies were not expressed the way they wanted which lead to poor results. The filmmakers continuously pushed the government to amend their censorship laws in order to promote freedom of expression, but the attempts were futile due to unyielding political influence and this was the main contribution to decline of South Korea’s film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cinema_journal/v042/42.1park.html|title=Elements of MPPC|accessdate=2010-12-01 |work=Cinema Journal, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past ==
The history of [[Cinema of Korea|Korean movies]] has lasted for over a hundred years, since the very first movie was played; but it hasn’t ever been free from government censorship. In 1907, the inspector general made the security law, which stated that anything that is performed in public can be regulated and controlled by the government. And when Korea was under Japanese rule, censorship was more strongly regulated than ever before. The [[Governor-General of Korea]] made an activity regulation committee in 1920 and performance regulation rules in 1922. In the movie ‘[[General's Son]],’ there is the scene of Japanese police sitting right next to the stage and arresting anyone who shows signs of propagandas to the public. Many movies were censored at this period of time. “Across the [[Tumen River]]” could be released after deletion of some scenes and changes of the name of the movie to “[[Salangeul chajaseo|To Find Love]].” “[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]” had been issued because [[the silent-firm]] narrator encouraged national consciousness.

In 1960, after the [[April Revolution]], the national movie ethic committee was founded which was the very first public organization that evaluated movies without government watch. As a result, “[[Obaltan|Aimless Bullet]]” and “A Coachman” that were about national consciousness could be played in the theatre. After the 5.16 military coup, a military government emerged and amended the constitution. The amendment stated that for public morals and social ethics, the government can censor movies or entertainment. After the amendment, “ Aimless bullet” was shut down at the theatre because one line in the movie says ‘Let’s go’ which they stated meant “Let’s go to the north.” During that time period, the anti-communism law allowed for the Central Intelligence Agency to arrest people, which they then used to arrest Man-hee lee, director of “Seven Women Prisoners ”. They stated that he described the North Korean Army as good and cool. They also released him under the condition that he had to make an [[anti-communism]] movie, which is why he made “Soldier Without Service Number” They arrested him again because he had cast a good looking guy for North Korean army. During this period of time, all the movies that were made also had to pass scenario censorship and after the movies were made. There was the other censorship, so all the movies had to pass two censorships from government. More than 80 percent of movies had to be revised before even filming the movie. For example, the movie ‘Fool’s March’ had many parts of the script had to be deleted even before the film was made. This led to a half hour of the film being deleted.

After South Korea opened the Olympics in 1988, it became possible to import the movies about [[communism]] and the censorship level for eroticism was loosened; but not many things had been changed. In September 1996, 10 minutes of the opening movie ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' from [[David Cronenberg]] was deleted, which led to great shame at the international movie festival. One month later, The Constitutional Court ruled that the censorship was unconstitutional. Following that rule, the movie laws had to be changed, and the Korea Media Rating Board was founded. They also made an additional rating level which was over R rating. It is reserved for movies that cannot be shown in regular movie theatres and can only be shown in designated unrated theaters which do not even exist in Korea. This means that movie makers have to delete the scenes in order for their films to receive an R rating. Even though the Korea Movie Rating Board does not have the power to regulate the scenes in the movies; they can imply that the movie makers need to censor the movies in order for the film to be shown.

== Present ==
In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia is disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also become an issue. South Korea has 5 different levels of rating systems; G, PG-12, PG-15, R-18 and Restricted Rate. These are ruled by the [[Decree|Presidential Decree]]. 
The first movie that was rated reservation rate was ‘[[Yellow Hair]].’ The fact that this movie got the reservation rate made more people watch this movie than usual. This movie was rejected in early 1999 before being rated an 18+ rate on its second application, after a sex scene between two women and one man was partially cut and digitally altered. The movie ‘[[Lies (film)|Lies]]’ sued the Movie Rating Board for reservation rating to [[the Constitutional Court]] and the Court ruled that the reservation rate was unconstitutional. They changed from the reservation rate to Restricted Rate. It didn’t make any difference than reservation rate because the Board made restricted rate movie theatres afterward; they all went to bankrupt or shut down. So basically the movies that received an R-rating lost their place to be shown. The movie “[[I Saw the Devil]] (2010)” could be shown at the theatre after deletion of one and half minutes of the movie.

The 2014 film, ''[[The Interview]]'' was banned in South Korea because it depicts of criticizing and killing of the North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]]. Although it was available in black markets, in 2015, a North Korean-defector sent unlicensed copies of the film via a helium balloon into the DMZ.

'''Fire performance''' is a group of [[performance arts]] or skills that involve the manipulation of [[fire]]. Fire performance typically involves equipment or other objects made with one or more [[Candle wick|wicks]] which are designed to sustain a large enough flame to create a visual effect.

Fire performance includes skills based on [[juggling]], [[baton twirling]], [[poi (performance art)|poi]] spinning, and other forms of [[object manipulation]]. It also includes skills such as [[fire breathing]], [[fire eating]], and body burning; sometimes called fakir skills.
Fire performance has various styles of performance including fire dancing; the use of fire as a finalé in an otherwise non-fire performance; and the use of fire skills as 'dangerous' stunts. Performances can be done as choreographed routines to music (this type being related to [[dance]] or [[rhythmic gymnastics]]); as freestyle (performed to music or not) performances; or performed with vocal interaction with the audience. Some aspect of fire performance can be found in a wide variety of cultural traditions and rituals from around the world.

Any performance involving fire carries inherent danger and risks, and [[fire safety]] precautions should always be taken.

==History==
Ancient [[Aztec]]s performed a fire dance dedicated to [[Xiuhtecuhtli]], the god of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jovinelly, Joann and Jason Netelkos|title=The crafts and culture of the Aztecs By|year=2003|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3512-3|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztec fire dance is performed today for tourists in Mexico. In [[Bali]], the Angel Dance and the Fire Dance, regularly performed for tourists, have origins in ancient rituals. Both the Angel Dance and the Fire Dance originated in a trance ritual called the ''sanghyang'', a ritual dance "performed to ward off witches at the time of an epidemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamashita|first=Shinji|title=Bali and beyond: explorations in the anthropology of tourism|year=2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-327-5|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the "horse dance" men perform the dance by holding rods representing horses, while leaping around burning coconut husks, and walking through the flames. [[French Polynesia]], [[Antigua]], [[Cuba]] and [[Saint Lucia]] are other locations where fire dances are recreated for tourists. The Siddha Jats of the [[Thar Desert]] in India perform traditional fire dances as part of the Spring festival. Fire dancing is performed to music played on drums and the behr. There are variations of the fire dancing; men often perform a dance that involves walking on hot coals.A large fire is created and allowed to burn down until it is a pit of glowing embers. The performers then jump in and out of the pit kicking up the embers to create showers of sparks while women perform a dance while balancing flaming tin pots on their heads. Today this ritual is often performed for tourists.
&lt;!-- Should there not be some reference to Polynesian fire dancing as well? --&gt;

Since the mid-1990s fire performance has grown in popularity. This growth has occurred both for hobby and professional practitioners. Fire skills are performed at [[rave party|raves]], nightclubs, beach parties, and music festivals. A festival that is popular with fire performers is at [[Burning Man]], where the fire skills are especially prevalent. Fire performance has become increasingly popular as entertainment at corporate events, street festivals, celebration events and as a precursor to firework displays.

==Types==

Fire performance has become more popular through the availability of a wider variety of fire equipment and teaching methods.

* Traditional fire shows: Traditional shows often incorporate Polynesian costuming and other cultural elements.  Many conform to the guidelines or are inspired by the annual World Fireknife Competition and Samoa Festival.  
* Modern fire shows: These shows vary greatly from performances choreographed to music to street style shows with varying levels of audience interaction and participation. Modern fire shows can use a very wide range of fire skills and props. See Pembrokeshire Fire Spinners. 
* Fire theatre: Such shows are theatrical shows which include fire and fire performance as elements of staged dramatic presentations.  Often the fire performance is a small element of the larger show.  These shows tend to use more elaborate props and costuming and can focus less on technical skill.
* Fire fetish show: Such shows are recognizable by more overt sexuality in the performance and often extremely risqué costuming, nudity, and implied or actual sexual contact between performers, and are often seen as a fusion between [[exotic dancing]] or [[American burlesque|burlesque]] with fire dancing.  Thus, fire fetish refers to a particular style of performance, and not a [[sexual fetish]] on the part of the performer, as would [[pyrophilia]].
* Erotic fire show: Such shows may be seen as simply a normal improvised fire dance but with emphasis on sexually arousing body gyrations, seductive facial expressions, an eroticised musical selection (such as [[R&amp;B]] or [[downtempo]] music), and minimal clothing of the performer, thus promoting sexual arousal or desire in addition to the expected visual entertainment for an audience. Unlike a fire fetish show, this performance is generally more low-key, slower in tempo, and may be performed by a solo dancer in front of a small and select audience, often a spouse or romantic partner. This performance can be an active and visually exciting form of ritual [[foreplay]]. However this type of show is  enticing to a select audience.
* Ritual fire show: Such shows are usually a fusion of [[pagan]] or [[occult]] ceremony with fire and fire performance.  They focus less on technical skill, and more on the use of the fire dancer to highlight the ritual or represent the specific element of fire.
* Fire and belly dance: Such shows are a fusion of Middle Eastern [[belly dancing]] (''raqs sharqi'') and combine elements of fire dancing and belly dancing.  Often the dancers use palm torches and fire swords made to resemble [[scimitar]]s.
* Fire comedy jugglers combine juggling, fire and comedy. This can include lighting parts of their body on fire.

==Fire apparatus==
Fire performance is usually performed with props that have specifically been made for the purpose. Fire [[torches]], fire staffs, fire poi, fire hula hoops, fire whips, and other fire props are all readily available.
*[[Poi (performance art)|Poi]] – A pair of roughly arm-length chains with handles attached to one end, and bundle of wicking material on the other.
*[[Fire staff|Staff]] – A metal or wooden tube ranging from 1–2 meters long with wicking material applied to one or both ends. Staffs are typically used individually or in pairs.   juggling three or more is also possible.
*[[Fire staff#Dragonstaff|Dragonstaff]] – A metal or wooden rube around 2 meters long where each end consists of three or more wicks arranged in a wheel. Dragon staves are more often rolled on the body rather than spun.
*[[Fire hoop]] – hoop with spokes and wicking material attached.
*[[Fire Fan|Fan]] – A large metal fan with one or more wicks attached to the edges.
*[[Fire umbrella]] – an umbrella-like performance prop that can be constructed in a variety of ways.
*[[Fire meteor]] – A long length of chain or rope with wicks, or small bowls of liquid fuel, attached to both ends.
*[[Freestyle nunchaku|Nunchaku]] – Nunchaku with wicking material, usually at either end.
*Batons
*[[Devil stick#Fire devil sticks|Fire stick]] – Like a traditional [[devil stick]], with wicks on both ends of the central stick.
*[[Torch (juggling)|Torch]] – A short club or torch, with a wick on one end, and swung like [[Indian club]]s or tossed end-over-end like [[juggling club]]s.
*[[Fire knife]] – Short stave with blade attached to the end and wicking material applied to the blade. Fire knives are the traditional [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] fire implement and have been in use since the 1940s.
*Fire [[rope dart]] – A wick, sometimes wrapped around a steel spike, at the end of a rope or chain ranging from 6–15 feet long, with a ring or other handle on the opposite end.
*Fire wand – a short metal rod, usually 28 inches long with two wicks on each end and a length of fire-resistant string threaded through the middle. The wand is balanced to stay upright and gives the appearance that it is levitating around the user. It is also known as a levitation wand, leviwand or flow wand.
*Fire sword – either a real sword modified for fire, or one specifically built for the purpose of fire shows.
*Chi ball/Fire orb – 2 rings or handles with a wick attached between them by a thin wire.
*Fire fingers – Short and thin torches attached to individual fingers.
*Palm torches – Small torches with a flat base meant to be held upright in the palm of the hand.
*Fire hip belt – A motorcycle chain belt with five spokes extending at equal intervals with wicking on the ends.
*Fire whip – Lengths of braided [[aramid]] fiber tapered to make a [[bullwhip]], usually with a metal handle about 12&amp;nbsp;inches long. The whip can be cracked to create large plumes of fire. 
*Fire flogger – A traditional [[BDSM]] flogger with kevlar or [[Technora]] tails. Can be used for both performance and [[temperature play]]
*Fire rope/snake – Similar to poi, but has a short 3–5 inch chain attaching the handles to a 12-inch or longer kevlar or Technora rope.
*Fire jump rope – A jump rope made of kevlar or Technora. 
*Fire cannon – a propane flame effect device; larger ones can shoot a pillar of fire up to 200+ feet in the air, although they usually are mounted to a base or vehicle.
*Fire poofer – Similar to fire cannons, but much smaller and made to be held, with fuel stored in a "backpack" fashioned of one or more propane tanks.
*Fire ball – Specially constructed juggling balls, either solid balls dipped in fuel and juggled with protective gloves, or ones designed to contain the flame in the centre of the ball.
*Wearable fire – Headdresses, hip belts, arm bands, or other garments made typically of metal with kevlar or Technora torches attached. Can be worn while fire dancing.

===Fuels===
Nearly all modern fire performance apparatus rely on a liquid fuel soaked in the wick. There are many choices for fuels, which differ in their specific properties. Fire performers select a fuel or a blend of fuels based on safety, cost, availability, and the desirability of various characteristics of the fuel including for example, the colour of flame, and flame temperature. There is also some geographic variance in fuels used, due local availability and price. Some American fire performers use [[white gas]] although most use other fuels due to its low [[flash point]], while British fire performers almost exclusively use [[kerosene]] (called "paraffin" in the UK). New Zealand performers often use Pegasol, which burns at a low heat, a bright colour and leaves little residue or smell.

=== Safety ===
Fire performance skills are inherently dangerous and only careful use of the props, storage of the fuel and performance in appropriate spaces will mean that the risks are minimised. Fire insurance policies all require fire performers to carry fire extinguishers, fire blankets or other fire safety equipment.

==Fire arts education==
There are organized events in various parts of the world teaching fire arts and object manipulation. These events which can be fire festivals or workshops at juggling or music festivals are popular in US, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.

[[Fox News]] (officially, Fox News Channel, FNC) is an [[United States|American]] [[cable television|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] channel.  During its time on the air, it has been the subject of numerous controversies and allegations.

==General==
Fox News has been alleged by academics, media figures, political figures, and watchdog groups of having [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[media bias|bias]] in their news coverage&lt;ref name="Collings2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Collings|title=Capturing the News: Three Decades of Reporting Crisis and Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqO_OifleVkC&amp;pg=PT166 |year=2010|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-7211-9|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=croft2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=fair2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=mediamatters2004/&gt; as well as perpetuating more general views of a [[Media bias in the United States#Conservative bias|conservative bias]].&lt;ref name=Goldberg2007/&gt; [[Fox News]] has publicly denied such charges,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/5b77af92-548c-11db-901f-0000779e2340.html Interview transcript: Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes], the [[Financial Times]], October 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the reporters in the newsroom provide separate, neutral reporting, while acknowledging their opinion programming is not intended to be neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/12/white-house-escalates-war-words-fox-news/ | work=Fox News | title=White House Escalates War of Words With Fox News | date=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, the allegations of bias have led to back and forth conflicts between Fox commentators and political&lt;ref name=Stelter2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR" /&gt; and media figures.&lt;ref name=hannitystuart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wemple2014/&gt; For example, in 2009 the Fox News Channel engaged in a verbal conflict with the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=Stelter2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR" /&gt;

===Political figures===
Former [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman [[Howard Dean]] has referred to Fox News as a "right-wing propaganda machine,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democrats.org/a/2006/09/dean_on_preside_3.php Dean On President Clinton Standing Up To Right-Wing Propaganda On Fox News Sunday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219003739/https://www.democrats.org/a/2006/09/dean_on_preside_3.php |date=December 19, 2006 }}, The Democratic Party, September 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politicians have boycotted events hosted or sponsored by the network.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/08/politics/main2546570.shtml Fox News Boss Hits Edwards' Boycott], [[CBS]] News, March 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2007/04/obama_to_nix_fo.html Obama to Nix Fox Debate], [[ABC News]]'s Political Radar, April 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, several major Democratic Party presidential candidates ([[Hillary Clinton]], [[John Edwards]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[Bill Richardson]]) boycotted or dropped out of [[Fox News]]-sponsored or {{hyphen}}hosted &lt;!-- YES, THAT HYPHEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WORD 'hosted'; PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE IT --&gt;debates,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2007/04/clinton_joins_b.html|title=Clinton Joins Boycott of Fox Debate|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; forcing their cancellation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Similar accusations have been levied against Fox News in response to its decision to exclude [[Ron Paul]] and [[Duncan Hunter]] from the January 5, 2008, Republican candidate debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/31/arts/TV-Debate-Limits.php |title=ABC, Fox News cutting low-polling presidential candidates out of debates - International Herald Tribune |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117002119/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/31/arts/TV-Debate-Limits.php |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, many individuals and organizations petitioned Fox News to reconsider its decision. When Fox refused to change its position and continued to exclude Paul and Hunter, the [[New Hampshire Republican State Committee|New Hampshire Republican Party]] officially announced it would withdraw as a Fox partner in the forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhgop.org/home/2008/1/5/nh-republican-party-withdraws-as-fox-forum-partner.html |title=NH REPUBLICAN PARTY WITHDRAWS AS FOX FORUM PARTNER |date=January 5, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107133937/http://www.nhgop.org/home/2008/1/5/nh-republican-party-withdraws-as-fox-forum-partner.html |archivedate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the network has been criticized for its tendency to support the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and its interests, [[David Frum]], former speechwriter for [[George W. Bush]], has also said, "Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we're discovering we work for Fox."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=ABC |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/nightlinedailyline/2010/03/david-frum-on-gop-now-we-work-for-fox.html |date=March 23, 2010 |title=David Frum on GOP: Now We Work for Fox |work=Nightline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media figures===
[[Larry King]] said in a January 17, 2007, interview with the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', "They're a Republican brand. They're an extension of the Republican Party with some exceptions, [like] [[Greta Van Susteren]]. But I don't begrudge them that. [Fox CEO] [[Roger Ailes]] is an old friend. They've been nice to me. They've said some very nice things about me. Not [Bill] O'Reilly, but I don't watch him."&lt;ref name=mediabistro2007&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/king_says_fox_news_is_a_republican_brand_but_theyve_been_nice_to_me_51252.asp King Says Fox News Is "A Republican Brand" (But "They've Been Nice To Me")] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127112811/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/king_says_fox_news_is_a_republican_brand_but_theyve_been_nice_to_me_51252.asp |date=January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Republican and conservative columnist [[Jonah Goldberg]] stated: "Look, I think liberals have reasonable gripes with Fox News. It does lean to the right, primarily in its opinion programming but also in its story selection (which is fine by me) and elsewhere. But it's worth remembering that Fox is less a bastion of ideological conservatism and more a populist, tabloid-like network."&lt;ref name=Goldberg2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/03/fox_john_edwards_and_the_two_a.html|title=RealClearPolitics - Articles - Fox, John Edwards and the Two Americas|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox News host [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] stated in 2004 in the context of the [[Iraq War]] that "Fox does tilt right", but that the network does not "actively campaign or try to help Bush-Cheney."&lt;ref&gt;''The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly'', July 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200407210007|title=O'Reilly: "FOX does tilt right"; said GOP "very uneasy with FOX" -- even after Cheney, Ralph Reed touted FOX|work=Media Matters for America|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media watchdogs===
[[Progressivism|Progressive]] [[Watchdog journalism|media watch dog]] groups such as [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR)&lt;ref name=fair2001&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1067 The Most Biased Name in News – Fox News Channel's extraordinary right-wing tilt], FAIR, July/August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Media Matters for America]],&lt;ref name=mediamatters2004&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/items/200407140002 33 internal FOX editorial memos reviewed by MMFA reveal FOX News Channel's inner workings], Media Matters, July 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that Fox News reporting contains conservative editorializing within news stories. FAIR has asserted that the ratio of conservative to non-conservative guests on Fox shows strongly favors conservatives. In a study of a 19-week period from January 2001 to May 2001 on ''[[Special Report with Brit Hume]]'' the ratio was 25:3, and FAIR obtained similar data from other Fox shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rendall|first1=Steve|title=Fox's Slanted Sources|url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/foxs-slanted-sources/|accessdate=April 25, 2015|work=Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting|date=July 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rendall|first1=Steve|title=Fox News–Wing of the GOP?|url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/fox-news-wing-of-the-gop/|accessdate=April 25, 2015 |work=Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Accuracy in Media]] has claimed that there was a [[conflict of interest]] in Fox News' co-sponsorship of the [[Republican Presidential Debates, 2008|May 15, 2007, Republican presidential candidates debate]], pointing out that candidate and former New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s law firm had tackled copyright protection and legislation on the purchase of cable TV lineups for [[News Corporation]], the parent company of Fox News, and suggesting that Fox might be biased in favor of Giuliani's candidacy for the Republican Party presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007May15/0,4670,D,00.html |title=Giuliani's Firm Lobbied Government – Republican Party – Democratic Party – Political Spectrum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305072234/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007May15/0,4670,D,00.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership and management==
Australian-born media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]] is the chairman and CEO of [[21st Century Fox]], the owner of Fox News Channel. He has been a subject of controversy and criticism as a result of his substantial influence in both the print and broadcast media. In the United States, he is the publisher of the ''[[New York Post]]'' newspaper and the magazine ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''. Accusations against him include the "[[dumbing down]]" of news and introducing "mindless vulgarity" in place of genuine [[journalism]], and having his own outlets produce news that serve his own political and financial agendas. According to the [[BBC]] website: "To some he is little less than the devil incarnate, to others, the most progressive mover-and-shaker in the media business."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2162658.stm Rupert Murdoch: Bigger than Kane] by Andrew Walker, [[BBC News]], July 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]]'s cousin, [[John Prescott Ellis]], was Fox News' projection team manager during the [[United States elections, 2000|general election of 2000]]. After speaking numerous times on election night with his cousins George and [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/12/tv.foxexecutive.ap/ Fox executive spoke five times with cousin Bush on Election Night] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627230023/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/12/tv.foxexecutive.ap/ |date=June 27, 2006 }}, [[CNN.com]], December 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis, at 2:16 AM, reversed Fox News' call for [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|Florida]] as a state won by [[Al Gore]]. Critics allege this was a premature decision, given the impossibly razor-thin margin (officially 537 of 5.9 million votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm|title=2000 Presidential General Election Results|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which created the "lasting impression that Bush 'won' the White House – and all the legal wrangling down in Florida is just a case of Democratic 'snippiness'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,399882,00.html Cousin John's calls tipped election tally] by Melinda Wittstock, [[The Guardian]], November 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as researcher [[John Lott]], have responded that, by this reasoning, Fox News and the other networks were even more premature in initially calling the state for ''Gore'', a call made while polls were still open, and which may have depressed voter turnout for Bush,&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnrlott.tripod.com/op-eds/MooresMyths.html Moore's Myths] by John R. Lott Jr. and Brian Blase, [[New York Post]], July 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; actually affecting the election, whereas the call for Bush later could not have, as the polls were closed by then.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On January 9, 2010, the son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch and the husband of Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, [[Matthew Freud]], stated he and other members of the media mogul's family are "ashamed and sickened" by the right leaning tendencies of Fox News in the opening salvo in a bid to displace [[Roger Ailes]], the founder and CEO of Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/business/media/10ailes.html] by David Carr, [[The New York Times]], January 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous Sunday New York Times news story featuring a profile on Roger Ailes, Freud was quoted saying "I am by no means alone within the family or the company in being ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes' horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalist standards that News Corporation, its founder and every other global media business aspires to, what you heard was a declaration of war, There are, practically speaking, now two factions inside of News Corp.: Ailes and Fox News, and the Murdoch children – with Rupert caught between them." Although Rupert Murdoch did not respond to the remark directly, a spokesperson for News Corporation put a statement after a Financial Times inquiry claiming "Matthew Freud's opinions are his own and in no way reflect the views of Rupert Murdoch, who is proud of Roger Ailes and Fox News."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/da191142-fe25-11de-9340-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1] by Andrew Edgecliffe, [[Financial Times]] January 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Arango]] also claims in Murdoch's 2008 biography that he voiced concerns privately to Ailes about his conduct claiming he was purportedly "embarrassed" by Fox News. Murdoch denied that claim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/books/23wolff.html?ex=1382500800&amp;en=874634841f6683f0&amp;ei=5124] by Tim Arango, [[New York Times]] October 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll conducted by [[Rasmussen Reports]] during September 2004 found that Fox News was seen as second to [[CBS]] as the most politically biased network in the public view. 37% of respondents thought [[CBS]], in the wake of the [[Killian documents controversy|Memogate scandal]], was trying to help elect [[John Kerry]], while 34% of respondents said they believed that Fox's goal was to "help elect Bush."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/Broadcast%20Bias.htm|title=Broadcast Bias|website=rasmussenreports.com|accessdate=August 6, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623052653/http://www.rasmussenreports.com/Broadcast%20Bias.htm|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a poll conducted by [[Public Policy Polling]] in January 2010 found Fox News to be the only US television news network to receive a positive rating by the public for trustworthiness with results strongly split depending on the political affiliation of the respondents &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_National_126.pdf Fox Most Trusted Name in News?] Public Policy Polling, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A survey by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press]] showed "a striking rise in the politicization of cable TV news audiences ... This pattern is most apparent with the fast-growing Fox News Channel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewresearch.org/assets/files/trends2005-media.pdf Trends 2005, Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506230321/http://pewresearch.org/assets/files/trends2005-media.pdf |date=May 6, 2006 }} Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2005. (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; Another Pew survey of news consumption found that Fox News has not suffered a decline in credibility with its audience, with one in four (25%) saying they believe all or most of what they see on Fox News Channel, virtually unchanged since Fox was first tested in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=1069 Online Papers Modestly Boost Newspaper Readership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928194356/http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=1069 |date=September 28, 2006 }} The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the results of a 2006 study by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] a survey of 547 journalists, found that Fox was rarely cited by surveyed journalists as an outlet taking an ideological stance in its coverage, and most identified as advocating [[American conservatism|conservative]] political positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State of the News Media 2006|url=http://assets.pewresearch.org.s3.amazonaws.com/files/journalism/State-of-the-News-Media-Report-2006-FINAL.pdf|website=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2004 survey, 69% of national journalists cited Fox News as being especially conservative in its coverage of news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey Findings – Press Going Too Easy on Bush|url=http://www.journalism.org/2004/03/13/survey-findings-press-going-too-easy-on-bush/|website=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=13 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies and reports===
The "2011 State of the News Media" Report by the Pew Center on Excellence in Journalism found that in 2010, Fox News Channel had average daytime audience of 1.2 million and nighttime viewership of 1.1 million, higher than its cable competitors but down 11% and 9% respectively from 2009. Fox's cumulative audience (unique viewers who watched at least 60 minutes in an average month) was 41.1 million, coming in second to CNN with 41.7 million. For 2010, CNN's digital network continued to lead Fox's digital network online; CNN with 35.7 million unique visitors per month, compared to Fox's 15.5 million.  For the first time Fox outspent its competitors, with a total news investment of $686 million. 72% of this investment went to program costs, reflecting their focus on high-profile hosts. They also increased their revenues 17% over 2009 to $1.5 billion, well ahead of second-place CNN at $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2011/overview-2/key-findings|title=» Key Findings|date=March 14, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2011/cable-essay/data-page-2|title=» Cable: By the Numbers |date=March 14, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Content analysis studies====
The Project on Excellence in Journalism report in 2006 showed that 68 percent of Fox cable stories contained personal opinions, as compared to MSNBC at 27 percent and CNN at 4 percent. The "content analysis" portion of their 2005 report also concluded that "Fox was measurably more one-sided than the other networks, and Fox journalists were more [[Opinion journalism|opinionated]] on the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2005/cable-tv-intro/content-analysis|title=» Content Analysis|date=January 10, 2005|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 University of California, Berkeley study cited that there was a correlation between the presence of the Fox News Channel in cable markets and increases in Republican votes in those markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DellaVigna, Stefano  |author2=Ethan Kaplan | title = The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting | version = March 30, 2006 | publisher = University of California, Berkeley |date=March 30, 2006 | url = http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/foxvote06-03-30.pdf#search=%22fox%20news%20studies%22 | format = PDF | accessdate = October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study found that with respect to coverage of the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|the first war in Afghanistan]] in 2005 found that "Fox News was much more sympathetic to the [Bush] administration than NBC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aday|first1=Sean|title=Chasing the Bad News: An Analysis of 2005 Iraq and Afghanistan War Coverage on NBC and Fox News Channel|journal=Journal of Communication|date=March 2010|volume=60|issue=1|pages=144–164|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01472.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Studies of reporting bias====
In a 2006 academic content analysis of election news, Rasmussen Reports showed that coverage at ABC, CBS, and NBC was more favorable toward Kerry than Bush, while coverage at Fox News Channel were more favorable toward Bush.&lt;ref name=Farnsworth&gt;Stephen Farnsworth and S. Robert Lichter, The Nightly News Nightmare: How Television Portrays Presidential Elections, Second Edition, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study of the news coverage of the 2004 political party conventions, Morris and Francia found that Fox news reporting was more negative toward the Democratic Convention and gave Republicans more opportunity to voice their message than the other networks. The study also found that viewers who relied on Fox news coverage exhibited attitude change toward both candidates, but particularly a lowering opinions toward John Kerry. In contrast the study found that CNN's coverage was more fair and balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cable News, Public Opinion, and the 2004 Party Conventions|author1=Jonathan S.

A study published in November 2005 by Tim Groseclose, a professor of [[political science]] at [[UCLA]], scoring political bias from twenty mainstream news reporting outlets, concluded that all "except Fox News' Special Report and the ''[[Washington Times]]'', received scores to the left of the average member of Congress." In particular, Fox News' ''[[Special Report with Brit Hume]]'' had an [[Americans for Democratic Action]] rating that was right of the political center. Groseclose's model used the number of times a host cited a particular [[think tank]] on his or her program and compared it with the number of times a member of the [[U.S. Congress]] cited a think tank, correlating that with the politician's Americans for Democratic Action rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=6664 Media Bias Is Real, Finds UCLA Political Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822210548/http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=6664 |date=August 22, 2007 }} December 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polisci.ucla.edu/faculty/groseclose/Media.Bias.pdf|title=A Measure of Media Bias |author1=Tim Groseclose |author2=Jeffery Milyo |website=ucla.edu|accessdate=August 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128014117/http://www.polisci.ucla.edu/faculty/groseclose/Media.Bias.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoff Nunberg]], a professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley and a [[National Public Radio]] commentator, criticized the methodology of the study and labeled its conclusions invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Nunberg]], [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001169.html "'Liberal Bias', Noch Einmal"]. ''[[Language Log]]'', July 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed to what he saw as a Groseclose's reliance on interpretations of facts and data that were taken from sources that were not, in his view, credible. Groseclose and Professor [[Jeffrey Milyo|Jeff Milyo]] rebutted, saying Nunberg "shows a gross misunderstanding [of] our statistical method and the actual assumptions upon which it relies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Liberman]], [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001301.html "Groseclose and Milyo respond"]. ''[[Language Log]]'', August 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Liberman (a professor of Computer Science and the director of Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania), who helped post Groseclose and Milyo's rebuttal, later posted how the statistical methods used to calculate this bias pose faults.&lt;ref name="Multiplying ideologies"&gt;{{cite web| last = Liberman| first = Mark| title = Multiplying ideologies considered harmful| publisher = Language Log|date=December 23, 2005| url = http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002724.html| accessdate = November 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Liberman| first = Mark| title = Linguistics, politics, mathematics| publisher = Language Log|date=December 22, 2005 |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002723.html| accessdate = November 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark concluded "that many if not most of the complaints directed against G&amp;M are motivated in part by ideological disagreement — just as much of the praise for their work is motivated by ideological agreement. It would be nice if there were a less politically fraught body of data on which such modeling exercises could be explored."&lt;ref name="Multiplying ideologies" /&gt;

A December 2007 study/examination by [[Samuel Robert Lichter|Robert Lichter]] of a self-described [[nonpartisan]] media watchdog group, the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]] found that Fox News's evaluations of all of the [[Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential candidates]] combined was 51% positive and 49% negative, while the network's evaluations of the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2008|Republican presidential candidates]] 51% negative and 49% positive. The study, however, did find that Fox's coverage was less negative toward Republican candidates than the coverage of broadcast networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpa.com/releases/07_12_21_Election_Study.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=April 5, 2013|website=archive.org|accessdate=August 6, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405140257/http://www.cmpa.com/releases/07_12_21_Election_Study.pdf|archivedate=April 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by [[Media Matters for America]] found that between August 1 and October 1, 2013, on Fox News "69 percent of guests and 75 percent of mentions cast doubt on [[Climatology|climate science]]," compared to "[half] of those quoted in ''The Wall Street Journal'' ... about 29 percent in The ''Los Angeles Times'', about 17 percent in the ''Washington Post'' and about 12 percent in Bloomberg News."&lt;ref name=Greenberg2013&gt;Max Greenberg, Denise Robbins, and Shauna Theel, "[http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/10/10/study-media-sowed-doubt-in-coverage-of-un-clima/196387STUDY: Media Sowed Doubt In Coverage Of UN Climate Report]", October 10, 2013, Media Matters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2013&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuccitelli |first=Dana |title=Conservative media outlets found guilty of biased global warming coverage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/11/climate-change-political-media-ipcc-coverage|newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News' argument against criticism that it disproportionately represents the views of [[Climate change denial|climate change deniers]] was to itself deny the factual figures which indicate that 97% of climate science experts worldwide hold the consensus view of [[Global warming controversy|human-caused global warming]].&lt;ref name=Nuccitelli2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Nuccitelli |first=Dana |title=Fox News defends global warming false balance by denying the 97% consensus|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/23/climate-change-climate-change-scepticism|newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 report by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] found that 93% of [[global warming]] coverage by Fox News was misleading. The report put the figure slightly lower—81 percent—for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. The misleading statements identified in the report included "... dismissals of human-caused climate change, disparaging comments about individual scientists, rejections of climate science as a body of knowledge, and [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] of data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/global_warming/Is-News-Corp-Failing-Science.pdf | title=Is News Corp.

Croft concluded that Fox News coverage glorified the [[Iraq War]] and its reporting framed the discussion in such a way as to drown out critics.&lt;ref name=croft2006/&gt; He quotes [[Christiane Amanpour]] as stating that there was a culture of self-censorship created by "the administration and its foot soldiers at ''Fox News''".&lt;ref name=croft2006&gt;{{cite book | author = Croft, Stuart | title = Culture, Crisis and America's War on Terror | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year=2006 | isbn=9780521687331|pages=190–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2017 study conducted by [[Harvard University]]'s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency|first 100 days]] in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Cox | first1=Jeff | title=Trump Press Coverage 'Sets New Standard' for Negativity: Study | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/19/trump-press-coverage-sets-new-standard-for-negativity-study.html | date=May 19, 2017 | publisher=[[CNBC]] | accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that, altogether, Trump received 80% negative coverage from the media, and that he received the least negative coverage on Fox – 52% negative and 48% positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Richardson | first1=Valerie | title=Harvard Agrees: Trump Press Coverage Sets 'New Standard for Negativity' | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/19/study-trump-press-coverage-new-standard-negativity/ | date=May 19, 2017 | publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]'' | accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tests of knowledge of Fox viewers====
A study by the [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] (PIPA) at the [[University of Maryland]] School of Public Affairs, as published in the Winter 03–04 issue of the ''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'',&lt;ref name="Study1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kull |first1=Steven |last2=Ramsay |first2=Clay |last3=Lewis |first3=Evan |year=2003 |title=Misperceptions, the Media, and the Iraq War |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=569–598 |publisher=The Academy of Political Science |doi=10.1002/j.1538-165x.2003.tb00406.x |url=http://www.psqonline.org/99_article.php3?byear=2003&amp;bmonth=winter&amp;a=02free |accessdate=July 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727191435/http://www.psqonline.org/99_article.php3?byear=2003&amp;bmonth=winter&amp;a=02free |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that poll-based findings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Iraq/IraqMedia_Oct03/IraqMedia_Oct03_rpt.pdf PIPA / Knowledge Networks Poll] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210232719/http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Iraq/IraqMedia_Oct03/IraqMedia_Oct03_rpt.pdf |date=February 10, 2006 }} Misperceptions, the Media, and the Iraq War. [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that viewers of Fox News, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] and local Fox affiliates were more likely than viewers of other news networks to hold three misperceptions:&lt;ref name="Study1" /&gt;

* 67% of Fox viewers erroneously believed that the "U.S. has found clear evidence in Iraq that Saddam Hussein [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda|was working closely with the al Qaeda terrorist organization]]" (compared with 56% for CBS, 49% for NBC, 48% for CNN, 45% for ABC, 16% for NPR/PBS).
* The erroneous belief that "The U.S. has found [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq]]" was held by 33% of Fox viewers and only 23% of CBS viewers, 19% for ABC, 20% for NBC, 20% for CNN and 11% for NPR/PBS.
* 35% of Fox viewers erroneously believed that "the majority of people [in the world] [[Views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq|favor the U.S. having gone to war]]" with Iraq (compared with 28% for CBS, 27% for ABC, 24% for CNN, 20% for NBC, 5% for NPR/PBS).

In response, Fox News frequent guest [[Ann Coulter]] characterized the PIPA findings as "misperceptions of pointless liberal factoids" and called it a "hoax poll".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/anncoulter/2004/05/13/11680.html Crazy-Like-A-Fox News Viewer] by [[Ann Coulter]], ''Townhall'', May 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] called the study "absolute crap".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', February 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ailes]] referred to the study as "an old [[push poll]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110005157 Elite, Arrogant, Condescending] by [[Roger Ailes]], ''OpinionJournal.com'', June 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Taranto]], editor of OpinionJournal.com, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s online editorial page, called the poll "pure propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110004127#fox Best of the Web Today] [[James Taranto]]. OpinionJournal, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. October 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; PIPA issued a clarification on October 17, 2003, stating that "The findings were not meant to and cannot be used as a basis for making broad judgments about the general accuracy of the reporting of various networks or the general accuracy of the beliefs of those who get their news from those networks. Only a substantially more comprehensive study could undertake such broad research questions," and stated "that the correlation between viewing Fox News and holding misperceptions does not prove that Fox News' presentation caused the misperceptions", inferring that [[Correlation does not imply causation|causality is not necessary to prove correlation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110005065 Best of the Web Today] [[James Taranto]].

A 2007 Pew Research Center poll of general political knowledge ("Who is the governor of your state?", "Who is the President of Russia?") indicated that Fox News Channel viewers scored 35% in the high-knowledge area, the same as the national average. This was not significantly different than local news, network news and morning news, and was slightly lower than CNN (41%). Viewers of ''The O'Reilly Factor'' (51%) scored in the high category along with [[Rush Limbaugh]] (50%), [[NPR]] (51%), major newspapers (54%), ''[[Newshour with Jim Lehrer]]'' (53%) ''[[The Daily Show]]'' (54%) and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (54%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/319/public-knowledge-of-current-affairs-little-changed-by-news-and-information-revolutions|title=Public Knowledge of Current Affairs Little Changed by News and Information Revolutions|date=April 15, 2007|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 Stanford University survey found "more exposure to Fox News was associated with more rejection of many mainstream scientists' claims about [[global warming]], [and] with [[Antiscience|less trust in scientists]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woods.stanford.edu/docs/surveys/Global-Warming-Fox-News.pdf|title=Public Opinion Research|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Kaiser Family Foundation survey on U.S. misperceptions about [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] found that Fox News viewers had a poorer understanding of the new laws and were more likely to believe in falsehoods about the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] such as cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits and the [[death panel myth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8148.pdf|title=Pop Quiz: Assessing Americans' Familiarity With the Health Care Law - The Henry J.

In 2011, a study by [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] found that New Jersey Fox News viewers were less well informed than people who did not watch any news at all. The study employed objective questions, such as whether [[Hosni Mubarak]] was still in power in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =

==Internal memos and e-mail{{anchor|Internal_memos_and_e-mails}}==

===Daily memos===
Fox News Channel executives exert a degree of editorial control over the content of the network's daily reporting. The channel's Vice President of News, [[John Moody (journalist)|John Moody]], controls content by writing memos to the news department staff. In the documentary ''[[Outfoxed]]'', former Fox News employees talk about the inner workings of the channel. In memos from the documentary, Moody instructs employees how to approach particular stories and on what stories to approach. Critics of Fox News claim that the instructions on many of the memos indicate a conservative bias. ''The Washington Post'' quoted Larry Johnson, a former part-time Fox News commentator, describing the Moody memos as "talking points instructing us what the themes are supposed to be, and God help you if you stray."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200407140002|title=33 internal FOX editorial memos reviewed by MMFA reveal FOX News Channel's inner workings|accessdate=January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Fox News producer Charlie Reina explained, "The roots of Fox News Channel's day-to-day on-air bias are actual and direct. They come in the form of an executive memo distributed electronically each morning, addressing what stories will be covered and, often, suggesting how they should be covered. To the newsroom personnel responsible for the channel's daytime programming, The Memo is the Bible. If, on any given day, you notice that the Fox anchors seem to be trying to drive a particular point home, you can bet The Memo is behind it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCommentary.asp?Page=\Commentary\archive\200311\COM20031107b.html Journalism 101] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424073936/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCommentary.asp?Page=%5CCommentary%5Carchive%5C200311%5CCOM20031107b.html |date=April 24, 2008 }} by Rich Tucker, [[CNSNews.com]], November 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Fox_News], ''Source Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

Photocopied memos from John Moody instructed the network's on-air anchors and reporters to use positive language when discussing [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] viewpoints, the [[Iraq War]], and [[tax cut]]s, as well as requesting that the [[Abu Ghraib]] prisoner abuse scandal be put in context with the other violence in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/items/200407140002 33 internal FOX editorial memos reviewed by MMFA reveal FOX News Channel's inner workings], [[Media Matters for America]], July 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Such memos were reproduced for the film ''Outfoxed'', which included Moody quotes such as, "The soldiers [seen on Fox in [[Iraq]]] in the foreground should be identified as '[[sharpshooters]],' not '[[sniper]]s,' which carries a negative [[connotation]]." {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Two days after the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 election]], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported that its news department had acquired a copy of a leaked internal memo from Mr. Moody that recommended the following: "... [L]et's be on the lookout for any statements from the Iraqi insurgents, who must be thrilled at the prospect of a Dem-controlled congress." Within hours of the memo's publication, Fox News anchor [[Martha McCallum]], went on-air on the program ''[[The Live Desk (U.S. TV program)|The Live Desk]]'' with reports of Iraqi insurgents cheering the firing of [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and the results of the 2006 congressional election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/11/14/fox-news-internal-memo-_n_34128.html|title=FOX NEWS INTERNAL MEMO: "Be On The Lookout For Any Statements From The Iraqi Insurgents ...

===Bill Sammon e-mail===
In December 2010, [[Media Matters for America]] released a leaked October 2009 e-mail between Fox News Washington managing editor [[Bill Sammon]] and the network's senior producers, which seemed to issue directives slanting Fox News' coverage of President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[health care reform]] efforts. In the e-mail, Sammon instructed producers to not use the phrase "[[public option]]" when discussing a key measure of President Obama's reform bill, and instead use the terms "government option" or "government-run health insurance[,]" noting negative connotations; Sammon also suggested that the qualifier "so-called" be said before any proper mention of the public option. Another e-mail by Fox News senior vice president Michael Clemente accepted Sammon's conditions. Critics claimed that Sammon took advice from Republican pollster [[Frank Luntz]], who appeared on ''[[Hannity]]'' shortly before the e-mail was written and made the same suggestions in identifying the public option. Critics also noticed that reporters and panelists on ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'' used the term "public option" before the e-mail was sent, but used the term "government option" immediately afterwards. Sammon, in an interview with [[Howard Kurtz]] for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', defended the directive and denied he was trying to skew Fox News' coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Mirkinson: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/fox-news-public-option-gop_n_794297.html ''Fox News Boss Ordered Staffers To Echo GOP Talking Point About Public Option In Health Care Coverage'']. Website of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' on December 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, Media Matters released an e-mail by Sammon from December 2009, in which he pressured Fox News reporters to assert that "theories are based upon data that critics have called into question" in light of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Farhi: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/15/AR2010121503181.html ''Liberal media watchdog: Fox News e-mail shows network's slant on climate change''].

==English Wikipedia edits==
In August 2007, a new utility, [[WikiScanner]], revealed that [[English Wikipedia]] articles relating to Fox News had been edited from [[IP address]]es owned by Fox News,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', Technology News, Bobbie Johnson (August 15, 2007) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/aug/15/wikipedia.corporateaccountability "Companies and party aides cast censorious eye over Wikipedia"]&lt;/ref&gt; though it was not possible to determine exactly who the editors were. The tool showed that the article for [[Shepard Smith]] was edited from Fox computers, removing mention of an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the edition of July 2, 2008 of ''[[Fox and Friends]]'', co-hosts [[Brian Kilmeade]] and [[Steve Doocy]] aired photos of ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Jacques Steinberg]] and ''Times'' television editor [[Steven Reddicliffe]] that appeared to have been crudely doctored, apparently in order to portray the journalists unflatteringly. This occurred during a discussion of a piece in the edition of June 28 of ''The New York Times'', which pointed out what Steinberg called "ominous trends" in Fox News' ratings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Strupp and Mitchell{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]], the photos depict ''New York Times'' reporter Jacques Steinberg with yellowed teeth, "his nose and chin widened, and his ears made to protrude further." The other image, of Times television editor Steven Reddicliffe, had similar yellow teeth, as well as "dark circles ... under his eyes, and his hairline has been moved back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200807020002?f=h_top|title=KHOW's Silverman uncritically allowed Tancredo to repeat misleading statements on immigrant assimilation|work=Media Matters for America|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the discussion, Doocy called the ''Times'' report, written by Steinberg, a "hit piece" ordered up by Reddicliffe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; The broadcast then showed an image of Steinberg's face superimposed over a picture of a [[poodle]], while Reddicliffe's face was superimposed over the man holding the poodle's leash.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

''Times'' culture editor [[Sam Sifton]] called the photo that was aired on Fox "disgusting," and the criticism of the paper's reporting a "specious and meritless claim" while denying that it was a "hit piece."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

== 9/12 newspaper ad controversy ==
On September 18, 2009, Fox News Channel took out full-page ads in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' with a prominent caption reading, "How did ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN miss this story?" with pictures of a [[Tea Party movement]] protest on the [[United States Capitol]] lawn. A still picture in the ad was in fact taken from a CNN broadcast covering the event. The veracity of this ad was called into question on the air by then-CNN commentator [[Rick Sanchez]], along with others pointing to various coverage of the event.&lt;ref name="politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/18/networks-respond-to-false-fox-ad/ | work=CNN | title=Networks respond to false Fox ad | accessdate=May 2, 2010 | date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calderone |first=Michael |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0909/WaPo_defends_running_Fox_ad.html |title=WaPo defends running Fox ad |publisher=Politico.Com |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediabistro.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/in_full_page_ad_fox_asks_where_were_other_media_on_912_the_answer_they_were_there_136133.asp | title=In Full Page Ad, Fox Asks Where Were Other Media on 9/12.

Fox News' vice president of marketing, Michael Tammero, responded, "it's fair to say that from the tea party movement ... to [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|ACORN]] ... to the march on 9/12, the networks either ignored the story, marginalized it or misrepresented the significance of it altogether."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/18/AR2009091801102.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | title=Fox News Ad Draws Protests | date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obama administration conflict with Fox News==
In September 2009, the [[Obama administration]] engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, 2009, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] appeared on all the major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about the President by commentators [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Sean Hannity]] and general coverage by Fox with regard to Obama's [[Affordable Care Act|health care proposal]].&lt;ref name=Stelter2009&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Fox's Volley With Obama Intensifying|first=Brian|last=Stelter|date=October 12, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt; ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' host [[Chris Wallace]] called White House administration officials "crybabies" in response. Following this, a senior Obama adviser told ''[[U.S. News]]'' that the White House would never get a fair shake from Fox News.&lt;ref name="USNWR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Kenneth T.|title=White House: Fox Pushed Team Obama Over the Brink|accessdate=July 25, 2013|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/obama/articles/2009/10/23/fox-pushed-team-obama-over-the-brink|newspaper=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|date=October 23, 2009|location=Washington, DC|page=23|quote=A senior Obama adviser tells U.S. News that White House staffers developed 'a growing realization' that the president would never get a fair shake from Fox.

In late September 2009, Obama senior advisor [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] and [[Roger Ailes]] met in secret to try to smooth out tensions between the two camps without much success. Two weeks later, White House officials referred to FNC as "not a news network". Communications director [[Anita Dunn]] claimed that "Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/10/23/the-fox-news-war-whats-the-upside-for-obama|title=The Fox News war: What's the upside for Obama?|publisher=CSMonitor.com|date = 2009-10-23|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html?_r=1| work=The New York Times|title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama followed with "If media is operating basically as a [[talk radio]] format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/23/eveningnews/main5415921.shtml?tag=stack|title=President Obama's Feud with FOX News|publisher=CBS News|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then-White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] stated that it was important "to not have the CNN's and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rutten24-2009oct24,0,3009088.column|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Obama's misguided Fox hunt|date=October 24, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official [[Ken Feinberg]], with bureau chiefs from the White House Pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to the defense of Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html|work=The New York Times | title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox | first=Jim | last=Rutenberg | date=October 23, 2009 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major bureau chiefs stated, "If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Bellantoni |date=October 23, 2009|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/wh-were-happy-to-exclude-fox-but-didnt-yesterday-with-feinberg-interview.php |title=WH: We're Happy To Exclude Fox, But Didn't Yesterday With Feinberg Interview &amp;#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this story broke the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, but said that Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent [[Major Garrett]] responded by stating that he had not made a specific request, but that he had a "standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Facebook User says: |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/finally-resolved-major-garrett-reveals-his-side-of-pay-czar-gate/ |title=Finally Resolved?

On November 8, 2009 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, [[Anita Dunn]] claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who "deal with TV issues" and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid Fox. [[Patrick Caddell]], a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President [[Jimmy Carter]] said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-fox8-2009nov08,0,507227.story?test=latestnews | work=Los Angeles Times |title=Democratic consultant says he got a warning from White House after appearing on Fox News | first=Peter | last=Nicholas | date=November 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video footage manipulation==
[[Jon Stewart]] reported on his November 11, 2009, broadcast of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' that Fox News pundit [[Sean Hannity]] misrepresented video footage purportedly showing large crowds on a health-care protest orchestrated by Rep. [[Michele Bachmann]]. Stewart showed inconsistencies in alternating shots according to the color of the sky and tree leaves, showing that footage from [[Glenn Beck]]'s much larger [[Taxpayer March on Washington|9/12 rally]], which had occurred two months earlier, and been spliced in with the other shots. Hannity estimated 20,000 protesters were in attendance, the [[Washington Post]] estimated 10,000, and [[Luke Russert]] reported that three [[Capitol Hill]] police officers guessed "about 4,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20091111/ts_ynews/ynews_ts977|title=Did Fox News alter footage of a conservative rally?|publisher=News.yahoo.com|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/11/05/2120383.aspx|title=First Read – Scenes from the 'Super Bowl'|publisher=msn.com|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223050224/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/11/05/2120383.aspx|archivedate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Hannity apologized to his viewers for the error during his November 11, 2009 broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Silva, [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-hannity-crowd13-2009nov13,0,157713.story Hannity apologizes for using video of bigger rally], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart periodically accused Fox of playing video footage out of context, such as when Hannity played footage of Obama stating the [[DREAM Act]] could not be passed by executive order to make the president seem [[hypocritical]] although when the footage is continued Obama goes on to clarify that the president does have the authority to halt deportations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart Calls Out Fox News Over Obama Tape Edit (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/jon-stewart-fox-news-obama-tape-edit_n_1611735.html|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Rebecca|last=Shapiro|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2009, Fox News anchor [[Gregg Jarrett]] told viewers that a [[Sarah Palin]] book signing in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], had a massive turnout while showing footage of Palin with a large crowd. Jarrett noted that the former Republican vice-presidential candidate is "continuing to draw huge crowds while she's promoting her brand-new book", adding that the images being shown were "some of the pictures just coming in to us ...

Fox senior vice-president of news Michael Clemente issued an initial statement saying, "This was a production error in which the copy editor changed a script and didn't alert the control room to update the video."&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt; Fox offered an on-air apology the following day during the same "Happening Now" segment citing regrets for what they described as a "video error" with no intent to mislead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.foxnews.com/11739702/for-that-we-apologize/?category_id=949437d0db05ed5f5b9954dc049d70b0c12f2749|title=For That We Apologize|author=FoxNews|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=November 21, 2009|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Fox News anchor [[Sean Hannity]] was criticized notably by Stewart and CNN anchor [[Howard Kurtz]], for selectively editing a video of an Obama speech on his program. Before playing the clip, Hannity remarked that there was a "rare moment of honesty" in Obama's speech, playing a video of Obama saying:{{quote|Taxes are scheduled to go up substantially next year, for everybody.}}

It quickly cuts back to Hannity, with Hannity saying, "I know the anointed one will make sure that happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2010/09/kurtz-calls-hannity-deceptive-editing/|title=CNN host calls out Sean Hannity for 'deceptive' video editing|date=September 12, 2010|author1=Webster, Stephen  |author2=Edwards, David|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But upon further inspection, what President Obama fully said was:{{quote|Under the tax plan passed by the last administration, taxes are scheduled to go up substantially next year, for everybody.}}

==ISIL video==
After Jordanian Air Force pilot [[Muath al-Kasasbeh]] was burned to death by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in February 2015, Fox included the full ISIL video on its website. The network said it had chosen to do so, after careful consideration, in order that readers of their website could "see for themselves the barbarity of ISIS." [[Malcolm Nance]], executive director of the [[think tank]] TAPSTRI (the Terror Asymmetrics Project on Strategy, Tactics and Radical Ideology), said that Fox News was "literally — ''literally'' — working for [[Al-Qaeda|al-Qaida]] and Isis's media arm ...

On July 6, 2016, [[Gretchen Carlson]] filed a [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit against Fox News chairman [[Roger Ailes]] in the [[Superior Court of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="PoliticoFiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/07/gretchen-carlson-files-lawsuit-against-roger-ailes-alleging-sexual-harassment-225162|title=Gretchen Carlson files sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News CEO Roger Ailes|date=July 6, 2016|work=Politico|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her complaint, Carlson alleged that she was fired from her program for refusing Ailes' sexual advances.&lt;ref name="PoliticoFiles"/&gt; After Carlson came forward, six more women spoke to [[Gabriel Sherman]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, alleging that Ailes had sexually harassed them and that Ailes had "spoke openly of expecting women to perform sexual favors in exchange for job opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/six-more-women-allege-ailes-sexual-harassment.html|title=6 More Women Allege That Roger Ailes Sexually Harassed Them|access-date=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York'' reported that [[Megyn Kelly]] told investigators Ailes made "unwanted sexual advances toward her" at the start of her career.

In August 2016, [[Andrea Tantaros]], who had been pulled from the network in April with reported "contract issues,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2016/04/29/fox_news_host_andrea_tantaros_quietly_pulled_from_daytime_show_over_contract_issues/ | title=Fox News host Andrea Tantaros quietly pulled from daytime show over contract "issues" | publisher=Salon | website=salon.com | first=Brendan | last=Gauthier | accessdate=May 16, 2016 | date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that she approached Fox News executives about Ailes sexually harassing her in 2015.

In April 2017, ''The New York Times'' reported that O'Reilly and Fox News had [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)#April 2017|settled five lawsuits]] against O'Reilly dating back to 2002, in addition to publicly acknowledged settlements to Andrea Mackris in 2004 and [[Juliet Huddy]] in 2017 were publicly reported; ''The Times'' reported that Fox hosts [[Rebecca Diamond]] and [[Laurie Dhue]] settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O'Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. ''The Times'' also reported a claim by former ''O'Reilly Factor'' guest [[Wendy Walsh]], who declined an offer from O'Reilly to go to his hotel suite and was subsequently denied a job as a Fox News contributor.&lt;ref name="nyt-settlements"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html|title=Bill O'Reilly Thrives at Fox News, Even as Harassment Settlements Add Up|last=Steel|first=Emily|date=April 1, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 2, 2017|last2=Schmidt|first2=Michael S.|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21st Century Fox hired the law firm of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]] to conduct an investigation into Walsh's allegation; that firm also conducted an investigation into the allegations against Ailes.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Steel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/business/media/fox-bill-oreilly-harassment-claim.html Fox Asks Law Firm to Investigate Bill O'Reilly Harassment Claim],''New York Times'' (April 9, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Fox Business suspended [[Charles Payne (journalist)|Charles Payne]] pending an investigation after a former network guest, [[Scottie Nell Hughes]], accused him of [[sexual harassment]]. Payne denied the harassment charge but acknowledged having had a three-year-long "romantic relationship" with Hughes before the accusation was made.

===Women's health care===
In 2013, Fox's daily morning show ''Fox &amp; Friends'' featured a segment in which contributor Dr. [[David B. Samadi]] made an appearance to discuss the cost of women's health care. In the program, Samadi argued that insurance costs more for women due to their more frequent use of health services, as opposed to men: "I just think that the whole system is not working well. I mean this is one of the examples, where men and women are totally different, there is a sex difference when it comes to the health care use, but I really think that if you pay for it, you are going to negotiate, finding out where is the best doctor, where you're going to get a better deal on all these X-rays etc., that's how you're gonna save money."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/08/27/david_samadi_and_fox_and_friends_fret_that_women_are_getting_too_much_health.html |title=Fox News Worries That Women Are Taking Up Too Much Health Care |author=Amanda Marcotte |publisher=Slate |date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this segment, Fox received criticism from several online outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828212907/http://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/fox-s-sexist-comments-on-women-s-healthcare-spark-outrage-172914267.html |title=Fox News Contributor's 'Sexist' Comments on Women's Health Care Spark Outrage |author=Beth Greenfield |publisher=Yahoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sean Hannity and Michael Cohen==

On April 9, 2018, federal agents from the [[U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney's office]] served a search warrant on the office and residence of  [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], Trump's personal attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Strobel |first1=Warren |last2=Walcott |first2=John |title=FBI raids offices, home of Trump's personal lawyer: sources |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohen-raid/fbi-raids-offices-home-of-trumps-personal-lawyer-sources-idUSKBN1HG336 |website=Reuters |accessdate=April 10, 2018 |date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the air, Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action, calling it "highly questionable" and "an unprecedented abuse of power".&lt;ref name = Winter&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-wants-review-some-materials-seized-cohen-fbi-raid-n866226|title=Fox News host Sean Hannity revealed as Michael Cohen's mystery client|last1=Winter|first1=Tom|last2=Edelman|first2=Adam|date=April 16, 2018|work=NBC News|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2018 in a court hearing, Cohen's lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in 2017-2018 but did "traditional legal tasks" for only three: Trump, [[Elliott Broidy]], and a "prominent person" who did not wish to be named for fear of being "embarrassed".&lt;ref name = Miller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierson|first1=Brendan|last2=Freifeld|first2=Karen|last3=Stempel|first3=Jonathan|title=Fox's Hannity revealed as mystery client of Trump's personal lawyer|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cohen/foxs-hannity-revealed-as-mystery-client-of-trumps-personal-lawyer-idUSKBN1HN12G|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feuer|first1=Alan|last2=Grynbaum|first2=Michael|last3=Koblin|first3=John|title=Sean Hannity Is Named as Client of Michael Cohen, Trump's Lawyer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/business/media/sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client, whom Cohen's lawyers named as Hannity.&lt;ref name = Miller/&gt; Although Hannity has covered Cohen on his show, he did not disclose that he had consulted with Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2018/04/fox-news-sean-hannity-downplay-michael-cohen-relationship/|title=Fox News and Sean Hannity Downplay Host's Relationship With Attorney Michael Cohen|last=Richardson|first=Davis|date=April 16, 2018|work=The Observer|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox News released a statement on April 16, 2018 attributed to Hannity: "Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.

The following day, news reports revealed that Hannity had shared another lawyer with Trump, [[Jay Sekulow]].

* [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]], which has since announced a campaign of "guerrilla warfare and sabotage"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51949.html|title=Media Matters' war against Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Fox, contends that Fox specializes in "political sabotage" by putting up moderate-to-conservative "Democrats" as token liberals against more staunchly conservative Republicans. It cites the following people as examples of this:
** [[Pat Caddell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200409160005|title=Who is Pat Caddell?}}, Media Matters for America, September 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; – called the Democratic party a "confederacy of [[gangster]]s" and defended conservative writer [[Ann Coulter]] when she said she could not talk about former Senator and presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] if a homophobic epithet she used was off-limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,256949,00.html |title=Ann Coulter Defends Edwards Comments |work=Fox News |date=March 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824151924/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,256949,00.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed by Democratic governor, [[Roy Barnes]], to a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat following the death of Republican Sen. [[Paul Coverdell]] in July 2000. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Another allegation of Fox's critics is that it sometimes ridicules protesters, especially ones for liberal causes. For example, during the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Bill O'Reilly referred to some of the protesters as "terrorists" (though he added, "most protesters are peaceful").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/conventions/chi-0409030248sep03,1,6976681.story?coll=chi-navrailnews-nav&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true

* [[Swedish Iranians|Iranian-Swedish]] newspaper commentator, author and legal professional Behrang Kianzad &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaOukq1wGbE|title = SVT Debatt, Autumn 2015|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in the [[Expressen]] newspaper that "there are lies, damned lies and Fox News",&lt;ref name="revirosengard"&gt;[http://expressen.se/index.jsp?a=214197 Expressen: Räven går i Rosengård] Behrang Kianzad&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a Fox News story about allegedly [[Muslim]] violence in the city of [[Malmö]], Sweden.

He also pointed out that the Fox News segment had false facts, namely that the city of Malmö has about 7% immigrants from Muslim countries and not 25%. Further more Kianzad pointed out the rhetorics used by Fox News to imply that the city of Malmö had reached some sort of breaking point due to Muslim immigrants and that these immigrants where potential terrorist. "&lt;ref name="revirosengard" /&gt;
*In August 2006, two Jordanian-Arab freelancers who were working for Fox News as producers, resigned from the network, citing its coverage that month of [[Israel]]'s [[2006 Lebanon War|conflict]] with the militant group [[Hezbollah]] in [[Lebanon]]. Their resignation letter read in part: "We can no longer work with a news organization that claims to be fair and balanced when you are so far from that ... Not only are you Fox News an instrument of the Bush White House, and Israeli propaganda, you are war mongers with no sense of decency, nor professionalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/16/148232|title=Fox News Producer Resigns Over Middle East Coverage|work=Democracy Now!|accessdate=October 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114052855/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F08%2F16%2F148232|archivedate=November 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 19, 2007, reports and commentary by Fox News personalities featured an anonymously sourced article in the conservative web magazine ''[[Insight (magazine)|Insight]]'' that claimed that associates of Democratic Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] had discovered that Senator [[Barack Obama]] had attended a "Muslim seminary" as a child in [[Indonesia]]. The term "Muslim seminary" refers to a specifically religious form of [[madrassa]] (school). It was determined within days that Obama had instead, as he had said in his memoirs, attended first a Catholic and then a modern public elementary school. The latter was, as Obama had written, "predominantly Muslim" (as Indonesia is predominantly Muslim), and not a [[seminary]] of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In March 2007, the [[Nevada Democratic Party]] pulled out of a planned debate to be hosted by Fox. Its spokesmen cited a joke by Fox News CEO [[Roger Ailes]], which hinged on President George W. Bush confusing the names of Barack Obama and [[Osama bin Laden]], as evidence that Fox News is biased against the party. Fox News chairman David Rhodes responded to the cancellation by saying that the Democratic Party is "owned by [[MoveOn.org]]" (which had created a petition against the debate).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/10/debate.canceled/index.html |title= Dems cancel debate over Fox chief's Obama joke| publisher= CNN|date=March 11, 2007|accessdate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 25, 2008, Fox News political contributor [[Liz Trotta]] stated on the air, while talking about the presidential election, "And now we have what some are reading as a suggestion that somebody knock off Osama, uh Obama. Well, both, if we could"; she then laughed. She apologized for the remark on-air on Fox News the next day, saying, "I am so sorry about what happened yesterday and the lame attempt at humor."&lt;ref&gt;

*In June 2007, when Louisiana Democratic Congressman [[William J. Jefferson]] was indicted on corruption, racketeering, and bribery charges, Fox News ran a video of Michigan Democratic Congressman [[John Conyers]], also black. Conyers criticized the network for "a history of inappropriate on-air mistakes" and the network's "lackluster" apology (which did not name him),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/06/05/john-conyers-responds-to-fox-news/|title=Conyers responds to Fox News|publisher=Crook and Liars|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=June 5, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930230356/http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/06/05/john-conyers-responds-to-fox-news/|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second, more specific apology was issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070606/ap_on_en_tv/tv_fox_wrong_tape|title=Fox News apologizes again for tape goof}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006 Fox News had aired footage of then-Rep.

*On September 5, 2011, Fox News criticized a speech by [[James P. Hoffa]] in Detroit calling for an "army of voters" to "take the SOBs out" and "give America back to Americans". But Fox edited out the mention of voters to make the speech sound like a call for violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.973kiro.com/813/541140/Dave-Ross-Brevity-or-deception|title=Brevity or deception?|date=December 31, 1969|work=MyNorthwest.com|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/fox-news-accused-of-doctoring-controversial-jimmy-hoffa-speech-55140/|title=Fox News Accused of 'Doctoring' Controversial Speech by Jimmy Hoffa|work=Christian Post|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fox News responses to criticism==
In June 2004, CEO [[Roger Ailes]] responded to some of the criticism with a rebuttal in an editorial in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'''s ''[[OpinionJournal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110005157|title=Elite, Arrogant, Condescending: The L.A. Times' editor is terrified of Fox News. How pathetic.|first=Roger|last=Ailes|publisher=''OpinionJournal'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=June 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Wall Street Journal'' is owned by News Corporation, which also owns Fox News) saying that Fox's critics intentionally confuse opinion shows such as ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' with regular news coverage. Ailes stated that Fox News has broken stories harmful to Republicans, offering "Fox News is the network that broke [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] four days before the election" as an example, referring to Bush's DUI charge in 1976 that had not yet been made public. The DUI story was broken by then-Fox affiliate [[WPXT]] in [[Portland, Maine]], although Fox News correspondent [[Carl Cameron]] also contributed to the report and, in the words of National Public Radio ombudsman [[Alicia Shepard]], Fox News Channel "sent the story ping-ponging around the nation" by broadcasting WPXT's coverage.&lt;ref name="ajr"&gt;[http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=218 Alicia C. Shepard, "A Late-Breaking Campaign Skeleton," ''American Journalism Review,'' December 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; WPXT News Director Kevin Kelly said that he "called Fox News in New York City to see if we were [[flogging a dead horse]]" before running the story, and that Fox News Channel confirmed the arrest with the campaign and ran the story shortly after 6 p.m.&lt;ref name="ajr"/&gt;

Upon the release of ''[[Outfoxed]]'', Fox News issued a statement&lt;ref name="foxnews_outfoxed_statement"/&gt; denouncing [[MoveOn.org]], Greenwald and ''The New York Times'' for [[copyright infringement]]. Fox dismissed their judgments of former employees featured in the documentary as the partisan views of disgruntled workers who never vocalized concern over any alleged bias while they were employed at the network. Ailes also shrugged off criticisms of the former Fox employees by noting that they worked in Fox affiliates and not at the actual channel itself. Fox News also challenged any news organization that sought to portray Fox as a "problem" with the following proposition: ''"If they will put out 100 percent of their editorial directions and internal memos, Fox News Channel will publish 100 percent of our editorial directions and internal memos, and let the public decide who is fair. This includes any legitimate cable news network, broadcast network, ''The New York Times'', ''Los Angeles Times'', and ''The Washington Post." {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
Former Fox News personality [[Eric Burns]] has suggested in an interview that Fox "probably gives voice to more conservatives than the other networks. But not at the expense of liberals." Burns justifies a higher exposure of conservatives by saying that other media often ignore conservatives.&lt;ref name=Phillips2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwantmedia.com/people/people28.html|title=I Want Media Is on Hiatus - Adweek|work=AdWeek|accessdate=October 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602040735/http://www.iwantmedia.com/people/people28.html|archivedate=June 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox News personalities have also taken part in back and forth disagreements with media personalities such as [[Jon Stewart]]&lt;ref name=hannitystuart&gt;{{cite news |title = Jon Stewart Addresses Hannity: "Sh*t Just Got Weird" |url = http://tellmenow.com/2014/04/jon-stewart-addresses-hannity-sht-just-got-weird/ |publisher = Tell Me Now |date = April 25, 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002440/http://tellmenow.com/2014/04/jon-stewart-addresses-hannity-sht-just-got-weird/ |archivedate = May 2, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Colbert]].&lt;ref name=Wemple2014&gt;{{cite news |first = Erik |last = Wemple |title = Bill O'Reilly vs. Stephen Colbert, still going strong |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/04/11/bill-oreilly-vs-stephen-colbert-still-going-strong/ | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GIGA''' was the brand name of a digital TV channel (also known as '''GIGA Digital''' or '''GIGA TV''') and several [[Germany|German]] [[television show]]s. The channel ceased operations in 2009.

==Early Days==
The first GIGA show was broadcast on 30 November 1998. The show [[NBC]] GIGA was shown first time on the television channel [[NBC Europe]]. The show lasted five hours, from 3 pm until 8 pm.

==Broadcasts on own channel==
In March 2005 the show was renamed from NBC GIGA to '''GIGA Green''', airing on its own digital channel starting in September. Also in September 2005 the original show was renamed a second time, now to the simple name '''GIGA''', which caused some confusion because the television channel on which it was broadcast was also named GIGA. The show had been shortened from five hours to three hours, Monday through Friday, and was now being broadcast on the television channel GIGA as well as on the television channel [[Das Vierte]] (English: The Fourth).

Then in March 2006, the show GIGA - the original NBC GIGA - was cancelled. The most popular shows still running at this point were GIGA\\Games, GIGA [[eSports]] and PLAY.

Beginning 1 January 2008 GIGA Digital Television GmbH in Cologne was operated by [[Premiere (pay television network)|Premiere]] (now Sky Deutschland).

==Shutdown==
On 13 February 2009, the managing director of GIGA, Stephan Borg, announced that Premiere decided to shut down the channel and release all staff. Reasons mentioned included the lack of financial success and bad outlook on the advertising market; in general, Premiere wanted to concentrate on its core channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mymym.com/en/news/15812.html GIGA TV stops all operations, mymym.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002084414/http://www.mymym.com/en/news/15812.html |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American gaming and entertainment network [[IGN]] Entertainment, which is owned by Fox Interactive Media, announced on 20 April 2009 the acquisition of the gaming community site GIGA.DE - the online arm of the GIGA television channel. The two companies have shared content since August 2008, and IGN took the opportunity to penetrate the German market. Current plans are to maintain the GIGA.DE trademark and structure.

==New beginning==
In September 2011 the ECONA Internet AG, the new owner of GIGA, announced that they want to revive GIGA as a TV-Show.
GIGA will first be available only as Web-TV including the Entertainment and Digital Lifestyle Site GIGA.DE.
GIGA will begin broadcasting in October 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2461">The '''hair hang''' is an [[Aerialist|aerial]] [[circus]] act where performers (usually young women) are suspended by their hair, [[acrobatics|acrobat]]ic poses and/or manipulation. Some believe the act originated in [[South America]]; others claim the act hails from [[China]]. Performers are literally hanging by their [[hair]], which is tied into a hairhang [[Aerial rigging|rig]]; the techniques used to tie the performer's hair, and the acrobatic techniques involved in the act, are key.

Many people underestimate the [[tensile strength]] of hair. A single strand can potentially carry a weight of up to 100 [[gram]]s; holding this in theory, and with proper technique, a full head of human hair could eventually hold between 5,600&amp;nbsp;kg and 8,400&amp;nbsp;kg (12,345-18518&amp;nbsp;lbs.), without breaking individual hairs or pulling out any [[hair follicle|follicles]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, the act still hurts, especially for new performers.

==Performers==
Many groups or individuals perform the hair hang, today. Some of them include:

'''Inès Ligron''' is a [[French fashion]] and beauty expert best known for working with celebrities, models, fashion houses, beauty firms, advertising agencies, and magazine editors. Ligron also owns a beauty academy in Japan called ''WCBA by Ines Ligron''. As a philanthropist, Ligron supports a home with 17 young adults diagnosed with mental handicap in Cambodia since 2011. Ines is the face of IROKA by KAO in Japan and has developed 2 fragrances for their latest laundry products.

Ligron became the national director of Japan in 1997 until 2009 when she revamped the Miss Universe Japan pageant into greater sponsorship and television event. She produced one Miss Universe winner and 2 runners-up during her 10 years with The Miss Universe Organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.cnn.com/tokyo/life/awaking-sleeping-beauties-japan-secrets-miss-universe-maker-209745/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligron filmed a French reality television series called "Les Anges Gardiens" (The Guardian Angels) with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jean-Roch. Ligron is the National Director of the Miss World Singapore Organization.

==Early life==
Inés Ligron was born '''Agnès Ligron''' in Montpellier, France, the daughter of Pierre and Monique Ligron. Ligron changed her first name from Agnès to Spanish Inés (or French Inès) when she was 25, because she started working in Spain where people could not say her name correctly, and in English it sounded too old-fashioned. Ligron grew up in the South of France near Montpellier because her parents had to leave Paris due to the allergies of her younger brother. She has a sister, Mireille Ligron, and a brother, Philippe Ligron. She studied literature, learned 3 languages, and enrolled in a fashion and cosmetic school in Montpellier called Inter Beaute. Before working as the National Director of Miss Universe in Japan, she worked with European cosmetic companies and designed a line of cosmetics consisting of make-up and skin care products for Montagut, and the products were to be sold in China. Ligron worked with IMG Models after moving to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="ines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inesligron.com/?page_id=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420161511/http://inesligron.com/?page_id=2 |archivedate=2009-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Ligron became the Asia/Pacific director of IMG model in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news

==Career==
Although Ligron works with high-profile clients and has a very notable fashion sense, she has never stayed in one place and traveled regularly throughout Asia to work as a freelance for international projects, giving her the opportunity to meet and work with some well-known clients. Acting as an agent for some Hollywood agencies, she has worked with Sarah Jessica Parker, Penélope Cruz, Jennifer Lopez, Maria Sharaprova, and Beyoncé, securing booking to contracts for endorsements and for multi-media events.

Based in Hong Kong, Ligron acted as IMG Models Asia-Pacific Director. IMG Models is a powerful model agency with headquarters in New York and celebrity supermodels such as Gigi  Hadid, Miranda Keir, Tyra Banks, Milla Jovovich, Liv Tyler, Kaia Gerber,  Gisele Bündchen, Carolyn Murphy, Alek Wek, Angela Lindervall, Nicki Taylor, and Lauren Hutton.

With the help of her numerous appearances on national televisions in Japan, France, and Hong Kong as a fashion leader, Ligron has reached a high level of followers. Her success led her to sign a multi-year contract with a tele-marketing company called Oak Lawn Marketing whom produced a series of 8 DVDs which were the bible of fashion and beauty for any woman in Japan. Ligron's DVD sales are combined with the four books that she has published (three in Japan and two in Thailand).

Ligron was appointed Best National Director by the Miss Universe Organization in 2007.

Ligron has appeared on numerous magazines in Japan:

[[File:Kemari Matsuri at Tanzan Shrine 2.jpg|thumb|A game of Kemari at [[Tanzan Shrine]]]]

'''Kemari''' ({{lang-ja|蹴鞠}}) is a [[ball]] game that was popular in [[Japan]] during the [[Heian Period]]. ''Kemari'' has been revived in modern times.

==History==
The first evidence of kemari is from 644 AD.&lt;ref name="hawaii"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese sports: a history |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Allen Guttmann, Lee Austin Thompson |year=2001 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location= |isbn= 9780824824648 |pages=26–27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbOau1trIMMC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=kemari#v=onepage&amp;q=kemari&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules were standardized from the 13th century.&lt;ref name="hawaii"/&gt; The game was influenced by the [[China|Chinese]] sport of ''[[Cuju]]''.&lt;ref name="soccer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Global Art of Soccer |last=Witzig |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=CusiBoy Publishing |location= |isbn= 9780977668809 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=kemari#v=onepage&amp;q=kemari&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters for Kemari are the same as [[Cuju]] in Chinese. The sport was introduced to Japan about 600, during the [[Asuka period]].  Nowadays, it is played in [[Shinto shrine]]s for festivals.&lt;ref name="soccer"/&gt; [[George H. W. Bush]] played the game on one of his presidential visits to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DF113AF934A35752C0A964958260&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=kemari&amp;scp=2 | work=The New York Times | title=On Japan Leg of Journey, Bush's Stakes Are High | first=Michael | last=Wines | date=1992-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DF143DF93BA35752C0A964958260&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=kemari&amp;scp=3 | work=The New York Times | title=Japanese Visit, on the Surface: Jovial Bush, Friendly Crowds | first=Michael | last=Wines | date=1992-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Kemari Matsuri at Tanzan Shrine 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A game of Kemari at [[Tanzan Shrine]]]]
It is a non-competitive sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Football | publisher=FIFA| url = https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html | accessdate =29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of Kemari is to keep one [[ball]] in the air,&lt;ref name="soccer"/&gt; with all players cooperating to do so.  Players may use any body part with the exception of arms and hands – their head, feet, knees, back, and depending on the rules, elbows to keep the ball aloft. The ball, known as a ''Mari'', is made of deerskin with the hair facing inside and the hide on the outside. The ball is stuffed with barley grains to give it shape. When the hide has set in this shape, the grains are removed from the ball, and it is then sewn together using the skin of a horse. The one who kicks the ball is called a ''mariashi.'' A good mariashi makes it easy for the receiver to control the mari, and serves it with a soft touch to make it easy to keep the mari in the air.

Kemari is played on a flat ground, about 6–7 meters squared.&lt;ref name="hawaii"/&gt; The uniforms that the players wear are reminiscent of the clothes of the [[Asuka age]] and include a crow hat. This type of clothing was called ''[[kariginu]]'' and it was fashionable at that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">The '''Kom(m)ödchen''' is a [[cabaret]] stage in [[Düsseldorf]].
[[File:Komödchen Düsseldorf (Eingang).jpg|thumb]]
The Kom(m)ödchen was created in 1947 as a political-literary cabaret by [[Kay Lorentz|Kay]] and [[Lore Lorentz]]. Other participants in the initial program ''"Positiv dagegen"'', which had its premiere on March 29, 1947, were Werner Vielhaber, Bernd Nesselhut, Hans Walter Clasen, Eduard Marwitz, Iris Fanslau, and Ruth Henrichs. [[Hanne Wieder]] was also part of the ensemble in its first year. In 1959 the television transmission of the program was banned for a year.

The theater moved to its present location on April 27, 1967, and its stage and props were moved to the new location by guests during the intermission of a performance.

In 1983, Lore Lorentz decided to pursue solo appearances and left the Kom(m)ödchen ensemble. Kay Lorentz stayed and continued to build a new ensemble. With his death in 1993, Lore gave up her solo career and returned to lead the Kom(m)ödchen. She gave the leadership to her son Kay S. Lorentz, who has continued since Lore's death in 1994.

The public square in front of the theater was renamed the "Kay-und-Lore-Lorentz-Platz" in their honor, and there is also a city school named the "Lore Lorentz Schule".

Well-known members of the ensemble have included [[Thomas Freitag]], [[Harald Schmidt]], [[Hugo Egon Balder]], and [[Volker Pispers]]. The journalist and poet [[Thaddäus Troll]] wrote scripts for the cabaret in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Lindenberg"&gt;Lindenberg, Eleonore (2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1456">'''Le Her''' (or ''le Hère'') is a French [[card game]] that dates back to the 16th century. It is quoted by the French poet Marc Papillon de Lasphrise in 1597. Under the name ''coucou'' it is mentioned in [[Rabelais]]' long list of games (in [[Gargantua]], 1534). Le Her belongs to the family of [[Ranter-Go-Round]] games. It is played with a standard deck of 52 [[Playing card|cards]] by two people, designated the dealer and the receiver. King is ranked high and ace low.

To play, the dealer gives one card to the receiver and one to the dealer. The receiver may choose to exchange cards with the dealer, unless the dealer has a king, in which case no exchange occurs. Then, the dealer may choose to exchange with the top card of the deck, unless the top card is a king, in which case no exchange occurs. In the case of the dealer and receiver having same ranked cards, the dealer is the winner.

Le Her played a role in the development of the mathematical theory of probability with solutions being sought by [[Jacob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] and [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort|de Montmort]].

'''''Lincoln Portrait''''' (also known as '''''A Lincoln Portrait''''') is a classical [[orchestral work]] written by the American composer [[Aaron Copland]]. The work involves a full [[orchestra]], with particular emphasis on the [[Brass instrument|brass]] section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s great documents, including the [[Gettysburg Address]]. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator.

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Aaron Copland Lincoln Portrait.ogg|title=''Lincoln Portrait''|description=A 23 second sample demonstrating the narration, by [[Gregory Peck]], of Lincoln's documents along with the prominence of brass instruments for dramatic emphasis}}
Copland was asked to write a musical portrait of an "eminent American" by the conductor [[Andre Kostelanetz]]. Copland used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln and quoted original folk songs of the period, including "[[Camptown Races]]" and "[[On Springfield Mountain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/catalogue/cat_detail.asp?musicid=2103 |title=''Lincoln Portrait''|publisher=Boosey &amp; Hawkes|date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Copland finished ''Lincoln Portrait'' in April 1942.

The first performance was by the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] on 14 May 1942, with [[William Adams (who?)|William Adams]] as the narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollack|first=Howard|title=Aaron Copland: the life and work of an uncommon man|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Together with some descriptive comments on Lincoln ("Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or
insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, [[State of the Union]]], December 1, 1862)

The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862)

It is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. ([[Lincoln–Douglas debates]], October 15, 1858)

As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. (Unknown, though in Lincoln's ''Collected Works'')

That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. ([[Gettysburg Address]])

==In Venezuela==
[[Juana Sujo]], an Argentine actress resident in Venezuela and an opponent of the repressive regime of Venezuelan President [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], was credited with sparking the popular uprising that led to his removal from power. Aaron Copland had come to [[Caracas]] to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of ''Lincoln Portrait'' on March 27, 1957. A ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer said it had a "magical effect" on the audience.{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}}

As Copland recalled, "To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment." On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, "... [[Gettysburg Address|that government of the people, by the people, for the people]] (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth," the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, "It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the ''Lincoln Portrait'' was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état|a revolution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holzer|first1=Harold|authorlink1=Harold Holzer|editor1-last=Cuomo|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Holzer|editor2-first=Harold|editor1-link=Mario M.

==Popular culture==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2017}}
The composition was [[parody|lampooned]] by [[Peter Schickele]] ("[[P. D. Q. Bach]]") in his piece ''Bach Portrait'' on the album ''[[1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults]]''. Another parody, "A Quayle Portrait" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quayle Portrait|url=http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=1275|author=Mad Music Productions, LLC}}{{sps|certain=y|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevant Dr. Demento show playlists reviewable at dmdb.org: 1991-04-21, 1991-06-16, 1992-06-21 --&gt;

Nine minutes of the composition, without narration (from a late 1960s recording by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), plays during the climactic one-on-one sequence between Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Ray Allen]]) in the 1998 Spike Lee film, ''[[He Got Game]]''. In the film, Jesus Shuttlesworth is a student at [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in Brooklyn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38083">{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}
The [[male prostitute]] or hustler is a frequent [[stereotype]] in literature and movies in the West from the 1960s on, and especially in movies and books with a [[gay]] perspective in which he may be considered a [[stock character]].  He also appears occasionally in popular music, some contemporary fashion advertising, and the visual arts.

==Stereotypes==
{{Original research|date=April 2010}} 
The most common stereotype of the hustler is as a sexy but tragic figure.  This stereotype reveals both a fascination with the hustler as a sexual object and sadness or disdain with his situation and life style.  This stereotyped male hustler is often an under-aged or teen-age "street kid" or "[[Runaway child|runaway]]" forced to leave home because of his sexual orientation or because of [[sexual abuse]]. He is often portrayed as a [[drug addict]] or thief.  The plotline frequently focuses on the crisis of leaving the trade or the street ("one last trick"), or on making enough money for an important use (a medical treatment, a gift). The climax often has one of two possible outcomes: the hustler either abandons the trade and re-integrates society, or he meets a tragic end.  This tragic image of the hustler can be contrasted with the stereotype of the female [[hooker with a heart of gold]]: instead of being portrayed as someone in control and contented, the hustler is lost, homeless, broke or exploited.

In movies and books that take the point of view of the client or of a boy/girl friend who loves the hustler, the hustler is often depicted as an impossible love object who will only bring hurt or frustration.  The lover may grow jealous of and disturbed by the hustler's work; occasionally the loving boy/girl friend will be drawn into the lifestyle of their hustler boy friend.  Older clients who fall in love with hustlers are frequently prey to emotional (and sometimes physical) pain; this is especially true in the case of "rough trade" (where the hustler identifies as straight), and this depiction has been reinforced by several famous incidents of violence against clients (such as the deaths of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] and [[Rudolph Moshammer]]).

In contrast to the previous depictions, the male [[prostitute]] has also sometimes been portrayed as an idealized rebel living outside the law and free of [[bourgeois]] conventions.  This almost [[Nietzsche]]an image of the hustler as moral and sexual outlaw owes much to the writings of [[Jean Genet]], [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[John Rechy]] (among others).

While less frequent in cinema and novels, the male prostitute with exclusively female clients (the "gigolo" or "escort") is generally depicted in a less tragic manner than the gay hustler (the gigolo is portrayed as older, athletic, well-dressed, etc.), and films like ''[[American Gigolo]]'' have done much to paint the character as a sophisticated seducer.  This portrayal has also led to cinematic satire (the ''[[Deuce Bigalow (disambiguation)|Deuce Bigalow]]'' films).

The portrayal of the client or "[[John (prostitution)|john]]" of male [[prostitution]] in popular culture is far less codified than that of the hustler and runs the gamut from the lonely married man, the self-hating in-the-closet guy, the exploitative or endearing businessman, and even the serial killer.

The diversity of these stereotypes reveals much about each author's or director's personal view of love, sexuality, power and morality.

These stereotypes may have a basis in fact, but they should not be taken as true in all cases.

The same issues that surround male prostitution (including the financial security and [[social status]] of the young "kept" lover, the older lover's obsessions and insecurities with regards to his or her youthful love-object, the sexual freedom or moral indifference of the hustler, etc.) often appear in movies and literature that portray amorous or sexual relationships—without prostitution—between an older man or woman and a younger male lover, for example, in Pasolini's novel and movie ''Theorem'', Harold Prince's film ''Something For Everyone'' (1970) and [[Bill Condon]]'s film ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998).

==In literature==

'''Milk chugging''', or the '''gallon challenge''' or '''milk challenge''', is the process of consuming a large amount of [[cow milk|milk]] within a set period of time. Although there are variations in procedure, the general parameters are that a person is given 60 minutes to drink {{convert|1|gal|1|spell=in}} of whole milk without [[vomiting]]. A gallon milk jug is a common size of milk container in the United States.

==History==

Retrieved 2010-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; where there are several explanations for the origins of the challenge. It certainly existed prior to that, however.  American baseball pitcher [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]] mentioned the challenge in his autobiography ''The Wrong Stuff'' as one of the activities that [[relief pitchers]] used to pass the time in the bullpen as far back as the late 1960s.  Undoubtedly, the most highly publicized competition was one that was featured in episode five of season two of the American [[television series]] [[Jackass (TV series)|''Jackass'']],&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://allaboutchocolatemilk.com/2016/11/03/chocolate-milk-muscle-recovery/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002610/http://allaboutchocolatemilk.com/2016/11/03/chocolate-milk-muscle-recovery/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2016-11-04 |title= Chugging for glory |last=Young |first=Luke |date= 2006-08-29 |work= [[Technician (newspaper)|Technician]] |accessdate= 2010-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Dave England]] and [[Ehren McGhehey]] were featured in a gallon challenge segment. Filmed in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2000, contestants were to consume one gallon of milk in an hour in a variety of flavors, which resulted in each participant vomiting. In 1999 North Carolina legislators started a yearly milk-drinking contest to promote the [[dairy industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article24636634.html|title=NC legislators chug milk in annual contest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical explanation==
[[File:Stomach diagram.svg|thumb|The human stomach capacity is around half a gallon ({{cvt|1/2|usgal|L |disp=out}})]]
The primary difficulty in completing the challenge lies in the limited capacity of the [[stomach]]. Generally, the stomach can hold only half a gallon ({{cvt|1/2|usgal|L |disp=out}}). [[Mechanoreceptors |Stretch receptors]] in the organ sense when its limit is reached, triggering a vomit reflex that swiftly empties the stomach. Moreover, drinking a gallon of milk is more difficult than drinking a gallon of water. The [[fat]] and [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] in milk each inhibit the stomach from releasing its contents into the [[small intestine]], forcing more of the liquid to remain in the stomach.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt; In turn, the action of [[gastric acid]] and [[proteases]] in the stomach cause proteins in the milk to unravel and expand the liquid into a thick semi-solid substance, further reducing the amount of fluid that can be held in the stomach without being regurgitated.

It is often claimed that the difficulty of retaining milk is related to [[lactose intolerance]]: the inability of many people to [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[lactose]], a major component of milk. Sarah Ash, an associate professor of [[nutrition]] at [[North Carolina State University]], finds this theory unlikely, as the symptoms of lactose intolerance occur in the [[large intestine]], rather than the stomach.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;

==Rules==
There are three universal rules in what has been called the "gallon challenge",  although some minor variations may exist.
*The contestant has one hour to drink {{convert|1|gal|1|spell=in}} of milk. Specifications on the type of milk vary, or are unspecified.&lt;ref name=MG&gt;Atkinson, Nat (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315043151/http://www.milkgallon.com/ "Rules."] ''MilkGallon: The Home of The Gallon Challenge''. Retrieved 2010-07-12&lt;/ref&gt;
*Should the contestant finish the gallon within that hour, they must retain the gallon for a set period. There are several variations of this rule; either the milk must simply be drunk in an hour without vomiting,&lt;ref name=tech/&gt; or the drinker must retain the contents for one additional hour&lt;ref name=tri&gt;Wright, Andrew (2001-04). "[http://gallonchallenge.tripod.com/ What is the Challenge?]". ''The Gallon Challenge''. Retrieved 2010-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; or the remainder of the hour&lt;ref name=MG/&gt; without vomiting
*Should they retain the gallon, they win. Otherwise, if the contestant vomits prior to the set period of time passing, they lose.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;

Although in almost all cases, the challenge is set for one gallon,&lt;ref name=won&gt;Slaughter, Shannon (2010-04-30). "[http://media.www.milliganstampede.com/media/storage/paper1260/news/2010/04/16/StudentLife/Wonderful.Wednesday.MilkChugging.Contest.Concludes.Winnerless-3907635.shtml Wonderful Wednesday milk-chugging contest concludes winnerless]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}".

'''''Neria''''' is a [[Zimbabwe]]an film made in 1993, written by the novelist [[Tsitsi Dangarembga]]. It is directed by [[Godwin Mawuru]] and the screenplay was written by Louise Riber. It is the highest-grossing film in Zimbabwean history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ezimbabwe.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/from-neria-to-zollywood-the-state-of-zimbabwean-film/ "From Neria to Zollywood: The State of Zimbabwean Film"], eZimbabwe, 7 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film concerns the struggles of a woman in a suburb of the capital; Harare, Warren Park, in Zimbabwe when she is widowed after her husband is killed in an accident. Her husband's older brother takes advantage of the death of his younger brother, and uses the inheritance for self-benefit at the expense of Neria and her two children.The movie was well crafted and amazingly had one of the best picture quality of that time. Oliver Mtukudzi's fame was increased even more and the sound track neria remains one of the most celebrated Zimbabwean songs. r&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/nerianrkempley_a0a372.htm|first=Rita|last=Kempley|title='Neria' (NR)|date=1993-04-09|accessdate=2007-04-15|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack of the film was sung by [[Oliver Mtukudzi]].

'''Old Strathcona''' is an [[historic district|historic]] [[List of neighbourhoods in Edmonton|district]] in south-central [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. Once the [[downtown|commercial core]] of the separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], the area is now home to many of Edmonton's arts and entertainment facilities, as well as a local [[shopping district|shopping hub]] for residents and students at the nearby [[University of Alberta]]. Many of the area's businesses are owner-operated but, [[retail chain|chains]] have also made inroads.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A good proportion of Edmonton's theatres and live-performance venues are also in the area.  The district centres on [[Whyte (82) Avenue]] and has shops, restaurants, bars and [[buskers]].

== Official definitions ==

=== Provincial historic area ===
In 2007, Old Strathcona was named Alberta's second [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Area]]. The district comprises an area of five city blocks from 85 Avenue south to 80 Avenue and from 102 Street west to 106 street.&lt;ref&gt;Canada's Historic Places [https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Search.aspx?DeptID=1&amp;ad=True&amp;st=Provincial%20Historic%20Area&amp;so=is&amp;sc=FormalRecognitionType Alberta Register of Historic Places: Old Strathcona].

=== Business revitalization zone ===
The '''Old Strathcona and Area Business Revitalization Zone (BRZ)''' is a roughly cross-shaped [[business revitalization zone]], extending along [[Whyte Avenue]] from just west of [[109 Street (Edmonton)|109 Street]] in the west, to just east of 99&amp;nbsp;Street in the east, and along [[Gateway Boulevard]] from 86&amp;nbsp;Avenue in the north to [[University Avenue (Edmonton)|University Avenue]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/documents/InfraPlan/b_oldstrath_brz.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507004912/http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/documents/InfraPlan/b_oldstrath_brz.pdf |archive-date=2012-05-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{main|Strathcona, Alberta}}
Old [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] was once a municipality separate from Edmonton, achieving town status in 1899 and city status in 1907. The City of Strathcona amalgamated with Edmonton in 1912.

A large part of Whyte Avenue's popularity is the historical character of its buildings, many of which are one hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;Monto, Tom (2011) Old Strathcona, Edmonton's Southside Roots. Edmonton: Crang Publishing, p. 305-308.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest building is the [[Strathcona Hotel]], built by the railway when it arrived in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Monto, Tom, p. 120-122&lt;/ref&gt; Early construction used mostly wood, but this changed in 1902 when the Town of Strathcona passed a bylaw requiring brick buildings in the downtown core to prevent a major fire. Many of the current brick buildings were erected during the 1910–1912 boom that brought thousands of settlers from eastern Canada, Britain and continental Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Monto, Tom, p. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte Avenue in the early 1890s was dominated by primitive shack homes and quickly-built pioneer stores. These early structures were soon replaced by more substantial wood-frame two-storey buildings or, in the case of the Ross Block, by a brick building even before the town's anti-fire bylaw.&lt;ref&gt;Monto, Tom, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Edmonton City Council]] sent a letter to the Province of Alberta requesting heritage status for the area, and the new status of Provincial Heritage Area in 2007.

=== Historic buildings and government recognition ===
Old Strathcona is Alberta's second Provincial Historic Area (downtown [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] being the first), and has a number of historic buildings.

The designation as a Provincial Historic Area applies to roughly 5 [[city block|square blocks]] that formed the commercial hub of the former city of Strathcona. It runs from 85 Avenue south to 80 Avenue and from 102 Street west to 106 Street. Within this area are many of the most significant buildings from Strathcona's early boom from the arrival of the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] in 1891 to the Edmonton real estate crash of 1913–14. Heritage buildings within this area include the [[Strathcona Hotel]], the [[Gainers Block]], the [[Strathcona Orange Hall|Orange Hall]], the [[Strathcona Canadian Pacific Railway Station|Canadian Pacific Railway Station]], the [[Strathcona Public Building|South Side Post Office]], the [[Douglas Block]], the [[Princess Theatre (Edmonton)|Princess Theatre]], the [[Strathcona Public Library]], the [[Connaught Armoury]], and [[Old Scona Academic High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Canada's Historic Places, [https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Details.aspx?DeptID=1&amp;ObjectID=4665-1350 ARHP Details: Old Strathcona]. Online at: hermis.alberta.ca. Retrieved on: 2012-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the Provincial Heritage Area in the wider Old Strathcona area are several non-commercial buildings that are also protected as heritage buildings including churches and residences. Within the [[Edmonton-Strathcona (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton-Strathcona provincial electoral district]], which covers most of the former City of Strathcona, there are 18 Provincial Historic Resources and 11 Registered Historic Resources recognized by the Government of Alberta, and 14 Municipal Restoric Resources recognized by the City of Edmonton (some buildings are on both registers).&lt;ref&gt;Canada's Historic Places, [https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Search.aspx?DeptID=1&amp;st=Edmonton-Strathcona ARHP: Text search for: "Edmonton-Strathcona].

[[File:PrincessTheatreEdmonton-01.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Princess Theatre (Edmonton)|Princess Theatre]]]]

==Present day==
After amalgamation of the cities of Strathcona and Edmonton, Strathcona went into an economic slump and little re-development occurred, allowing many of area's old buildings to continue to the present day. In the 1970s, Edmonton city council bought many properties along 104 Street in preparation for a freeway through the historic area. A "Save-the-district" movement emerged and the plan was abandoned. Old Strathcona then became more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] in tone, as well as performing its historic purpose of supplying goods and services to local residents, students at nearby [[University of Alberta]], and residents of the nearby County of Strathcona whose county offices would first be located in Old Strathcona&lt;ref&gt;Monto, Tom, p. 119, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strathcona Hotel, the first building built after the arrival of the railway that had established the hamlet of South Edmonton in 1891 (leading to the town and city of Strathcona) has been in operation ever since (excepting the period of Prohibition, 1916-1923), and other bars were never absent from the district. However, in the 1990s, many new bars were established in Whyte Avenue buildings that had previously held offices and shops. The area's night-time ambience began to change dramatically. The area has attracted media attention over the years for its revelry.

Over time, the area has become the premier entertainment strip in Edmonton and is the locale for events such as the [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]]. Although it has lacked alternative music venues since the 1990s heyday, there is a strong revival of music venues on Whyte Avenue with several offering live entertainment for various genres. The primary location for clubs and nightlife is on Whyte Avenue between 99 and 109 Streets, with the majority of clubs directly on Whyte Avenue or on adjacent side streets.

Whyte Avenue arguably remains the centre of Edmonton's alternative lifestyles, containing various independent clothing and other types of shops catering to a variety of alternative subcultures (ranging from hippie to raver to goth etc.). Clothing is the fastest growing business trend in the area,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} with retailers all along the avenue.  Old Strathcona was a bastion of small, local and independent business.

There are a number of restaurants in this area, many locally owned. Several of the bars also have kitchens. In total, there are almost 100{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} places to eat in Old Strathcona.

===Theatre===
Old Strathcona is home to a vibrant independent theatre scene, with nine theatre companies operating out of several buildings in the neighbourhood, including the [[Varscona Theatre]], ATB Financial Arts Barns, Northern Light Theatre, [[The Walterdale Playhouse]] and Roxy on Gateway.  The Varscona Theatre alone is home to several award-winning companies: [[Shadow Theatre]], [http://www.teatroq.com/ Teatro la Quindicina], [https://www.plainjanetheatre.com/ Plain Jane Theatre Company], the variety show That's Terrific!, and improvisation troupe [[Die-Nasty]]. Every August, Old Strathcona plays host to the [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]], the largest and oldest Fringe Theatre event in North America. Edmonton historian Lawrence Herzog has called the diversity of material being produced in the Old Strathcona Theatre District "wide and astonishing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Plays The Thing in Old Strathcona | work=Real Estate Weekly | url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view2?CONTENT_ID=139 | accessdate=2007-02-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908193312/http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view2?CONTENT_ID=139 | archive-date=2013-09-08 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
Old Strathcona is also known for its art house theatres, The [[Princess Theatre, Edmonton|Princess Theatre]] and the [[Garneau Theatre]]. In 2011, Edmonton's [[Metro Cinema Edmonton|Metro Cinema Society]] took over management of the Garneau Theatre, while The Princess continued to be operated by [[Rainbow and Magic Lantern Cinemas|Magic Lantern Theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griwkowsky|first=Catherine|title=Garneau theatre closing|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2011/06/13/garneau-theatre-closing|accessdate=10 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404102606/http://www.edmontonsun.com/2011/06/13/garneau-theatre-closing|archive-date=2012-04-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
{{ERRS HLBS route|collapse=yes}}
Old Strathcona celebrates all year long. January brings Ice on Whyte, a sculpting competition and outdoor ice playground. June features Improvaganza, an invitational international [[improvisational theatre|improv]] festival, hosted by [[Rapid Fire Theatre]]. In mid July, the Whyte Avenue ArtWalk puts more than 230 working artists on the sidewalks of Old Strathcona, and on the final Sunday of Artwalk, Whyte Avenue closes the entire street for a massive Street Sale. In August, the [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]] welcomes hundreds of thousands of theatre goers and festival patrons. The fall brings the Chante Festival and many events during the Edmonton Halloween festival.

Old Strathcona has a year-round [[farmers' market]] that requires all vendors to be primary producers. Edmonton's market garden industry finds an average of 10,000 customers every Saturday.&lt;ref name="Global News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramsay|first1=Caley|title=Times are changing down at the Old Strathcona Farmers’ Market|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/401866/times-are-changing-down-at-the-old-strathcona-farmers-market/|accessdate=11 October 2017|agency=Global News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whyte (82) Avenue''' is an [[arterial road]] in south-central [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It became the main street of the City of Strathcona as it formed, and now runs through Old Strathcona. It was named in 1891 after [[William Whyte (railway manager)|Sir William Whyte]], who was superintendent of the CPR's western division from 1886 to 1897 and was knighted by [[George V|King George&amp;nbsp;V]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Monto, Tom. Old Strathcona - Edmonton's Southside Roots (Edmonton: Crang Publishing/Alhambra Books, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte (82) Avenue is part of a {{convert|40|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} continuous roadway that runs through [[Sherwood Park]], Edmonton, and [[St. Albert, Alberta|St.&amp;nbsp;Albert]] that includes [[Wye Road]], [[Sherwood Park Freeway]], portions of [[University Avenue (Edmonton)|University Avenue]] and [[Saskatchewan Drive]], [[Groat Road]], and [[St.&amp;nbsp;Albert Trail]].

The roadway was originally the core of the former city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] and was the division between the north and south [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] while ''Main Street'', now [[Calgary Trail|104&amp;nbsp;Street (Calgary Trail)]] and was the division between the west and east quadrants.&lt;ref name=map_1912&gt;{{cite map|title=Mundy’s Map of The Twin Cities Edmonton &amp; Strathcona|url=https://lostyeg.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/eam-92-mundys-map-1911.jpg|publisher=The Mundy Blueprint Co.|date=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Edmonton and Strathcona amalgamated Edmonton adopted its present numbering system; Whyte Avenue was co-designated ''82&amp;nbsp;Avenue'' which allowed it to keep both names. As [[List of Alberta provincial highways|Alberta's highway system]] developed, Whyte Avenue became part of [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway&amp;nbsp;1]] (renumbered to [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway&amp;nbsp;2]] in 1941) between 104&amp;nbsp;Street and [[109 Street, Edmonton|109&amp;nbsp;Street]] while it was part of [[Alberta Highway 14|Highway&amp;nbsp;14]] east of 104&amp;nbsp;Street.&lt;ref name=1962_map&gt;{{cite map|publisher = Government of the Province of Alberta|year = 1962|title = Alberta Official Road Map|url = http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg196/spillphoto/Edmonton1962.jpg|inset = Edmonton|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170330015037/http://i.imgur.com/BjPzH1U.jpg|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highway designations were moved to [[Whitemud Drive]] in the 1980s.

A small section of 82&amp;nbsp;Avenue exists as a [[collector road]] between 71&amp;nbsp;Street and [[50 Street, Edmonton|50&amp;nbsp;Street]], where the main roadway transitions to the Sherwood Park Freeway.

===Blue Mile===
{{Split section|2005–06 Edmonton Oilers season|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=April 2018}}
[[Image:Oiler fans 2006.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Edmonton Oilers|Oiler]] fans, unable to enter the jam-packed [[Rexall Place]], celebrate on Edmonton's Whyte Avenue during the [[2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs]].]]

The '''Blue Mile''' or the '''Copper Kilometre''' is the name given by the local media to the Old Strathcona District's Whyte Avenue during the [[Edmonton Oilers]] [[2005–06 Edmonton Oilers season|2006 Stanley Cup playoff run]], since it closely resembled the events which took place on the [[Red Mile]] in [[Calgary]] two years prior.

Following the Edmonton Oilers upset victory over the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, several thousand Oiler fans flocked to Whyte Avenue and turned the district into a hockey party strip, as Oiler fans walked the streets cheering, chanting, high-fiving, horn-honking, and flag-waving for their team. Others surfed the crowd in a grocery-shopping cart, and still others climbed trees and traffic lights.

Whyte Avenue in Edmonton gained national attention for its level of violence in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBC News: Hockey fans stabbed in Edmonton melee|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/05/13/hockey-060513.html|accessdate=June 4, 2007|work=CBC News|agency=CBC|date=May 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901083833/http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/05/13/hockey-060513.html|archivedate=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrests at the Blue Mile are estimated at least 350 people through the Oilers Stanley Cup playoff run, including breaching the public peace, assaults, impaired driving, mischief, and alcohol-related offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People arrested at Stanley Cup finals celebration|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2006/05/29/1603249-sun.html|accessdate=June 4, 2007|date=May 29, 2006|work=Winnipeg Sun|agency=Sun Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094619/http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2006/05/29/1603249-sun.html|archive-date=2007-03-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isfeld|first1=Erin|title=Violence on 'Blue Mile' mars Oilers celebration|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060513/oilers_arrests_060513?s_name=&amp;no_ads=|accessdate=June 4, 2007|work=CTV News|agency=Bell Media|date=May 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017065956/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060513/oilers_arrests_060513?s_name=&amp;no_ads=|archivedate=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galashan|first1=Sarah|last2=Melenka|first2=Dez|title=Oilers defeat Hurricanes 4-0 in Cup's Game 6|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060617/stanley_game6_060617/20060617?hub=TopStories|accessdate=June 19, 2007|work=CTV News|agency=Bell Media|date=June 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819161047/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060617/stanley_game6_060617/20060617?hub=TopStories|archivedate=August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isfeld|first1=Erin|title=Edmonton Oilers fans looking forward to Cup final|url=http://www.ctv.ca:80/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060528/edmonton_fans_060528/20060528?hub=TopStories&amp;s_name=|accessdate=June 4, 2006|work=CTV News|agency=Bell Media|date=May 28, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011193357/http://www.ctv.ca:80/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060528/edmonton_fans_060528/20060528?hub=TopStories&amp;s_name=|archivedate=2006-10-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rowdy behaviour led the mayor of Edmonton, [[Stephen Mandel]], to threaten to close down the strip: "I hope this doesn't come down to having to shut down Whyte completely...but this will not be tolerated going into the final series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oiler fan turmoil|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2006/05/29/1603250-sun.html|accessdate=June 4, 2007|date=May 29, 2006|work=Winnipeg Sun|agency=Sun Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312175646/http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2006/05/29/1603250-sun.html|archive-date=2007-03-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Perihelion: The Prophecy''''' is an RPG developed by Morbid Visions and published by [[Psygnosis]] in 1993 for [[Amiga]] computer.

==Gameplay==
The player controls six characters who are supposed to save the realm they live in from an evil being which is slowly materialising into their dimension. The character races are rather unusual in RPGs and include Bionecrons, Symbions and various cross-breeds between humans, animals and mechanical entities.

The gameplay concerns juggling through the set of screens which are responsible for different parts of the game, such as exploring the dungeon and a world map, inventory management, spell creation (using a sophisticated runic system), network connections (used also for conversation purposes) and battle mode (a bit archaic, turn-based system). Everything is controlled from a set of icons.

The game has 16-bit graphics which are mostly in grey and orange shades. The sound and music are conducted with attention to details, and the music changes depending on the action on the screen.

==Notes==
The game entirely was created by only three people: Gyula Szentirmay (coder), Edvard Toth (graphic designer) and Zoltan Vech (musician). The whole management over the project was in hands of Edvard Toth who was responsible for the artwork, design, concept and story (in-game script and dialogue is big in size for almost 80 pages of written text).&lt;ref&gt;http://edvardtoth.com/games/perihelion/&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these three people would later help create the [[real-time strategy]] title ''[[Theocracy (computer game)|Theocracy]]''. {{Clarify|post-text='Many of three'?|date=May 2016}}

'''''Police Story 3: Super Cop''''' ({{zh|t=警察故事３超級警察|cy=gíng chaat gu sih sāam: Chīu kāp gíng chaat}}), also known as '''''Super Cop''''' in North America, is a 1992 [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action comedy  film]] starring [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]]. Jackie reprises his "Kevin" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] character, a [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong cop]] from ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' and ''[[Police Story 2]]''. It is the first in the [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'' series]] not to be directed by Jackie, with [[Stanley Tong]] taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for [[Maggie Cheung]] as Jackie's girlfriend, May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Supercop Gets Kicks From Footloose Style |work=The Los Angeles Times|date=26 July 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-26/entertainment/ca-27970_1_jackie-chan|accessdate=2010-10-23|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ka-Kui is the "supercop" of the [[Hong Kong]] police, with amazing [[martial arts]] skills. He is sent to [[Guangzhou]], where the Chinese police force's Interpol director, Inspector Jessica Yang ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat's organization, Ka-Kui is to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther, who is in a Chinese prison. Ka-Kui, posing as a petty criminal prisoner, manages Panther's escape with the connivance of the guards. Grateful Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat's gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.

On the way, they pass through Ka-Kui's supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. The local police pretend to arrest Ka-Kui in a restaurant, but Ka-Kui and Yang (also a martial-arts expert) escape after a big fight, which concludes with the faked killing of a policeman. This confirms Panther's trust in them.

In Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big [[opium]] grower's fortified compound in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] of [[Thailand]], for a meeting of big-time [[heroin]] traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat's gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat's gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat's price.

The action then shifts to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the [[Capital_punishment_in_Malaysia|death penalty]] for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]], and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.

A new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang – their cover now blown – to help free Chen.

Chaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.

==Production==
A significant aspect of this film is that it was the first Jackie Chan film from [[Hong Kong]] to use [[sync sound]], allowing all the actors' voices to be recorded as they spoke on scene, rather than dubbed over by different actors later.{{Citation needed|reason=Please add reference and contextual information.|date=May 2017}}

Exterior scenes were filmed in [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Interior scenes were shot in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

According to his book ''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', Chan dislocated his cheekbone during a stunt scene.&lt;ref name="I Am Jackie Chan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html |title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing |author=[[Jackie Chan]] |publisher=[[Random House]] |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The North American release by [[Dimension Films|Dimension]] was well received.

[[James Berardinelli]] of website ReelViews wrote:
"As is usual in a Chan film, the end credits (which show out-takes of failed stunts) are one of ''Supercop''{{'}}s highlights. There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]''. I can't think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie. Ultimately, the closing montage points out one of the chief differences between Chan's stylized, fast-paced films and those of his American counterparts: this is action with a smile, not a grimace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Supercop (aka Police Story 3): A Film Review by James Berardinelli|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/supercop.html|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Richard Harrington said:
"Chan seems to have met his soul mate in Khan [Yeoh's credited name], Asia's top female action star. Like Chan, Khan does her own fighting and stunts. Unlike the Hollywood action contingent, Chan and Khan don't rely on cinematic trickery. Theirs are not special effects, just spectacular ones. Connoisseurs will find Chan's helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[The Living Daylights]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/supercopharr.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=More Kicks From Jackie Chan | date=18 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. version of the film received a "Certified Fresh" rating of 96% on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

Furthermore, in 2009, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] named ''Police Story III'' as one of his favorite films of the past seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quentin Tarantino’s Top 20 Films of the Past 17 Years|url=http://www.filmjunk.com/2009/08/17/quentin-tarantinos-top-20-films-of-the-past-17-years/|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated that ''Supercop'' features the "greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-tarantinotop20/17/ |title=Quentin Tarantino's Top 20 Favorite Films |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 during a roundtable discussion, when asked which movie scene he would love to save for the last of humanity to see, he named the final scene of the movie as his choice. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheHollywoodReporter Roundtable Interview With Directors|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7qKKQrSBY|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/best-action-movies|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=The 100 best action movies|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Police Story 3: Super Cop'' was listed at 75th place on this list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116140621/www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-80-71|work=Time Out|accessdate=November 7, 2014|title=The 100 best action movies: 80-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimension version==
The [[Dimension Films]] version, which was distributed theatrically in North America in 1996, was retitled ''Supercop'', and was dubbed into [[American English]] with the participation of [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]].

Among the changes was the addition of a new score. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]' rendition of "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" plays over the end credits, followed by a song specially written and performed for the film by the band [[Devo]], entitled "Supercop".

This release was cut by approximately 10 minutes. These cuts include:
* Scenes of the police superiors getting a briefing about drug-related crimes.
* The police superiors discussing a plan to send Jackie Chan's character on an undercover mission.
* A scene where Yeoh tries to teach Chan about Mainland China.
* A longer version of the meeting with Chaibat in which the sexy women lounging about his mansion are revealed as drug addicts.

==DVD releases==
* The film was given a theatrical and VHS release in the United Kingdom, but has never been released on DVD in the United Kingdom.
* In January 1998, [[Dimension Films]] released their ''Supercop'' version.
* In Hong Kong, the film was initially released by [[Mega Star Video Distribution, Ltd.|Megastar]] and later, [[Deltamac]]. In 2004, it was re-released by [[Intercontinental Video Limited|IVL]]. This version was contained within a Police Story trilogy DVD boxset (Region 0 [[NTSC]]). All Hong Kong DVDs contain the original cut.
* In January 2009, the film was re-released in the west by [[Dragon Dynasty]] and [[the Weinstein Company]]. Although it has the original [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] soundtrack, it is cut to fit the visuals of the included Dimension ''Supercop'' version. It does not contain any of the scenes specific to the Hong Kong version.
* Hong Kong based company Kam &amp; Ronsom Enterprise announced that they would release the first three ''Police Story'' films on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/asia/china/e3i4e9a6c684b313de0498ce32a2dae08e3 Bruce Lee hits Blu-ray Disc]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoff==
{{Main|Once a Cop}}
Michelle Yeoh went on to star in a 1993 [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''[[Once a Cop]]'' or ''Project S''. Though it features a [[cameo appearance]] by [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Bill Tung]] reprises his role as "Uncle" Bill, this film is not a proper part of the ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'' series. Confusingly, some releases of this film were also entitled ''Supercop'' or ''Supercop 2''. In most Asian territories it was called ''Project S'', under which title the most comprehensive DVD was released by MIA.

==Popular culture==
The film inspired two missions in the 2004 videogame [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]], both of which were taken from the film's final scenes. The game's last mission, "End of The Line", where C.J must chase a firetruck with a red open-top car and catch Sean "Sweet" Johnson was taken from the scene where Jackie must chase a van using a red open-top car to catch Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh).

The mission "Wrong Side of The Tracks", where the player must follow a train from a dirt bike was taken from the scene where Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh) follows the train on a similar dirt bike.

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Supercop (soundtrack)}}
A soundtrack containing alternative rock and hip hop was released on 30 July 1996 by [[Interscope Records]]. It peaked at #133 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

[[File:Footpath signs.jpg|thumb|Footpath sign]]
'''In [[England and Wales]]''', other than in the 12 [[Inner London]] Boroughs and the [[City of London]], '''the "[[right of way]]"''' refers to paths on which the public have a legally protected right to pass and re-pass. The law in England and Wales differs from [[Scots law]] in that rights of way only exist where they are so designated (or are able to be designated if not already), whereas in Scotland any route that meets certain conditions is [[Rights of way in Scotland|defined as a right of way]], and in addition there is a general presumption of access to the countryside ("right to roam"). Private rights of way or [[easement]]s also exist (see also [[Highways in England and Wales]]).

==Inner London==
[[Definitive map]]s of public [[rights of way]] have been compiled for all of [[England and Wales]], as a result of the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], except the 12 [[Inner London]] boroughs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturenet.net/row/definitivemaps.html |title=Rights of Way Definitive Maps |website=Naturenet.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, along with the [[City of London]], were not covered by the Act. Definitive maps exist for the [[Outer London]] boroughs.

To protect the existing rights of way in London, the [[Ramblers]] launched their "Putting London on the Map" in 2010, with the aim of getting "the same legal protection for paths in the capital as already exists for footpaths elsewhere in England and Wales. Currently, legislation allows the Inner London boroughs to choose to produce definitive maps if they wish, but none do so".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130417035105/http://www.innerlondonramblers.org.uk/current-campaigns/putting-london-on-the-map.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch event of "Putting London on the Map" took place at the [[British Library]], and since then the 'Inner London Area' of the Ramblers has been working with [[Ramblers]] Central Office staff to try to persuade each of the Inner London boroughs of the desirability of producing definitive maps of rights of way".&lt;ref&gt;Inner London Ramblers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Lambeth Council]] passed a resolution to work towards creating a definitive map for their borough, but this does not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001857/https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/search/content/definitive%20map ]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[City of London]] has produced a Public Access Map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140814140927/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/housing-and-council-tax/land-charges-and-registers/Documents/public-access-map-internet-definition-of-public-access.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public footpaths{{anchor|Public footpath (England and Wales)}}==
{{See also|Footpath|Long-distance footpaths in the UK}}
[[File:TL0452 stile.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kissing gate]] with yellow footpath markings]]
[[File:Hampshire County Council Footpath Waymarker.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hampshire]] County Council footpath waymark.]]
In England and Wales a ''public footpath'' is a path on which the public have a legally protected right to travel on foot and in some areas public footpaths form a dense network of short paths. It is probable that most footpaths in the countryside are hundreds of years old. The majority of footpaths are shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps.

Local highways authorities (usually [[county council]]s or [[Unitary authority#United Kingdom|unitary authorities]]) are required to maintain the definitive map of all public rights of way in their areas and these can be inspected at council offices. If a path is shown on the [[definitive map]] and no subsequent legal order (such as a stopping up order) exists then the right of way is conclusive in law. Just because a path is not shown on that map does not mean that it is not a public path, as the rights may not have been recorded. The [[Countryside Agency]] estimated that over 10% of public paths were not yet listed on the definitive map. The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] provides that paths that are not recorded on the definitive map by 2026 and that were in use prior to 1949 will automatically be deemed stopped up on 1 January 2026.

The right of access on a public footpath normally only extends to walking (there may be other unrecorded rights as well), so there is usually no right to cycle or ride a horse on a public footpath. However, it is not a criminal offence to do so unless there is a traffic order or bylaw in place specifically: it is a [[tort|civil wrong]] to ride a [[bicycle]] or a [[horse]] on a public footpath, and action could be taken by the landowner for [[trespass]] or [[nuisance]] by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bedford.gov.uk/environment_and_planning/countryside/rights_of_way/what_is_a_public_right_of_way.aspx |title=What is a Public Right of Way |website=Bedford.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highway right to use a right of way is restricted to passing and re-passing, associated activities, and the taking of 'usual accompaniments'. Bedford Borough Council mentions that walkers may:
* take a pram, pushchair or wheelchair, where possible
* take a dog as long as on a lead or under close control
* admire the view, stop for a rest, have a small picnic on the verge	
* take a short alternative route to get round an obstruction

==Public bridleways{{anchor|Public bridleway (England and Wales)}}==
{{see also|Bridle path}}
[[File:NY0612 bridleway.jpg|thumb|Bridleway fingerpost]]
A ''public bridleway'' is a way over which the [[general public]] have the following, but normally (unless otherwise according to Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981 s56(1)(b)) no other rights: 
*to travel on foot and
*to travel on [[horseback]] or leading a [[horse]], with or without a right to drive [[animal]]s of any description along the way.

Note that although Section 30 of the Countryside Act 1968 permits the riding of bicycles on public bridleways, the act says that it "shall not create any obligation to facilitate the use of the bridleway by cyclists". Thus, the right to cycle exists even though it may be difficult to exercise on occasion. Cyclists using a bridleway are obliged to give way to other users on foot or horseback.

Public bridleways are shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps, but many public bridleways (as well as "roads used as public paths", "byways open to all traffic" and "restricted byways") were recorded as footpaths only as a result of the burden of maintenance required by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and so are now wrongly recorded on the definitive map.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Susan; Hogg, Sue (1997). What is a cross road?. South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust. Page 41, 42. {{ISBN|978-0953057306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitive Map Modification Orders are needed to correct these errors.

=={{Anchor|BOAT|Byway open to all traffic}}Byways open to all traffic==
[[File:Grendon, Northamptonshire byway.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Northamptonshire]] byway]]
{{See also|Byway (road)}}
A ''byway open to all traffic (or BOAT)'' is a [[highway]] over which the [[general public]] have a right to travel for [[vehicle|vehicular]] and all other kinds of [[traffic]], but which is used by the public mainly as footpaths and bridleways are used, per [[Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/15#section-15-9-c section 15(9)(c)], as amended by Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Act 1991, Schedule 1.

After the 2006 Regulations to the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], BOATs should now more properly be referred to simply as byways.

==Roads used as public paths{{Anchor|RUPP|Road used as public path}}==
A ''road used as public path (RUPP)'' was one of the three types of public right of way (along with footpaths and bridleways) introduced by the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The Countryside Act 1968 required all highway authorities to reclassify RUPPs in their area – occasionally as public footpaths but in practice generally as public bridleways unless public vehicular rights were demonstrated to exist in which case it would become a 'byway open to all traffic'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/41/schedule/3/enacted#schedule-3-part-III |title=Countryside Act 1968 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2016-10-06 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process was slow as it involved research into historic usage and often public enquiries, and so was not completed by the time the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] was passed. This reclassified all remaining RUPPs as 'restricted byways' on 2 May 2006.

==Restricted byways{{anchor|Restricted byway (England and Wales)}}==
On 2 May 2006 the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/16/contents Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006] reclassified all remaining Roads Used as Public Paths as ''restricted byways''. The public's rights along a restricted byway are to travel:
*on foot
*on horseback or leading a horse
*by any vehicle (e.g. bicycles, horse-drawn carriages) other than mechanically propelled vehicles (e.g. motorbikes or cars) unless vehicular rights pre-existed, then the act did not extinguish those rights

==Permissive path {{anchor|Permissive path (England and Wales)}}==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:River Wensum Footpath.JPG|200px|thumb|Permissive path along [[River Wensum]], [[Norfolk]], England]]
A permissive path, permitted path or concessionary path is a path (which could be for walkers, riders, cyclists, or any combination) whose use is allowed by the landowner. It would normally be a path that is not at the time on the definitive map of public rights of way but that does not prevent it from already being a public path for any or all of those user categories mentioned. For instance it might be a historic route fallen into disuse or it might have been used for twenty years 'as of right' by the public, in both cases being a public right of way which is not yet shown on the definitive map. Some permissive footpaths and bridleways are shown on 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scale Ordnance Survey maps.

A permissive path is often closed on a specified calendar day each year (lawful only if it is not already a public right of way of some description), and clearly signed (e.g. signpost or waymark) as permissive. The act of so closing or signing it ensures that any future use of it does not count towards the 20 years' use 'as of right' needed to establish its public status. These are precautions to prevent it becoming designated as a statutory right of way in relation to its permitted use.

==Right to roam==
Under the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] the public also has a right to walk away from rights of way on designated "[[Freedom to roam|access land]]". This right is in addition to rights of way, and does not extend to horse-riders or cyclists. Access land may be closed for up to 28 days per year, whereas rights of way must remain open at all times, except in exceptional circumstances with special permission of the local authority.

==Creation of new public rights of way==
A footpath, bridleway or restricted byway can be created by one of the following means.

=== Dedication ===
In England and Wales, a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway may be expressly dedicated by the owner as a public right of way.  Furthermore, unchallenged use by the public, as of right, for at least 20 years, may give rise to a presumption of dedication under Section 31 of the [[Highways Act 1980]]. A presumption of dedication may arise under common law after any appropriate period of time, by way of a presumed deed that has been lost; known as the doctrine of "modern lost grant". Paths created by express dedication since 1949 are ''not'' automatically maintainable at the public expense as a result of s.49 [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].&lt;ref&gt;Riddall, J &amp; Trevelyan, J, ''Rights of Way; A guide to Law and Practice'', 4th edition, {{ISBN|978-1-901184-99-0}}, page 275&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public path creation agreement ===
Section 25 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a local authority (that is, a district or county council, or a unitary authority) to enter into an agreement (known as a 'public path creation agreement') with a relevant landowner to create a footpath or bridleway over land in their area. The local authority has to consult any other local authority in whose area the path will be, but does not have to consult wider. There is no provision for anyone else to be consulted or to object. The agreement must be advertised in the local paper, and the route is automatically maintainable at public expense.

=== Agreement between a parish council and landowner ===
Section 30 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a parish council (community council in Wales) to enter into an agreement with a relevant landowner to create a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway over land in their area or in an adjacent parish. The parish council is under no obligation to consult anyone. All they have to do is reach an agreement with the landowner. There is no provision for anyone else to be consulted or to object. The path is not automatically maintainable at the public expense.

=== Public path creation order ===
Section 26 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a local authority (that is, a district or county council, or a unitary authority) to make an order to create a footpath or bridleway over land in their area. If there are no objections, the local authority can confirm the order themselves, so bringing the path into effect. However, where objections have been made, the order will need to be considered by an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate. Depending on the number and nature of the objections, he may consider the order after an exchange of written representations between the authority and the objectors, after holding a hearing, or after a public local inquiry. People who would like to use the path should submit letters saying why they need the path.

=== Street works authority ===
Section 228 of the Highways Act 1980 is mainly used by the street works authority (county council or unitary authority) to declare a street to be a highway maintainable at public expense. The street works authority has to perform works on the route. Such street works need only be appropriate to the type of highway to which the notice relates. So for a potential bridleway, if the grass is cut, or a hedge cut back, this could constitute street works for the purpose of this section, so enabling it to be used. The authority then places s.228 "Adoption of Streets" notices at each end of the route. Only the owner of a street (or if more than one, the majority of the owners) has the power to object. If there is an objection, the street works authority can either discontinue, or it can go to the magistrates' court. A path created by this method will be maintainable at the public expense. Hampshire County Council has used this method for footpaths,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970722055042/http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c21425.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; and Essex County Council often uses it for new bridleways.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Rights of way improvement plans==
Each [[highway authority]] in England and Wales (other than [[Transport for London]], the [[City of London]] and [[Inner London]] boroughs) was required to produce a Rights of Way Improvement Plan under sections 60 to 62 of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] within five years of the date on which Section 60 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act came into force; this deadline was 21 November 2007. Each highway authority is required to review their Rights of Way Improvement Plan at least every ten years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16256">'''SATO''' (Springfield and the Ozarks) 48 is an annual contest held in [[Springfield, Missouri]] an open to entrants from around the globe. The event challenges local filmmakers to create a five-minute short film from scratch over the course of 48 hours from Friday-Sunday, usually during the month of April. No production may take place before an inspiration package is distributed at the kick-off event. Each film entry must then be conceived, written, directed, edited, output, and delivered directly to the festival heads within the specified 48-hour period.  Late turn-ins are accepted for screening if they meet the inspiration package criteria but are ineligible for any award nominations.

The short films &amp; accompanying posters are then premiered and showcased at a local theatre, and are later evaluated by an international panel of judges who decide which films receive awards and nominations.

==Inspiration package==
At the launch event, the organizers provide to each team an “inspiration package” which contains specific elements the film must include. These elements can include anything from a prop (or visual element) to a character to a line of dialogue to an idea or concept.  The inspiration package may also contain limitations such as being able to use only one weapon, no weapons, et cetera.

In celebration of their fifth anniversary, the SATO48-2010 “inspiration package” had five components:

*A distinctive SOUND must figure into:
**the beginning of your Film and
**the conclusion of your Film.
*A turning point in your Film must involve a SHADOW.
*The PROP, a hardcopy print out of the “SATO48 FilmHead,” must be prominently visible in at least one scene.
*We have emailed you the SATO48 FilmHead in gif, jpeg, and Photoshop formats.  You must change this image, in any way you wish (digital form or hardcopy),  and use it at least once in your Film.
*The number 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, and finally 5 must appear IN SEQUENCE in your Film.  Only one number is to be used per scene or segment.

{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===2012===
*The following four words must be used within the film either visually or audibly; Founder, Lover, Inventor, Mentor.
**In addition to using the words, each of the two principal characters should be one of the four words.
*Each team received 2 random Pez dispensers.
**Each pez must be disguised in some way, but also be recognized as the "prop"
**Each pez must be utilized independently in a scene, but also must appear together in a separate scene.

The '''San Francisco Sound''' refers to rock music performed live and recorded by [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] community in San Francisco during these years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=  "The Hippie Temptation" (segment) CBS News report on Haight-Ashbury | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zHmi9y-KLo |accessdate= 2013-04-12 | author= Reasoner, Harry &amp; Wallace, Warren  1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Bob 2013 ''Yeah, Yeah, Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop''. London: Faber and Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, "A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore."&lt;ref&gt;Vulliamy, Ed  "Love and Haight". ''The Guardian / The Observer''. 20 May 2007. Retrieved from Web October 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay-Area-based jazz critic and columnist [[Ralph J. Gleason]] had established the first journal (''Jazz Information'') devoted to jazz, in 1939. Gleason was open to new pathways. He admired San Francisco's new music scene in the mid-1960s, and wanted to draw attention to it. According to an announcer for a TV show that Gleason hosted: "In his syndicated newspaper column, Mr. Gleason has been the foremost interpreter of the sounds coming out of what he calls 'the Liverpool of the United States.' Mr. Gleason believes the San Francisco rock groups are making a serious contribution to musical history."&lt;ref name="April 8, 1967: Ralph Gleason TV Interview"&gt;{{cite web

The first serious journal of rock music, ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy]]'', had been founded in the eastern U.S. in 1966 by [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]]. However, Ralph Gleason, shortly after the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], became one of the founders of what would become the nation's dominant rock-scene fan journal, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:1966 Early Jefferson Airplane.JPG|thumb|left|Jefferson Airplane's original personnel]]The new sound, which melded many musical influences, was perhaps heralded in the live performances of the [[Jefferson Airplane]] (from 1965 on), who put out an LP record earlier than nearly all the other new bands (September 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19800/m1/ |title=Show 41&amp;nbsp;– The Acid Test: Psychedelics and a sub-culture emerge in San Francisco |show=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Douglas Brinkley, celebrated author [[Hunter S. Thompson]], one of the Bay Area cultural-scene boosters, was a big early fan of the group: "Thompson extolled the sonic energy of the Jefferson Airplane as it pulsed around the California locales that nursed the psychedelic era..."&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Douglas 1999  "Introduction" in Hunter S. Thompson's ''Hell's Angels'', The Modern Library edition, New York: Random House.  p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the "Beat Generation" style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting. Acoustic music had had an avid following far and wide, but it was "a fading world of traditional folk and Brechtian art songs." &lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Karen 2001 ''Joni Mitchell: Shadows and Light''. London:Virgin Books, pp.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; The entire tone of the ''new'' subculture was different. According to biography author Robert Greenfield, "Jon McIntire [manager of the Grateful Dead from the late sixties to the mid-eighties] points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of joy. The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenfield |first=Robert |format=interview |title=The Burden of Being Jerry |url=http://www.levity.com/gans/SFFocus.html |accessdate=2013-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new music was loud and community-connected: bands sometimes presented free concerts in [[Golden Gate Park]] and "[[happening]]s" at the city's several psychedelic clubs and ballrooms. The many bands that formed signalled a shift from one subculture to the next.

[[Monterey, California]] is about 120 road miles south of San Francisco. At the June 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]], Bay Area groups ([[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Big Brother and The Holding Company]]) performed from the same stage as established and fast-rising musical groups and well-known individual artists from the U.S., England, and even India. Soon after, Ralph J. Gleason and [[Jann Wenner]], based in San Francisco, established ''Rolling Stone'' magazine (first issue's date: November 1967).
  
Each San Francisco band had its characteristic sound, but enough commonalities existed that there was a regional identity. By 1967, fresh and adventurous improvisation during live performance (which many heard as being epitomized by the Grateful Dead and by the "cross-talk" guitar work of [[Moby Grape]]) was one characteristic of the San Francisco Sound. A louder, more prominent role for the electric bass—typically with a melodic or semi-melodic approach, and using a plush, pervasive tone—was another feature.&lt;ref&gt;Melhuish, Martin &amp; Hall, Mark (1999)  ''Wired for Sound: A Guitar Odyssey''.  Kingston Ontario: Quarry Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This questing bass quality has been wryly characterized as a "roving" (rather than the conventional "stay-at-home") style. In jazz it had been exuberantly pioneered by numerous musicians—and such bassists as [[Charles Mingus]], [[Scott LaFaro]], and [[Steve Swallow]] had taken it into very exploratory places. A musician who was a leading example of this, [[Jack Casady]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]] (and the offshoot [[Hot Tuna]]) pioneered the approach, perhaps best represented on the album ''[[Bless Its Pointed Little Head]]''. [[Phil Lesh]], bassist with the Grateful Dead, furthered this sound. Lesh had developed his style on the foundation of having studied classical, brass-band, jazz, and modernist music on the violin and later the trumpet.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book |title=Garcia: An American Life |last=Jackson |first=Blair |year=1999 |page=74 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-14-029199-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration of chordal progressions previously uncommon in rock &amp; roll, and a freer and more powerful use of all instruments (drums and other percussion, electric guitars, keyboards, as well as the bass) went along with this "[[Psychedelic era|psychedelic]]-era" music. Brasses and reeds, such as trumpets and saxophones were rarely used, unlike in contemporary [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[soul music|soul]] bands and some of the white bands from the U.S. East Coast (e.g., [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]] or [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]). [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]], a San Francisco-based group that got its start in the late 1960s, was an exception, being a racially integrated hippie band with a hefty influence from soul music, hence making use of brass instrumentation.

"Rock &amp; roll" was the point of departure for the new music. But well known stars of rock &amp; roll "were being called fifties primitives" by this time.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard (2011) ''Conversations with Scorsese'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf, pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period when "rock" was differentiating itself from rock &amp; roll, partly due to the upshot of the [[British Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;n.a. 2010 "Rock and Roll". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; In San Francisco, musical influences came in from not only [[London]], [[Liverpool]], and [[Manchester]], but also included the bi-coastal [[American folk music revival]] of the 1950s and 1960s, the [[Chicago#Music|Chicago]] [[electric blues]] scene, the [[soul music]] scenes in [[Music of Detroit|Detroit]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio|Muscle Shoals]], [[jazz]] styles of various eras and regions. A number of key San Francisco rock musicians of the era cited [[John Coltrane]] and his circle of leading-edge jazz musicians as important influences.

The journalist Ed Vulliamy wrote: "The Summer of Love had an empress, and her name was [[Janis Joplin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Vulliamy, Ed  "Love and Haight". ''The Guardian / The Observer''. 20 May 2007. Retrieved from Web October 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Women, in a few cases, enjoyed an equal status with men as stars in the San Francisco rock scene—but these few instances signaled a shift that has continued in the U.S. music scene. Both [[Grace Slick]] (singing with Jefferson Airplane) and Joplin (singing initially with Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company) gained a substantial following locally and, before long, across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties" documentary (part 1)  | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcVEnQpNbc | accessdate=2013-04-12 | author=  Bove, Tony &amp; Donahue, Raechel   et al. n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another woman singer (and songwriter), [[Stevie Nicks]], as a child had recurrently moved in the U.S. with her family. Coming of age in the San Francisco Bay Area, she gained her first performing experience there in the '60s with [[Lindsey Buckingham]]'s rock band. Eventually both Nicks and Buckingham achieved international exposure and acclaim once their California talents were absorbed into the established British rock band [[Fleetwood Mac]] in 1975.

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Performances of an international super group like the Beatles were hosted in a huge venue like the Cow Palace. At first, the local Bay Area bands played in smaller ones. The early band venues, while the new SF scene was emerging from folk and folk-rock beginnings, were often places like the [[The Matrix (club)|Matrix]] nightclub. As audiences grew, and audience dancing became customary, performances moved into venues with more floor space, such as the Longshoreman's Hall, the Fillmore Auditorium, the Avalon Ballroom, Winterland, and the Carousel Ballroom (which was later renamed Fillmore West). Outdoor performances, often organized by the band members themselves and their friends, also played their part.

Because San Francisco had an especially vibrant and attractive countercultural scene in the latter half of the 1960s, musicians from elsewhere (along with the famous hip multitude) came there. Some stayed and became part of the scene. Examples include the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]], whose music took on more of the character of the San Francisco Sound, while yet retaining some of its original Texas flavor, [[Mother Earth (band)|Mother Earth]], fronted by female lead singer [[Tracy Nelson (singer)|Tracy Nelson]], who relocated to the Bay Area from Nashville, and the [[Electric Flag]], bringing Chicago blues to the Bay Area care of former [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]]. [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] (who formed the Steve Miller Band) was from Wisconsin, by way of Chicago and New York City while bandmate [[Boz Scaggs]] originally called Texas home.

==AM and FM radio==
The San Francisco bands' music was everything that AM-radio pop music wasn't. Their performances contrasted with the "standard three-minute track" that had become a cliché of the pop-music industry, due to the requirements of AM radio, to the sound capacity of the 45 RPM record, and to the limited potentials of many pop songs and song treatments. It is true that many of the San Francisco bands did record "three-minute" tracks when they desired pop-music station airplay for a song. But in live performance, the bands would often share their improvisatory zest by playing a given song or sequence for as long as five or six minutes, and occasionally for as long as half an hour. In early 1967, [[Tom Donahue]]–a veteran disc jockey, rock concert producer, songwriter, and music-act manager–was inspired to revive a moribund radio station, KMPX, and inaugurate the first FM-radio rock station, in San Francisco, in order to showcase this type of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties" documentary (part 1)  | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcVEnQpNbc | accessdate=2013-04-12 | author=  Bove, Tony &amp; Donahue, Raechel   et al. n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donahue was uniquely qualified, being savvy and enthusiastic about jazz, R&amp;B, Soul, and ethnic music, besides the then-current rock music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peiTJ2FnD3Q Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh 1967 Interview, Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; An important departure in this new era of "album oriented radio" (AOR) was that show hosts felt free to play lengthy tracks or two or more tracks at a time from a good record album.

The '''Scottish Society of Playwrights''' (SSP) is a professional member’s organisation representing [[theatre]] [[playwright]]s in [[Scotland]]. It is affiliated to the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]], and party to the [[Theatrical Management Association]] playwright’s agreement.

==History==

The Scottish Society of Playwrights was founded at a meeting of Scotland's playwrights held in the Netherbow Theatre in September 1973, at the instigation of Hector MacMillan, [[Ena Lamont Stewart]], and John Hall. It was established in response to a need for a co-ordinated voice for playwrights to be heard in Scottish theatre and to act as a playwriting development and promotional agency. It was formally established, after its constitution was drafted by Ian Brown, its first Chair, Hector MacMillan and Ada F Kay in November 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brown, 'More to Come', Edinburgh Review 137, 2013, pp. 90-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first twelve years of its existence the SSP received funding from the Scottish Arts Council. This meant that, besides such tasks as negotiating the first national contract for playwrights with the Federation of Scottish
Theatre and representing playwrights in dispute with theatre managements, the Society was able to act as a major development agency for playwrights.

During this period, based on the work of the US National Playwrights' Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Center, it developed the model of playwrights' workshops that is now recognised and used throughout the UK by such institutions as North West Playwrights Workshop and the Performing Arts
Lab.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brown, 'Playwrights' workshops of the Scottish Society of Playwrights, the Eugene O'Neill Center  and their long term impact in the UK', International Journal of Scottish Theatre and Screen, 4.2 (2011) pp. 35-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It also published important, but neglected, texts, offered members at-cost copying and published a Newsletter which developed in time into Scottish Theatre News. It appointed administrators, firstly Linda Haase and later Charles Hart, who provided outstanding service, Linda Haase going on to help found the Tron Theatre and Charles Hart to be New Writing Officer of the Arts Council in England.

In the mid-eighties, the Scottish Arts Council rethought its funding priorities and decided to withdraw funding from what it called 'support services' in favour of 'direct provision'. It was impervious to the fact that support for playwrights through the SSP was in fact direct provision.

In 1985, the SSP had to close down its lively and wide-ranging workshop, publishing and copying activities and concentrate on its primary role representing the playwrights of Scotland.

In 1986, with the Writers Guild and Theatre Writers Union, it negotiated its agreement with the Theatrical Management Association for the benefit of Scottish playwrights presenting work in England and Wales. Since then, it has represented the interests of playwrights throughout Scotland and abroad, leading a successful playwrights' strike in the early nineties and yet maintaining positive relations with theatre management organisations, north and south of the Border. The SSP continues to be more than simply a negotiating body. In recent years, it has, for example, held a conference in Inverness for northern based playwrights (1999) and produced the first authoritative directory of Scottish playwrights (2001).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10010">'''Tartan Features''' is a filmmaking network and distribution platform based in Scotland. It supports the production of [[micro-budget]] [[feature film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/611/alison-piper-reclaiming-film-how-tartan-features-giving-scots-filmmakers-vital-network|title=Alison Piper: Reclaiming film - how Tartan Features is giving Scots filmmakers a vital network of support|date=2015-03-06|work=CommonSpace|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Tartan Features was established in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yearzerofilmmaking.com/single-post/2018/01/22/Five-Years-%E2%80%93-And-the-changes-seen-in-the-Scottish-Indie-Film-Community|title=Year Zero Filmmaking {{!}} Punk Rock Cinema|website=Year Zero Filmmaking {{!}} Punk Rock Cinema|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name is in reference to the defunct "Tartan Shorts" filmmaking strand run by the Scottish Screen Production Fund (later [[Scottish Screen]]) and [[BBC Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yearzerofilmmaking.com/single-post/2016/06/22/Tartan-Features-Why-Micro-Budget-Features|title=Year Zero Filmmaking {{!}} Punk Rock Cinema|website=Year Zero Filmmaking {{!}} Punk Rock Cinema|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Tartan Features made their first venture into do-it-yourself cinema distribution. Their first feature, ''Sarah's Room'' (then titled ''To Here Knows When'') was screened at the Edinburgh Filmhouse Cinema via a collaboration with the independent short film night, Write-Shoot-Cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/filmhouse/docs/feb14medres|title=issuu.com {{!}} {{!}} Filmhouse Brochure|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the first opportunity in Scotland for independent filmmakers to have their micro-budget feature films to be screened regularly in a cinema. ''Sarah's Room'' was followed by three other Tartan Features Write-Shoot-Cut collaborations during 2014: ''Skeletons'', ''Take It Back and Start All Over Again'' and ''A Practical Guide to a Spectacular Suicide''.

== Films ==
The Tartan Features roster of films are numbered in the style of the independent record labels from which they take inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yearzerofilmmaking.com/single-post/2018/04/16/Year-Zero-Tartan-Features-Eventography|title=Year Zero Filmmaking {{!}} Punk Rock Cinema|website=Year Zero Filmmaking {{!}} Punk Rock Cinema|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of films under the Tartan Features banner have reached critical acclaim, including [[Big Gold Dream]], receiving warm reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/film/documentary-explores-birth-of-edinburgh-indie-scene-1-3801914|title=Documentary explores birth of Edinburgh indie scene|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://louderthanwar.com/film-preview-big-gold-dream-scottish-post-punk-infiltrating-mainstream-1977-82/|title=Film Preview - Big Gold Dream: Scottish Post-Punk and Infiltrating the Mainstream- 1977-82|date=2015-06-15|work=Louder Than War|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plaudits in end-of-year lists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/28701/1/the-best-music-documentaries-of-the-year|title=The best music documentaries of the year|last=Dazed|date=2015-12-03|work=Dazed|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the award-winning [[Where Do We Go from Here?

'''''The 9th Life of Louis Drax''''' is a 2016 Canadian-American [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] directed by [[Alexandre Aja]], written by [[Max Minghella]] based on [[Liz Jensen]]'s best-selling novel of the same title, and starring [[Jamie Dornan]], [[Sarah Gadon]], Aiden Longworth, [[Oliver Platt]], [[Molly Parker]], [[Julian Wadham]], [[Jane McGregor]], [[Barbara Hershey]], and [[Aaron Paul]].

The film was released in the United States and United Kingdom on September 2, 2016, by [[Summit Entertainment|Summit Premiere]] and [[Soda Pictures]].

==Plot==

Louis Drax (Longworth), a 9-year-old boy, narrates that throughout his short life he has survived a series of near-fatal accidents, and the most recent one involves a suspicious fall off a cliff during a picnic with his parents, the cause of which he does not explain. Through a series of flashbacks, Louis's sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Perez (Platt) are shown. Perez asks Louis about his opinions and past, learning that Louis exhibits certain peculiar behaviors, such as a distrust of men and repeated killings of his pet hamsters, an act Louis justifies by calling it "The Right of Disposal." Perez is suspicious of Louis's relationship with his father, Peter (Paul). Additional flashbacks reveal a strained relationship between Peter and Louis's mother, Natalie (Gadon), including an incident where Peter and Louis run into Peter's ex-wife during a trip to [[SeaWorld]], resulting in a fight between Peter and Natalie. Despite Dr. Perez promising that everything Louis told him would be confidential, he tells Natalie about his concerns, causing her to end the sessions as she believes Perez is interfering with her marriage.

In the present, a doctor examining Louis after his latest accident pronounces him dead. After Louis is transported to the morgue, however, he suddenly awakes, and is placed in intensive care in a coma. Meanwhile, Peter, who has disappeared, is immediately the primary suspect in the possible attempted murder of Louis. Louis's case attracts the attention of Dr. Allan Pascal (Dornan), who is fascinated by Louis's sudden turnaround and becomes the lead doctor in charge of Louis's care. Despite Allan being married, he and Natalie share a mutual attraction, and he kisses her one-day while the two go on a walk, which is seen by everyone. As soon as this happens, Louis briefly awakens from his coma, only to mutter 'my dad' before falling back unconscious.

Natalie and Allan receive threatening letters telling them to stay away from each other, with the author of said letters claiming to be Louis himself. Dalton (Parker), the lead investigator on Louis's case, believes the letters to be written by Peter. To help find the writer, everyone in the hospital submits to a handwriting test. For Natalie's protection, she is given a room in the hospital to stay in until Peter is found. Dalton warns Allan not to become involved with Natalie, telling him that not only is Peter not Louis's real father, but at one point Natalie attempted to give Louis up for adoption. Natalie confesses to Allan that Louis was the result of a rape from a different man, and despite Dalton's warnings, she and Allan have sex.

Louis is visited in the hospital by his grandmother, Peter's mother Violet (Hershey). Violet, who notices Allan and Natalie's relationship, warns Allan that Natalie is unstable and manipulative, implying she has lied about multiple things including her rape. Dalton suddenly enters, informing Violet and Allan that Peter's body has been found at the bottom of a cliff, having been dead for several days.

While all of the above is happening, Louis continues to narrate, seemingly aware of everything going on despite being in a coma. At certain points he is visited by a mysterious, deformed creature covered in seaweed, who gives him advice and encouragement. Allan also sees this creature at one point in a dream he has while sleeping by Louis's side. Louis visits the creature in a cave, and it is ultimately revealed that it is Louis's manifestation of Peter, who was found dead in a cave covered in seaweed. The Peter creature is very kind to and protective of Louis, and Louis doesn't want to leave him.

One day, while waking up from a nap, Allan is told by another doctor that not only did he sleepwalk during his nap, but he also wrote a prescription for Natalie, for dangerous doses of [[insulin]] and [[chloroform]]. This, combined with Allan's other dreams and the suspicious letters, leads Allan to believe that while he sleeps, Louis has somehow been controlling him and his actions. This is further supported when it is discovered that Allan's handwriting matches that of the threatening letters. Allan informs Dr. Perez, who decides to work with Allan to get to the bottom of the situation. He hooks Allan up to an [[EKG]] and through meditative exercises manages to directly communicate with Louis via Allan's mind and voice.

Louis reveals what happened during the picnic: Natalie tries to give Louis some candy but refuses to allow Peter to have any, making Peter suspicious about Natalie possibly harming Louis and leading to a fight. Louis flees to the cliff edge, while Natalie and Peter follow and get into a scuffle, which ends when Natalie pushes Peter off the cliff to his death. Louis sees this and despite Natalie's pleas, walks off the edge of the cliff on his own in an apparent suicide attempt.

At this point, Louis's heartbeat suddenly stops and Allan wakes up. While Allan tries to revive him with a [[defibrillator]], it is shown that Natalie is responsible for Louis's 'accidents', having done things such as poison his candy, electrocute him while near a socket, and smother him with a pillow. Allan succeeds in restarting Louis's heart while Natalie looks on.

Some time later, Allan moves out after separating from his wife. He visits Natalie, who has been placed in a psychiatric ward under Dr. Perez's care. Perez explains to Allan that he has diagnosed Natalie with [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], and her multiple abuses of Louis were her attempts to grow closer to him by 'saving' him from near-death situations, which she herself put him in. It is shown that Natalie is now pregnant, presumably with Allan's child.

In a final narration, Louis ponders the fact that his mother was 'the bad one' and whether being in a coma forever is bad, as it allows him to stay with his father. Peter's voice, however, tells Louis that the world is beautiful and he needs to grow up and live his life. Louis finally awakens from his coma, and the film ends.

[[File:TheMemoirsOfAnAmnesiac.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Memoirs of an Amnesiac''''' is the [[autobiography]] of [[composer]], radio, and television personality [[Oscar Levant]]. Published in 1965 by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], it was Levant's second best-seller, following a quarter-century after his first book, ''A Smattering of Ignorance''.

Levant intersperses his reminisces about Hollywood in its heyday with one-liners and pithy quotes by himself and others. When asked about writing a book on [[Victor Herbert]] by a publisher, for example, Levant remarked "I wouldn't even ''read'' one!" [[Dorothy Parker]], when Levant asked her if she ever took [[barbiturates|sleeping pills]], supposedly answered, "In a big bowl with sugar and cream."

Witty, acerbic, and often self-deprecating, the book casually drops scores of famous names such as Levant's good friend [[George Gershwin]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Otto Klemperer]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Harpo Marx]], [[Irving Berlin]], and [[Joseph P. Kennedy]]. It serves as both a Who's Who of Hollywood over three decades—skewering fellow musicians, actors, [[conducting|conductors]], [[politician]]s, and [[gangster]]s--and a harrowing personal tale of [[neurosis|neuroses]] and [[obsessions]]. Levant details in particular his harrowing time in [[mental hospital|psychiatric ward]]s, his addictions to [[Demerol]] and [[paraldehyde]]; his experiences with [[electroconvulsive therapy]], well-meaning but useless [[psychiatrist]]s, and unscrupulous [[Physician|quacks]]; and how his long-suffering wife June and his three daughters endured his numerous eccentricities, superstitions, and hangups. 

:''I was an inert, happy-go-lucky derelict who could''
:''have been created by [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]].''

:''I have a [[Extra-sensory perception|sixth sense]]; I lack the other five.''

:When Jack Paar asked Levant what he did for exercise, Oscar answered, "''I stumble and fall into a coma.''"

:When Oscar told his wife June that he was in the hospital again, she responded with "''Gesundheit''!"

'''''Howard Crabtree's When Pigs Fly''''' is a [[Revue|musical revue]] in two [[Act (drama)|acts]] conceived by Howard Crabtree and Mark Waldrop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/4074/howard-crabtrees-when-pigs-fly "Howard Crabtree's 'When Pigs Fly' "] samuelfrench.com, {{ISBN|9780573623318}}, accessed August 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The revue has music by [[Dick Gallagher]] and lyrics by co-conceiver, sketch writer and director Mark Waldrop. The revue opened [[Off-Broadway]] in 1996 and ran for two years, and received the [[Outer Critics Circle]] Award for Best Off-Broadway Musical and the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Best Musical Revue.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;Ruhlman, William. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/when-pigs-fly-mw0000087639 'When Pigs Fly'] allmusic.com, accessed August 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The revue opened Off-Broadway on August 14, 1996 at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre, and closed on August 15, 1998 after 840 performances.&lt;ref name=closing&gt;[[Simonson, Robert]] and Lefkowitz, David. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/40461-Last-Chance-Crabtrees-Pigs-To-Give-Last-Oink-Aug-15 "Last Chance: Crabtree's 'Pigs' To Give Last Oink Aug. 15"] ''Playbill'', August 12, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Mark Waldrop with costumes by Howard Crabtree, the cast included Stanley Bojarski, John Treacy Egan, [[David Pevsner]], Jay Rogers, and Michael West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/461 ''When Pigs Fly'' Listing"] lortel.org, accessed October 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the show derives from Crabtree's school counselor, who said that Crabtree's ambition to "put on stage shows" would happen "when pigs fly."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Mary. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19970207&amp;id=1SlUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4013,2041216 "Howard Crabtree"] ''Boca Raton News'' (The Associated Press), February 7, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Crabtree died on June 28, 1996. Waldrop noted "It's a show...inspired by costumes--and, just by extension, the exuberance of Howard's spirit and his desire to just put it out there.... Without Howard, it's inconceivable that I would have written a gay revue."&lt;ref&gt;Haun, Harry.

An Off-Broadway revival, directed once again by Mark Waldrop, with choreography by Denis Jones and costumes by [[Bob Mackie]], was scheduled to begin previews on October 6, 2017 and open October 30, 2017 at Stage 42.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard, Jeremy. [http://deadline.com/2017/08/bob-mackie-designs-howard-crabtrees-when-pigs-fly-off-broadway-1202148076/ " 'When Pigs Fly' Off Broadway"] ''Variety'', August 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The cast was to feature Jordan Ahnquist, Taylor Crousore, Jacob Hoffman, Brian Charles Rooney and Frank Viveros. However, on October 2, 2017, the producers announced that the revival is canceled. The reason given was that "a shortfall in the show’s investment has made it impossible for the production to continue."&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam. [http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadway-revival-of-when-pigs-fly-abruptly-canceled# "Off-Broadway Revival of 'When Pigs Fly' Abruptly Canceled"] Playbill, October 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The concept of the revue is that "Howard" stages a musical. As he struggles to do so, dealing with the large egos of performers or scenery gone wrong, he hears the words of his high school counselor, "Miss Roundhole". She sarcastically said, "When pigs fly!" in response to his ambitions. The characters in the revue (all played by men) appear in sketches: a song to unlikely loves ("Torch Song #1"); four life-sized queens from a deck of playing cards ("You've Got to Stay in the Game"); and dancers make a case for being yourself ("Light in the Loafers"). "The Melody Barn" is a take-off on classic summer stock themes; "Laughing Matters," is a defense of fun in sad times.

"The wigs alone...are like tone poems of camp: pillowy, cartoon-land creations, threatening to lift the men beneath them somewhere, fully aloft.... Crabtree's visual creations are the reason for this drag-intensive show's being."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips,Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/28/entertainment/ca-50906 "'Pigs Fly' and Campy Wit Soars"] ''Los Angeles Times'', June 28, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] wrote that the revue is "...an exceptionally cheerful, militantly gay new musical revue that comes close to living up to its own billing, 'the side-splitting musical extravaganza.' No sides are ever in serious danger of splitting. Yet there's enough hilarity, wit and outre humor here to evoke that era, more than 40 years ago, when bright, irreverent revues were as commonplace on Broadway as today's stately Cameron Mackintosh spectacles."&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9D0DEFD81531F936A2575BC0A960958260 "Review. Don They Now Their Drag Apparel"] ''The New York Times'', August 15, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Talkin' Broadway review of a regional production in San Francisco, the reviewer wrote: "The music by Dick Gallagher is jaunty and tuneful and lyrics by Mark Waldrop are sharp and witty. This is a real great musical comedy revue. Michael Sommers of ''The Star Ledger'' sums it up beautifully by calling it 'A Hog-Heaven of silliness.' Clive Barnes of the ''New York Post'' said 'This show is user-friendly for straights.' I totally agree with both critics."&lt;ref&gt;Connema, Richard.

The original cast recording was released by RCA Victor.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
''When Pigs Fly'' won the 1997 Outer Critics Circle Awards for Off-Broadway Musical and costume design,&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, David.

'''''World Builder''''' is a 2007 [[short film|short]] [[sci-fi film]] by [[Bruce Branit]]. The entire film (except for two characters) is [[computer graphics|computer generated]].

==Plot==
The film begins with the words "Program Start." In a [[green room]], a young man is lying on his back and looking at [[holographic]] pictures of himself and a young woman, presumably his wife (as we see a wedding ring on his hand). All of a sudden, a holographic timer appears on his arm, letting him know that something will happen in one hour. Closing the pictures, he stands up and gets to work.

Using a [[computer program]], he begins to make a row of tall [[box]]es. Once the first row is made, he makes a copy and puts the copy of the row of boxes across from the first. He then gets to work on adding details to each box. He adds columns, doors, and windows. Once done, he works on the appearances of the boxes to make them look like [[building]]s. He adds color and then some [[nature]]. He pays particular attention to a yellow [[flower]]. Soon, with time running out, he hastily finishes the details and hide in a doorway when the timer stops.

With time up, the boxes no longer look like [[computer model]]s but actual buildings. A door opens and the young woman from the pictures, dressed in a [[hospital gown]], emerges. She is astonished by what she sees. She walks down the [[street]], looking at the buildings and their details. Watching from his doorway, the man realizes that he forgot to do one building and it looks like a model from a computer program. He prays that she doesn't see the building. She comes his way and he hides, watching her look at the yellow flower and smile lovingly. She leaves the street with a final look back. Once she is gone, he emerges and watches his world that he created dematerialize into a new picture. It shows the woman smiling at the flower. Choking back tears, he kisses her picture. The screen goes dark, showing the words "Program Ends".

In a holographic recovery room, the young man enters. The young woman is lying on the bed, in a [[coma]] and hooked up to machines to monitor her progress. He kisses her forehead and drops into a glass of water the very flower she admired in the computer program.
