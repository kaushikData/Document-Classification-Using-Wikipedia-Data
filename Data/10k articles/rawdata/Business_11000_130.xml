34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line was opened on June 3, 1917, as part of an extension of the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]], the dominant subway in [[Manhattan]] at the time, from Times Square–42nd Street to [[South Ferry loops (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]].&lt;ref name=34th/&gt; It was served by a shuttle train to Times Square until the rest of the extension opened a year later on July 1, 1918.&lt;ref name="west side open"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/07/02/archives/open-new-subway-to-regular-traffic-first-train-on-seventh-avenue.html| title=Open new subway to regular traffic| newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the subway would be expanded down the Lower West Side to neighborhoods such as [[Greenwich Village]] and the western portion of the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].

As part of this and the northern [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] extension, the IRT network would be radically changed from an S-shaped line connecting the eastern side of Lower Manhattan to the [[Upper West Side]] to an H-shaped network with two parallel lines, the East and West Side Lines, and a [[42nd Street Shuttle|shuttle at 42nd Street]] connecting them.&lt;ref name="west side open"/&gt;&lt;ref name="east side open"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/02/97011929.pdf| title=Open new subway lines to traffic; called a triumph| newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 2015–2019 [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] Capital Plan, the station, along with thirty-two other New York City Subway stations, will undergo a complete overhaul as part of the [[Enhanced Station Initiative]]. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. Unlike other stations that will be renovated under the initiative, 34th Street–Penn Station will not be completely closed during construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/procure/contracts/143675sol-3.pdf|title=Enhanced Station Initiative: CCM Pre-Proposal Conference|date=October 25, 2016|website=|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=August 11, 2017|page=8 (PDF page 15)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the NYCT and Bus Committee recommended that Judlau Contracting receive the $125 million contract for the renovations of [[57th Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|57th]] and [[23rd Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|23rd Street]]s on the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]]; [[28th Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|28th Street]] on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], and 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and [[34th Street–Penn Station (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|IND Eighth Avenue Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/180122_1030_Transit.pdf|title=NYCT/Bus Committee Meeting|author=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date=January 22, 2018|page=135|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the MTA Board temporarily deferred the vote for these packages after city representatives refused to vote to award the contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/transit/subway-station-improvements-1.16331101|title=Controversial cosmetic subway improvement plan falters|last=Barone|first=Vincent|date=January 24, 2018|work=am New York|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/MTA-Postpones-Plan-Modernize-Subway-Stations-Cuomo-De-Blasio-470926353.html|title=MTA Shelves Plan to Modernize Subway Stations Amid Criticism|last=Siff|first=Andrew|date=January 24, 2018|work=NBC New York|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was put back for a vote in February, where it was ultimately approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-votes-cuomo-1b-plan-pretty-subway-stations-article-1.3836591|title=Foes Hit Gov's Station Fix Plan|date=2018-02-13|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[34th Street–Penn Station (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|34th Street–Penn Station]] on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] and [[Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center]] on the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]], this station has two [[side platform]]s for local service and a center [[island platform]] for express service. This is due to the expected increase in ridership and to encourage riders to switch at the next stop northbound, [[Times Square–42nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square–42nd Street]], as it is set up in the usual island platform manner for [[cross-platform interchange]]s.&lt;ref name="nycsorg"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nycsubway.org/perl/stations?6:3134| title=34th Street-Penn Station| website=NYCSubway.org| accessdate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no free transfer between this station and the station of the same name on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, despite the fact that both connect to Penn Station. The nearest transfer location is at Times Square–42nd Street with a free transfer to [[42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal]].&lt;ref name="nycsorg"/&gt;

34th Street–Penn Station spans three streets (32nd, 33rd, and 34th Streets) with a set of entrances/exits at all of these streets. For the purposes of this article, entrance and exit are interchangeable.&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Pennsylvania Station / Times Square|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M08_PennStation_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=December 11, 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{Access icon}} '''34th Street''': There are four entrances directly from the intersection of 34th Street and Seventh Avenue. On the local platforms the [[turnstile]]s for these exits are at platform level; passengers wishing to use the express platforms must use a passageway beneath the platforms and tracks. These entrances utilize the northern portions of the platforms. There is also a supplementary and handicapped-accessible entrance to the Penn Station complex in general from 34th Street.&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015/&gt;
* '''33rd Street''': There are three direct entrances from the street at 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue. As a replacement for the southwestern corner's lack of an entrance, there is an underground entrance directly connecting the station with the Long Island Rail Road concourse in the Penn Station complex. The turnstiles for this entrance are located below the track level and utilize the central portions of the platforms.&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015/&gt;
* '''32nd Street''': The main entrance to the Penn Station complex is located on the western end of 32nd Street. From there, passengers may go through the New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road concourses and use the entrance to this station at the end of the latter's concourse. There is also a smaller exit from the station at the southern ends of the platforms that connects with the end of the New Jersey Transit concourse where it meets the Long Island Rail Road underneath the main corridor in the station that connects New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. There is also an entrance on the north side of 32nd Street between Seventh and Sixth Avenues.&lt;ref name=MTA-PennStation-2015/&gt;

==Ridership==
34th Street–Penn Station on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line is continually ranked as one of the busiest stations in the subway system. In 2016, it was the fifth-busiest subway station, with 27,741,367 riders as recorded by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]].&lt;ref name="2016-rider"/&gt; By comparison, its sister station on the Eighth Avenue Line is ranked sixth-busiest, with 25,183,869 passengers.&lt;ref name="2016-rider"/&gt; When the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station was a shuttle stop before the rest of the South Ferry extension opened, ridership was quite low; in its first year of operation, only 78,121 boardings were recorded.&lt;ref name="ridership2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transit.frumin.net/subway/growth/nyc-station-ridership.xls.zip |title=1904-2006 ridership figures |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |accessdate=August 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723132222/http://transit.frumin.net/subway/growth/nyc-station-ridership.xls.zip |archivedate=2011-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''As You Sow''' is a non-profit foundation chartered to promote [[corporate social responsibility]] (for example on [[human rights]]) through shareholder advocacy, coalition building, and legal strategies.&lt;ref name=AboutUs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2013/943/169/2013-943169008-0ac1472a-9.pdf IRS Form 990]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As You Sow was founded in 1992&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asyousow.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=As You Sow |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has five program areas for addressing its environmental and social concerns: Energy, Environmental Health, Waste, Power of the Proxy, and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asyousow.org/our-work/ |title=Our Work |publisher=As You Sow |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of As You Sow's Programs include shareholder advocacy to pressure companies to adopt responsible policies. According to As You Sow, "Shareholder advocacy leverages the power of stock ownership in publicly traded companies to promote environmental, social, and governance change from within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asyousow.org/about-us/theory-of-change/shareholder-advocacy/|title=Shareholder Advocacy|publisher=As You Sow |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As You Sow says that its Environmental Enforcement Program&lt;ref name="asyousow1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asyousow.org/our-work/environmental-health/toxic-enforcement// |title=Toxic Enforcement |publisher=As You Sow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; has reached settlements with hundreds of companies resulting in products being relabeled or reformulated to remove [[Dangerous goods|hazardous]] ingredients. Funds secured through these settlements are disbursed through grants to support other organizations throughout the state.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

With a coalition of other investment organizations, As You Sow has pressed oil and gas companies to disclose and address the risks of [[hydraulic fracturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casey |first=Tina |url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/05/shareholders-press-companies-to-disclose-fracking-risk/ |title=Shareholders press oil and gas companies to disclose fracking risks |publisher=Triplepundit.com |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce''' ({{lang-de|Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag}}, '''DIHK''') is a [[Germany|German]] 'chamber,' similar to an [[England|English]] [[guild]] but is required under German law and provides [[Politics|political]] influence of a [[trade union]]. This organization was formerly known as the ''Deutscher Industrie- und Handelstag'' or ''DIHT''.

==DIHK==
In Germany, '[[Chambers of Commerce]] and Industry' is an organization for 79 'chambers' who represents companies within the German state.  The DIHK provides over 'three million entrepreneurs' or association members, representing small kiosks and shops to larger commercial companies, with political influence. DIHK has its headquarters in [[Berlin]], a major office in [[Brussels]] and representative offices throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=DIHK1&gt;{{Cite web

Association members are under [[Chamber of Commerce#Compulsory/public law chambers|German Chamber of Commerce]] compulsory or public law model, [[Business|enterprises]] of certain sizes, types, or sectors are obliged to become members of the chamber. This model is common in [[European Union]] countries ([[France]],&lt;ref&gt;[[André-Pierre Nouvion]], ''Chambres de commerce et d'industrie'' - Encyclopédie juridique [[Dalloz]] - Répertoire de droit commercial, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]]), but also in [[Japan]]. Main tasks of the chambers are foreign trade promotion, vocational training, regional economic development, and general services to their members. The chambers were given responsibilities of public administration in various fields by the state which they exercise in order management. The chambers also have a consultative function; this means the chambers must be consulted whenever a new law related to industry or commerce is proposed.&lt;ref name=DIHK1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipe.org/programs/training/pdf/Chamber_Primer.pdf |title=Markus Pilgrim and Ralf Meier, Chamber Primer |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107031727/http://www.cipe.org/programs/training/pdf/Chamber_Primer.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, for over 150 years, the chambers of commerce and industry (''IHK - Industrie- und Handelskammer'') and the chambers of skilled crafts (''HwK - Handwerkskammer'') are public statutory bodies with self-administration under the inspectorate of the state ministry of economy. Enterprises are members by law according to the chamber act (''IHK-Gesetz'') of 1956. Because of this, such chambers are much bigger than chambers under private law. IHK Munich, the biggest German chamber of commerce, has 350,000 member companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHK München|url=http://www.muenchen.ihk.de|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany also has compulsory chambers for "free occupations" such as architects, dentists, engineers, lawyers, notaries, physicians and pharmacists.  Exceptions are skilled craftsmen, [[freelancer]]s and agricultural businesses.&lt;ref name=DIHK1/&gt;&lt;ref name=OV&gt;[http://www.dihk.de/english/aboutus/overview.pdf Overview of DIHK]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Babak Morteza Zanjani''' ({{lang-fa|بابک مرتضی زنجانی}}, born 21 March 1974)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1893.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; is an Iranian billionaire and [[business magnate]]. He was the managing director of the [[UAE]]-based Sorinet Group, one of Iran's largest business conglomerates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorinetgroup.com|title=Sorinet Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2013, he was arrested and accused of withholding $2.7 billion of government money owned by the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]], in his attempts to facilitate Iran's oil revenue hindered by the [[sanctions against Iran]]. He was convicted of corruption, sentenced to death and is currently awaiting execution.

Several commentators have stated that Zanjani is perhaps a “[[fall guy]]” for corruption scandals in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;

==Sorinet Group==

Sorinet Group ({{lang-fa|گروه شرکت‌های سورینت}}) is an Iranian business [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The company is one of Iran's largest business conglomerates. Sorinet businesses include cosmetics, finance and banking, hospitality, commercial aviation, infrastructure, building material, information technology and international real estate development. It operates in countries including Iran, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, [[Tajikistan]], Malaysia, China. 
He also owned [[Qeshm Airlines]] and [[Rah Ahan Sorinet F.C.]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rahahansport.ir/inside.aspx?cat=news&amp;g=1006 |title=Zanjani to Rahahan footballers: Raise your self-confidence |work=Rah Ahan Sorinet F.C |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Zanjani stated that his net worth was $13.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/world/middleeast/to-this-tycoon-iran-sanctions-are-like-gold.html?_r=0|title = To This Tycoon, Iran Sanctions Were Like Gold|publisher =  NY Times |date = 5 October 2013 |work = News (in English)|accessdate= 21 October 2016|first=Thomas |last=Erdbrink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU sanctions against Iran==
Zanjani was named in the [[European Union sanctions against Iran#Sanctions|restrictive measures against Iran]] in December 2012 by the [[EU council]] on the grounds of "assisting designated entities to violate the provisions of the EU regulation on Iran and is providing financial support to the government of Iran".&lt;ref name=eurt&gt;{{cite web |url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:356:0055:0060:EN:PDF|title= Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1264/2012 of 21 December 2012|work=Official Journal of the European Union|date=23 December 2012|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Zanjani was claimed to be "a key facilitator for Iranian oil deals and transferring oil-related money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/22/us-eu-iran-sanctions-idUSBRE8BL04L20121222|title=Tougher EU sanctions against Iran come into force|author=Barbara Lewis|work=Reuters |date=23 December 2012|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the accusation, declining any ties with the Iranian government and calling the Europeans' decision "a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/23/us-iran-sanctions-zanjani-idUSBRE8BM06920121223 |title = Iranian businessman denies EU sanctions-busting accusation|author= Humeyra Pamuk|work = Reuters|date=23 December 2012|accessdate=19 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union|EU]] [[sanctions against Iran]] describe Zanjani as "a key facilitator for Iranian oil deals and transferring oil related money" and accuses First Islamic Bank of being used to channel Iranian oil-related payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.radiozamaneh.com/english/content/businessman-sees-upside-sanctions|title= Businessman sees upside of sanctions|work=Radio Zamaneh|date=13 April 2013|accessdate= 13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zanjani said the complex nature of his companies' transactions, involving large sums, might have misled EU authorities. Zanjani's companies are or may be involved in the Labuan Iran oil smuggling on the eastern coast of [[Malaysia]]. Labuan has been serving as a drop-off spot for Iranian crude.

==Alleged dual nationality==
In January 2013, an Iranian news website, [[Baztab]], reported that Zanjani holds a [[Danish passport]] in addition to his Iranian one, a claim which was later denied by Zanjani. He called the passport's copy "fake", saying in an interview with the news website of [[Rah Ahan Yazdan F.C.|Rahahan F.C.]], his football team: "This story [the copy of my passport] is too badly fabricated that they even put my picture on the passport without a tie. However, it is obligatory to tie a necktie to take pictures for European passports," which is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rahahansport.ir/inside.aspx?cat=news&amp;g=1062 |title=Zanjani's comments on the recent allegations and accusations |work=Rahahan F.C. |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216034922/http://rahahansport.ir/inside.aspx?cat=news&amp;g=1062 |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
On 30 December 2013, Zanjani was arrested by Iranian police for his alleged role in the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|corruption scandal in Turkey]], in which he was accused of embezzling more than €2.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiofarda.com/content/f12_babak_zanjani_not_paying_irans_oil_money/25216202.html/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85 |title=Zanjani arrested |work=Radio Farda |date=30 December 2013 |accessdate=23 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317001050/http://www.radiofarda.com/content/f12_babak_zanjani_not_paying_irans_oil_money/25216202.html/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85 |archivedate=17 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/330120/society/judiciary |title=Babak Zanjani was arrested|work=Khabar Online|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some days later, a spokesman from the [[National Bank of Tajikistan]] denied any cooperation between Zanjani and the bank and claimed all documents presented by Zanjani about their two-way communications were fake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-central-bank-iran-ties/25216499.html Tajik National Bank Denies Link With Iranian Businessman] ''Radio Free Europe''&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried in an [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]].

===Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] of Commerce degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|title=Bachelor Of Commerce (Bcom) - Varsity College|website=www.varsitycollege.co.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131853/https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business (see aside). 
Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, business management, human resources, marketing, and economics; some programs also require [[Business statistics|(business) statistics]], [[Business mathematics#University level|(introductory) calculus]] and information systems. 
Depending on the institution, a formal [[academic major]] may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

For a comparison with other business degrees, see [[Business education#Undergraduate education]].

===Honours Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Honours degree|Honours]] Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com. (Hons) or B.Comm. (Hons) or H.B.Com. or H.B.Comm.) is further advanced. It may consist of a four-year program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|title=Bachelor of Commerce Degree (Bcom)- University Canada West|website=ucanwest.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044341/https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|archivedate=2016-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoit.ca/ac-calendar/0506/EN/main/programs/103887/bcom_hons_92.html|title=Commerce - Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)|first=The University of Ontario Institute of|last=Technology|website=www.uoit.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year [[Bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105318/http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree requires additional academic courses to be completed with higher academic performance standards and may also require a researched [[thesis]] component; the one-year program is often focused exclusively on a single subject-area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|title=Qualifications|website=www.unisa.ac.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216065503/http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|archivedate=2014-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126230943/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |archivedate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours|title=BCom Students - Faculty of Business and Economics|website=bcom.unimelb.edu.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005629/http://www.bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours/|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Master of Commerce]] (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degrees.

===Duration===
The [[curriculum]] generally lasts three years in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Malta]], [[South Africa]], some parts of [[Canada]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The curriculum requires four years of study in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the majority of [[Canada]], [[Ghana]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In [[Nepal]], the duration of the program can be three years.

In [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and some universities in [[India]], the B.Com. (Hons) degree is considered an additional [[postgraduate]] qualification, whereas in [[Malta]], an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification. In [[Pakistan]], [http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/22/Hailey-College-of-Commerce] the B.Com. degree lasts two years, the B.Com. (Hons) degree lasts three years, and a four-year program leads to the BS (Hons) Commerce degree.

==History==
:''See: [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|Birmingham Business School#History and background]].''&lt;!--{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}} --&gt;
The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the [[University of Birmingham]]. The [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|University's School of Commerce]] was founded by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], an Englishman from [[Oxford University]], who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Toronto]]. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at [[Harvard University]], and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce.  Ashley began the program which was the forerunner of many other B.Com. degree programs throughout the [[British Empire]].

Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham program in Commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6386">{{Banking |image=London.bankofengland.arp.jpg |caption=The [[Bank of England]], established in 1694.}}
Under [[English law]], a '''bank has a general right to combine accounts''' where a customer has multiple accounts with the same bank.&lt;ref name=Ellinger&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.P. Ellinger |author2=E. Lomnicka |author3=C. Hare |year=2011|title=Ellinger's Modern Banking Law |edition=5th|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-019-923209-3|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The right has been recognised since at least 1860&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1860/307.pdf Cumming v Shand]'' (1860) 5 H&amp;N 95.  See also: ''Re European Bank, Agra Bank Claims'' (1872) LR 8 Ch App 41; ''Garnett v McKewan'' (1872) LR 8 Ex 10&lt;/ref&gt; (and probably longer).  However it was not until 1975 in the House of Lords decision in ''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785 that it was finally determined that this was a type of [[set-off (law)|set-off right]] rather than anything related to the [[banker's lien]] (a separate common law right).  Typically the right will be exercised where one account is overdrawn and the other is in credit so that the bank can secure full repayment of overdraft without the need to take any further action with respect to the customer.  The broad rationale is that separate numbered accounts are set up for administrative convenience only, but the legal duty upon a bank to "account" to its customers for the sums held by it only extends to the net sum.

==Mutuality==

In order for the bank to combine accounts there must be mutuality, i.e. it must be the same customer and the same legal entity for the bank.&lt;ref&gt;''Greenwood Teale v William, William, Brown &amp; Co'' (1894) 11 TLR 56&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accounts held at different branches of the same bank may still be combined.  Although it has not been finally determined by case law, most commentators accept that accounts in different currencies may be combined, as may accounts in different countries (so long as the governing law in each country permits such combination).&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

==Bars to combining accounts==
There are various grounds set out in the case law which indicate when an account may not be combined.
* '''Agreement to forbear'''.  An agreement by the bank not to combine accounts will be binding, possible even in the absence of any consideration.  If not an express time, then it will generally be implied that a material change in circumstances would terminate such an agreement (in ''Halesowen'' it was held that calling a meeting of creditors would constitute such circumstances, but in Australia it has been held that appointing a receiver did not.&lt;ref name=Aus&gt;''Direct Acceptances Corp v Bank of NSW'' (1968) 88 WN (NSW) (Pt 1) 498&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Money held for specific purpose'''.  In line with the authorities on [[Quistclose trusts in English law|''Quistclose'' trusts]], if money is held by the bank for a specific purpose, then it is impressed by a trust and is not subject to combination.&lt;ref&gt;''WP Greenhalgh &amp; Sons v Union Bank of Manchester'' [1924] 2 KB 153&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Money held on trust'''.  Where the customer holds the money in the account as trustee and so is not beneficially entitled to it, it cannot be combined.&lt;ref&gt;''Union Bank of Australia v Murray-Aynsley'' [1898] AC 693&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it appears that the reverse is not true - if a trust account is overdrawn then the bank can combine that with a trustee's personal account because the trustee is personally liable for the obligations of the trust.&lt;ref name=Can&gt;''Daniels v Imperial Bank of Canada'' (1914) 19 DLR 166&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Where account is subject to a [[security interest]]'''.  Provided the security interest is fixed and not [[floating charge|floating]], this will prevent combination of accounts.&lt;ref&gt;''Biggerstaff v Rowatt's Wharf Ltd'' [1896] 2 Ch 93; ''NW Robbie &amp; Co Ltd  v Witney Warehouse Co Ltd'' [1963] 1 WLR 1324&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Where one account is a loan account'''.  This is considered further below.

==Loan accounts==
There is a distinct line of authority which indicates that where one of the accounts is a loan account then the bank cannot exercise its rights to combine accounts.  Most of the authorities relating to this are older cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Re EJ Morel (1934) Ltd'' [1962] Ch 21; ''Bradford Old Bank v Sutcliffe'' [1918] 2 KB 833&lt;/ref&gt; but the rule was applied more recently in ''Fraser v Oystertec plc'' [2006] 1 BCLC 491.

Although slightly anachronistic, the rationale appears to be that the customer of the bank should not be at risk of the bank combining a short-term current account on which the customer writes cheques for daily expenses with a long-term loan account which is not due for repayment until some future time.  In practice, most loan agreements will usually give the bank a contractual right to set-off in any event.&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

==Notice==
Although there is one case which argues to the contrary, the orthodox position is that the bank does not need to give the customer notice prior to exercising a right to combine accounts.&lt;ref name=Halesowen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sing&gt;''Good Property Land Development Pte Ltd v Société Générale'' [1996] 2 SLR 239 at 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insolvency==
If the bank does not exercise a right to combine accounts prior to a company going into insolvent liquidation, then insolvency set-off will operate automatically, and the insolvency set-off rules will prevail over the bank's right to combine accounts.&lt;ref name=Halesowen&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign countries==
The banker's right to combine accounts has been recognised at appellate level by the courts of various other [[common law jurisdictions]], including Australia,&lt;ref name=Aus /&gt; Canada,&lt;ref name=Can /&gt; Guyana&lt;ref&gt;''British Guiana Bank v OR'' (1911) 104 LT 754 (PC)&lt;/ref&gt; and Singapore.&lt;ref name=Sing /&gt;  However, there does not appear to be any corresponding general right in civil law jurisdictions outside of the conventional right of [[set-off (law)|set-off]].

'''Boaz Toporovsky''' ({{lang-he|בועז טופורובסקי}}, born 17 July 1980) is an [[Israel]]i politician. He served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Yesh Atid]] between 2013 and 2015.

==Biography==
Toporovsky was born and grew up in [[Rishon LeZion]]. After completing his mandatory military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], he studied law at [[Tel Aviv University]]. During his studies, Toporovsky became chairman of the university's student union in 2005, holding the post until 2007. He then entered politics and worked for Minister of Social Affairs, [[Isaac Herzog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/new-kids-in-the-knesset-lapid-s-activists.premium-1.496016 New kids in the Knesset: Lapid’s activists] Haaretz, 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he became chairman of the [[National Union of Israeli Students]], and in the same year founded the Tzabar party, heading its list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Knesset elections]], in which it received only 0.14% of the vote and failed to pass the electoral threshold. However, the party did win seats on [[Tel Aviv]] city council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/yair-lapids-sends-a-diverse-quality-slate-to-knesset/ All the kingmaker’s men, and women] Times of Israel, 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 he became chairman of the [[Issta]] travel agency.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 Knesset elections]] he was placed eighteenth on [[Yesh Atid]]'s list, becoming a Knesset member when the party won 19 seats. He was placed fourteenth on the party's list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechirot20.gov.il/election/Candidates/Pages/OneListCandidates.aspx?LPF=Search&amp;WebId=6adadc15-e476-480b-9746-04490aedeb0f&amp;ListID=ba72a662-765c-45af-9d48-fb68080956af&amp;ItemID=43&amp;FieldID=ListNickname_GxS_Text Yesh Atid list] Central Elections Committee&lt;/ref&gt; losing his seat as the party was reduce to 11 seats.

Toporovsky is married to Shelly Herman, participant of the third season of Israeli reality show [[MasterChef Israel|Master Chef]].

Martha Washington was born in the east room of the mansion.&lt;ref name=MW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

==History==
The two-story frame house consisting of six rooms&lt;ref name=DHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; was originally built around 1730.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; It was first inhabited by prominent Virginia [[Planter (American South)|planter]] [[John Dandridge]] and his wife [[Frances Jones (mother of Martha Dandridge Washington)|Frances Jones]].&lt;ref name=MW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; The couple raised their eight children, including [[Martha Washington]], there.&lt;ref name=MW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; It was at Chestnut Grove that Martha married her first husband, [[Daniel Parke Custis]], on 15 May 1750.&lt;ref name=MW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

In 1768, Martha Washington's younger brother [[Bartholomew Dandridge]] sold Chestnut Grove and its accompanying {{convert|500|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; Colonel Richard Pye Cooke then purchased the mansion in 1840.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webpages.charter.net/chamberlayne/history/part2.htm | title=The Third Generation and Beyond: The Late 18th to the Mid-19th Century | date=July 13, 2003 | accessdate=2008-03-05 | publisher=The Chamberlaynes of Virginia | author=Philip J.

Unlike neighboring plantation homes, Chestnut Grove continued to serve as a residence for 200 years in its original state until it burned down in November 1926.&lt;ref name=DHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

==Architecture==
Chestnut Grove's architectural details survive due to old photographs and sketches.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; The mansion was a two-story frame structure with a [[hip roof]] and a chimney at either end.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; It also contained a [[basement]] which ran the length of the mansion.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; The interior of Chestnut Grove was plain and paneled in pine.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

The British Association of '''Communicators in Business''' (CiB) is a professional body based in the [[United Kingdom]] which provides in-house, freelance and agency staff involved in [[internal communications]].

It aims to provide support for professionals involved in strategy planning and delivery, writing, design, online, print, measurement and brand management, among other internal communication disciplines.

On 23 September 2009 the members of CiB voted to change the name and status of the association to the Institute of Internal Communication (IoIC). The official changeover to Institute status, along with the launch of its new corporate identity, will take place at their annual conference in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=428:cib-votes-for-name-change&amp;catid=1:stories&amp;Itemid=115 CiB votes for name change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045615/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=428%3Acib-votes-for-name-change&amp;catid=1%3Astories&amp;Itemid=115 |date=8 October 2011 }} Communicate magazine, 2009-09-24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Beale''' (1759&amp;ndash;1842) was a Scottish merchant and fur trader active in the Far East mercantile centres of [[Bombay]], [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] and [[Macau]] as well as at one time the [[Prussia]]n consul in China.

==Biography==
Daniel Beale was the purser of, successively, the East India Company ships ''Walpole'' and ''General Coote'' on voyages between London and Canton in 1783-1786: in 1783 he joined the Macao partnership of [[John Henry Cox]] and John Reid in their mercantile ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "John Meares: Dubliner, Naval Officer, Fur Trader and would be Colonizer", ''Journal of Australian Naval History,'' vol.8, no.1, March 2011, pp.32-62, n.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving evidence before the British parliament’s commons committee of ''Enquiry on the East India Company’s Affairs'' on 11 May 1815, Beale testified that he had been resident in Canton "from the latter end of 1787 to the middle of 1797"&lt;ref name="PCE"&gt;{{Cite book|title= The parliamentary debates from the year 1803 to the present time}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yyfauGAhTpcC&amp;pg=RA5-PT213 Online version at Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as "agent for many of the mercantile houses in Bombay and [[Bengal]]." 

[[John Henry Cox]] had been sent to Canton in 1782 by his father James to sell off an accumulated stock of clocks, watches and mechanical toys&lt;ref name=RIDE&gt;

Along with James Fox, the other major manufacturer of singsongs was Francis Magniac of Clerkenwell, London, whose sons Charles and [[Hollingworth Magniac|Hollingworth]] would later become partners of Beale.&lt;ref name="GREENBERG"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Michael|title= British trade and the opening of China 1800-1842|publisher= Monthly Review Press; First Edition (1 January 1951)|isbn= 978-0-85345-497-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QNo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76 Online version at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchants operating in the Far East at this time formed a bewildering array of partnerships. As well as the Coxes, Beale was also at various times a partner of John Reid, Charles Magniac and his brother Hollingworth, as well as Alexander Shank and Robert Hamilton.&lt;ref name="CONNELL"&gt;

On 15&amp;nbsp;February 1786, a [[Prussia]]n ship arrived at [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]] whereupon the [[East India Company]]’s agent at [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] informed the Committee of [[Supercargo]]es that Beale had shown him a letter signed by "Count Lusi, Envoy Extraordinaire to his Majesty the King of Prussia with the King of Great Britain and his Colonel of Infantry", announcing his appointment as his Prussian Majesty’s Consul in China.&lt;ref&gt;’’[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]’’ (1798) Volume 58, Page 555 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk4DAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA555 Online version at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beale was also a member of the Associated Merchants Trading to the Northwest Coast of America, which owned the [[snow (ship)|snow]] ''Iphigenia Nubiana'', trading on this coast in 1788 and 1789. Other partners in the venture were [[John Meares]], [[John Henry Cox]], Richard C. Etches, John W. Etches, William Fitzhugh and Henry Land.&lt;ref&gt;Dalzell , Kathleen ‘’Queen Charlotte Islands - Book 2: of places and names’’ Prince Rupert: Cove Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with fellow Scotsman [[John Reid (merchant)|John Reid]], Beale was also one of the owners of the [[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]], a vessel ostensibly belonging to the fictitious Austrian East India Company, which sailed under the flag of Austria. This allowed her to circumvent the trade monopoly then held by the East India Company. Beale was by this time the Prussian agent in Canton following his earlier appointment as consul. Beale organized the voyage of the ''Imperial Eagle'' when he returned to London from Canton on the HCS ''General Coote'' in August 1786.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Dermigny, ''La Chine et L’Occident,'' Paris, SEVPEN, 1964, tome III, p.1241.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1797, Beale &amp; Co. had become the biggest of the country traders, dealing with clients in Bombay, Calcutta and London, in Indian cotton, sandalwood, tin, pepper Chinese tea and silk as well as opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coates|first=Austin|title= Macao and the British, 1637-1842|publisher=China; OUP|isbn= 978-0-19-582782-8}} p. 73, pp. 128ff&lt;/ref&gt; His firm Beale &amp; Co. seems to have been active in the opium trade between 1783&amp;ndash;1793.

In 1797 Daniel Beale left China to join Magniac &amp; Co. in London and in 1800 the sole British firm in Canton is recorded as Reid, Beale &amp; Co., formerly Hamilton &amp; Reid, and in 1804 to become Beale &amp; Magniac.&lt;ref name="GREENBERG" /&gt;

==Memorial==
Beale died in England in 1842. In the gallery of [[St Pancras New Church]], London, there is a memorial to Thomas Beale of [[Fitzroy Square]] and of Millfield House [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]], Middlesex. formerly of Canton and Macao, "a most zealous promoter of the building of this Church and one of the original trustees."&lt;ref name="SOL"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65559 ''Survey of London: volume 24: The parish of St Pancras part 4: King’s Cross Neighbourhood'' (1952), pp. 1–9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was immortalised by the artist [[Jacques-Laurent Agasse]] in his painting ''Daniel Beale at his Farm at Edmonton with his Favourite Horse''.&lt;ref name ="SOUTH"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/f-jacques-laurent-agasse-1767-1849-1-c-860tjei64d|title=Sotheby’s Auction Item|year=2005|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1791 he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Paul Barbot of London.&lt;ref name="SOUTH" /&gt; She died in 1830.&lt;ref name="SOL" /&gt;

They had a son, also named Daniel, who was born about 1798 and died on 4&amp;nbsp;January 1827 aged 29, as well as a younger brother, [[Thomas Beale]], and a cousin, [[Thomas Chaye Beale]].&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://gwulo.com/sites/gwulo.com/files/Gwulo-Macau-Old-Protestant-Cemetery.pdf|title=Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3878">'''Data warehouse automation''' ('''DWA''') refers to the process of accelerating and automating the [[data warehouse]] development cycles, while assuring quality and consistency. DWA is believed to provide automation of the entire lifecycle of a data warehouse, from source [[Systems analysis|system analysis]] to [[Software testing|testing]] to  [[documentation]]. It helps improve productivity, reduce cost, and improve overall quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automate and accelerate your data transformations|url=http://www.attunity.com/products/prepare-data-compose|website=www.attunity.com|publisher=Attunity|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Data warehouse automation primarily focuses on automation of each and every step involved in the lifecycle of a data warehouse, thus reducing the efforts required in managing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Buzzword! Data Warehouse Automation|url=http://blogs.jetreports.com/2015/03/05/new-buzzword-data-warehouse-automation/|website=blogs.jetreports.com|publisher=jetreports|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data warehouse automation works on the principles of design patterns. It comprises a central repository of design patterns, which encapsulate architectural standards as well as best practices for data design, data management, data integration, and data usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wherescape.com/media/1988/data-warehouse-automation-decision-guide.pdf|title=Data Warehouse Automation - A Decision Guide|website=www.wherescape.com|publisher=David L. Wells, Infocentric LLC|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2015, an analyst firm has published a guide ''Which Data Warehouse Automation Tool is Right for You?'' covering four of the leading products in the DWA space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Data Warehouse Automation Tool is Right for You?|url=http://eckerson.com/register?content=which-data-warehouse-automation-tool-is-right-for-you|website=eckerson.com|publisher= Wayne Eckerson|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, an international software and technology services company engaged in developing ‘agile tools’ for the data integration industry, was named by CIO Review as one of the 20 most promising productivity tools solution providers 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIO Magazine Award - 20 Most promising productivity tools|url=http://analytixds.com/latest_news/analytix-data-services-wins-cio-reviews-2015/|website=www.analtyixds.com|publisher=AnalytiX DS|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Data warehouse automation can provide advantages like source data exploration, warehouse data models, ETL generation, test automation, metadata management, managed deployment, scheduling, change impact analysis and easier maintenance and modification of the data warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Warehouse Automation (DWA)?|url=http://www.timextender.com/software/data-warehouse-automation/business-value/|website=timextender.com|publisher=TimeXtender Software 2015|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More important than the technical features of DWA tools, however, is the ability to deliver projects faster and with less resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deliver Faster|url=http://kalido.com/products/kalido-information-engine/deliver-faster/|website=kalido.com|publisher=Magnitude Software|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L|publisher=UOL|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- == Histórico do processo eletrônico no Brasil ==
=== Primeira fase: o início ===
O processo eletrônico no sentido amplo, ou seja, o uso do computador no processo, remonta há décadas,&lt;ref name="RPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.processoeletronico.com.br/page003.aspx|title=Breve Retrospecto do Processo Civil|publisher=Revista de Processo Eletrônico|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sendo possível identificar algumas iniciativas embrionárias em vários Tribunais do País, as quais foram evoluindo, com o uso posterior de outros sistemas e aplicativos, bem como novas linguagens.
Já no sentido estrito não é mais recente a primeira aparição do uso do audio como elemento de autos, inclusive remontando há séculos,&lt;ref name="RJMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aplicacao.mp.mg.gov.br/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/263/novas%20perspectivas%20uso%20taquigrafia_Santos.pdf?sequence=1|title=Diálogo Multidisciplinar|publisher=Revista Jurídica do Ministério Público, Vol. 6|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; caracterizando uma forma eletrônica de armazenamento principal de atos processuais.

=== Segunda fase: a evidência ===
A fase de maior evidência do ''processo eletrônico'' se iniciou em 2006,&lt;ref name="RD2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://direito2.com/tjgo/2008/jun/20/lenar-destaca-projudi-como-renovacao-para-o-judiciario|title=Lenar destaca Projudi como renovação para o Judiciário|author=TJGO|date=20/06/2008|publisher=Revista Direito2|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; com o lançamento do projeto [[PROJUDI]], de iniciativa do órgão oficial [[CNJ]]. A partir de então, crescentemente, os Tribunais passaram a apresentar uma maior movimentação de fluxo de informações ao público externo, bem como trabalhos internos, voltados ao desenvolvimento deste ramo da administração, sobretudo a partir do uso do respectivo sistema, com todas as suas implementações (aplicativos) em todo o país, passando pelas fases de teste, produção e uso estável.

=== A fase atual ===
No momento atual, coexistem diversos sistemas e aplicativos de processos em diversos tribunais. O [[CNJ]]&lt;ref name="CNJPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br|title=Página Principal|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; vem apresentando o novo projeto [[PJe]], aquele que vem obtendo mais evidência no trânsito de informações e mais ocorrências nas pesquisas relacionadas à atividade atual desta área. O material obtido acerca do projeto afirma ser o mesmo uma soma de esforços e utilizações de vários sistemas já testados no âmbito das Justiças Federal e do Trabalho. Ao mesmo momento, percebe-se a a existência do projeto [[Slapsoftware]], uma iniciativa não governamental de processo eletrônico, que, segundo o material obtido, afirma ser o primeiro sistema a seguir o paradigma de [[software livre]], não contradiz o projeto oficial, propondo uma união de esforços, submetendo-se às determinações do [[CNJ]] quanto ao Judiciário, e até mesmo propondo a fusão com o [[PJe]]. Por outro lado, alguns aplicativos também são desenvolvidos por empresas privadas, autoras de alguns dos sistemas e aplicativos já citados. Aqui se deve registrar uma diferença de paradigma, a saber. O projeto do organismo governamental segue a política que vem buscando, desde o início, de condicionar o uso dos aplicativos desenvolvidos aos processos que têm os autos armazenados em meio eletrônico, ou seja, o processo eletrônico em sentido estrito. Já o [[Slapsoftware]] permite o uso dos mesmos aplicativos para ambas as formas de armazenamento, bem como um modelo misto de participação pública e privada, ou seja, atividades como especificação e parametrização de aplicativos, bem como a distribuição e suporte por parte de empresas privadas.

=== Poder judiciário ===
Desde 2009, os sistemas e aplicativos no [[Poder Judiciário]], sobretudo os que gerenciam o [[processo judicial]] devem respeitar determinações e recomendações do [[CNJ]].&lt;ref name="CNJCPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br/sgt/consulta_publica_classes.php|title=Sistema de Gestão de Tabelas Processuais Unificadas|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tais [[norma]]s dizem respeito, entre as principais questões, à [[classificação]] de processos e atos para fins [[Estatística|estatísticos]], ou seja, com objetivo de [[controle]] de produtividade, definição de meios de atuação para correções de distorções e diagnósticos em geral das demandas e suas causas. Entre os mecanismos mediatos de classificação está a '''numeração única'''.&lt;ref name="CNJNU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br/programas-de-a-a-z/eficiencia-modernizacao-e-transparencia/pj-numeracao-unica|title=Numeração Única|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poderes executivo e legislativo===
É menor o número de informações sobre o desenvolvimento de sistemas processuais neste [[Órgão público|órgãos]], bem como para os processos [[Processo administrativo|administrativos]] e [[Processo legislativo|legislativos]], entretanto, se percebe, a partir de uma minuciosa pesquisa, uma demanda reprimida em relação ao uso de tais sistemas para uma abrangência maior de processos. Embora se trate do mesmo tema, vez por outra tais sistemas vêm sendo referidos como elementos autônomos.&lt;ref name="JNPAE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/18959/processo-administrativo-eletrônico|title=Processo Administrativo Eletrônico|author=Correa, D. B. R|date=01/07/2010|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== O processo eletrônico e a empresa privada ==
A [[iniciativa privada]] participa, com expressiva presença, no mercado destinado ao desenvolvimento de sistemas para processos, tanto os que possuem os autos eletrônicos como aqueles que, no modelo tradicional, são manuseados em papel e registrados e acompanhados pelo sistema.

== Nomes primitivos do processo eletrônico ==
=== Processo virtual ===
O primeiro nome dado ao ''processo eletrônico'' foi  ''processo virtual''. Processo virtual, conceito de [[direito processual civil]],&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comentários ao Código de Processo Civil, Atualizado por Sérgio Bermudes|last=Pontes de Miranda|first=Francisco Cavalcanti|volume=1|pagess=692,1872|publisher=Forense}}&lt;/ref&gt; relativo ao tema específico da formação do processo, da [[Ação (direito)|ação]] e da [[lide]], é aquele processo '''eventual''', aquele que pode vir a ser processo ou, enfim, o processo que não existe, senão numa construção hipotética. A conveniência do uso deste nome, decorrente da [[metáfora]] da "navegação virtual", como ato de usar a [[rede mundial de computadores]] logo passou a ser revista e tal denominação foi abandonada. Ainda hoje, entretanto, algumas poucas ocorrências desta expressão são encontradas como denotativas do armazenamento de [[autos]] em [[arquivos]].

=== Processo digital ===
[[Digital]], uma contraposição a analógico (relógio digital é aquele possui marcações discretas e informa os dados por [[dígito]]s, que são, em última instância, resultante de operações binárias, ao contrário do analógico que marca continuamente). A difusão do computator e da metáfora da "era digital" como a era dos [[bits]] entratanto, acabou por cunhar esta expressão como uma alternativa para o ''processo eletrônico'', como já explanado anteriormente na enumeração dos ''sistemas'' e ''aplicativos''.
--&gt;

== Law ==
In Brazil, since 2006, there is a law dealing about the electronic process,&lt;ref name="LTR"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ltreditora.com.br/comentarios-a-lei-do-processo-eletronico.html|title=Comentários à Lei do Processo Eletrônico|last=Chaves Júnior|first=José Eduardo de Resende|publisher=LTR|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it's the Law nº 11419 of 2006, without which there would not be the possibility of the phenomenon in its strict sense, that is the substitution of paper as primary source of information. This law is also important to kill the polemic about the validity of non-traditional communications means in legal procedures enrolled by former rules.

'''''Ex aequo et bono''''' ([[Latin]] for "according to the right and good" or "from equity and conscience") is a [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin phrase]] that is used as a legal [[technical terminology|term of art]]. In the context of [[arbitration]], it refers to the power of arbitrators to dispense with consideration of the law but consider solely what they consider to be fair and equitable in the case at hand.

Article 38(2) of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) provides that the court may decide cases ''ex aequo et bono'' only if the parties agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0 |title=Statute of the Court |publisher=International Court of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the ICJ decided a case using "equitable criteria" in creating a boundary in the Gulf of Maine for Canada and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/67/067-19841012-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf |title=Case concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area |publisher=International Court of Justice |date=October 12, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 33 of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]]'s Arbitration Rules (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/arb-rules/arb-rules.pdf |title=UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules |publisher=United Nations Commission on International Trade Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides that the arbitrators shall consider only the applicable law unless the arbitral agreement allows the arbitrators to consider ''ex aequo et bono'', or [[amiable compositeur]], instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/un.arbitration.rules.1976/33.html |title=Article 33 – Applicable law, amiable compositeur |work=UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is also expressed in many national and subnational arbitration laws such as section 22 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW).

On the other hand, the constituent treaty of the Eritrea–Ethiopia Claims Commission explicitly forbids the body from interpreting ''ex aequo et bono''.

==Ex aequo==
The phrase '''''ex aequo''''' (without ''et bono'') is used to mean "equally placed", often in the context of competition winners.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' (1998). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=PA561 "ex aequo"], p. 561. {{ISBN|8186062254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Databar 14 00075678164125.png|thumbnail|GS1 DataBar barcode symbol encoding a GTIN-12 number]]
[[Image:Databar-stacked-omni.png|frame|GS1 DataBar Stacked Omni-Directional barcode symbol encoding &lt;tt&gt;'''00123456789012'''&lt;/tt&gt;]]

'''GS1 DataBar''' is a family of symbols most commonly seen in the [[GS1 DataBar Coupon]]. Formerly known as Reduced Space Symbology (RSS-14), this family of [[barcodes]] include:

* Symbols intended for retail [[point of sale]] scanning:
** GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional
** GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional
** GS1 DataBar Expanded
** GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked
* Symbols that are not intended for retail Point-of-Sale scanning:
** GS1 DataBar Truncated
** GS1 DataBar Limited
** GS1 DataBar Stacked

All GS1 DataBar barcodes encode a GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 in a 14-digit data structure. In order to make the GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 a 14-digit data structure, a leading zero or zeros is filled to the left of the GTIN. GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional, GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional, GS1 DataBar Expanded, and GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked have omnidirectional scanning capability. GS1 DataBar Truncated, GS1 DataBar Stacked and GS1 DataBar Limited can only be scanned by a linear hand held or imaging scanning device: they cannot be scanned by omnidirectional scanners and are intended to be read by handheld scanners.

GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional is designed to condense the GTIN information into a more compact and square barcode suitable for use on smaller packages (such as the label stickers on fresh produce).

GS1 DataBar Limited, GS1 DataBar Stacked and GS1 DataBar Truncated are designed for very small item identification and are mainly used in the [[healthcare industry]]. Each encodes a GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 in 14-digit data structure. Only GS1 DataBar Limited uses an indicator digit 1.

In addition to encoding Application Identifier (01) GTIN, GS1 DataBar Expanded and GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked can encode additional GS1 Application Identifiers such as [[shelf life|sell-by date]], weight, and lot number. Each symbol has a capacity of up to 74 characters. These attributes can help in controlling [[shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]], optimizing product replenishment, and improving the traceability of a product at the point of sale. They are seeing increased use in manufacturers' coupons. Starting June 2011 GS1 Databar use is mandated for coupons and the use of UPC-A must be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honeywellaidc.com/promos/0710_Ask_the_Expert_landing/images/61510GS1DataBarPres_20100709T175210Z.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbology is formally defined as ISO/IEC 24724:2006.

The name was changed from RSS to GS1 DataBar due to the potential for confusion with [[Really Simple Syndication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gs1.org/docs/media_centre/gs1_pr_270207_RSS_now_called_GS1_DataBar.pdf |title=Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) is now called GS1 DataBar |author=Eric Decroix |publisher=GS1 Global Office (press release)|date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the above is true.

'''Sir James Henry Gunson''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CMG|CBE}} (26 October 1877 – 12 May 1963) was a New Zealand businessman and [[Mayor of Auckland City]] from 1915 to 1925. He was knighted in 1924.

==W Gunson &amp; Co==
Born and educated in Auckland, in his mid-twenties he took over W Gunson &amp; Co, the seed-grain and produce business his father founded in 1881. William Gunson died in 1902.  In October 1916, now mayor of Auckland, James sold his father's stock and station agency to [[Wright Stephenson]].&lt;ref&gt;Business Changes Hands. ''Auckland Star'', Volume XLVII, Issue 268, 9 November 1916, Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
James Gunson stood for Parliament several times without success; ([[Roskill (New Zealand electorate)|Roskill]] in 1919, [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden]] in 1926 and then [[Auckland Suburbs (New Zealand electorate)|Auckland Suburbs]] in 1928).

==Auckland==
Mayor from 1915 to 1925 he undertook the building of the war memorials [[Auckland Museum]] and Cenotaph, the [[Domain Wintergardens|Wintergardens]] in [[Auckland Domain]] and the construction of [[Tamaki Drive]]. In later public life, he was responsible for the monument on One Tree Hill ([[Maungakiekie]]) and the treeplanting of [[Cornwall Park, Auckland|Cornwall Park]] fulfilling Sir [[John Logan Campbell (politician)|John Logan Campbell]]'s vision. Gunson was Chairman of the [[Auckland Harbour Board]] 1911–15, and was a member of the Government Railways Board 1931–35.

Several parts of the city bear his name or were his gift. His farming property to the South of Auckland in [[Manukau]], called Totara Park, was later given to the city of Auckland. His main town residence, in St Andrew's Road, [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]], became the Tongan royal residence, which it remains.  A further Auckland property (named Rydal Mount after the residence of the English poet [[William Wordsworth]]) was by the same architect, Draffin, that Gunson had chosen to design [[Auckland Museum]]. Gunson Street, in Freemans Bay, Auckland, is named after him.

In 1935, he was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | work= Evening Post | accessdate=14 August 2013 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzoni has co-authored several books and more than 30 business case studies on how leaders can create a high performance work environment reshaping management culture and unlearning bad practice. Four of his case studies were recognised in the Case of the Year Awards by the European Foundation for Management Development &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efmd.org|title=EFMD – Business School Accreditation, Corporate Learning|website=www.efmd.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Case centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecasecentre.org/main/products/view?&amp;id=62355|title=Helen Ramsay: A Mediation Attempt|website=thecasecentre.org|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzoni has written several articles in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2016/09/to-get-more-feedback-act-more-coachable|title=To Get More Feedback, Act More Coachable|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0d117500-f17d-11d8-95b8-00000e2511c8.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4shdwzg8O|title=How companies can go from good to great|last=Manzoni|first=Jean Francois|date=2004-08-19|work=Financial Times|access-date=2017-09-15|issn=0307-1766}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''The Set-Up to Fail Syndrome: How Good Managers Cause Great People to Fail'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Set-Up-Fail-Syndrome-Managers-People/dp/0875849490|title=The Set-Up-To-Fail Syndrome: How Good Managers Cause Great People to Fail|last=Manzoni|first=Jean-Francois|last2=Barsoux|first2=Jean-Louis|date=October 2002|publisher=Harvard Business Review Press|isbn=9780875849492|location=Boston, Mass|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he co authored with Jean-Louis Barsoux. The book expands on an similarly themed article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1998/03/the-set-up-to-fail-syndrome|title=The Set-Up-To-Fail Syndrome|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Harvard Business Review'' in which the authors explored how managers’ behavior might contribute to employees poor performance. In an interview with [[BBC News|BBC]], Manzoni explained how employees also contribute to their own unsatisfactory relationships with their superiors. Manzoni cautioned that attaching labels like demanding or overbearing can ultimately become a self-fulfilling prophecy. "The moment you label someone as difficult you’ve just made them more difficult to work with because you’re not going to give this person the benefit of the doubt anymore and you’re not going to relate with them on a productive level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170817-how-to-identify-and-handle-a-demanding-boss|title=How to identify, and handle, a demanding boss|last=Johanson|first=Mark|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzoni was invited to speak at the 2014 and 2016 [[World Economic Forum]] meetings in Davos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speakersassociates.com/speaker/jean-francois-manzoni|title=Jean-Francois Manzoni|last=Ltd|first=Speakers Associates|date=2016-11-04|website=Speakers Associates|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/people/jean-francois-manzoni/|title=Jean-François Manzoni {{!}} World Economic Forum|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni is a member of the Human Capital Leadership Institute’s International Advisory Panel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hcli.org/the-institute/international-academic-panel/|title=international academic panel – Human Capital Leadership Institute|website=www.hcli.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Switzerland, Singapore’s Public Service Division and the [[Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Jens Henrik Beer''' (1731 – 7 August 1808) was a Norwegian businessperson.

He was born in [[Flekkefjord]] as a son of merchant and sawmill owner Nils Henriksen Beer (1690–1746) and his wife Anna M. C. Eide.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Beer, Jens Henrik|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull Sr. |editor2=Krogvig, Anders |editor2-link=Anders Krogvig |editor3=Gran, Gerhard |editor3-link=Gerhard Gran|edition=1st|first=Wollert|last=Keilhau|authorlink=Wollert Keilhau|year=1923|volume=1|pages=407–408|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father acquired burghership in 1736, and was probably a part of the first generation of the family to be born in Norway—Jens Henrik Beer's grandfather probably immigrated from Germany or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ringard|first=Morten|authorlink=Morten Ringard|title=Flekkefjords historie|publisher=Flekkefjord Municipality|location=Flekkefjord|year=1942|page=131|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer was married twice; first to Elisabeth K. J. Eide (1736–1767) from 1763 to 1765, then to Ellen Bolette Færø (1745–1817) from 1769 to his death. He was a grandfather of [[Jens Henrik Beer]] and [[Anders Beer]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He attended school in the [[Netherlands]], and also spent time at sea. He is notable for being one of the leading merchants between Norway and [[Scotland]] at his time. His ships exported timber to Scotland, and [[malt]] and [[flour]] in return to Norway. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he saved Scottish cargo by sailing under a Danish flag, and even sold it in France. He was declared an [[honorary citizen]] of Montrose in 1772. In Norway, to which he gradually retreated, he was a ship-owner and owned sawmills at Tjørsvaag, [[Fjellsæ|Fjeldså]] and [[Sirnes]] in the Flekkefjord district, at [[Haughom|Haukom]] in [[Sirdal|Siredalen]] and at [[Feda]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

== Board memberships &amp; charities ==
Lamar Hunt Jr. also commits time to serving on a number of different advisory boards as another way to lend a hand and give back to the communities that have meant so much to him. Over the years, Lamar Hunt Jr. has served on school boards, Dynamic Catholic Board of Directors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dynamiccatholic.com/our-mission/board-of-directors/#lamar|title=Board of Directors - The Dynamic Catholic Institute|work=The Dynamic Catholic Institute|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the board for [http://huntmidwest.com/about-hunt-midwest/ownership-leadership/ Hunt Midwest Enterprises], to name a few.

Hunt Jr. also serves on the Catholic Radio Network founded by Jim O'Laughlin in 2004. As a member of the advisory board and an underwritter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecatholicradionetwork.com/services2|title=The Catholic Radio Network - Underwriters|last=|first=|date=|website=The Catholic Radio Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; his involvement has helpedgrown to include 17 stations all over Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado.

Hunt Midwest Enterprises (HME) is part of the legacy left behind by [[Lamar Hunt|Lamar Hunt's]] desire to invest in and give back to the Kansas City community. Lamar Hunt Jr. stewards this heritage as an active board member in projects that match its core values of quality, integrity, safety, and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140417006127/en/LightEdge-Solutions-Hunt-Midwest-Celebrate-Opening-Kansas|title=Hunt Midwest Celebrates Opening of New Kansas City Data Center|last=Hagen|first=Debbie|date=April 17, 2014|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamar Hunt Jr. evaluates the various projects presented to him by Hunt Midwest's management team and helps to develop the vision that was established by his father.

Hunt Jr. also volunteered with the Archbishop's Case Review Task Force, which examined the major needs in the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas in order to come up with approaches and fundraising solutions that helped meet some urgent needs. In 2012, the Task Force completed a private appeal campaign and raised $14 million for various projects in the Kansas City area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 6, 2012|title=Archbishop’s Case Review Task Force Final Report and Recommendations|url=https://www.archkck.org/document.doc?id=1200|journal=The Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas|volume=|pages=37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamar Hunt Jr. also gives his time, resources, and support to charities, organizations, and programs such as the Bright Futures Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article57111728.html|title=Former Derrick Thomas Academy to Become Home to New Catholic Elementary School|last=|first=|date=January 28, 2016|work=Kansas City Star|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helps provide scholarships for students in need to attend Catholic schools throughout the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph without a financial barrier. The Bright Futures Fund helps students to discover their potential, build a foundation of social justice, and develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The fund also helps build a community where families feel safe and welcome and schools that engage both students and their parents in their educational journey.

He has also participated in Read Across America, a program in which adults simply give up a part of their day to read to children at schools. Lamar Hunt Jr. participated in both Independence, Missouri and Columbus, Ohio and found the experience to be very moving. "Reading is so fundamental and important that any adult can be a role model for children in this critical life skill," he says. "I was told that, as a male, reading to students had a particularly great impact because so often fathers do not do this with their children."

The [[Law]] &amp; Management approach is a term defined by Antoine Masson and Hugh Bouthinon-Dumas, researchers at ESSEC, to refer to any research works focusing on Law as a key factor for companies success.&lt;ref name="RTDcom"&gt;A. Masson, H. Bouthinon-Dumas, L’approche Law and Management, ''RTD Com'', janvier /mars 2011, p. 233 à 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law &amp; Management approach, unlike the Economic Analysis of Law (also known as "Law and Economics") which primarily aims at assessing and comparing the cost and efficiency of the rules in accordance with criterium developed by Economists, seeks to explain the differences of performance between companies facing the same legal environment, according to their ability to take advantage from Law.

From a methods perspective, the Law &amp; Management approach focuses on the  behaviors of economic actors towards Law. The Law &amp; Management methods are therefore primarily behavioral and borrow numerous investigation and data processing techniques from the [[sociology]] or [[psychology]] fields since these approaches  rely on observation. The purpose of the Law &amp; Management is nevertheless specific and consistent with management sciences, as it try to understand how Law can be used by (and within) companies to achieve their assigned goals (that are mainly economic). The results of Law &amp; Management studies can be used to base recommendations that are addressed primarily not to normative or judicial authorities (as in the Law &amp; Economic) but to the economic actors.

Currently, the Law &amp; Management approach refers to the legal work of authors such as, in the United States, Constance Bagley ([[Yale School of Management]]),&lt;ref name="Winning Legally"&gt;, C. E. Bagley, Winning ''Legally: How to Use the Law to Create Value, Marshal Resources, and Manage Risk, Harvard Business School Press'', 2005, spec. pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Bird ([[University of Connecticut]]),&lt;ref name="Pathways of Legal Strategy "&gt;, R. Bird, Pathways of Legal Strategy, ''14 STAN. J.L, BUS, &amp; FIN.'' (2008), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; George Siedel (Michigan Business School),&lt;ref name="Using Law for Competitive Advantage"&gt;, G. J. Siedel, ''Using Law for Competitive Advantage'', Jossey Bass, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Scandinavia]] (around the "proactive law” movement) Haapio Helena ([[University of Vaasa]]),&lt;ref name="Introduction to Praoactive Law "&gt;, H. Haapio, Introduction to Praoactive Law : A Business Lawyer's View, ''Scandinavian Studies in Law'', vol. 49, 2010, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[France]], Christophe Roquilly (EDHEC),&lt;ref name="Performance juridique et avantage concurrentiel "&gt;, Ch. Roquilly, « Performance juridique et avantage concurrentiel », LPA, 30 avril 2007, n° 86, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Christophe Collard (EDHEC),&lt;ref name="La performance juridique"&gt;, C. Collard, C. Roquilly, La performance juridique : pour une vision stratégique du droit dans l'entreprise, L.G.D.J., 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Masson (ESSEC) ou Hugues Bouthinon-Dumas (ESSEC).

'''''Le chant du Styrène''''' (lit. "the song of the [[styrene]]") is a 13 minutes long French documentary film from 1958 directed by [[Alain Resnais]].

The film was an order by French industrial group [[Pechiney]] to highlight the merits of plastics. The commentary, narrated by [[Pierre Dux]], is a poem written by [[Raymond Queneau]], all in [[alexandrine]]s, whose title is a pun from styrene's phonetic resemblance to [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]].

'''Little Italy''' is a neighborhood in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], once known for its large population of [[Italian Americans]].&lt;ref name="lifeinitaly.com"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/heritage/little-italy.asp Little Italy | Italy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the neighborhood consists of only a few Italian stores and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littleitalynyc.com/ Little Italy NYC - The Official Website for New York City's Little Italy District&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the west by [[Tribeca]] and [[SoHo, Manhattan|Soho]], on the south by [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], on the east by the [[Bowery]] and [[Lower East Side]], and on the north by [[Nolita]].

==History==
Little Italy on [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]] used to extend as far south as [[Worth Street]], as far north as [[Houston Street]], as far west as [[Lafayette Street]], and as far east as [[Bowery]].&lt;ref name="lifeinitaly.com"/&gt; It is now only three blocks on Mulberry Street.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/30/changing-times-pushing-little-italy-to-brink-of-extinction/ | work=New York Post | first=Kate | last=Briquelet | title=Little Italy is on the brink of extinction | date=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little Italy originated as Mulberry Bend. [[Jacob Riis]] described Mulberry Bend as "the foul core of New York's slums."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1&gt;Tonelli, Bill. "Arrivederci, Little Italy." ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. September 27, 2004. p. [http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/features/9904/ 1]. Retrieved on April 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period "Immigrants of the late 19th century usually settled in ethnic neighborhoods".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City|last=Jackson, Keller|first=Kenneth T, Lisa|publisher=University Press|year=2010|location=New Haven, US|pages=|quote=|via=Yale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore,  the "mass immigration from Italy during the 1880's"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multicultural America: A Multimedia Encyclopedia|last=Pretelli|first=Matteo|publisher=SAGE Reference|year=2014|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1362–1363|quote=|via=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the large settlement of Italian immigrants in lower Manhattan. The results of such migration had created an "influx of Italian immigrants" which had "led to the commercial gathering of their dwelling and business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Immigration and Migration in the American West|last=Henderson|first=Matthew Adam|publisher=SAGE Reference|year=2006|pages=411–413|via=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Tonelli from ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine said, "Once, Little Italy was like an insular Neapolitan village re-created on these shores, with its own language, customs, and financial and cultural institutions."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt; Little Italy was not the largest Italian neighborhood in New York City, as [[East Harlem]] (or [[Italian Harlem]]) had a larger Italian population. Tonelli said that Little Italy "was perhaps the city's poorest Italian neighborhood".&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt; In 1910 Little Italy had almost 10,000 Italians; that was the peak of the community's Italian population. At the turn of the 20th century over 90% of the residents of the Fourteenth Ward were of Italian birth or origins.&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt; Tonnelli said that it meant "that residents began moving out to more spacious digs almost as soon as they arrived."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt; Such a vastly growing community impacted the "U.S. labor movement in the 20th century" by making up much of the labor population in the garment industry".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], many residents of the [[Lower East Side]] began moving to [[Brooklyn]], [[Staten Island]], eastern [[Long Island]], and [[New Jersey]]. Chinese immigrants became an increased presence after the [[U.S. Immigration Act of 1965]] removed immigration restrictions, and the [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan Chinatown]] to Little Italy's south expanded. In 2004, Tonelli said, "You can go back 30 years and find newspaper clips chronicling the expansion of Chinatown and mourning the loss of Little Italy."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt;

Prior to 2004, several upscale businesses entered the northern portion of the area between Houston and Kenmare Street. Tonelli said "Real-estate prices zoomed, making it even tougher for the old-timers—residents and businesspeople alike—to hang on."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, areas below Houston Street were cut off for the rest of the fall of 2001. The [[San Gennaro feast]], scheduled for September 13, was postponed. Business from the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] dropped severely, due to the closure of [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], which connected Chinatown and the [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; as a result, residents in Little Italy and Chinatown suffered. Tonelli said the post-9/11 events "strangely enough, ended up motivating all these newfangled efforts to save what's left of the old neighborhood."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt;

In 2004 Tonelli said "Today, Little Italy is a veneer—50 or so restaurants and cafés catering to tourists, covering a dense neighborhood of tenements shared by recent Chinese immigrants, young Americans who can't afford [[SoHo, Manhattan|Soho]]&lt;!--Don't change! It's a quote--&gt;, and a few remaining real live Italians."&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt; This sentiment has also been echoed by Italian culture and heritage website ''ItalianAware''. The site has called the dominance of Italians in the area, "relatively short lived." It attributes this to the quick financial prosperity many Italians achieved, which afforded them the opportunity to leave the cramped neighborhood for areas in Brooklyn and Queens. The site also goes on to state that the area is currently referred to as Little Italy more out of nostalgia than as a reflection of a true ethnic population.&lt;ref name=ItalianAware&gt;{{cite web|title=Littl-er Italy in NYC|url=http://italianaware.blogspot.com/2011/02/littler-italy-in-new-york.html|publisher=ItalianAware|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Little Italy and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] were listed in a single [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="NRHP listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places listings for February 19, 2010|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20100219.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little Italy, by this point, was shrinking rapidly.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' sent its reporters to characterize the Little Italy/Mulberry neighborhood in May 1896:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are laborers; toilers in all grades of manual work; they are artisans, they are junkman, and here, too, dwell the rag pickers. ... There is a monster colony of Italians who might be termed the commercial or shop keeping community of the Latins. Here are all sorts of stores, pensions, groceries, fruit emporiums, tailors, shoemakers, wine merchants, importers, musical instrument makers. ... There are notaries, lawyers, doctors, apothecaries, undertakers. ... There are more bankers among the Italians than among any other foreigners except the Germans in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (May 31, 1896) "Little Italy in New-York" ''[[The New York Times]]'' p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 1,211 residents claiming Italian ancestry lived in three census tracts that make up Little Italy. Those residents comprise 8.25% of the population in the community, which is similar to the proportion of those of Italian ancestry throughout New York City. &lt;!--Used as a comparison in the New Yorker article--&gt;Bill Tonelli of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine contrasted Little Italy with the [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan Chinatown]]; in 2000, of the residents of the portions of Chinatown south of Grand Street, 81% were of Chinese origins.&lt;ref name="Tonelli1"/&gt;

In 2004, Tonelli revisited the issue, saying, "Little Italy may always endure as an open-air theme park of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European immigration to the Lower East Side ... But you'll spend a long time in the neighborhood before you hear anyone speak Italian, and then the speaker will be a tourist from Milan."&lt;ref name=Tonelli2&gt;Tonelli, Bill. "Arrivederci, Little Italy." ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. September 27, 2004. p. [http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/features/9904/index1.html 2]. Retrieved on April 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Tonelli added, "You have to slow your gaze to find the neighbors in this neighborhood, because they're so overwhelmed and outnumbered by the tourists. But once you focus, you can see them, standing (or sitting) in the interstices, taking in the scene, like the group of men, mostly senior citizens, loitering contentedly under an awning on Mulberry Street."&lt;ref name=Tonelli2/&gt;

==Cultural attractions==
[[File:Little Italy.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]] in Little Italy]]
Little Italy was home to dozens of restaurants that serve authentic Italian cuisine, but between March 2013 and March 2014, eight eateries closed down.&lt;ref&gt;http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/03/rent_hikes_forcing_little_italy_restaurants_to_close.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, [[Sorrento Lactalis]] funds neighborhood cultural events in Little Italy.&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt;

The Feast of San Gennaro originally was once only a one-day religious commemoration. It began in September 1926 with the new arrival of immigrants from Naples. The Italian immigrants congregated along Mulberry Street in Manhattan's ''Little Italy'' to celebrate [[San Gennaro]] as the Patron Saint of [[Naples]]. The ''Feast of San Gennaro'' is a large street fair, lasting 11 days, that takes place every September along Mulberry Street between Houston and Canal Streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italian-link.com/pages/littleitalynewyork.shtml Little Italy New York City&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is an annual celebration of [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]] and the [[Italian-American]] community. In 1995 Mort Berkowitz became the professional manager of a community group that had been formed to take over management of the San Gennaro feast. Since then, Berkowitz became involved in other recreational activities in Little Italy, including the summer, [[Carnival|Carnevale]], [[Columbus Day]], and [[Christmas]] events.&lt;ref name=Tonelli1/&gt;

Richard Alba, a sociologist and professor at [[University at Albany, SUNY]], said, "The fascinating part here is the way in which ethnic tourism—not only by [[Italian Americans]] but by people who want to see an authentic urban village—keeps these neighborhoods going."&lt;ref name=Tonelli2/&gt;

==Organized crime and the Mafia==
Little Italy residents have seen organized crime since the early 20th century. Powerful members of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mafia]] have operated in ''Little Italy''.
* [[Ignazio Saietta|Ignazio "The Wolf" Lupo]] (a [[Morello crime family]] boss operated in Little Italy from late 1890s-1920s)
* [[Michele Miranda|Michele "Big Mike" Miranda]] (a [[Caporegime|Capo]] in the [[Genovese crime family]] operated in the neighborhood from the 1950s into the late 1960s)
* [[Peter DeFeo]] (a ''Genovese crime family'' capo who operated an illegal ''Italian lottery'' in the 1960s into the 1970s)
* [[Matthew Ianniello|Matthew "Matty the Horse" Ianniello]], a ''Genovese crime family'' capo operated from his restaurant ''[[Umberto's Clam House]]'' in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;McShane, Larry via [[Associated Press]]. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/04/AR2007030400559_pf.html "Matty 'The Horse' on His Last Ride"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 4, 2007. Accessed December 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitello, Paul. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/nyregion/mafia-boss-matty-the-horse-ianniello-dies-at-92.html "Matthew Ianniello, the Mafia Boss Known as ‘Matty the Horse,’ Dies at 92"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 22, 2012. Accessed December 23, 2017. "His stake in one restaurant, Umberto's Clam House, in Little Italy, placed him at the scene of an infamous and legendary gangland murder on April 7, 1972, when the reputed Colombo crime family underboss Joey Gallo was riddled with bullets between courses of a late-night meal by four gunmen, in an intrafamily gang war. Mr. Ianniello, who then owned a hidden interest in Umberto's, was working in the kitchen at the time and was initially suspected of having some involvement in the hit. But he was never charged."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Gotti]], boss of the [[Gambino crime family]] operated from the [[Ravenite Social Club]] in the late 1980s into the early 1990s&lt;ref&gt;[[Selwyn Raab|Rabb, Selwyn]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/magazine/john-gotti-running-the-mob.html?pagewanted=all "John Gotti Running The Mob"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 2, 1989. Accessed December 23, 2017. "On Christmas Eve, a week after the double slaying, detectives concealed in a van in Little Italy witnessed a striking scene outside the Ravenite Social Club, Dellacroce's old headquarters, that confirmed what investigators had heard from informers: John Gotti was the new boss of the Gambino family."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Little Italy was the locale of the fictional [[Corleone family|Corleone crime family]] depicted in the novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' and the [[Godfather Trilogy|three movies]] based on it. It is also the setting for the 1973 film ''[[Mean Streets]]'', starring [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Harvey Keitel]],&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Edward. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/16/nyregion/little-italy-journal-reliving-mean-streets-in-open-air-screenings.html "Little Italy Journal; Reliving 'Mean Streets' In Open-Air Screenings"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 16, 2000. Accessed July 30, 2016. "For a taste of the old neighborhood, he had to walk over to the playground at Spring and Mulberry Streets to watch films like ''Mean Streets,'' the 1973 Martin Scorsese opus in which Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro play small-time wiseguys in Little Italy."&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1994 film ''[[Leon: The Professional]]'', starring [[Jean Reno]] and [[Natalie Portman]].&lt;ref&gt;Breihan, Tom. [https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/the-professional-is-deeply-problematic-profoundly-cool-1702737080 "''The Professional'' Is Deeply Problematic, Profoundly Cool, And Very '90s"], ''[[Deadspin]]'', May 15, 2015. Accessed December 23, 2017. "The movie opens with a camera flying over Central Park, turning into a fisheye zoom-in on the Little Italy restaurant where Reno gets his contracts. When he's on a job, Reno's face emerges from shadows, then disappears again when he's made his point."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Horstman and Auzenne learned about podcasting in 2005 and decided that this could be a way to disseminate their knowledge about effective management.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Auzenne said he didn’t want to create a model where he would only give away half of a solution and then require the audience to pay for the rest of the solution.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"&gt;Mike Auzenne in: Manager Tools: Making Money from Podcasting article by David Spark on http://www.sparkminute.com/2009/09/29/manager-tools-making-money-from-podcasting/&lt;/ref&gt;  The co-founders have stated that they believe they can change the world by changing management, and that the way to change it is one manager at a time.&lt;ref name="mtweb" /&gt; After starting with the weekly free podcasts, both hosts completely dedicated their work time, and became co-founders of Manager Tools LLC, a management consulting firm.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt; They regularly consult to and train managers in [[Fortune 1000]] companies around the world.&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;Career Tools Wins Business Category of People's Choice Podcast Awards http://www.eworldwire.com/pressreleases/211975&lt;/ref&gt; Their company also sells transcripts of the podcasts on-line through membership, and they organize public and in-company conferences to practice the Manager Tools.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"/&gt; As of 2012, the company has five full-time employees.

Most casts are about 30–40 minutes long, presented as a dialogue between the two hosts.&lt;ref name="smb"&gt;http://www.smbtrendwire.com/2008/01/07/podcast-review-manager-tools/ Review at Small Business Trends Radio (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a specific topic related to management or career development. Casts start with an overview of the points to be discussed, followed by the discussion point by point, and end with a summary of the points discussed.

Manager Tools main podcasts are available on the webpage and also through [[iTunes]] and [[RSS]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;List of Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts&lt;/ref&gt; The podcasts often refer to each other which in the past has created issues with new listeners. In order to help them, a collection of 'basics' casts has been created and is available on their website as well.&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt; Those cover mostly 'The Management Trinity' as well as additional basic notions.

Manager Tools casts help ''90 percent of the people, 90 percent of the time''.&lt;ref&gt;Feedback From Your Directs - What To Say - Part 1 http://www.manager-tools.com/2012/04/feedback-your-directs-what-say-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; And the great majority of the casts are timeless instead of just timely.&lt;ref name="Newsletter"&gt;Mark Horstman, "Things I Think I Think" newsletter from 26 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Management]] is about doing the right things repeatedly. Successful managers do them over and over again; and is about '''Behaviors'''.&lt;ref&gt;One-on-Ones: The Single Most Effective Management Tool http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Content and theories==

===Foundational Principles - The Management Trinity===

The hosts often refers to the ''''Management Trinity'''':&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manager-tools.com/2013/01/positive-feedback-before-its-time&lt;/ref&gt; One on Ones, Feedback, and Coaching, plus their silent fourth partner, Delegation. These are at the heart of everything Manager Tools recommends.&lt;ref&gt;The Management Trinity http://www.manager-tools.com/2009/10/management-trinity-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; All Of The Manager Tools Trinity Tools are ''Teachable Equivalents'' that the hosts have developed. Most casts are based on these tools.

They usually include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics"&gt;List of Basic Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Managing Responsibilities http://www.ymresourcer.com/documents/Managing_Responsibilities.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
*One on Ones (Weekly meetings in order to reinforce relationships) - recognised as "the best business practice of all time" by profitguide.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profitguide.com/article/78170--the-30-best-business-practices-of-all-time&lt;/ref&gt; -
*Feedback (reinforcing or correcting behaviours)
*Coaching (Fostering Continuous Development)
*Delegation (Managerial Economics of who should do a task)

Other foundational principles as described in the 'basics' podcasts include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt;
* Running Effective Meetings
* Methods for rolling out the Manager Tools Trinity
* 'Solution to a Stalled Technical Career'

===DISC - Management adapted to the personality of the direct report===
Manager Tools podcasts often refer to the [[DISC assessment]] when adapting management and communication styles to individuals.

The DiSC model provides nonjudgmental language for exploring behavioral issues across four personality traits ('''D'''ominance, '''I'''nfluence, '''S'''teadiness and '''C'''onscientious.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inscapepartners.com/discclassic/&lt;/ref&gt; These four traits can be grouped in a grid with "D" and "I" sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and "C" and "S" below representing introverted aspects. "D" and "C" then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and "I" and "S" share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal dimension represents "Open" vs. "Guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[[DISC assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
There are also some recurring references to other 'rules' or 'laws'. These are mostly referred to verbally in the podcasts:&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/hortsmans-laws-podcast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/horstmans-laws-01&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Max Ernst''' (2 April 1891 – 1 April 1976) was a German (naturalised American in 1948 and French in 1958) painter, sculptor, [[graphic artist]], and poet. A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary pioneer of the [[Dada]] movement and [[Surrealism]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Max Ernst was born in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]], near [[Cologne]], the third of nine children of a middle-class [[Catholic]] family. His father Philipp was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter, a devout Christian and a strict disciplinarian. He inspired in Max a penchant for defying authority, while his interest in painting and sketching in nature influenced Max to take up painting himself.&lt;ref name="chrono285"&gt;Spies, Rewald 2005, 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 Ernst enrolled in the [[University of Bonn]], studying philosophy, art history, literature, psychology and psychiatry. He visited [[lunatic asylum|asylums]] and became fascinated with the art of the mentally ill patients; he also started painting that year, producing sketches in the garden of the Brühl castle, and portraits of his sister and himself. In 1911 Ernst befriended [[August Macke]] and joined his ''Die Rheinischen Expressionisten'' group of artists, deciding to become an artist. In 1912 he visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne, where works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] profoundly influenced his approach to art. His own work was exhibited the same year together with that of the Das Junge Rheinland group, at Galerie Feldman in Cologne, and then in several group exhibitions in 1913.&lt;ref name="chrono285" /&gt;

In 1914 Ernst met [[Hans Arp]] in Cologne. The two soon became friends and their relationship lasted for fifty years. After Ernst completed his studies in the summer, his life was interrupted by [[World War I]]. Ernst was drafted and served both on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Fronts]]. Such was the devastating effect of the war on the artist that in his autobiography he referred to his time in the army thus: "On the first of August 1914 M[ax].E[rnst]. died. He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918".&lt;ref&gt;Spies, Rewald 2005, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period on the Western Front, Ernst was assigned to chart maps, which allowed him to continue painting.&lt;ref name="chrono285"/&gt; Several [[German Expressionist]] painters died in action during the war, among them [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]].

===Dada and surrealism===
[[File:Ubu Imperator.jpg|thumb|right|Max Ernst, ''Ubu Imperator'', 1923, [[Musee National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]
Ernst was demobilised in 1918 and returned to Cologne. He soon married art history student [[Luise Straus-Ernst|Luise Straus]], whom he had met in 1914. In 1919, Ernst visited [[Paul Klee]] in Munich and studied paintings by [[Giorgio de Chirico]], which deeply impressed him. The same year, inspired partly by de Chirico and partly by studying mail-order catalogues, teaching-aide manuals and similar sources, he produced his first [[collage]]s (notably ''Fiat modes'', a portfolio of [[lithograph]]s), a technique which would come to dominate his artistic pursuits. Also in 1919 Ernst, social activist [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld]] and several colleagues founded the Cologne [[Dada]] group. In 1919–20 Ernst and Baargeld published various short-lived magazines such as ''Der Strom'', ''die Schammade'' and organised Dada exhibitions.&lt;ref name="chrono285"/&gt;

Ernst and Luise's son [[Jimmy Ernst|Ulrich 'Jimmy' Ernst]] was born on 24 June 1920; he also became a painter.&lt;ref name="chrono285" /&gt; Ernst's marriage to Luise was short-lived. In 1921 he met [[Paul Éluard]], who became a lifelong friend. Éluard bought two of Ernst's paintings (''Celebes'' and ''Oedipus Rex'') and selected six collages to illustrate his poetry collection ''Répétitions''. A year later the two collaborated on ''Les malheurs des immortels'' and then with [[André Breton]], whom Ernst met in 1921, on the magazine ''[[Littérature (magazine)|Littérature]]''. In 1922, unable to secure the necessary papers, Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a [[ménage à trois]] with Éluard and his wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] in Paris suburb Saint-Brice, leaving behind his wife and son.&lt;ref name="chrono285"/&gt; During his first two years in Paris, Ernst took various odd jobs to make a living and continued to paint. In 1923 the Éluards moved to a new home in [[Eaubonne]], near Paris, where Ernst painted numerous [[mural]]s. The same year his works were exhibited at ''Salon des Indépendants''.&lt;ref name="chrono285"/&gt;

[[File:Les Fusains.jpg|thumb|left|180px|"Les Fusains": 22, rue Tourlaque, [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] where Max Ernst established a studio in 1925]]
Although apparently accepting the ménage à trois, Éluard eventually became more concerned about the affair. In 1924 he abruptly left, first for [[Monaco]] and then for [[Saigon]].&lt;ref&gt;Warlick, M.E. 2001. ''Max Ernst and Alchemy: a Magician in Search of Myth'', p. 83. {{ISBN|978-0-292-79136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon asked his wife and Max Ernst to join him; both had to sell paintings to finance the trip. Ernst went to Düsseldorf and sold a large number of his works to a long-time friend, [[Johanna Ey]], owner of gallery ''Das Junge Rheinland''.&lt;ref name="chrono285"/&gt; After a brief time together in Saigon, the trio decided that Gala would remain with Paul. The Éluards returned to Eaubonne in early September, while Ernst followed them some months later, after exploring more of South-East Asia. He returned to Paris in late 1924 and soon signed a contract with Jacques Viot that allowed him to paint full-time. In 1925 Ernst established a studio at 22, rue Tourlaque.&lt;ref name="chrono285"/&gt;

In 1925, Ernst invented a graphic art technique called [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]] (see [[Surrealist techniques]]), which uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images. He also created the '[[grattage]]' technique, in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He used this technique in his famous painting ''[[Forest and Dove]]'' (as shown at the Tate Modern). The next year he collaborated with [[Joan Miró]] on designs for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. With Miró's help, Ernst developed grattage, in which he trowelled pigment from his canvases. He also explored with the technique of [[decalcomania]], which involves pressing paint between two surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Max Ernst working in decalcomania is shown in the 1978 documentary on the Dada and Surrealist art movement, ''Europe After the Rain''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst developed a fascination with birds that was prevalent in his work. His alter ego in paintings, which he called [[Loplop]], was a bird. He suggested that this alter-ego was an extension of himself stemming from an early confusion of birds and humans. He said that one night when he was young, he woke up and found that his beloved bird had died; a few minutes later, his father announced that his sister was born. Loplop often appeared in collages of other artists' work, such as ''Loplop presents André Breton''. Ernst drew a great deal of controversy with his 1926 painting ''The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses: André Breton, Paul Éluard, and the Painter''.&lt;ref&gt;Image: [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Max_Ernst/view_1.asp?item=4&amp;view=l The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E. and the Artist]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Ernst married {{Ill|Marie-Berthe Aurenche|de}} and it is thought his relationship with her may have inspired the erotic subject matter of ''The Kiss'' and other works of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Flint|first=Lucy, Guggenheim Collection|title=''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706214957/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|archivedate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst appeared in the 1930 film ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'', directed by the [[Surrealist]] [[Luis Buñuel]]. Ernst began to sculpt in 1934 and spent time with [[Alberto Giacometti]]. In 1938, the American heiress and artistic [[patron]] [[Peggy Guggenheim]] acquired a number of Max Ernst's works, which she displayed in her new gallery in London. Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim were married from 1942 to 1946.

===World War II and later life===
[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|''L'Ange du Foyer'', 1937]]
In September 1939, the outbreak of [[World War II]] caused Ernst to be interned as an "undesirable foreigner" in [[Camp des Milles]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], along with fellow surrealist, [[Hans Bellmer]], who had recently emigrated to Paris. He had been living with his lover and fellow surrealist painter, [[Leonora Carrington]] who, not knowing whether he would return, saw no option but to sell their house to repay their debts and leave for Spain. Thanks to the intercession of [[Paul Éluard]] and other friends, including the journalist [[Varian Fry]], he was released a few weeks later. Soon after the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]], he was arrested again, this time by the [[Gestapo]] but managed to escape and flee to America with the help of [[Peggy Guggenheim]] and Fry.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite web|last=Olga's Gallery|title=Max Ernst biography|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/E/ernst/ernstbio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim arrived in the United States in 1941 and were married at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iyengar|first1=Rishi|title=New Google Doodle Honors Surrealist Painter Leonora Carrington|url=http://time.com/3771801/google-doodle-leonora-carrington-surrealist-painter/|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=Time|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other artists and friends ([[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Marc Chagall]]) who had fled from the war and lived in New York City, Ernst helped inspire the development of [[Abstract expressionism]].

His marriage to Guggenheim did not last and in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in October 1946, in a double ceremony with [[Man Ray]] and Juliet P. Browner, he married [[Dorothea Tanning]].&lt;ref name="Juliet's obituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/obituaries/juliet-man-ray-79-the-artist-s-model-and-muse-is-dead.html | title=Juliet Man Ray, 79, The Artist's Model And Muse, Is Dead | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=21 January 1991 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Flint, Peter B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple made their home in [[Sedona, Arizona]] from 1946 to 1953, where the high desert landscapes inspired them and recalled Ernst's earlier imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waldman|first1=Diane|title=Max Ernst : A Retrospective|date=1975|publisher=Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Sedona was remote and populated by fewer than 400 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants and small Native American communities, their presence helped begin what would become an American [[artists colony]]. Among the monumental red rocks, Ernst built a small cottage by hand on Brewer Road and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists and for Ernst, who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living there. As a result of the book and its publicity, Ernst began to achieve financial success. From the 1950s he lived mainly in France. In 1954 he was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/max-ernst-1065 | work = Tate Etc. | title = Max Ernst 1891–1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the age of 84 on 1 April 1976 in Paris and was interred at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

Also, ''Barefoot in the Head'', a collaboration between guitarist [[Thurston Moore]] and saxophonists [[Jim Sauter (musician)|Jim Sauter]] and [[Don Dietrich (musician)|Don Dietrich]] of [[Borbetomagus]], features a collage from this same book.
* American rock group [[Mission of Burma]] titled two songs after the artist: "Max Ernst" was the b-side of their first 1980 single (now included on the CD of ''[[Signals, Calls and Marches]]''), mentioning two of Ernst's paintings (''The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus'' and ''Garden Airplane-Trap'') and ending with the words "Dada dada dada ..." repeated many times and distorted via [[tape loop]]; their 2002 album ''OnOffOn'' features "Max Ernst's Dream".
* Writer [[J. G. Ballard]] makes numerous references to the art works of Max Ernst in his breakthrough novel  ''[[The Drowned World]]'' (1962) and the experimental collection of short stories ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'' (1970).
* ''Europe After the Rain'' was used by musician [[John Foxx]] as the title for the opening track of his 1981 album ''[[The Garden (John Foxx album)|The Garden]]''.
* Max Ernst himself, and some of his work, is mentioned in [[William Gibson]]'s novel [[Count Zero]] (1986), the second novel of the [[Sprawl trilogy]], an influential set of books which established the [[cyberpunk]] subgenre of science-fiction
* ''(The) Eye of Silence'' was used by musician Cavestar (Kevin Crosslin) as the title of a track from his 1997 album ''Cavestar''.
* The first edition of the Penguin paperback edition of [[James Blish]]'s ''[[A Case of Conscience]]''  uses details from ''The Eye of Silence'' as cover art.
* Ernst's alter-ego [[Loplop]] appears in [[China Miéville]]'s 1998 debut novel ''[[King Rat (Miéville novel)|King Rat]]''.
* German experimental electronic musician [[Thomas Brinkmann]] has made numerous references to Max Ernst and [[Loplop]] in his productions and record labels.

==Legacy==
Max Ernst's life and career are examined in [[Peter Schamoni]]'s 1991 documentary ''Max Ernst''. Dedicated to the art historian [[Werner Spies]], it was assembled from interviews with Ernst, stills of his paintings and sculptures, and the memoirs of his wife Dorothea Tanning and son Jimmy. The 101-minute German film was released on DVD with English subtitles by Image Entertainment.

In 2005, "Max Ernst: A Retrospective" opened at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and included works such as ''Celebes'' (1921), ''Ubu Imperator'' (1923), and ''Fireside Angel'' (1937), which is one of the few definitively political pieces and is sub-titled ''The Triumph of Surrealism'' depicting a raging bird-like creature that symbolises the wave of fascism that enveloped Europe. The exhibition also includes Ernst's works that experiment with free association writing and the techniques of [[frottage (art)|frottage]], created from a rubbing from a textured surface; [[grattage]], involving scratching at the surface of a painting; and [[decalcomania]], which involves altering a wet painting by pressing a second surface against it and taking it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Max Ernst Retrospective Opens Today in NY|journal=Art+Auction|date=7 April 2005|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/117/a-max-ernst-retrospective-opens-today-in-ny/|accessdate=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst's son [[Jimmy Ernst|Jimmy]], a well-known German/American [[abstract expressionist]] painter, who lived on the south shore of [[Long Island]], died in 1984. His memoirs, ''A Not-So-Still Life'', were published shortly before his death. Max Ernst's grandson Eric and his granddaughter Amy are both artists and writers.

The [[Republic of Panama]] is one of the oldest and best-known tax havens in [[the Caribbean]], as well as one of the most established in the region.&lt;ref name=Maverick&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maverick|first1=J. B.|title=Why Is Panama Considered a Tax Haven?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/093015/why-panama-considered-tax-haven.asp|accessdate=May 5, 2016|work=Investopedia|date=September 30, 2015|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panama has had a reputation for [[tax avoidance]] since the early [[20th century]], and Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives.

Panama's offshore sector is intimately tied to the [[Panama canal]], which has made it a gateway and ''entrepôt'' for international trade.&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt; There are strong similarities between Panama and other leading tax havens like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. On paper at least, Panama has the largest shipping fleet in the world, greater than those of the US and China combined, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].

==Background (1910s–1970s)==
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the [[Panama Canal]], 1907]]
A 2014 investigation by journalist [[Ken Silverstein]] published in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Magazine]]'' explains how Panama came into being, with US help:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia to hand over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them [[J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], which was appointed as the country's official "fiscal agent".&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An operation{{which|date=July 2016}} approved by the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] sought to foment armed rebellion, forcing Panama away from Colombia, then politically fragile. Roosevelt achieved this goal with the help of [[William Nelson Cromwell]], a well-connected US Republican lawyer and also legal counsel for JP Morgan's railroad interests. The administration's key objective was allegedly to install a pro-US Panamanian government that would secure US rights over the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref name="Diaz-Espino2014"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Ovidio Diaz-Espino

|publisher=Primedia E-launch LLC
|isbn=978-0-9905521-2-3
|page=120
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] resulted, establishing permanent U.S. rights to a [[Panama Canal Zone]] several miles wide, across the neck of the isthmus. Panama became independent from Colombia the same month, and the Panama Canal opened in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 academic study published by the Norwegian Center for Taxation, Panama's reputation as a [[tax haven]] began in the year 1919, when it began registering foreign ships in order to help [[Standard Oil]] avoid US taxes and regulations; other US ship owners followed, some seeking to avoid the higher wages and better working conditions imposed by US legislation such as the Seaman's Act and safety standards for sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during the [[Prohibition era]], US passenger ships were allowed to serve alcohol to their customers without breaking the law if they had Panamanian registration.&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, Panama extended its minimalist approach to taxation, regulation and financial disclosure requirements to the world of [[offshore finance]]. According to the study, "Wall Street interests helped Panama introduce lax company incorporation laws, which let anyone start tax-free, anonymous corporations, with few questions asked".&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires" /&gt;

==Background (1970s–present)==
For decades, offshore finance had a relatively modest profile in Panama, but it took off in the 1970s as world oil prices surged. During this time, the Republic of Panama passed legislation "entrenching corporate and individual financial secrecy".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;
{{cite news
|title=Panama Papers: How did Panama become a tax haven?
|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-35967590
|work=BBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, partly attracted by business opportunities deriving from the Panama Canal and its free trade zone, more than 100 international banks had offices in Panama City.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

According to ''[[Investopedia]]'': "Panama's offshore jurisdiction offers a wide array of excellent financial services, including offshore banking, the incorporation of offshore companies, registration of ships and the formation of Panama trusts and foundations."&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt; In Panama, no taxes are imposed on offshore companies which engage in business solely outside of the jurisdiction; therefore, the companies which are incorporated in the Republic of Panama and the owners of these companies are exempt from [[corporate taxes]], [[withholding tax]]es, [[capital gains tax]], [[local taxes]], [[estate taxes]] and [[inheritance tax]]. However, businesses within Panama itself are permitted to conduct business there so long as the company pays its local taxes.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;

Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of the [[United States]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives due to the legislation which regulates the country's offshore jurisdiction and financial services.&lt;ref&gt;Panama as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives:

Alongside incorporation of IBCs, Panama is active in forming tax-evading foundations and trusts, insurance, and boat and shipping registration, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt;

===Financial privacy===
[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb |325px |right |Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] leak on April 15, 2016]]

An extensive amount of legislation currently exists in the Republic of Panama to protect corporate and financial privacy. However, organisations such as the [[Tax Justice Network]] and other [[advocacy groups]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] state that the main intention of these laws is financial secrecy, as opposed to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of [[shareholders]] of Panamanian corporations, trusts and foundations are still not required by law to be publicly registered. Panama has no [[exchange controls]]: this means that for individual clients of Panama's offshore banking, as well as for offshore business entities incorporated in Panama, there are no limits or reporting requirements on money transfers into or out of the country.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Panama also has very strict banking secrecy laws: for example, it is forbidden for Panamanian banks to share any information about offshore bank accounts or account holders, except under special circumstances instigated by the Panamanian authorities. Such regulation has made it difficult to investigate the true extent of the [[Panama Papers]] leak, as severe criminal penalties are enacted to individuals who breach confidentiality.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Despite this, Panama does not appear on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s top ten list for financial secrecy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View 2015 Results|url=http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|website=Financial Secrecy Index|publisher=Tax Justice Network|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055612/http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Alex Cobham of Tax Justice Network saying "There is a double standard: many developed countries host or support jurisdictions where there is an absence of financial transparency".&lt;ref name="BBC top 10"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seitz|first1=Max|title=Why the top 10 tax havens don't include Panama|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35998801|work=BBC Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Manuel Noriega]], commander of the [[Panamanian Public Forces#The Panamanian Defense Forces|Panama Defence Forces]], took power in Panama in 1983, Silverstein said, Noriega essentially nationalised the money-laundering business; he partnered with the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellin drug cartel]] and gave it free rein to operate in the country."&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[Private Eye]]'' used data collected from the [[Land Registry]] to create "an easily searchable online map ... of properties in England and Wales owned by offshore companies. It reveals for the first time the extent of the British property interests held by companies based in tax havens." Most of these properties are tax avoidance vehicles and in some cases also to conceal wealth of dubious origin."&lt;ref&gt;

A 2003 examination of tax havens by [[Jeffrey Robinson]] quotes a US Customs official as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Panama] is filled with dishonest lawyers, dishonest bankers, dishonest company formation agents and dishonest companies registered there by those dishonest lawyers so that they can deposit dirty money into their dishonest banks. The [[Colon Free Trade Zone|Free Trade Zone]] is the black hole through which Panama has become one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world.&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama"&gt;

'''ProClarity Corporation '''was a  [[software]] [[company (law)|company]] specializing in [[business intelligence]] and data analysis applications.

The company was founded in 1995 as Knosys Inc. in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Idaho]]. The company was renamed ProClarity Corporation after its primary commercial software product, "ProClarity", in 2001.

ProClarity's software products integrated tightly with [[Microsoft Analysis Services]].

Among ProClarity's more than 2,000 global clients were [[AT&amp;T]], [[Ericsson]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Home Depot]], Pennzoil QuakerState, [[Reckitt Benckiser]], [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [[Verizon]], and [[Wells Fargo]].

On April 3, 2006, [[Microsoft]] announced the acquisition of ProClarity.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/apr06/04-03ProClarityPR.mspx Microsoft Agrees to Acquire ProClarity, Enhancing Business Intelligence Offering]", Microsoft press release, April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The company was gradually folded into Microsoft's [[Microsoft engineering groups|Business Division]] while a final major version, ProClarity 6.3, was released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934052/en-us ProClarity Analytics Server 6.3 is now available]", Microsoft support article, March 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Additional business intelligence components, such as [[Sharepoint 2010|PerformancePoint Services for SharePoint 2010]], and business intelligence improvements in existing products, as in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel 2013]], were released by the division in subsequent years.

[[#Office suite|Office suite]]s, which brought [[word processor|word processing]], [[spreadsheet]], and [[relational database]] programs to the [[desktop computer|desktop]] in the 1980s, are the core example of productivity software. They revolutionized the office with the magnitude of the productivity increase they brought as compared with the pre-1980s office environments of typewriters, paper filing, and handwritten lists and ledgers. Some 78% of "middle-skill" occupations (those that call for more than a [[high school]] diploma but less than a [[bachelor's degree]]) now require the use of productivity software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/digital-skills-gap/ Crunched by the Numbers: The Digital Skills Gap in the Workforce], Burning Glass Technologies, March 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, productivity software has become even more [[consumerization|consumerized]] than it already was, as computing becomes ever more integrated into daily personal life.

==Details==
Productivity software traditionally runs directly on a computer. For example, [[Commodore Plus/4]] model of computer contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] for applications of productivity software. Productivity software is one of the reasons people use [[personal computer]]s.

Productivity software can fall into the following categories:

'''Time Management Software''': With time management software, one is able to track time on a desktop without any user intervention. This allows the person to analyse how much time is spent on each task and what one can do to re-prioritise his tasks and spend time on the most important tasks. 

'''Project Management Software''': With project management software, one is able to delegate, track major projects and have a quick overview of the progress made by each team member.

==Office suite==
[[File:LibreOffice Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw.png|thumb|[[LibreOffice]], an example of office suite, showing Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw]]
An '''office suite''' is a collection of bundled productivity software (a [[software suite]]) intended to be used by [[knowledge worker]]s. The components are generally distributed together, have a consistent [[user interface]] and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways that the [[operating system]] would not normally allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=office suite|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/48311/office-suite|website=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest office suite for personal computers was [[Starburst (office suite)|Starburst]] in the early 1980s, comprising the word processor [[WordStar]], together with companion apps CalcStar (spreadsheet) and DataStar (database).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/whatever-happened-to-wordstar-2/ |title=Whatever Happened to Wordstar? |author=John C. Dvorak |authorlink=John C. Dvorak |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other suites arose in the 1980s, and over the course of the 1990s [[Microsoft Office]] came to dominate the market,&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief History of Computing,'' by Gerard O'Regan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7kWyJXB7z0C&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; a position it retains {{as of|2018|lc=yes}}.

=== Typical office suite components ===
{{See also|Comparison of office suites#Main components}}

'''Social media mining''' is the process of obtaining [[big data]] from user-generated content on social media sites and [[mobile apps]] in order to extract patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information, often for the purpose of advertising to users or conducting research. The term is an analogy to the resource extraction process of [[mining]] for rare minerals. Resource extraction mining requires mining companies to sift through vast quantities of raw ore to find the precious minerals; likewise, social media mining requires human data analysts and automated software programs to sift through massive amounts of raw social media data in order to discern patterns and trends relating to social media usage, online behaviours, sharing of content, connections between individuals, online buying behaviour, and more. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as these organizations can use these patterns and trends to design their strategies or introduce new programs, new products, processes or services.

Social media mining uses a range of basic concepts from [[computer science]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]]. Social media miners develop [[algorithm]]s suitable for investigating massive files of social media data. Social media mining is based on theories and methodologies from  [[social network analysis]], [[network science]], [[sociology]], [[ethnography]], optimization and mathematics. It encompasses the tools to formally represent, measure and model meaningful patterns from large-scale social media data.&lt;ref name="Zafarani"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zafarani |first1=Reza |last2=Abbasi |first2=Mohammad Ali |last3=Liu |first3=Huan |title=Social Media Mining: An Introduction |year=2014 |url=http://dmml.asu.edu/smm |accessdate = 15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations engaged in social media mining to obtain data about customers, clients and citizens.

==Background==

As defined by Kaplan and Haenlein,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media |year=2010 |journal = Business Horizons | volume = 53 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; social media is the "group of internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." There are many categories of social media including, but not limited to, social networking (Facebook or LinkedIn), microblogging (Twitter), photo sharing (Flickr, Photobucket, or Picasa), news aggregation (Google reader, StumbleUpon, or Feedburner), video sharing (YouTube, MetaCafe), livecasting (Ustream or Twitch.tv), virtual worlds (Kaneva), social gaming (World of Warcraft), social search (Google, Bing, or Ask.com), and instant messaging (Google Talk, Skype, or Yahoo! messenger).

The first social media website was introduced by [[GeoCities]] in 1994. It enabled users to create their own homepages without having a sophisticated knowledge of [[HTML]] coding. The first social networking site, [[SixDegrees.com]], was introduced in 1997. Since then, many other social media sites have been introduced, each providing service to millions of people. These individuals form a virtual world in which individuals (social atoms), entities (content, sites, etc.) and interactions (between individuals, between entities, between individuals and entities) coexist. Social norms and human behavior govern this virtual world. By understanding these social norms and models of human behavior and combining them with the observations and measurements of this virtual world, one can systematically analyze and mine social media. Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining faces grand challenges such as the big data paradox, obtaining sufficient samples, the noise removal fallacy, and evaluation dilemma.
Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and homophily, provide effective recommendations, and analyze novel social behavior in social media.

== Uses ==

Social media mining is used across several industries including business development, social science research, health services, and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"&gt;Zafarani, R., Ali Abbasi, M., Liu, H., (2014). Social Media Mining. Cambridge University Press. http://dmml.asu.edu/smm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, A., (2017). "Mining of Social Media data of University students." ''Education and Information Technologies'', 22: 1515-1526.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the data received goes through [[social media analytics]], it can then be applied to these various fields. Often, companies use the patterns of connectivity that pervade social networks, such as assortativity—the social similarity between users that are induced by influence, homophily, and reciprocity and transitivity.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"&gt;Tang, J., Chang, Y., Aggarwal, C., Liu, H., (2016). "A Survey of Signed Network Mining in Social Media". ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 49: 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces are then measured via statistical analysis of the nodes and connections between these nodes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Social analytics also uses [[sentiment analysis]], because social media users often relay positive or negative sentiment in their posts.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"&gt;Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M., &amp; Stahl, F., (2013). "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis."&lt;/ref&gt; This provides important social information about users' emotions on specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;Laeeq, F., Nafis, T., &amp; Beg, M. (2017). "Sentimental Classification of Social Media using Dating Mining." ''International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science'', 8: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three patterns have several uses beyond pure analysis. For example, influence can be used to determine the most influential user in a particular network.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Companies would be interested in this information in order to decide who they may hire for [[influencer marketing]]. These influencers are determined by recognition, activity generation, and novelty—three requirements that can be measured through the data mined from these sites.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Analysts also value measures of homophily: the tendency of two similar individuals to become friends.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"/&gt; Users have begun to rely on information of other users' opinions in order to understand diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"/&gt; These analyses can also help create recommendations for individuals in a tailored capacity.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; By measuring influence and homophily, online and offline companies are able to suggest specific products for individuals consumers, and groups of consumers. Social media networks can use this information themselves to suggest to their users possible friends to add, pages to follow, and accounts to interact with.

'''Thomas Coleman du Pont''' (December 11, 1863 – November 11, 1930) was an American engineer and politician, from [[Greenville, Delaware]]. He was President of [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], and a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] who served parts of two terms as [[United States Senator]] from Delaware.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life and family==
Du Pont was born at [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky. He was a cousin of U.S. Senator [[Henry A. du Pont]] and great grandson of [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]], the founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Du Pont attended preparatory school at [[Urbana University]] and earned an engineering degree at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. While at MIT, he was initiated into the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.

He married a cousin, Alice Elsie du Pont (granddaughter of [[Charles I. du Pont]]), and in 1891 they had a daughter, Alice Hounsfield du Pont. In 1921, Alice married [[C. Douglass Buck|Clayton Douglass Buck]], future U.S. Senator and two-term governor of Delaware. She inherited her father's family home, [[Buena Vista (St. Georges, Delaware)|Buena Vista]], and in 1965 the Bucks sold it to the State of Delaware for $1. The state now operates it as the Buena Vista Conference Center. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buenavista.delaware.gov/downloads/BuenaVista_history_2011.pdf |title=Buena Vista History |publisher=State of Delaware |accessdate=January 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001407/http://buenavista.delaware.gov/downloads/BuenaVista_history_2011.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Du Pont started his career in the family's coal mines, the [[Central Coal and Iron Company]], and soon pursued opportunities in street railways. In 1894, he began working as the general manager of the Johnson Street Rail Company in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]].

With his cousins, [[Alfred I. du Pont]] and [[Pierre S. du Pont]], T. Coleman du Pont bought out the family's explosives business in Delaware. He was president from 1902 until 1915, during which time he oversaw the acquisitions of more than one hundred competitors. He was a key player in the formation of the holding company, [[E. I du Pont de Nemours Company]] of New Jersey. In 1907, the DuPont Company was sued for antitrust violations; he later sold off his stake of the business in 1914.

Du Pont had control of the [[Hotel McAlpin]], [[Claridge Atlantic City]], Wallick's, and other American hotels. Together with Lucius M. Boomer, president of Boomer-du Pont Properties Corporation and husband of [[Jørgine Boomer]], du Pont owned a number of other hotels.  In 1918, they purchased the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in [[New York City]], then in 1920 the [[Willard Hotel]] in [[Washington, D. C.]] and in 1925 the company purchased The [[Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]] in [[Philadelphia]] from the heirs of the founder, [[George C. Boldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EED91130E433A25750C0A9649C946996D6CF|page =1|title=COLEMAN DU PONT PURCHASES THE WALDORF-ASTORIA|date=February 3, 1918|newspaper= The New York Times|accessdate= November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806EEDF1038EE32A25750C0A9669D946896D6CF|date=October 3, 1919|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=November 28, 2012|title=DU PONT INTERESTS BUY THE MARTINIQUE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06E5D71E31E03ABC4D53DFB366838B639EDE|newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate=November 28, 2012|title=DU PONT GETS THE WILLARD|date= May 5, 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, du Pont acquired control of [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society]] from [[J. P. Morgan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E4DF1631E733A05750C1A9609C946496D6CF|date= June 1, 1915|page =1|newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate=November 28, 2012|title=T.C.

==DuPont Highway==

In 1908, du Pont proposed a modern road that was to run the length of Delaware from [[Selbyville, Delaware|Selbyville]] north to [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] as part of a philanthropic measure. This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]] counties. The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of [[Europe]] and was to have a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} wide right-of-way consisting of a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual [[Tram|trolley]] lines, {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadways for heavy vehicles, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} wide unpaved roadways for horses, and sidewalks. Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways. The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying. Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway.

After portions of the DuPont Highway were built, these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge.&lt;ref name=Milner-6-8&gt;[[#Milner|Milner]], pp. 6, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coleman DuPont Road, Inc. was established in 1911 and construction of the DuPont Highway began.&lt;ref name="1958 report"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Delaware State Highway Department Annual Report|edition=1958|pages=4–13|publisher=Delaware State Highway Department|location=Dover, Delaware|date=1958|url=http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/annual_reports/pdf/1958/1958_history.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DuPont Highway would end up being built as a two-lane concrete road on a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} alignment with a {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}} wide roadway.&lt;ref name=Milner-14&gt;[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delaware State Highway Department]] took over construction and the DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near [[Odessa, Delaware|Odessa]] was finished.&lt;ref name=Milner-16&gt;[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast.  In conjunction with the rise of the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the [[Northeast megalopolis]].  Southern Delaware also developed into a major [[truck farming]] region due to having much greater access to urban markets.  No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and [[broiler chicken]]s directly to consumers in the north.&lt;ref name=Milner-28&gt;[[#Milner|Milner]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DuPont Highway became [[U.S. Route 113|US 113]] between [[Selbyville, Delaware|Selbyville]] and [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] and [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|US 13]] between Dover and Wilmington.&lt;ref name="1925 report"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual Report of the State Highway Department|edition=1925|page=17|publisher=Delaware State Highway Department|location=Dover, Delaware|date=December 31, 1925|url=http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/annual_reports/pdf/1925/annual_1925.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DE 1931 map"&gt;{{Delaware road map|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:TColemanDuPont.jpg|thumb|right|Coleman du Pont in his Senate office]]
Du Pont retired from business activities in 1915 and became involved in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politics, as a member of the [[Republican National Committee]] from 1908 until 1930. It was largely under his leadership that the Union Republicans and Regular Republicans came back together and built the modern Delaware Republican Party.

Du Pont was appointed to the U.S. Senate on July 7, 1921, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Senator [[Josiah O. Wolcott]]. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 67th Congress. However, he lost his bid to complete the term in a special election on November 7, 1922. On the same day he also lost his bid for the full term to follow, in both instances losing to Democrat [[Thomas F. Bayard, Jr.]], a Wilmington lawyer who was married to one of du Pont's cousins.

Du Pont was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1924, defeating the incumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[L. Heisler Ball]] for the nomination, and going on to defeat Democrat [[James M. Tunnell]], a [[Georgetown, Delaware]] lawyer. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the [[69th United States Congress|69th]] and  [[70th United States Congress|70th]] Congress, until health problems caused him to resign.

In all, du Pont served two separate terms, one from July 7, 1921 until November 21, 1922, during the administration of U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]], and the other from March 4, 1925 until December 9, 1928, during the administration of U.S. President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. The later years of his life were marked by his implication in the [[Teapot Dome]] scandal, and by lawsuits over various Florida real estate deals.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Death==
Du Pont suffered from cancer of the larynx and died at Buena Vista. He was buried in the [[Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery]] in [[Greenville, Delaware]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=T.

==Almanac==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. U.S. Senators are popularly elected and took office March 4 for a six-year term.

'''Thomas Alva Edison''' (February 11, 1847{{spaced ndash}}October 18, 1931) was an American [[inventor]] and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Adrian Wooldridge|authorlink1=Adrian Wooldridge|title=The alphabet of success|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707053-superstars-need-dazzling-range-qualities-alphabet-success|accessdate=September 16, 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sproule1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sproule|first1=Anna|title=Thomas Alva Edison : The World's Greatest Inventor|date=2000|publisher=Blackbirch Press|location=Woodbridge, CT|isbn=9781567113310|edition= 1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoNJ1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hangout - Thomas Edison|url=http://www.state.nj.us/hangout_nj/200408_edison_p1.html|website=www.state.nj.us|publisher=State of New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with developing many devices in fields such as [[electric power generation]], [[mass communication]], [[sound recording]], and [[motion pictures]].&lt;ref name="coned1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=Con Edison: A Brief History of Con Edison – electricity |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These inventions, which include the [[phonograph]], the [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]], and the long-lasting, practical electric [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]], had a widespread impact on the modern [[industrial society|industrialized world]].&lt;ref name="Wizard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/edison.html |title=The Wizard of Menlo Park |work=The Franklin Institute |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305131049/http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/edison.html |archivedate=March 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of [[mass production]] and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; He is often credited with establishing the first industrial [[research laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first= Bryan|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1910417_1910419_1910460,00.html |title=The Electrifying Edison |publisher=Time.com |date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison was raised in the American [[midwest]] and early in his career he worked as a [[telegraph operator]], which inspired some of his earliest inventions.&lt;ref name="coned1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=Con Edison: A Brief History of Con Edison – electricity |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey]], where many of his early inventions would be developed. He would later establish a [[botany|botanic]] laboratory in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] in collaboration with businessmen [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]], and a laboratory in [[West Orange, New Jersey]] that featured the world's first [[film studio]], the [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]]. He was a [[List of prolific inventors|prolific inventor]], holding 1,093 [[List of Edison patents|US patents in his name]], as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 of complications of [[diabetes]].

==Early life==
[[File:Young Thomas Edison.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Edison as a boy]]
Thomas Edison was born, in 1847, in [[Milan, Ohio]], and grew up in [[Port Huron, Michigan]]. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia]]) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born in [[Chenango County, New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=443&amp;ResourceType |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808185308/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=443&amp;ResourceType |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 8, 2011 |title=National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL) |publisher=Tps.cr.nps.gov |date=January 12, 1965 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://invention.si.edu/thomas-edisons-inventive-life Thomas Edison's Inventive Life; by Joyce Bedi] Retrieved March 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; His father, the son of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from Nova Scotia, settling in [[southwestern Ontario]] (then called [[Upper Canada]]), in a village known as Shewsbury, later [[Vienna, Ontario|Vienna]], by 1811. Samuel Jr. eventually fled Ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful [[Rebellions of 1837|Mackenzie Rebellion]] of 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/edis/historyculture/samuel-and-nancy-elliott-edison.htm |title=Samuel and Nancy Elliott Edison |work=National Park Service |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Samuel Sr., had earlier fought in the [[War of 1812]] as captain of the First Middlesex Regiment. By contrast, Samuel Jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the United States at [[Sarnia]]-Port Huron. Once across the border, he found his way to [[Milan, Ohio]]. His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been "Edeson."&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Neal | title = Edison: Inventing the Century | publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] | year = 1995 | pages = 3–5 | isbn = 978-0-7868-6041-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison only attended school for a few months and was instead taught by his mother.&lt;ref name="npsedisonbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison Biography|url=https://www.nps.gov/edis/learn/historyculture/edison-biography.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's ''[[School of Natural Philosophy]]'' and [[The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For Sesquicentennial, Cooper Union Puts Artifacts on View | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/for-sesquicentennial-cooper-union-puts-artifacts-on-view/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Bao | last=Ong | date=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of [[scarlet fever]] during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in [[Smiths Creek, Michigan]], along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.&lt;ref name="Josephson"&gt;"Edison" by [[Matthew Josephson]].

==Early career==
Edison's family moved to [[Port Huron, Michigan]], after the canal owners successfully kept the railroad out of  Milan Ohio in 1854 and business declined.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, [[Station master|station agent]] J. U. MacKenzie of [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]], was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the [[Grand Trunk Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitstratford.ca/uploads/railwayindustry.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123422/http://www.visitstratford.ca/uploads/railwayindustry.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-03-07 |title=Stratford's Railway Industry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010 |website=Visit Stratford |publisher=Stratford Tourism |access-date=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite CAB|Edison, Thomas Alva"&gt;{{Cite CAB|wstitle=Edison, Thomas Alva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the ''Grand Trunk Herald'', which he sold with his other papers.&lt;ref name="Cite CAB|Edison, Thomas Alva"/&gt; This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including [[General Electric]], still one of the largest [[public company|publicly traded companies]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2266720/ |title=GE emerges world's largest company: Forbes |publisher=Trading Markets.com |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTYYG9X?url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2266720/ |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ge-emerges-worlds-largest-company-forbes/445093 |title=GE emerges world's largest company: Forbes |publisher=Indian Express.com |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTYurUQ?url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ge-emerges-worlds-largest-company-forbes/445093 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where, as an employee of [[Western Union]], he worked the [[Associated Press]] bureau [[news agency|news wire]]. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a [[lead–acid battery]] when he spilled [[sulfuric acid]] onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, pages 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named [[Franklin Leonard Pope]], who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, {{US patent|90646}}, which was granted on June 1, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edison.rutgers.edu/vote.htm The Edison Papers], Rutgers University.

==Menlo Park laboratory (1876-1886)==
===Research and development facility===
[[File:Menlo Park Laboratory.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Edison's Menlo Park Laboratory, reconstructed at Greenfield Village at [[Henry Ford Museum]] in Dearborn, Michigan.]]
Edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], a part of Raritan Township (now named [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township]] in his honor) in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], with the funds from the sale of Edison's [[quadruplex telegraph]]. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 (${{Inflation|US|10,000|1874|fmt=c|r=-2}} in today's dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US}}), which he gratefully accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bounceenergy.com/blog/2013/02/happy-birthday-thomas-edison/ |title=Happy Birthday, Thomas Edison! |last=Trollinger |first=Vernon |work=Bounce Energy |date=February 11, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.

[[William Joseph Hammer]], a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|iron ore separator]], [[incandescent light bulb|electric lighting]], and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see [[Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps]]). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager [[Francis Robbins Upton]] turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |last=Biographiq |year=2008 |isbn=9781599862163 |page=9 |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|sprague}}[[Frank J. Sprague]], a competent mathematician and former [[United States Navy|naval officer]], was recruited by [[Edward H. Johnson]] and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of [[Ohm's Law]], [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/ |title=The Thomas A.

Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were [[design patent]]s, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over [[prior art]]. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Harold, "They Made America." Little, Brown and Company, New York, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-316-27766-2}}. p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have "a stock of almost every conceivable material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=737 |title=Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) |last=Wilson |first=Wendell E. |work=The Mineralogical Record |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415080355/http://www.minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=737 |archivedate=April 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained "eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels&amp;nbsp;... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell&amp;nbsp;... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores&amp;nbsp;..." and the list goes on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shulman | first = Seth | title = Owning the Future | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 1999 | pages = 158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his desk, Edison displayed a placard with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]]' famous quotation: "There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,752631,00.html |title=AERONAUTICS: Real Labor |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] |date=December 8, 1930 |accessdate= January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.

With Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/gilded-age/essays/edison%E2%80%99s-laboratory |title=Edison's Laboratory |last=Israel |first=Paul |work=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.&lt;ref name=time1979/&gt;

===Phonograph===
[[File:Edison and phonograph edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|Photograph of Edison with his phonograph (2nd model), taken in [[Mathew Brady]]'s Washington, D.C. studio in April 1878.]]
{{listen|pos=left|filename=Thomas Edison Mary had lamb.ogg|title=Mary Had a Little Lamb|description=Thomas Edison reciting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" in 1929.}}
Edison began his career as an inventor in [[Newark, New Jersey]], with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the [[phonograph]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edbio.html |title=The Life of Thomas A. Edison |work=The Library of Congress |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Wizard" /&gt;

His first phonograph recorded on [[Tin#Applications|tinfoil]] around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited [[sound quality]] and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. [[Joseph Henry]], president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as "the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other".&lt;ref&gt;Edison, Thomas A. 1989. ''Menlo Park: The early years, April 1876 – December 1877''. Edited by P. B. Israel, K. A. Nier and L. Carlat. Vol. 3, The papers of Thomas A Edison. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Doc. 1117&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Neil. 2001. ''Edison: Inventing the century''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp.97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described Edison as a "[[genius]]" and his presentation as "a scene... that will live in history".&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post. 1878. ''Genius before science''. Washington Post, April 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;Edison, Thomas A. 1877. ''Telephones or speaking-telegraphs''. US patent 203,018 filed December 13, 1877, and issued April 30, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; he did little to develop it until [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Chichester Bell]], and [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Charles Tainter]] produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.

===Carbon telephone transmitter===
In 1876, Edison began work to improve the [[microphone]] for telephones (at that time called a "transmitter") by developing a [[carbon microphone]], which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.

Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by [[Johann Philipp Reis]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell]], worked by generating a weak current. The [[carbon microphone]] works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.&lt;ref name="Adrian Hope 1102, page 378"&gt;Adrian Hope, 100 Years of Microphone, New Scientist May 11, 1978 Vol. 78, No. 1102, page 378 ISSN 0262-4079&lt;/ref&gt; His work was concurrent with [[Emile Berliner]]'s loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;''IEEE Global History Network: Carbon Transmitter''. New Brunswick, NJ: IEEE History Center {{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Carbon_Transmitter |title=Carbon Transmitter |accessdate=January 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318043500/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Carbon_Transmitter |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[David Edward Hughes]] study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).&lt;ref name="Adrian Hope 1102, page 378"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''David Edward Hughes: Concertinist and Inventor'' {{Cite web|url=http://www.angloconcertina.org/files/HughesforWebsite.pdf |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913132543/http://www.angloconcertina.org/files/HughesforWebsite.pdf |title=David Edward Hughes: Concertinist and Inventor |archivedate=September 13, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for [[Western Union]].&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt; In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was [[roasted]]. This type was put in use in 1890&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt; and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.

===Electric light===
{{Main|Incandescent light bulb}}
[[File:Edison bulb.jpg|thumb|Thomas Edison's first successful light bulb model, used in public demonstration at Menlo Park, December 1879]]

In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley &amp; Sons – 2004, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including [[Alessandro Volta]]'s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by [[Henry Woodward (inventor)|Henry Woodward]] and [[Mathew Evans]]. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included [[Humphry Davy]], [[James Bowman Lindsay]], [[Moses G. Farmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliotmaine.org/mosespage.htm |title=Moses G.

Sawyer]], [[Joseph Swan]], and [[Heinrich Göbel]].

Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways",&lt;ref name="Patent898" /&gt; it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a [[carbonization|carbonized]] [[bamboo]] filament that could last over 1,200&amp;nbsp;hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of [[Wyoming]], where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the [[Continental Divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1878, Edison formed the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] in New York City with several financiers, including [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Spencer Trask]],&lt;ref&gt;"Handbook of Research on Venture Capital". Colin Mason. Edward Elgar Publishing. January 1, 2012. pg 17&lt;/ref&gt; and the members of the [[Vanderbilt family]]. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: "We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sloan-c.org/conference/proceedings/1996/doc/96_gomory.doc |title=Keynote Address – Second International ALN1 Conference (PDF) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTbqS3d?url=http://www.sloan-c.org/conference/proceedings/1996/doc/96_gomory.doc |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SS Columbia Undated Photograph.png|thumb|left|The [[Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company]]'s new steamship, the [[SS Columbia (1880)|''Columbia'']], was the first commercial application for Edison's incandescent light bulb in 1880.]]
[[Henry Villard]], president of the [[Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company]], attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the [[SS Columbia (1880)|''Columbia'']]. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the ''Columbia'' went to [[New York City]], where Edison and his personnel installed ''Columbia'''s new lighting system. The ''Columbia'' was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from ''Columbia'' in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Jehl, Francis [https://books.google.com/books?id=OkL1Smk4uiAC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;dq=SS+Columbia+(1880) Menlo Park reminiscences : written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory], Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, July 1, 2002, page 564&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dalton"&gt;Dalton, Anthony

[[Lewis Latimer]] joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884. Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the "Process of Manufacturing Carbons", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs. Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/edis/forkids/the-gifted-men-who-worked-for-edison.htm |title=Lewis Howard Latimer |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Westinghouse]]'s company bought [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl's]] competing [[Electrodeless lamp|induction lamp]] patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"&gt;"Diehl's Lamp Hit Edison Monopoly," Elizabeth Daily Journal, Friday Evening, October 25, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 1883, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|US patent office]] ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of [[William E. Sawyer]] and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for "a filament of carbon of high resistance" was valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |last=Biographiq |year=2008 |isbn=9781599862163 |page=15 |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called [[Ediswan]] to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.

[[Mahen Theatre]] in [[Brno]] (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps.

===Electric power distribution===
After devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric "[[Public utility|utility]]" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Faruqui, Kelly Eakin, Pricing in Competitive Electricity Markets, Springer Science &amp; Business Media – 2000, page 67&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 1880, he founded the [[Edison Illuminating Company]], and during the 1880s, he patented a system for [[electricity distribution]]. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on [[Pearl Street Station]], New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]] generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts [[direct current]] (DC) to 59 customers in lower [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=A brief history of Con Edison:"Electricity" |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing [[overhead lines|overhead wires]] began service in [[Roselle, New Jersey]].

===War of currents===
{{Main|War of Currents}}
[[File:PyramidParthenon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 [[Tennessee Centennial Exposition]].]]
As Edison expanded his [[direct current]] (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing [[alternating current]] (AC) systems. From the early 1880s AC [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of [[transformer]]s in Europe and by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and "step down" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, pages 54–60&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.

Edison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As [[George Westinghouse]] installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, "''Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maury Klein, The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America, Bloomsbury Publishing USA – 2008, page 257&lt;/ref&gt; Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.&lt;ref&gt;Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The By Jill Jonnes page 146&lt;/ref&gt; Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq0Le9FfXlAC&amp;pg=PT68&amp;dq=Thomson+Houston+westinghouse+edison+1887&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xhPhVKfmB-aHsQTkyoEY&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomson%20Houston%20westinghouse%20edison%201887&amp;f=false|title=Edison to Enron|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.  This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA – 2009, pages 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader [[Harold P. Brown]] in a [[propaganda]] campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [[War of Currents|"battle of currents"]]. The development of the [[electric chair]] was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and [[Smear campaign|smear]] Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.

Thomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier [[J.P. Morgan]] engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called [[General Electric]]. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA – 2009, page 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Bradley Jr., Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies, John Wiley &amp; Sons – 2011, pages 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Orange and Fort Myers (1886–1931)==
[[File:Edison battery exhibit, 1915.jpg|thumb|Thomas A. Edison Industries Exhibit, Primary Battery section, 1915]]
Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as "[[Thomas Edison National Historical Park|Glenmont]]" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in [[Llewellyn Park]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought property in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], Florida, and built what was later called [[Seminole Lodge (Thomas Edison)|Seminole Lodge]] as a winter retreat. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.&lt;ref name="Reisert"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Reisert|first1=Sarah|title= Home Away from Home |magazine=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=46–47|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/home-away-from-home|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the security concerns around [[World War I]], Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the [[Naval Consulting Board]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=board&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/about-nrl/history/edison/ |title=Thomas Edison's Vision |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2013 |quote=Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels seized the opportunity created by Edison's public comments to enlist Edison's support. He agreed to serve as the head of a new body of civilian experts – the Naval Consulting Board – to advise the Navy on science and technology.|publisher=[[United States Navy]] |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber.  Edison's work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org/about/what-youll-see/edison-s-botanic-research-laboratory/|title=Edison Botanic Research Laboratory – Edison &amp; Ford Winter Estates – (239) 334-7419|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203203552/http://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org/about/what-youll-see/edison-s-botanic-research-laboratory/#|archive-date=February 3, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EFWE 2008.04.01 .jpg|thumb|From left to right: Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone, the three partners of the Edison Botanic Research Corporation.]]

The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part [[Acid-base extraction]], to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://communities.acs.org/community/science/sustainability/green-chemistry-nexus-blog/blog/2014/05/21/thomas-edison-s-botanical-laboratory-to-be-recognized-as-a-national-historic-chemical-landmark-in-fort-myers|title=Green Chemistry: The Nexus Blog: Thomas Edison'... {{!}} ACS Network|website=communities.acs.org|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on ''[[Solidago leavenworthii]]'', also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.&lt;ref&gt;Growing American Rubber by Mark Finlay&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other inventions and projects==

===Fluoroscopy===
Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscope]], a machine that uses [[X-rays]] to take [[radiographs]]. Until Edison discovered that [[Scheelite|calcium tungstate]] fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium [[platinocyanide]] screens originally used by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.

The fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, [[Clarence Madison Dally|Clarence Dally]]. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: "Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them."&lt;ref&gt;Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library: Edison fears the hidden perils of the x-rays. New York Worldb/, August 3, 1903, Durham, NC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tasimeter===

Edison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the [[tasimeter]], which measured [[infrared|infrared radiation]].  His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar [[corona]] during the total [[Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878]].

===Telegraph improvements===
{{original research|section|date=December 2016}}

The key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the [[ticker tape|stock ticker]], the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.

===Motion pictures===

Edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or "Kinetograph". He did the electromechanical design while his employee [[W.&amp;nbsp;K.&amp;nbsp;L. Dickson]], a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; In 1891, Thomas Edison built a [[Kinetoscope]] or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Edison Motion Pictures |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist.html |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTfhBN2?url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist.html |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1896, [[Thomas Armat]]'s [[Vitascope]], manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.

Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman [[Irving T. Bush]] (1869–1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in [[Austria-Hungary]], the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/stollwerck.htm |title=Martin Loiperdinger.

The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the [[Fairs]] in early 1895. The Edison's Kinétoscope Français, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.&lt;ref name="Imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0111244/ |title=Guido Convents, ''Van Kinetoscoop tot Cafe-Cine de Eerste Jaren van de Film in Belgie, 1894–1908, pp. 33–69.''

On May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with [[Leon Gaumont]] and the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph]] Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.&lt;ref name="Imdb.com"/&gt;

[[Edison Studios|Edison's film studio]] made close to 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]'' (1894), ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896), ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910 film)|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1910), and the first ''[[Frankenstein (1910 film)|Frankenstein]]'' film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park, Coney Island]] announced they would execute [[Topsy (elephant)|Topsy the elephant]] by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title ''[[Electrocuting an Elephant]]''.

As the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lubin.htm Siegmund Lubin (1851–1923)], Who's Who of Victorian Cinema. Retrieved August 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of [[photographic paper]] with the [[U.S. copyright office]]. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist1.html#EE "History of Edison Motion Pictures: Early Edison Motion Picture Production (1892–1895)"], Memory.loc.gov, [[Library of Congress]]. Retrieved August 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Edison started the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the [[Acoustical Society of America]], which was founded in 1929.

Edison said his favorite movie was ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. He thought that [[talkies]] had "spoiled everything" for him. "There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf."&lt;ref name="condensed1042"&gt;Reader's Digest, March 1930, pp. 1042–1044, "Living With a Genius", condensed from The American Magazine February 1930&lt;/ref&gt; His favorite stars were [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Clara Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edison Wears Silk Nightshirt, Hates Talkies, Writes Wife", Capital Times, October 30, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
Starting in the late 1870s, Thomas Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|Edison Ore Milling Company]], Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm#Cement|title=Edison's Companies – The Edison Papers|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the [[Falconbridge, Greater Sudbury, Ontario|Falconbridge]] ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&amp;lang=en&amp;currID=2031&amp;parID=2029 |title=Thomas Edison |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |work=[[Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTghSyU?url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&amp;lang=en&amp;currID=2031&amp;parID=2029 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A street in Falconbridge, as well as the [[Edison Building (Falconbridge)|Edison Building]], which served as the head office of [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Mines]], are named for him.

===Battery===
[[File:Edison Storage Battery Company 1903.JPG|thumb|Share of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued 19. October 1903]]
The Edison Storage Battery Company was founded in 1901. With this company, Edison exploited his invention of the accumulator. In 1904, 450 people already worked for the company. The first accumulators were produced for electric cars, but there were several defects. Several customers complained about the products. When the capital of the company was spent, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte.

===Chemicals===

At the start of [[World War I]], the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August, 1914, resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was [[phenol]], which was used to make [[phonograph]] records–presumably as [[phenolic resins]] of the [[Bakelite]] type.

At the time, phenol came from [[coal]] as a by-product of [[coke oven]] gases or [[manufactured gas]] for [[gaslighting]].  Phenol could be nitrated to [[picric acid]] and converted to [[ammonium picrate]], a shock resistant [[high explosive]] suitable for use in artillery shells.  The best telling of the phenol story is found in “The Aspirin Wars.”&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles C. And Plummer, Mark L (1991)., The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition, Alfred A. Knopf, NY, isbn 0-394-57894-5, p 38-40&lt;/ref&gt; Most phenol had been imported from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], but with war, [[Parliament]] blocked exports and diverted most to production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.

Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his [[Silver Lake, NJ]], facility using processes developed by his chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Conot, Robert (1979), A Streak of Luck: The Life &amp; Legend of Thomas Alva Edison, Seaview Books, NY, p 413-4&lt;/ref&gt; He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, PA]] and [[Bessemer, AL]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the [[German dye trust]].  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and [[pyrax]].  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.

Phenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. [[Bakelite]], the original [[thermoset]] [[plastic]], had been invented in 1909. [[Aspirin]], too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899 had become a block buster drug. [[Bayer]] had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in [[Rensselaer, NY]], but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.

Bayer relied on [[Chemische Fabrik von Heyden]], in [[Piscataway, NJ]], to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.  (See [[Great Phenol]] plot.)  It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.  He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to [[salicylic acid]] by Heyden, some of which was exported.

==Final years and death==
===Final years===
[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Ford]], Thomas Edison, and [[Harvey Firestone]], respectively. [[Ft. Myers]], Florida, February 11, 1929]]

[[Henry Ford]], the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.

In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers [[Civitan International|Civitan Club]]. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that "The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Armbrester |first= Margaret E. |title= The Civitan Story |year= 1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location= Birmingham, AL |page= 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.

Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna Railroad]] inaugurated suburban electric train service from [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], and [[Gladstone, New Jersey]]. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to [[South Orange, NJ|South Orange]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2001"&gt;{{Holland-Classic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by [[New Jersey Transit]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2001"/&gt;

Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular [[Food faddism|fad diet]] in his last few years; "the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours".&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Israel|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Israel (historian)|title=Edison: A Life of Invention|year=2000|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-0-471-36270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, "correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies." She also said that during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.&lt;ref name="condensed1042"/&gt;

Edison became the owner of his [[Milan, Ohio]], birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Death===
Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, "Glenmont" in [[Llewellyn Park]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina.

Edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at [[The Henry Ford]] museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced [[Charles Edison]] to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_128a.html "Is Thomas Edison's last breath preserved in a test tube in the Henry Ford Museum?"], [[The Straight Dope]], September 11, 1987.

==Marriages and children==
On December 25, 1871, at the age of twenty-four, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:
* Marion Estelle Edison (1873–1965), nicknamed "Dot"&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 1995, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed "Dash"&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 1995, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;
* William Leslie Edison (1878–1937) Inventor, graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title=Older Son To Sue To Void Edison Will; William, Second Child Of The Counsel |url= |quote=The will of Thomas A.

[[File:Mina Edison 1906.jpg|thumb|Mina Miller Edison in 1906]]
On February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty-nine, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865–1947) in [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Thomas_Edison%27s_Children |title=Thomas Edison's Children |date=December 16, 2010 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of the inventor [[Lewis Miller (philanthropist)|Lewis Miller]], co-founder of the [[Chautauqua Institution]], and a benefactor of [[Methodist]] charities.

Wanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison's son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr.. became a problem for his father and his father's business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in [[snake oil]] products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as "''The Latest Edison Discovery''". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35.00 ({{Inflation|US|35.00|1885|fmt=eq|r=0}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LOST IN HISTORY: Thomas A.

==Views==
===On politics, religion, and metaphysics===
Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a "[[Freethought|freethinker]]".&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; Edison was heavily influenced by [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]''.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; Edison defended Paine's "scientific [[deism]]", saying, "He has been called an [[atheism|atheist]], but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity."&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; In 1878, Edison joined the [[Theosophical Society]] in New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tsmembers.org/|title=Theosophical Society Members 1875-1942 – Historical membership list of the Theosophical Society (Adyar) 1875-1942|website=tsmembers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but according to its founder, [[Helena Blavatsky|H. P. Blavatsky]], he was not a very active member&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collected Writings, Vol. XII|last=Blavatsky|first=Helena Petrovna|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|year=1980|isbn=|location=Wheaton, IL|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In an October 2, 1910, interview in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', Edison stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me&amp;nbsp;— the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love&amp;nbsp;— He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us&amp;nbsp;— nature did it all&amp;nbsp;— not the gods of the religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title="No Immortality of the Soul" says Thomas A. Edison.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also stated, "I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=75ldAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22I+do+not+believe+in+the+God+of+the+theologians;+but+that+there+is+a+Supreme+Intelligence+I+do+not+doubt%22&amp;dq=%22I+do+not+believe+in+the+God+of+the+theologians;+but+that+there+is+a+Supreme+Intelligence+I+do+not+doubt%22&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QDQyUrD0NuPs2wWTwoGADQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBg The Freethinker]'' (1970), G.W. Foote &amp; Company, Volume 90, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nonviolence]] was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, "I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill." Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: "Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=DtjWFiDKsJ0C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Still+savages%22+edison&amp;ei=KiHMSLJSiNzKBIiglYsJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2IXFOuvGUriygDwhEkgvqyaefwEg Innovate Like Edison: The Success System of America's Greatest Inventor] by Sarah Miller Caldicott, Michael J.

In 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told [[B. C. Forbes]] of ''[[American Magazine]]'' that he was working on a "spirit phone" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gereports.com/edisons-forgotten-invention-a-phone-that-calls-the-dead/|title=Edison's Forgotten 'Invention': A Phone That Calls the Dead|date=October 28, 2010|publisher=GE Reports|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111162640/http://www.gereports.com/edisons-forgotten-invention-a-phone-that-calls-the-dead/|archivedate=November 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the ''New York Times'' in 1926 that "I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentplaques.com/blog/?p=1026|title=Invention Geek – Edison Spirit Phone?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the monetary system===

Thomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the [[gold standard]] and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating "Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and [[interest]] is an invention of Satan."&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/12/06/98768710.pdf |title=Ford sees wealth in muscle shoals|work=[[The New York Times]] |format=PDF |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |date=December 6, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

He thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled "A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System".&lt;ref&gt;Edison, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, [[Henry Ford]], he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammes |first1=D.L. |last2=Wills |first2=D.T.|title=Thomas Edison's Monetary Option|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|year=2006 |volume=28|issue=3|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammes |first=David L.|title=Harvesting Gold: Thomas Edison's Experiment to Re-Invent American Money|publisher=Mahler Publishing|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18691">'''Triple accreditation''' (or '''Triple Crown accreditation''') is the combination of [[Accreditation|accreditations]] awarded to 89 business schools worldwide as of May 2018 (up from 74 in May 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.today/guide/triple-accreditation-business-schools|title=Triple accredited business schools (AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS)|publisher=MBA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the three largest and most influential business school accreditation organizations:

* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]] - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[United States]])
* [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] - The Association of MBAs ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]] - EFMD Quality Improvement System ([[European Union]])

Of the 13,670 schools offering business degree programs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]. Oct 15th 2011.  [http://www.economist.com/node/21532269 "Is time running out for business schools that aren’t quite elite?"]&lt;/ref&gt; only 90 have triple accreditation as of August 2018.

A major reason for the small number of triple-accredited institutions in the world is the requirement of the [[Association of MBAs]] that AMBA-accredited business schools should only admit MBA applicants with at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/-/media/files/accreditation/mba-criteria-for-accreditation.ashx?la=en|title=MBA Accreditation Criteria 2016|author=AMBA|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts{{who|date=February 2018}} claim that most top [[United States|US]] [[business school]]s cannot meet this criterion as they sometimes (though rarely) admit applicants with only a [[bachelor]]'s degree and little or no work experience. They claim that it is why triple-crown accreditation is pursued primarily by European institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools| doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not the case when some (former) triple accredited institutes, [[City University of Hong Kong]] for example, only require applicants having "relevant work experience is desirable (though not specifically required)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/mba/admissions/requirements/|title=MBA Admissions Requirements, City University of Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences in accreditation ==

Each of the three institutions assesses a business school according to different criteria and scope:&lt;ref&gt;AACSB Standards http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/standards.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AMBA Criteria http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EQUIS Standards and Criteria http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/equis-guides&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|right|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]

*Scope of accreditation
:AACSB has the broadest scope, as it accredits management and accounting programs at the entire university (e.g. management programs at the business school and the school of engineering) and grants university-wide accreditation.
:AMBA has the most focused scope as it accredits only the business school's portfolios of [[MBA]] programs (full-time, part-time, executive, distance-learning), [[Master of Business and Management|MBM]] programs (including [[MSc]] International Management) and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] (also known as DMgt in China).
:EQUIS's scope ranks in the middle, as it accredits the business school but not the university and not specific portfolios of programs.
*Duration of the accreditation process
:AACSB: 2–7 years
:AMBA: 9–18 months
:EQUIS: 2–3 years
*Reaccreditation
:AACSB: full re-accreditation every 5 or 10 years (the 10-year accreditation is being phased out)
:AMBA: full re-accreditation every 3 or 5 years (1-year accreditation is a possible outcome of reaccreditation in exceptional circumstances)
:EQUIS: full re-accreditation every 3 or 5 years
*School audit team
:AACSB's peer review team includes deans and business school administrators.
:AMBA's assessment team includes deans, associate deans, program directors and one AMBA representative.
:EQUIS's team includes three deans and one corporate representative.
*Evaluation report content
:AACSB's report reflects compliance with the AACSB standards
:AMBA's report includes compliance with criteria, conditions and recommendations
:EQUIS's report reflects compliance with the EQUIS standards
*Criteria/Standards size
:AACSB: 77 pages for Business Accreditation; 36 pages for Accounting Accreditation
:AMBA: 24 pages (9 pages for MBA; 9 pages for MBM; 6 pages for DBA)
:EQUIS: 71 pages
*Quantitative vs Qualitative
:AACSB has more quantitative criteria (checklists)
:AMBA has more qualitative criteria
:EQUIS is in the middle (between AACSB and AMBA)
*Internationalization
:AACSB conducts the evaluation against the school's own mission, so AACSB has no internationalization requirement unless internationalization is part of the school's mission.
:AMBA has internationalization criteria for research, curriculum and student enrolment. However, these are reviewed in a regional context for less internationalized regions (e.g. Latin America and Russia).
:EQUIS has strict requirements on internationalization.
*Faculty numbers
:AACSB: prescribed faculty ratios (AQ/PQ ratio)
:AMBA: no prescribed faculty-to-students ratio
:EQUIS: prescribed minimum numbers of faculty

*Visiting faculty
:AACSB disapproves of heavy use of visiting faculty.
:AMBA allows the visiting faculty model, as long as the visiting faculty are managed by the core faculty (and as long as the quality and course content is monitored).
:EQUIS disapproves of heavy use of visiting faculty.
*Research
:AACSB requires research in line with the mission of the school.
:AMBA requires research and publications in international refereed journals or proof of impactful research at national level.
:EQUIS requires research with an international dimension.
*Program-specific criteria
*:AACSB has no program-specific standards since it evaluates the entire university.
*:AMBA has program-specific criteria such as:
** at least 3 years of full-time work experience for all admitted MBA students;
** at least 500 contact hours (scheduled class hours) for a full-time MBA curriculum and a minimum of 120 contact hours for a distance-learning MBA;
** at least 20 students enrolled in an MBA program;
*:EQUIS has some program-specific standards in the context of the evaluation of the entire business school.
*Accreditation fees
:AACSB: 47,000 USD for initial business accreditation (or 63,500 USD for both business and accounting accreditation). In addition, an annual business accreditation fee is charged: 4,500 USD annually for a 5-year accreditation cycle or 2,500 USD annually for a 10-year accreditation cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/fees.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
:AMBA: 22,000 GBP for initial accreditation or 15,000 GBP for re-accreditation.
:EQUIS: 52,800 EUR for a 5-year initial accreditation or re-accreditation and 46,200 EUR for a 3-year initial accreditation or re-accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efmd.org/index.php/accreditation-main/equis/equis-fee-structure&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schools ==

There are 87 triple-accredited schools based in 33 countries and territories as of March 2018:&lt;ref&gt;AMBA-accredited schools: http://www.ambaguide.com/find-an-accredited-programme/schools/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AACSB-accredited schools: {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AOGQe8CN?url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EQUIS-accredited schools: http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top schools without triple accreditation ==


One reason for this is that a (small) number of top business schools choose not to allocated the work resource and incur the financial cost required for international accreditation and rely only on accreditation by their national accrediting body (usually the country's education ministry).

Another reason is that the top schools in some regions do not meet one or more of the detailed criteria of the accrediting institutions and choose not to amend their policy. Notable examples are some top US business schools: [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford GSB]], [[Columbia Business School]], [[Chicago Booth]], [http://www.tuck.edu Tuck School of Business], etc., which do not meet [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]]'s mandatory three-year student-work-experience requirement for all MBA students.

A third reason is that most of the 509 schools that have obtained AACSB accreditation in the US and Canada (either via the standard accreditation process or via the granting of accreditation based on their reputation as top schools) do not look outside of North America for further validation, such as through European or British accreditation.

Stratton was educated at [[Eton College]] before doing [[National Service]] in the Army. He competed for Great Britain in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]] – the sailing took place at [[Naples]], competing in the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]] class; later in 1960 he won the [[Finn Gold Cup]].

Stratton was an early pioneer of Finn sailing in the Britain and was involved in starting the British Finn Association. Between 1961 and 1964 he was the Secretary to the International Finn Association; he later became its President in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnuk.org.uk/news/143-vernon-stratton-1927-2011 British Finn Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916231100/http://www.finnuk.org.uk/news/143-vernon-stratton-1927-2011 |date=September 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also three times British Olympic sailing team manager – [[1968 Summer Olympics|Acapulco (1968)]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|Kiel (1972)]] and [[1980 Summer Olympics|Tallinn (1980)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtsandyachting.com/news/?article=159123 Yachts and Yachting]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saulo founded her own finance and insurance company and in November 2012 she was elected to the House of Representatives of American Samoa, to represent Tualauta County.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was the only woman in the House, although in 2014 a second woman, [[Atalina Asifoa]], was elected and for two years there were two women in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://samoanews.com/local-news/once-again-tualauta-faipule-vui-only-woman-fono|title=Once again Tualauta faipule Vui is the only woman in the Fono {{!}} Samoa News|website=samoanews.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Saulo's election in 2012 her eligibility to stand was challenged on the grounds that she had allegedly not been required to provide a birth certificate in order to register as a candidate in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/208687/electoral-challenge-against-only-woman-elected-to-american-samoa-house|title=Electoral challenge against only woman elected to American Samoa House|date=2012-11-23|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
