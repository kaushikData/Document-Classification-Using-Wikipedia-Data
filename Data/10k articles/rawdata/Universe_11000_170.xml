      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">'''AgInSbTe''', or '''[[Silver]]-[[Indium]]-[[Antimony]]-[[Tellurium]]''', is a [[phase transition|phase change]] material from the group of [[chalcogenide glass]]es, used in rewritable [[optical disc]]s (such as [[CD-RW|rewritable CDs]]) and [[phase-change memory]] applications. It is a quaternary compound of [[silver]], [[indium]], [[antimony]], and [[tellurium]]. 

During writing, the material is first erased, initialized into its [[crystalline]] state, with long, lower-intensity laser irradiation. The material heats up to its crystallization temperature, but not up to its melting point, and crystallizes in a [[metastable]] [[face-centered cubic]] structure. Then the information is written on the crystalline phase, by heating spots of it with short (&lt;10 ns), high-intensity laser pulses; the material locally melts and is quickly cooled, remaining in the [[amorphous]] phase. As the amorphous phase has lower reflectivity than the crystalline phase, the bitstream can be recorded as "dark" amorphous spots on the crystalline background. At low linear velocities, clusters of crystalline material can exist in the amorphous spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jjap.ipap.jp/link?JJAP%2F44%2F3042|title=Laser-Induced Crystallization in AgInSbTe Phase-Change Optical Disk|date=10 May 2005|publisher=|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=44|issue=5A|pages=3042–3048|doi=10.1143/jjap.44.3042|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010242/http://jjap.ipap.jp/link?JJAP%2F44%2F3042|archivedate=27 September 2007|author1=Yem-Yeu Chang|author2=Lih-Hsin Chou}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another similar material is [[GeSbTe]], offering a lower linear density, but with higher overwrite cycles by 1-2 orders of magnitude. It is used in pit-and-groove recording formats, often in [[DVD-RW|rewritable DVDs]].

The '''Alabama Plating Company Superfund site''' is a former industrial site in [[Vincent, Alabama]]. The site covers 6 acres and was used by the Alabama Plating Company as an [[electroplating]] facility between 1956-1986. The facility caused contamination of the ground water with hazardous waste containing [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Alabama Plating Co.

{{Infobox antimony}}
'''Antimony''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Sb''' (from {{lang-la|stibium}}) and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;51. A lustrous gray [[metalloid]], it is found in nature mainly as the [[sulfide mineral]] [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kimhi]]'s Commentary on Jeremiah 4:30 and I Chronicles 29:2; Hebrew: '''פוך'''/'''כְּחֻל''', Aramaic: '''כּוּחְלִי'''/'''צדידא'''; Arabic: '''كحل''', and which can also refer to [[antimony trisulfide]]. See also Z. Dori, ''Antimony and Henna'' (Heb. '''הפוך והכופר'''), Jerusalem 1983 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as [[lead]] upon its discovery. The earliest known description of the metal in the West was written in 1540 by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]].

For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]]. The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and [[carbothermic reaction|reduction with carbon]] or direct reduction of [[stibnite]] with iron.

The largest applications for metallic antimony is an alloy with [[lead]] and [[tin]] and the lead antimony plates in [[lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]]. Alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for [[solder]]s, [[bullet]]s, and [[plain bearing]]s. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing [[fire retardant]]s found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in [[microelectronics]].

==Characteristics==

===Properties===
[[File:Antimon.PNG|thumb|left|alt=A clear vial containing small chunks of a slightly lustrous black solid, labeled "Sb".|A vial containing the black [[allotrope]] of antimony]]
[[File:Antimony massive.jpg|left|thumb|alt=An irregular piece of silvery stone with spots of variation in lustre and shade.|Native antimony with [[redox|oxidation]] products]]
[[File:SbAs lattice.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure common to Sb, [[stibarsen|AsSb]] and gray As]]
Antimony is a  member of [[Group (periodic table)|group 15]] of the periodic table, one of the elements called [[pnictogen]]s,  and has an [[electronegativity]] of 2.05. In accordance with periodic trends, it is more electronegative than [[tin]] or [[bismuth]], and less electronegative than [[tellurium]] or [[arsenic]]. Antimony is stable in air at room temperature, but reacts with [[oxygen]] if heated to produce [[antimony trioxide]], Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|758}}

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metalloid with a [[Mohs scale]] hardness of 3, which is too soft to make hard objects; coins of antimony were issued in China's [[Guizhou]] province in 1931 but the durability was poor and the minting was soon discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcoinpics.co.uk/metal.html|title=Metals Used in Coins and Medals|publisher=ukcoinpics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony is resistant to attack by acids.

Four [[allotropy|allotropes]] of antimony are known: a stable metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a [[brittle]], silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a [[trigonal]] cell, [[isomorphic]] with the gray allotrope of [[arsenic]]. A rare [[explosive form of antimony]] can be formed from the electrolysis of [[antimony trichloride]]. When scratched with a sharp implement, an [[exothermic]] reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as [[red phosphorus]] and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100&amp;nbsp;°C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of [[stibine]] (SbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at −90&amp;nbsp;°C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this [[metastability|metastable]] allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name="cww"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&amp;pg=PA50|pages=50–51|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental antimony adopts a layered structure ([[space group]] R{{overline|3}}m No. 166) in which layers consist of fused, ruffled, six-membered rings. The nearest and next-nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex, with the three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6.697&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|758}}

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of antimony}}
Antimony has two stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;121&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%.

===Occurrence===
{{See also|Category:Antimonide minerals|Category:Antimonate minerals}}
[[File:Stibnite.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stibnite]]]]
The abundance of antimony in the [[Earth]]'s crust is estimated to be 0.2 to 0.5 [[part per million|parts per million]], comparable to [[thallium]] at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2016-antim.pdf|title=Mineral Commodity Summaries: Antimony|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in more than 100 [[mineral]] species. Antimony is sometimes found natively (e.g. on [[Antimony Peak]]), but more frequently it is found in the sulfide [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is the predominant ore [[mineral]].&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;&lt;!--Commercial forms of antimony are generally [[ingot]]s, broken pieces, [[granular material|granules]], and cast cake. Other forms are [[powder (substance)|powder]], shot, and [[single crystal]]s.{{fact|date=February 2012}}--&gt;

==Compounds==
{{See also|Category:Antimony compounds}}
Antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state: Sb(III) and Sb(V).&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; The +5 [[oxidation state]] is more stable.

===Oxides and hydroxides===
[[Antimony trioxide]] is formed when antimony is burnt in air.&lt;ref name="reger2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry: Principles and Practice|author=Reger, Daniel L.|author2=Goode, Scott R.|author3=Ball, David W.|last-author-amp=yes|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUIaM1V3ThsC&amp;pg=PA883|publisher=Cengage Learning|date=2009|isbn=978-0-534-42012-3|page=883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the gas phase, the molecule of the compound is {{chem|Sb|4|O|6}}, but it polymerizes upon condensing.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt; [[Antimony pentoxide]] ({{chem|Sb|4|O|10}}) can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|author=House, James E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocKWuxOur-kC&amp;pg=PA502|date=2008|isbn=978-0-12-356786-4|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, [[antimony tetroxide]] ({{chem|Sb|2|O|4}}), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V).&lt;ref name="house"/&gt; Unlike oxides of [[phosphorus]] and [[arsenic]], these oxides are [[amphoteric]], do not form well-defined [[oxoacid]]s, and react with acids to form antimony salts.

Antimonous acid {{chem|Sb(OH)|3}} is unknown, but the conjugate base sodium antimonite ({{chem|[Na|3|SbO|3|]|4}}) forms upon fusing [[sodium oxide]] and {{chem|Sb|4|O|6}}.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|763}} Transition metal antimonites are also known.&lt;ref name="norman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|author=Godfrey, S.

Many antimony ores are sulfides, including [[stibnite]] ({{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}), [[pyrargyrite]] ({{chem|Ag|3|SbS|3}}), [[zinkenite]], [[jamesonite]], and [[boulangerite]].&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|757}} [[Antimony pentasulfide]] is [[non-stoichiometric compound|non-stoichiometric]] and features antimony in the +3 [[oxidation state]] and S-S bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0020-1650(69)80231-X|title=The oxidation number of antimony in antimony pentasulfide|date=1969|last1=Long|first1=G.|journal=Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters|volume=5|page=21|last2=Stevens|first2=J.

===Halides===
Antimony forms two series of [[halide]]s: {{chem|SbX|3}} and {{chem|SbX|5}}. The trihalides [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]], [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]], [[antimony tribromide|{{chem|SbBr|3}}]], and [[antimony triiodide|{{chem|SbI|3}}]] are all molecular compounds having [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].

The trifluoride [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]] is prepared by the reaction of [[antimony trioxide|{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}}]] with [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]]:&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|761–762}}
:{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}} + 6 HF → 2 {{chem|SbF|3}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|O}}

It is [[Lewis acid]]ic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions {{chem|SbF|4|-}} and {{chem|SbF|5|2-}}. Molten [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]] is a weak [[electrical conductor]]. The trichloride [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]] is prepared by dissolving [[stibnite|{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}]] in [[hydrochloric acid]]:
:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 6 HCl → 2 {{chem|SbCl|3}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|S}}
[[File:Antimony-pentafluoride-monomer-3D-balls.png|thumb|upright|left|Structure of gaseous SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The pentahalides [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] and [[antimony pentachloride|{{chem|SbCl|5}}]] have [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]] in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase, [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] is [[polymer]]ic, whereas [[antimony pentachloride|{{chem|SbCl|5}}]] is monomeric.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic chemistry|author=Wiberg, Egon|author2=Wiberg, Nils|author3=Holleman, Arnold Frederick|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Academic Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|761}} [[Antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the [[superacid]] [[fluoroantimonic acid]] ("H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;").

[[Oxohalide|Oxyhalides]] are more common for antimony than for arsenic and phosphorus. [[Antimony trioxide]] dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as [[antimony oxychloride|SbOCl]] and {{chem|(SbO)|2|SO|4}}.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|764}}

===Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds===
Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. Antimony forms [[antimonide]]s with metals, such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) and silver antimonide ({{chem|Ag|3|Sb}}).&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|760}} The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, such as Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb and Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the highly unstable gas [[stibine]], {{chem|SbH|3}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Chemistry&amp;nbsp;– A Textbook for College Students|author=Kahlenberg, Louis|publisher=READ BOOKS|date=2008|isbn=978-1-4097-6995-8|pages=324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{chem|Sb|3-}} + 3 {{chem|H|+}} → {{chem|SbH|3}}
Stibine can also be produced by treating {{chem|Sb|3+}} salts with hydride reagents such as [[sodium borohydride]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature. Because stibine has a positive [[heat of formation]], it is [[thermodynamic stability|thermodynamically unstable]] and thus antimony does not react with [[hydrogen]] directly.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organoantimony chemistry|Organoantimony compounds]] are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with [[Grignard reagent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Elschenbroich, C. "Organometallics" (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|3-527-29390-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers, including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations. Examples include Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[triphenylstibine]]), Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic [Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and several related halides.

==History==
[[File:antimony-symbol.svg|upright=0.3|thumb|alt=An unshaded circle surmounted by a cross.|One of the [[alchemical symbol]]s for antimony]]
[[Antimony(III) sulfide]], Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, was recognized in [[predynastic Egypt]] as an eye cosmetic ([[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]) as early as about [[4th millennium BC|3100 BC]], when the [[cosmetic palette]] was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2006.00279.x|title=Application of Lead Isotope Analysis to a Wide Range of Late Bronze Age Egyptian Materials|date=2006|last1=Shortland|first1=A. J.|journal=Archaeometry|volume=48|issue=4|page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An artifact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at [[Girsu|Telloh]], [[Chaldea]] (part of present-day [[Iraq]]), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt; Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone in 1892&lt;ref name=moorey&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorey|first=P.

Moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Tello object (published in 1975), "attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony" (i.e. native metal) and that "the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments."&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt; This weakens the evidence for a lost art "of rendering antimony malleable."&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt;

The Roman scholar [[Pliny the Elder]] described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']].&lt;ref name=mellor&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BGE6AQAAIAAJ|chapter=Antimony|page=339|title=A comprehensive treatise on inorganic and theoretical chemistry|volume=9|author=Mellor, Joseph William|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny the Elder also made a distinction between "male" and "female" forms of antimony; the male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, has been suspected to be native metallic antimony.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural history]]'', 33.33; W.H.S. Jones, the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translator, supplies a note suggesting the identifications.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman naturalist [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air. It is thought that this produced metallic antimony.&lt;ref name=mellor/&gt;

[[File:Specola, medaglione di vannoccio biringucci.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Italian metallurgist [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] described the first procedure of how to isolate antimony.]]

The first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the 1540 book ''[[De la pirotechnia]]'' by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]],&lt;ref&gt;Vannoccio Biringuccio, [http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/delapirotechnial00biri ''De la Pirotechnia''] (Venice (Italy): Curtio Navo e fratelli, 1540), Book 2, chapter 3: ''Del antimonio &amp; sua miniera, Capitolo terzo'' (On antimony and its ore, third chapter), pp. 27-28. [Note: Only every second page of this book is numbered, so the relevant passage is to be found on the 74th and 75th pages of the text.] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; predating the more famous 1556 book by [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]], ''[[De re metallica]]''. In this context Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony. The book ''Currus Triumphalis Antimonii'' (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), describing the preparation of metallic antimony, was published in Germany in 1604. It was purported to be written by a [[Benedictine]] monk, writing under the name [[Basilius Valentinus]] in the 15th century; if it were authentic, which it is not, it would predate Biringuccio.{{refn|Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von [[Leibniz]], after careful inquiry, concluded the work was spurious, there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the book's author was its ostensible editor, [[Johann Thölde]] ([[circa|c.]] 1565 – c. 1624).

The work remains of great interest, chiefly because it documents how followers of the renegade German physician, Philippus Theophrastus [[Paracelsus]] von Hohenheim (of whom Thölde was one), came to associate the practice of alchemy with the preparation of chemical medicines.--&gt;

The metal antimony was known to German chemist [[Andreas Libavius]] in 1615 who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide, salt and potassium [[tartrate]]. This procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface.&lt;ref name=mellor/&gt;

With the advent of challenges to [[phlogiston theory]], it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides, oxides, and other compounds, as do other metals.&lt;ref name=mellor/&gt;

===Etymology===
The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late [[Byzantine Greek]] take their names for antimony, is ''antimonium''. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The [[popular etymology]], from ἀντίμοναχός ''anti-monachos'' or French ''antimoine'', still has adherents; this would mean "monk-killer", and is explained by many early [[alchemist]]s being monks, and antimony being poisonous.&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{OEtymD|antimony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular etymology is the hypothetical Greek word ἀντίμόνος ''antimonos'', "against aloneness", explained as "not found as metal", or "not found unalloyed".&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;"Antimony" in ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'', 5th ed. 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-471-48494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fernando, Diana|title=Alchemy: an illustrated A to Z|date=1998|publisher=Blandford}} Fernando even derives it from the story of how "Basil Valentine" and his fellow monastic alchemists poisoned themselves by working with antimony; ''antimonium'' is found two centuries before his time. "Popular etymology" from ''OED''; as for ''antimonos'', the pure negative would be more naturally expressed by ''a-'' "not".&lt;/ref&gt; Lippmann conjectured a hypothetical Greek word ανθήμόνιον ''anthemonion'', which would mean "floret", and cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological [[efflorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, pp. 643–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The early uses of ''antimonium'' include the translations, in 1050–1100, by [[Constantine the African]] of Arabic medical treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, p. 642, writing in 1919, says "''zuerst''".&lt;/ref&gt; Several authorities believe ''antimonium'' is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from ''ithmid'';&lt;ref&gt;Meyerhof as quoted in Sarton, asserts that ''ithmid'' or ''athmoud'' became corrupted in the medieval "traductions barbaro-latines".; the ''OED'' asserts some Arabic form is the origin, and if ''ithmid'' is the root, posits ''athimodium, atimodium, atimonium'', as intermediate forms.&lt;/ref&gt; other possibilities include ''athimar'', the Arabic name of the metalloid, and a hypothetical ''as-stimmi'', derived from or parallel to the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Endlich, p. 28; one of the advantages of ''as-stimmi'' would be that it has a whole syllable in common with ''antimonium''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2451020|pages=21–32|last1=Endlich|first1=F. M.|title=On Some Interesting Derivations of Mineral Names|volume=22|issue=253|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1888|doi=10.1086/274630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard chemical symbol for antimony (Sb) is credited to [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], who derived the abbreviation from ''stibium''.&lt;ref&gt;In his long article on chemical reactions and nomenclature – Jöns Jacob Berzelius, "Essay on the cause of chemical proportions, and on some circumstances relating to them: together with a short and easy method of expressing them," ''Annals of Philosophy'', vol. 2, pages 443–454 (1813) and vol. 3, pages 51–62, 93–106, 244–255, 353–364 (1814) – on [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8M4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 page 52], Berzelius lists the symbol for antimony as "St"; however, starting on [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8M4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA248 page 248], Berzelius subsequently uses the symbol "Sb" for antimony.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], the sulfide of antimony.
The Egyptians called antimony ''mśdmt'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albright|first=W. F.|title=Notes on Egypto-Semitic Etymology.

Later Greeks also used στἰβι ''stibi'', as did [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names ''stimi'' {{sic}}, ''larbaris'', [[alabaster]], and the "very common" ''platyophthalmos'', "wide-eye" (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as ''stibium''. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as إثمد ''ithmid, athmoud, othmod'', or ''uthmod''. [[Littré]] suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from ''stimmida'', an accusative for ''stimmi''.&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]], ''s.v.'', vocalisation, spelling, and declension vary; Endlich, p. 28; Celsus, 6.6.6 ff; Pliny ''Natural History'' 33.33; Lewis and Short: ''Latin Dictionary''.

In 2016, according to the [[US Geological Survey]], China accounted for 76.9% of total antimony production, followed in second place by Russia with 6.9% and Tajikistan with 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2017-antim.pdf|title=United States Geological Mineral Commodity Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese production of antimony is expected to decline in the future as mines and smelters are closed down by the government as part of pollution control. Especially due to a new environmental protection law having gone into effect on January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/Environmental-Protection-Law-2014-eversion.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China|last=|first=|date=24 April 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised “Emission Standards of Pollutants for Stanum, Antimony, and Mercury” having gone into effect, hurdles for economic production are higher. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in China, by September 2015 50% of antimony production capacity in the Hunan province (the province with biggest antimony reserves in China) had not been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2016-antim.pdf|title=U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries: Antimony|last=|first=|date=1 January 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reported production of antimony in China has fallen and is unlikely to increase in the coming years, according to the Roskill report. No significant antimony deposits in China have been developed for about ten years, and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted.&lt;ref name="Roskill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancoa.com.au/RoskillCRT.pdf|title=Study of the antimony market by Roskill Consulting Group|access-date=9 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018034957/http://www.ancoa.com.au/RoskillCRT.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest antimony producers, according to Roskill, are listed below:

===Production process===
The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower-grade ores are concentrated by [[froth flotation]], while higher-grade ores are heated to 500–600&amp;nbsp;°C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the [[gangue]] minerals. Antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by reduction with scrap iron:&lt;ref name="of03"/&gt;

:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 3 Fe → 2 Sb + 3 FeS

The sulfide is converted to an oxide; the product is then roasted, sometimes for the purpose of vaporizing the volatile antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide.&lt;ref name="Norm"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2003.10.014|title=Antimony distribution and environmental mobility at an historic antimony smelter site, New Zealand|date=2004|last1=Wilson|first1=N. J.|last2=Craw|first2=D.|last3=Hunter|first3=K.|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=129|issue=2|pages=257–66|pmid=14987811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony is isolated from the oxide by a carbothermal reduction:&lt;ref name="of03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norm"/&gt;

:2 {{chem|Sb|2|O|3}} + 3 C → 4 Sb + 3 {{chem|CO|2}}

The lower-grade ores are reduced in [[blast furnace]]s while the higher-grade ores are reduced in [[reverberatory furnace]]s.&lt;ref name="of03"/&gt;

===Supply risk and critical mineral rankings===
Antimony has consistently been ranked high in European and US [[Critical mineral raw materials|risk lists concerning criticality of the element]] indicating the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current economy and lifestyle.

With most of the antimony imported into Europe and the US coming from China, Chinese production is critical to supply. As China is revising and increasing environmental control standards, antimony production is becoming increasingly restricted. Additionally Chinese export quotas for antimony have been decreasing in the past years. These two factors increase supply risk for both Europe and US.

====Europe====
According to the BGS Risk List 2015, antimony is ranked second highest (after rare earth elements) on the relative supply risk index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/statistics/risklist.html|title=MineralsUK Risk List 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that it has currently the second highest supply risk for chemical elements or element groups which are of economic value to the British economy and lifestyle.
Furthermore, antimony was identified as one of 20 critical raw materials for the EU in a report published in 2014 (which revised the initial report published in 2011). As seen in Figure xxx antimony maintains high supply risk relative to its economic importance. 92% of the antimony is imported from China, which is a significantly high concentration of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52014DC0297|title=Review of the list of critical raw materials for the EU and the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S.====
Much analysis has been conducted in the U.S. toward defining which metals should be called strategic or critical to the nation's security. Exact definitions do not exist, and views as to what constitutes a strategic or critical mineral to U.S. security diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanresources.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ARPN_Quarterly_Report_WEB.pdf|title=American Resources Policy Network Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, no antimony was mined in the U.S. The metal is imported from foreign countries. From 2011-2014 68% of America's antimony came from China, 14% from India, 4% from Mexico, and 14% from other sources. There are no government stockpiles in place currently.

The U.S. “Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains” has screened 78 mineral resources from 1996-2008. It found that a small subset of minerals including antimony has fallen into the category of potentially critical minerals consistently. In the future, a second assessment will be made of the found subset of minerals to identify which should be defined of significant risk and critical to U.S. interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/specific-interest/critical_en|title=Critical Raw Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
About 60% of antimony is consumed in [[flame retardant]]s, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings, and solders.&lt;ref name="of03"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-019/of03-019.pdf|first1=C.|last1=Butterman|first2=J. F.|last2=Carlin, Jr.|date=2003|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Mineral Commodity Profiles: Antimony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flame retardants===
Antimony is mainly used in the [[antimony trioxide|trioxide]] for [[flame retardant|flame-proofing compounds]], always in combination with halogenated flame retardants except in halogen-containing polymers. The flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide is produced by the formation of halogenated antimony compounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG9VFSBnIPAC&amp;pg=PA61|chapter=Antimony trioxide and Related Compounds|title=Flame retardants for plastics and textiles: Practical applications|isbn=978-3-446-41652-9|author1=Weil|first1=Edward D.|last2=Levchik|first2=Sergei V.|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8--&gt; which react with hydrogen atoms, and probably also with oxygen atoms and OH radicals, thus inhibiting fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0010-2180(73)90006-0|title=Mass spectrometric studies of flame inhibition: Analysis of antimony trihalides in flames|date=1973|last1=Hastie|first1=John W.|journal=Combustion and Flame|volume=21|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markets for these flame-retardants include children's clothing, toys, aircraft, and automobile seat covers. They are also added to [[polyester resin]]s in [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] [[composite material|composites]] for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn in the presence of an externally generated flame, but will extinguish when the external flame is removed.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Grund, Sabina C.; Hanusch, Kunibert; Breunig, Hans J.; Wolf, Hans Uwe (2006) "Antimony and Antimony Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a03_055.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG9VFSBnIPAC&amp;pg=PA15|pages=15–16|title=Flame retardants for plastics and textiles: Practical applications|isbn=978-3-446-41652-9|author1=Weil|first1=Edward D.|last2=Levchik|first2=Sergei V.|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alloys===
Antimony forms a highly useful [[alloy]] with [[lead]], increasing its hardness and mechanical strength. For most applications involving lead, varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal. In [[lead–acid batteries]], this addition improves plate strength and charging characteristics.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Types of Alloys|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1HSsx9fPAKkC&amp;pg=PA60|title=Battery Technology Handbook|first=Heinz Albert|last=Kiehne|publisher=CRC Press|date=2003|pages=60–61|isbn=978-0-8247-4249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in antifriction alloys (such as [[Babbitt metal]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-4067-4671-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KR82QRlAgUwC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Principles of Metallography|last=Williams|first=Robert S.|publisher=Read books|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[bullet]]s and [[lead shot]], [[electrical cable]] sheathing, [[type metal]] (for example, for [[Linotype machine|linotype]] printing machines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IYZezyEvZ78C&amp;pg=PA399|title=Inorganic Chemistry&amp;nbsp;– A Textbooks for Colleges and Schools|first=E.

===Other applications===
Three other applications consume nearly all the rest of the world's supply.&lt;ref name="of03"/&gt; One application is a stabilizer and a catalyst for the production of [[polyethyleneterephthalate]].&lt;ref name="of03"/&gt; Another is a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in [[glass]], mostly for TV screens;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_365|chapter=Glass|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|last1=De Jong|first1=Bernard H.

Biology and medicine have few uses for antimony. Treatments containing antimony, known as [[antimonial]]s, are used as [[emetic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Antimony's Curious History|first=Colin A.|last=Russell|jstor=532063|pages=115–116|volume=54|issue=1|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|date=2000|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0101|pmc=1064207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony compounds are used as [[antiprotozoal agent|antiprotozoan]] drugs.

==Precautions==
The effects of antimony and its compounds on human and environmental health differ widely. The elemental antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. The effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble Sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance, lung overload, inflammation and ultimately tumour formation, not to exposure to antimony ions (OECD, 2008). Antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin. The effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony.

For oral absorption, ICRP (1994) recommended values of 10% for tartar emetic and 1% for all other antimony compounds. Dermal absorption for metals is estimated at most 1% (HERAG, 2007). Inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble Sb(III) substances (such as antimony dust) is estimated at 6.8% (OECD, 2008), whereas a value &lt;1% is derived for Sb(V) substances. Antimony(V) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony(III) in the cell, and both species exist simultaneously.

Antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine. Antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects, with the exception of [[antimony potassium tartrate]] ("tartar emetic"), a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat [[leishmaniasis]] patients.

Prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis. However, it was agreed at the European Union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance-specific, but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts (ECHA/PR/09/09, Helsinki, 6 July 2009). Antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{PGCH|0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antimony is incompatible with strong acids, halogenated acids, and oxidizers; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form [[stibine]] (SbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) is set at 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] and by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) as a legal [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as an 8 hour TWA.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Antimony compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) production. Some studies report minor antimony leaching from PET bottles into liquids, but levels are below drinking water guidelines. Antimony concentrations in fruit juice concentrates were somewhat higher (up to 44.7&amp;nbsp;µg/L of antimony), but juices do not fall under the drinking water regulations. The drinking water guidelines are:

===Toxicity===
Certain compounds of antimony appear to be toxic, particularly antimony trioxide and antimony potassium tartrate.&lt;ref name="atsdr.cdc.gov"&gt;https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Effects may be similar to arsenic poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/antimony-poisoning&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational exposure may cause respiratory irritation, pneumoconiosis, antimony spots on the skin, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac arrhythmias. In addition antimony trioxide is potentially carcinogenic to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 3037053|year = 2010|last1 = Sundar|first1 = S|title = Antimony Toxicity|journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume = 7|issue = 12|pages = 4267–4277|last2 = Chakravarty|first2 = J|pmid = 21318007|doi = 10.3390/ijerph7124267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverse health effects have been observed in humans and animals following inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to antimony and antimony compounds.&lt;ref name="atsdr.cdc.gov"/&gt; Antimony toxicity typically occurs either due to occupational exposure, during therapy or from accidental ingestion. It is unclear if antimony can enter the body through the skin.&lt;ref name="atsdr.cdc.gov"/&gt;

'''Biologic mesh''' (or '''biomesh''') is a type of [[surgical mesh]] made from an organic [[biomaterial]] (such as [[porcine]] dermis, porcine [[Submucosa#Small intestinal submucosa|small intestine submucosa]], [[bovine]] dermis or [[pericardium]], and the [[dermis]] or [[fascia lata]] of a cadaveric human). Biologic mesh is primarily indicated for several types of [[hernia]] repair, including [[Inguinal hernia|inguinal]] and [[Incisional hernia|ventral]] hernias, hernia prophylaxis, and contaminated hernia repairs.&lt;ref name="ChowbeyEndo12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3wJoqnFAMC&amp;pg=PA76 |chapter=Chapter 6: Prosthetics and fixations devices |title=Endoscopic Repair of Abdominal Wall Hernias |editor=Chowbey, P. |publisher=Byword Books Private Limited |location=Delhi, India |pages=63–86 |year=2012 |edition=2nd |isbn=9788181930880 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CADTHBio15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0079059/ |title=Biological Mesh: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness and Guidelines – An Update |author=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health |work=PubMed Health |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |date=11 August 2015 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has also been used in [[pelvic floor dysfunction]], [[parotidectomy]], and [[Plastic surgery|reconstructive plastic surgery]].&lt;ref name="CADTHBio15" /&gt; The development of biologic mesh largely has derived from the need of a [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]] material that addresses "the problems associated with a permanent synthetic mesh, including chronic inflammation, foreign body reaction, fibrosis, and mesh infection."&lt;ref name="ChowbeyEndo12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbonell-TataySurg15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA591 |chapter=Chapter 47: Surgical Advances in the Treatment of Abdominal Wall Hernias |title=Technological Advances in Surgery, Trauma and Critical Care |author1=Carbonell-Tatay, F. |author2=González, Á.Z. |editor1=Latifi, R. |editor2=Rhee, P. |editor3=Gruessner, R.W.G. |publisher=Springer |location=New York |pages=573–597 |year=2015 |isbn=9781493926718 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, however, the efficacy and optimal use of biological mesh products remains in question.&lt;ref name="CADTHBio15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbonell-TataySurg15" /&gt;

==Development, benefits, and drawbacks==
The idea of using organic materials for surgical mesh has been around since at least the late 1950s, though researchers soon learned the materials they tested weren't [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]].&lt;ref name="ChowbeyEndo12" /&gt; Research into more compatible [[biomaterial]]s occurred in the proceeding decades, including the search for cellular-based materials extracted from humans and animals. For example, in 1980, research presented at the first ever World Biomaterials Congress detailed the examined use of dermal collagen of sheep to construct biological mesh for reconstructive surgery.&lt;ref name="ESBBio80"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMVpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22biological+mesh%22&amp;dq=%22biological+mesh%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiboeehlcbLAhUJsYMKHZXrAQ4Q6AEILTAC |chapter=Processed Sheep Dermal Collagen as a Biomaterial: An Experimental Study |title=Final Programme, Book Of Abstracts: First World Biomaterials Congress, Baden Near Vienna, Austria, April 8-12, 1980 In Conjunction With The Twelfth International Biomaterials Symposium And The Sixth Annual Meeting Of The Society For Biomaterials |author1=van Gulik, T.M. |author2=Klopper, P.J. |author3=van der Hooff, A. |author4=Bantjes, A. |editor=World Biomaterials Congress |publisher=European Society for Biomaterials |year=1980 |isbn=9782902590025 |page=2.107 |quote=In our search for a biological mesh for reconstructive surgery, we investigated sheep dermal collagen. |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, "research for developing and improvising the biological material required for the production of these meshes" has been ongoing.&lt;ref name="ChowbeyEndo12" /&gt;

Typical advantages attributed to biologic meshes include reducing the risk of infection (from using non-biologic surgical meshes) and is absorbed into the resulting scar as part of cellular ingrowth.&lt;ref name="CADTHBio15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SturtModern06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EtJtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121 |chapter=Chapter 8: Modern Management of an Intestinal Fistula |title=Recent Advances in Surgery 34 |author1=Sturt, N.J.H. |author2=Windsor, A.C.J. |author3=Engledow, A.H. |editor1=Taylor, I |editor2=Johnson, C.D. |publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers |location=New Delhi, India |pages=109–124 |year=2011 |isbn=9789350253021 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly described drawbacks include the high cost of the material and its uncertain clinical effectiveness, particularly in regards to the cost.&lt;ref name="ChowbeyEndo12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CADTHBio15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SturtModern06" /&gt; An August 2015 follow-up literature review published by the [[Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health]] in particular addressed these drawbacks, concluding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the publications identified for the current report, there remains a lack of sufficient evidence to guide clinical practice regarding the use of biological mesh products ... Several surgical indications are addressed by this collection of [randomized controlled trials (RCTs)] with relatively few studies per indication. Therefore, it is not immediately apparent whether this represents a significant amount of research on the clinical effectiveness of any particular mesh product or for any specific patient population that would support clinical decision making. Further rigorously designed RCTs are required to clarify comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of the many available biological mesh products for most surgical indications in which their use has been suggested.&lt;ref name="CADTHBio15" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Contamination considerations===
The presence of contamination may limit the applicability of permanent synthetic mesh in some procedures such as hernia repair. Biologic mesh may be acceptable for this purpose or for placement in open wounds as a staged closure in complex abdominal wall reconstruction. There is limited data in both of these areas, with some noting a high risk of hernia recurrence and associated infection. The data is mostly limited to animal models and case series.&lt;ref&gt;Saettele TM, Bachman SL, Costello CR, Grant SA, Cleveland DS, Loy TS, Kolder DG, Ramshaw BJ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5333">'''Cambridge Energy Research Associates''' ('''CERA''') is a consulting company in the United States that specializes in advising governments and private companies on [[energy]] markets, geopolitics, industry trends, and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihs.com/about/index.aspx |title=About IHS |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-06-04 |publisher=IHS CERA}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERA has research and consulting staff across the globe and covers the oil, gas, power, and coal markets worldwide.

The company was founded in 1983 by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[Daniel Yergin]], James Rosenfield and Joseph Stanislaw. Comprising experts from many fields within the energy industry, CERA was acquired by [[IHS Inc.|IHS]] Energy in 2004. In 2009 it modified its name to '''IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates''' or '''IHS CERA''' as part of the IHS brand integration in which name changes also took place for other endorsed brands under IHS, including IHS [[Jane's Information Group|Jane's]], IHS [[Global Insight]], IHS [[EViews]], and IHS Herold.

==CERAWeek==
Some of the company's largest clients include international energy companies, energy consumers, governments, utilities, technology companies, and financial institutions. Many of them attend "CERAWeek", the company's annual conference held at the Hilton Americas Hotel in [[Houston, Texas]]. Daily programs usually revolve around the topics of oil, natural gas, electric power, renewables, and technology.

Past keynote speeches have been given by the energy secretaries and ministers of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iraq]], [[Mexico]], [[Norway]], and the [[United States]]. Other notable speakers have included former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Robert Rubin]], [[United States Secretary of Energy]] [[Samuel Bodman]], former [[Colorado]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Gary Hart]]; former [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] [[Donald L. Evans]]; former [[Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]], and former Secretary General of [[OPEC]] [[Rilwanu Lukman]].

CERA also manages the [[Upstream Capital Costs Index]].

==Peak oil==
As the controversy over [[peak oil]] intensified in 2006, CERA found itself on the optimistic side of predictions, forecasting that a peak would not occur before 2030, and this would not be a "peak" but rather an "undulating plateau".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cera.com/aspx/cda/client/report/report.aspx?KID=5&amp;CID=10720 |title=The Future of Global Oil Supply: Understanding the Building Blocks |first=Peter |last=Jackson |publisher=IHS CERA |date=11/4/2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion has been met with criticism by those who believe a peak has already occurred or is imminent. ASPO-USA described CERA's position as having a credibility problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CERA’s peak oil critique has a credibility problem |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/26270 |first=Steve |last=Andrews |first2=Randy |last2=Udall |date=2008-02-19 |publisher=ASPO-USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Skrebowski considered the CERA report to be a polemic that confused stocks and flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.globalpublicmedia.com/an_open_letter_to_cera_from_chris_skrebowski |title=An open letter to CERA from Chris Skrebowski |date=2006-12-06 |first=Chris |last=Skrebowski |accessdate=2012-06-04 |publisher=Global Public Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Daniel Yergin said that markets have helped fuel a "shortage psychology" that the world is "running out of oil". He also described $120–$150 per barrel as the "break point" for oil, the point where demand erosion would affect the price rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oil speculation: The great debate |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/25/news/economy/jec_oil/index.htm |first=Aaron |last=Smith |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CERA researchers have predicted in September 2009 that peak demand has come and gone in the [[OECD]] world, likely sometime in 2005. This is not, however, in agreement with peak oil, which is more on the extraction and production side. CERA continues to believe that there is plenty of oil under ground. In predicting peak demand in developed countries, CERA states that long-term demand is softening as a result of demographic and socioeconomic changes in developed countries (such as the aging of OECD populations), improved transportation efficiency, and encroachment by substitutes such as biofuels and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihs.com/products/cera/energy-report.aspx?id=106592338 |publisher=IHS CERA |title=Peak Oil Demand in the Developed World: It's Here |first=Aaron |last=Brady |date=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chad–Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project''' is a controversial project to develop the production capacity of oilfields near [[Doba, Chad|Doba]] in southern [[Chad]], and to create a {{convert|1,070|km|adj=on}} pipeline to transport the oil to a [[Floating production storage and offloading|floating storage and offloading vessel]] (FSO), anchored off the coast of [[Cameroon]], near the city of [[Kribi]]. It is operated by [[ExxonMobil]] (40%) and also sponsored by partners forming the consortium, [[Petronas]] (35%) and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] (25%). The governments of Chad and Cameroon also have a combined 3% stake in the project.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/sipa/martin/chad-cam/overview.html#project|title=Chad Cameroon Oil Pipeline Project, a Study Tool and Case Study|last=Martin|first=J. Paul |publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was launched on October&amp;nbsp;18, 2000, and completed in June 2003 (the official inauguration took place in October of the same year).

It was largely funded by multilateral and bilateral credit financing provided by Western governments. The [[International Finance Corporation]], the private-sector arm of the [[World Bank]], provided $100 million of debt-based financing, and France's export credit agency [[COFACE]] and the U.S. [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] each provided $200&amp;nbsp;million; private lenders coordinated by the IFC provided an additional $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Joseph2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/africa.nsf/Content/SelectedPR?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=69D3E7E2C40EAE6185256A72007085D2 |title=IFC Signs Loans for Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project |last=Joseph |first=Ludwina |date=June 21, 2001 |publisher=International Finance Corporation,  World Bank Group |accessdate=25 April 2011 |location=Washington, D.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523225026/http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/africa.nsf/Content/SelectedPR?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=69D3E7E2C40EAE6185256A72007085D2 |archivedate=23 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The original consortium of oil companies involved in the pipeline project were [[Exxon]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Elf Aquitaine]]. Negotiations started in 1988, with Chad and a consortium of oil companies signing a 30-year oil concession in the southern Chad region of [[Doba, Chad|Doba]].&lt;ref name="Delescluse, Aude Chad-Cameroon 2004"&gt;[http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/publications/journal/.../delescluselocked.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Delescluse, Aude Chad-Cameroon: A Model Pipeline? 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Royal Dutch Shell and Elf Aquitaine dropped the project due to controversies surrounding the project and volatile oil prices. As a result, Exxon opened the project up for bid to a select few corporations and in April 2000, [[Petronas]] of Malaysia and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] acquired stakes in the project.&lt;ref name="UTXAustin"&gt;Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline: A Case Study from New Era, Center for Energy Economics, University of Texas at Austin&lt;/ref&gt; Exxon then enlisted the support of the [[World Bank]] to raise support within the international community. The World Bank agreed on the condition that certain environmental and social standards were enforced both in Chad and Cameroon, and that the revenues be put towards improving social and economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Delescluse, Aude Chad-Cameroon 2004"/&gt;

==Participants==

===Chad===
Since 1990, President [[Idriss Deby]] has been the head of government in [[Chad]], where presidential [[Elections in Chad|elections]] are held every five years. Chad's economy is dependent mainly on agriculture and livestock. It heavily relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital, as well as international investment projects. Because of Chad's [[Landlocked country|landlocked]] borders, its economy struggles from a lack of resources and instability between rebel groups. The country also serves as a host to thousands of refugees from neighboring [[Sudan]] and [[Central African Republic]], as well as many victims of [[human trafficking]]. Oil exploitation is estimated at a potential 1.5 billion barrels, and Chinese companies are currently developing an oil refinery and another pipeline in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424020620/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }} CIA World Factbook: Chad&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tchad Oil Transportation Company (TOTCO) manages the pipeline within Chad that is owned by the country. TOTCO is incorporated in Tchad, and is a joint venture between Chad and the Upstream Consortium.&lt;ref name="UTXAustin" /&gt;

===Cameroon===
The Republic of [[Cameroon]] has been ruled by President [[Paul Biya]] since November 6, 1982. A relatively peaceful and stable nation, Cameroon is a republic with a multiparty presidential regime. Although there are presidential elections every seven years, there are no term limits. A climate of intense corruption has created an unequal distribution of wealth and poor conditions for domestic and international investments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html CIA World Factbook: Cameroon&lt;/ref&gt;

The portion of the pipeline owned by Cameroon is managed by the Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COTCO). This company is incorporated in Cameroon, and is a joint venture between the governments of Cameroon and Chad, and the Upstream Consortium, an independent monitoring institution.&lt;ref name="UTXAustin" /&gt;

===World Bank===
The World Bank's support was very important for the Consortium of oil companies, as they believed they needed the support of the Bank in order for the project to succeed.

While the project's private sponsors, the Upstream Consortium, provided about 95% ($2.2 billion) of the financing for the pipeline, the World Bank also contributed through debt financing. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided a loan of about $100 million, $85.8 million of which went to COTCO and $14.2 million of which went to TOTCO, and also helped secure an additional $300 million in private commercial lending. The [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) provided $92.9 million to Chad ($39.5 million) and Cameroon ($53.4 million) to finance the joint-venture pipeline companies. Last of the World Bank-provided financing was given through the [[European Investment Bank]], which provided $46.6 million to finance Cameroon and Chad's equity in COTCO and TOTCO.&lt;ref name="UTXAustin" /&gt;

Included in plans for the project was a revenue management law developed by the World Bank. This separated the oil revenues given to Chad into four required areas: a Future Generations Fund, health, education and other development projects, a fund to compensate the Doba region of Chad from where the oil was extracted and government reserves. The revenue management law also created the Petroleum Revenue Oversight Committee, which oversees how the oil revenues are spent, and includes members of both the Chadian government and civil society.&lt;ref name="publishwhatyoupay.org2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/en/resources/catholic-relief-services-statement-chad-cameroon-oil-pipeline |title=Catholic Relief Services statement on the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline |date=9 Oct 2003 |work=publishwhatyoupay.org |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006062223/http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/en/resources/catholic-relief-services-statement-chad-cameroon-oil-pipeline |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/en/resources/catholic-relief-services-statement-chad-cameroon-oil-pipeline |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006062223/http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/en/resources/catholic-relief-services-statement-chad-cameroon-oil-pipeline |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }} CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES STATEMENT ON THE LAUNCH OF CHAD-CAMEROON OIL PIPELINE PROJECT, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2008, Chad fully prepaid both the IBRD and IDA components of the World Bank loan totaling $65.7 million from its "national coffers swollen by more than $1 billion a year in oil revenues".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Polgreen|first=Lydia|title=World Bank Ends Effort to Help Chad Ease Poverty|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/world/africa/11chad.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended its involvement in the project. The World Bank noted that, "over the years, Chad failed to comply with key requirements of this agreement", including devoting a substantial portion of the oil revenues to poverty reduction programs, and thus it "concluded that it could not continue to support this project under these circumstances".&lt;ref name=wb&gt;{{cite news|title=World Bank Statement on Chad-Cameroon Pipeline|url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01210/external.html?link=http://go.worldbank.org/2XPFIDG260|newspaper=The World Bank|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The pipeline project has been affected by persistent charges and fears about corruption and the diversion of revenues—ostensibly intended for poverty reduction—towards arms purchases, particularly by the regime of [[Chadian President]] [[Idriss Déby]]. [[Delphine Djiraibe]], a human rights attorney who became one of the leading critics of these arms purchases, was later awarded the 2004 [[Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award]] for her work against the project.&lt;ref name=RFK&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rfkcenter.org/delphine-djiraibe |title=2004: Delphine Djiraibe, Chad |publisher=Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights |accessdate=3 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521013217/http://rfkcenter.org/delphine-djiraibe |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition leader and parliamentarian [[Ngarledjy Yorongar]] of the [[Front of Action Forces for the Republic]] (FAR) accused [[National Assembly of Chad|National Assembly]] President [[Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue]] of taking a bribe from [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]], then a partner in the project, in 1997. Yorongar was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and detained for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/irinw221.html IRIN-West Africa Update 221], 3 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, the World Bank announced that $4&amp;nbsp;million of a $25&amp;nbsp;million signing bonus from the oil companies was spent by the Chadian government on weapons. The World Bank required tight restrictions on oil revenues as a condition of its loans. In January 2006, Chad moved to unilaterally increase the portion of oil revenues going to its general fund from 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;Emad Mekey, [http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=31645 Chad Dilutes Oil-For-Development Pledge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212170141/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=31645 |date=February 12, 2006 }}, 2 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2006, President Déby ordered Chevron and Petronas to quit the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5292036.stm Chad oil company deadline expires], ''BBC News'', 28 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impacts===
In Chad and especially Cameroon, through which the pipeline stretches 890&amp;nbsp;km of the total 1,070&amp;nbsp;km, there have been claims of adverse effects of the construction and maintenance of the pipeline on the indigenous communities and environment. One of the largest areas affected is in the coastal Cameroonian town of Kribi. Located {{convert|11|mi|km|order=flip}} off the coast of Kribi is the export terminal facility. There has been much controversy regarding the alleged degradation the coastal reefs during construction. This has not only impacted the underwater habitat, but also the livelihoods of the local people who depend on fishing as their main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Shombong, Nkushi Francis, [https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/4426/69634472.pdf "Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project: Impact Assessment of the Project to the Local Community: Case Study of the Ocean Division of Cameroon"], thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of M.Phil. degree in Resources and Human Adaptations, [[University of Bergen]], Norway, Department of Geography, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since completion of the pipeline in 2003, there have been two known oil leaks at the transfer site {{convert|11|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} off the shore of Cameroon. The first occurred on January 15, 2007. Representatives for COTCO claimed that the leak was contained within a few hours and that the amount of spilled was not sufficient to cause any harm, though local fishermen did claim to have seen traces of the oil ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.relufa.org/partners/jhnewsletter/documents/KribiOilSpill.doc|title=Oil Spill at Chad-Cameroon Pipeline’s Offshore Terminal|author=Relufa|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032735/http://www.relufa.org/partners/jhnewsletter/documents/KribiOilSpill.doc|archivedate=2014-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second oil spill was on April 22, 2010, at the same site. COTCO stated that the leaked oil amounted to less than five barrels. Cameroonian NGOs Relufa and Centre pour l'Environnement et le Développement have brought to light the inefficiencies of the oil-spill preparedness plan, as well as the lack of communication between COTCO and the surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.relufa.org/documents/Pressreleaseoilspillapril2010.pdf|title=Another oil leak on the marine terminal of the Chad- Cameroon pipeline|date=27 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032737/http://www.relufa.org/documents/Pressreleaseoilspillapril2010.pdf|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International involvement==

===Non-governmental institutions===
[[Non-governmental organizations]] have played a large role in mediating the concerns of the international community with the needs of the indigenous communities of [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]]. Even before construction commenced on the pipeline project in 2000, international and local NGOs were monitoring the situation and meeting with representatives from the World Bank and the Consortium of gasoline companies. After the completion of the project, NGOs were also very involved with documentation of any problems and worked in conjunction with external independent monitoring agencies.

In 2005, under the direction of the [[World Bank]]'s International Advisory Group, a group of stakeholders including COTCO, the CPSP and multiple NGOs created a platform under which complaints registered with the World Bank by organizations and individuals could be resolved. According to FOCARFE (Fondation Camerounaise d'Actions Rationalisees et de Formation sur l'Environnement), more than 300 civil society complaints existed by the close of construction in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;FOCARFE, Minutes of the Information Day on the Social Statement on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, the stakeholders involved in the project came together to discuss their views, main issues and concerns for a Forum of Information on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project. The stakeholders involved were the Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COTCO), the Comité de Pilotage et de Suivi des Pipelines (the Pipelines Steering and Monitoring Committee) and a group of four Cameroonian NGOs: CED (Centre pour l'Environnement et le Developpement), RELUFA (Reseau de Lutte contra le Faim), CARFAD (African Center for Applied Forestry Research and Development) and FOCARFE (Fondation Camerounaise d'Actions Rationalisees et de Formation sur l'Environnement). The meeting was held to discuss a wide array of topics, including the monitoring of the pipeline activities, environmental and social compensation plans, CAPECE's capacity building objectives and the involvement of NGOs.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01210/WEB/0__CO-21.HTM|title=Stakeholders Come together in Cameroon to share Project information|publisher=[[World Bank Group]]|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Environmental Defense]]
*[[Friends of the Earth]]
[[Friends of the Earth]] is a transnational [[grassroots]] environmental network. The organization brings together and mobilizes social and environmental advocacy groups from all over the world to rally behind certain issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are |title=FOE:Who We Are |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502030212/http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are |archivedate=2 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While FOE has been involved in documentation and monitoring of pipeline project since its construction, the organization more recently developed a report in 2008 condemning a [[World Bank]] initiative for "New Climate Funds". Along with four other advocacy organizations, FOE stated that the World Bank had repeatedly engaged in projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, that actually negatively affected the environment and only added to pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.foe.org/pressRelease.jsp?press_release_KEY=427|title=World Bank Climate Initiatives Come Under Fire|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://www.cedcameroun.org/ Centre pour L'Environnement et le Developpement]
The Center for Environment and Development is a Cameroon-based NGO founded and run by native lawyer [[Samuel Nguiffo]]. The CED's main purpose is to advocate and campaign against the "liquidation of the regions forests for short-term profit". Certain exploitations within the Cameroon region include logging, hunting for bushmeat, mining for natural resources and the construction of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The CED works to inform local communities about their rights to land and community forest concessions, as well as constant documentation and publications to educate the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/138|title=Samuel Nguiffo|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615064817/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/138|archivedate=15 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Catholic Relief Services]]
[[Catholic Relief Services]], an international nonprofit humanitarian organization, has been one of the key watchdogs in the pipeline project, even before construction was completed. In a statement made in October 2003, they stated their concerns for the people and environment of both Chad and Cameroon, and anticipated negative effects of the pipeline for the future. One of their main concerns for the project was the potential mismanagement of profit funds by Chad and Cameroon, as well as the ineffectiveness of policies mandated by the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES STATEMENT ON THE LAUNCH OF CHAD-CAMEROON OIL PIPELINE PROJECT, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cameroon Chad Pipeline Monitoring Project is an initiative created by CRS that supports the efforts of Cameroonian NGOs as they advocate for proper use of profits from the pipeline, as well as the communities and environment surrounding the pipeline. One of the main efforts of the [[Catholic Relief Services]] has been to review and correct compensation packages received by those located along the pipeline, as well as advocating for fair salaries for local workers contracted by the oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicrelief.org/cameroon/pipeline/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112224324/http://www.catholicrelief.org/cameroon/pipeline/ |archivedate=2011-01-12 |df= }} Cameroon Chad Pipeline Monitoring Project&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical waste''' is a [[Waste types|waste]] that is made from harmful chemicals (mostly [[industrial waste|produced by large factories]]). Chemical waste may fall under regulations such as [[COSHH]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or the [[Clean Water Act]] and [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] in the [[United States]]. In the U.S., the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]], as well as state and local regulations also regulate chemical use and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollutionequipment-digital.com/pollutionequipment/20100405/?pg=17#pg13|title=Techniques for Efficient Hazardous Chemicals Handling and Disposal|date=April–May 2010|page=13.|access-date=10 March 2016|author=Hallam, Bill|work=Pollution Equipment News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical waste may or may not be classed as [[hazardous waste]]. A '''chemical hazardous waste''' is a solid, [[liquid]], or [[gas]]eous material that displays either a “Hazardous Characteristic” or is specifically “listed” by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, [[Corrosive|Corrosivity]], Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/media_files/docs/pdf/wastesectionupdatefinal.pdf|title=LABORATORY CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Environmental Health and Radiation Safety University of Pennsylvania|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the [[Safety data sheet|Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)]], Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Waste - Disposal of Laboratory Wastes (GUIDANCE) {{!}} Current Staff {{!}} University of St Andrews|url = https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/policy/healthandsafety/publications/waste/waste-disposaloflaboratorywastesguidance/|website = www.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidance for Disposal of Laboratory Chemical Wastes ==
In the laboratory, chemical wastes are usually segregated on-site into appropriate waste [[carboy]]s, and disposed by a specialist contractor in order to meet safety, health, and legislative requirements.
[[File:Chemical Waste Disposal Guideline.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Chemical waste category that should be followed for proper packaging, labelling, and disposal of chemical waste.]]
Innocuous aqueous waste (such as solutions of [[sodium chloride]]) may be poured down the sink. Some chemicals are washed down with excess water.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This includes: concentrated and dilute [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s, harmless soluble inorganic salts (all drying agents), [[alcohol]]s containing salts, hypochlorite solutions, fine (tlc grade) [[Silicate|silica]] and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. [[Aqueous solution|Aqueous]] waste containing toxic compounds are collected separately.

Waste [[mercury (element)|elemental mercury]], spent [[acid]]s and [[Alkali|bases]] may be collected separately for [[recycling]].

Waste [[organic solvents]] are separated into [[Organochloride|chlorinated]] and non-chlorinated solvent waste. Chlorinated solvent waste is usually incinerated at high temperature to minimize the formation of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shibamoto|first=T|year=2007|title=Dioxin formation from waste incineration.|journal=Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology|volume=190|pages=1–41|pmid=17432330|author2=Yasuhara, A|author3=Katami, T}}&lt;!--|access-date=10 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/waste_management/l28072_en.htm|title=Waste incineration|last=Europa|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-chlorinated solvent waste can be burned for [[energy recovery]].

In contrast to this, chemical materials on the "Red List" should never be washed down a drain. This list includes:&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; compounds with transitional metals, [[biocide]]s, [[cyanide]]s, [[mineral oil]]s and [[hydrocarbon]]s, poisonous [[organosilicon]] compounds, metal phosphides, [[phosphorus]] element, and [[fluoride]]s and [[nitrite]]s.

Moreover, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) prohibits disposing certain materials down any UVM drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chemical Waste Management  {{!}} Environmental Health and Safety at UVM|url = http://www.uvm.edu/safety/lab/chemicalwaste#Selecting%2520the%2520Correct%2520Container|website = www.uvm.edu|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including [[flammable liquid]]s, liquids capable of causing damage to wastewater facilities (this can be determined by the [[pH]]), highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] materials capable of causing an obstruction in the [[wastewater]] system, [[Radioactive waste|radioactive]] materials, materials that have or create a strong odor, wastewater capable of significantly raising the temperature of the system, and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] or [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] disruptors.

Broken [[laboratory glassware|glassware]] are usually collected in plastic-lined cardboard boxes for landfilling. Due to contamination, they are usually not suitable for recycling. Similarly, used [[hypodermic needle]]s are collected as [[sharps waste|sharps]] and are incinerated as [[medical waste]].

== Chemical Compatibility Guideline ==
Many chemicals may react adversely when combined. It is recommended that incompatible chemicals be stored in separate areas of the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chemical Compatibility and Segregation Guides|url = http://orf.od.nih.gov/EnvironmentalProtection/WasteDisposal/Pages/chem_compat.aspx|website = orf.od.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acids]] should be separated from [[alkalis]], [[metals]], [[cyanides]], [[sulfides]], [[azides]], [[phosphides]], and [[Oxidise|oxidizers]]. The reason being, when combined acids with these type of compounds, violent [[exothermic reaction]] can occur possibly causing [[Flammability|flammable gas]], and in some cases [[Explosion|explosions.]]

[[Oxidizing agent|Oxidizers]] should be separated from [[acid]]s, [[Organic matter|organic materials]], [[metal]]s, [[reducing agent]]s, and [[ammonia]]. This is because when combined [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizers]] with these type of compounds, inflammable, and sometimes [[toxic]] compounds can occur.

=== Container compatibility ===
When disposing hazardous laboratory chemical waste, chemical compatibility must be considered. For safe disposal, the container must be chemically compatible with the material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid. [[Acids]] or [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] should not be stored in [[metal]]. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] should not store in [[glass]]. [[Gasoline]] ([[solvents]]) should not store or transport in lightweight [[polyethylene]] containers such as milk jugs. Moreover, the Chemical Compatibility Guidelines should be considered for more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Store and Dispose of Hazardous Chemical Waste|url = http://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/research-lab/hazardous-waste/chemical.html#Select-compatible-containers|website = blink.ucsd.edu|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory waste containers ==
Packaging, labelling, storage are the three requirements for disposing chemical waste.

=== Packaging&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Requirements|url = http://www.ehs.utoronto.ca/resources/wmindex/wm4.htm|website = www.ehs.utoronto.ca|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
[[File:Chemical Waste Area.jpg|thumb|How to properly label, package, and store chemical waste safely.]]
For packaging, chemical liquid waste containers should only be filled up to 75% capacity to allow for [[Vapor|vapour expansion]] and to reduce potential spills which could occur from moving overfilled containers. Container material must be compatible with the stored [[hazardous waste]]. Finally, wastes must not be packaged in containers that improperly identify other nonexisting hazards.

In addition to the general packaging requirements mentioned above, incompatible materials should never be mixed together in a single container. Wastes must be stored in containers compatible with the chemicals stored as mentioned in the container compatibility section. [[Solvent]] safety cans should be used to collect and temporarily store large volumes (10–20 litres) of [[Flammability|flammable]] organic waste [[solvent]]s, precipitates, [[solid]]s or other non-fluid wastes should not be mixed into safety cans.

=== Labelling ===
Label all containers with the group name from the chemical waste category and an itemized list of the contents. All chemicals or anything contaminated with chemicals posing a significant hazard. All waste must be appropriately packaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laboratory|first=National Research Council (US) Committee on Prudent Practices in the|date=2011-01-01|title=Management of Waste|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55885/|language=en|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage ===
When storing chemical wastes, the containers must be in good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. [[Hazardous waste]] must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory and should not be allowed to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chem.wisc.edu/deptfiles/docs/lab-waste-disposal-portrait.pdf|title=Laboratory Waste Disposal|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. [[Snap cap]]s, mis-sized caps, [[parafilm]] and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible [[hazardous wastes]], such as [[acids]] and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/sgs/current/chem_waste.pdf|title=PROCEDURES FOR LABORATORY CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Memorial University|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping of chemical waste in the United States==
[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov |title=SIS Specialized Information System |author= |work= |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA)  [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government.  TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov |title=Toxnet |author= |work= |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other 
authoritative sources.

==Chemical waste in Canadian aquaculture ==
Chemical waste in our oceans is becoming a major issue for marine life. There have been many studies conducted to try and prove the effects of chemicals in our oceans. In Canada, many of the studies concentrated on the Atlantic provinces, where fishing and aquaculture are an important part of the economy. 
In New Brunswick, a study was done on the [[sea urchin]] in an attempt to identify the effects of toxic and chemical waste on life beneath the ocean, specifically the waste from salmon farms. Sea urchins were used to check the levels of metals in the environment. It is advantageous to use green sea urchins, [[Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis]], because they are widely distributed, abundant in many locations, and easily accessible. By investigating the concentrations of metals in the green sea urchins, the impacts of chemicals from [[Aquaculture of salmonids|salmon aquaculture]] activity could be assessed and detected. Samples were taken at 25-metre intervals along a transect in the direction of the main tidal flow. The study found that there was impacts to at least 75&amp;nbsp;m based on the intestine metal concentrations. So based on this study it is clear that the metals are contaminating the ocean and negatively affecting aquatic life.

[[Image:Underside.JPG|thumb|Green Sea Urchin or S. droebacheinsis'']]

==Uranium in Ground and Surface Water in Canada==
Another issue regarding chemical waste is the potential risk of surface and groundwater contamination by the heavy metals and [[radionuclides]] leached from uranium waste-rock piles (UWRP) A Radionuclide is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. Uranium waste-rock piles refers to [[Uranium mining]], which is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. An example of such threats is in Saskatchewan, Uranium mining and ore processing (milling) can pose a threat to the environment. In open pit mining, large amounts of materials are excavated and disposed off in waste-rock piles. Waste-rock piles from the [[Uranium mining]] industry can contain several heavy metals and contaminants that may become mobile under certain conditions. Environmental contaminants may include [[acid mine drainage]], higher concentrations of radionuclides, and non-radioactive metals/metalloids (i.e. As, Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn).

The leachability of heavy metals and radionuclide from UWRP plays a significant role in determining their potential environmental risks to surrounding surface and groundwater. Substantial differences in the solid-phase partitioning and chemical leachability of Ni and U were observed in the investigated UWRP lithological materials and background organic-rich lake sediment. For Instance, in the uranium-mining district of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, the sequential extraction results showed that a significant amount of Ni ([[Nickel]]) was present in the non-labile residual fraction, while Uranium was mostly distributed in the moderately labile fractions. Although Nickel was much less labile than Uranium, the observed Nickel exceeded Uranium concentrations in [[Leaching model (soil)|leaching]]]]. The observed Nickel and Uranium concentrations were relatively high in the underlying organic-rich lake sediment. Expressed as the percentage of total metal content, potential leachability decreased in the order U &gt; Ni. Data suggest that these elements could potentially migrate to the water table below the UWRP. Detailed information regarding the solid-phase distribution of [[contaminant]]s in the UWRP is critical to understand the potential for their environmental transport and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/waterres/cycle/groundwater/well/uranium.html|title=Uranium in Well Water - Water Resources Management|first=Department of Municipal Affairs and|last=Environment|date=|website=www.env.gov.nl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], the [[kei car|''kei'' car]] is a specific type of small car. The term [[microcar]] is loosely used for very small cars, some of which overlap city car classification.

==Internal combustion engine city cars==

===Early history===
The original concept for the city car came about as a result of the growing market for entry level vehicles in the 1920s and 1930s. The  [[Great Depression]] caused the market for large, luxurious vehicles to collapse. As a result, manufacturers had no choice but to build small, cheap vehicles that people could afford, similar to early 20th century "[[runabout (car)|runabouts]]". However, these vehicles were not specifically branded as vehicles to use in cities or congested areas. They were purely for use as [[People's Car (disambiguation)|people's car]]s; cars designed to be cheap, sell a large number of units, and put people who had not owned cars on wheels. A number of these small, cheap cars were sold before the [[World War II|Second World War]], including the 1920s [[Austin 7]], 1930s [[Fiat 500 "Topolino"]] and the 1940s [[Crosley]]. 

After the Second World War, a number of manufacturers introduced [[microcar]]s, which contained many of the elements that City Cars would come to be known for, such as small size and good maneuverability. Microcars were also among the first cars to marketed on their good parking ability; for example, Iso, and later BMW used the [[Isetta]]'s front hinged door as a marketing advantage, saying you could pull into a parallel parking spot nose forward and exit onto the sidewalk using the door.

Some of these early city cars included the [[Bond Minicar]] and [[AC Cars|AC]] [[AC Petite|Petite]] in Britain; the [[Isetta|Iso Isetta]] in Italy in 1953; the [[Fulda (car)|Fulda]], [[Messerschmitt#Post-war|Messerschmitt]] [[Messerschmitt KR175|Kabinenroller]], and [[Brütsh]] in Germany in 1954 (all two-seaters with a [[Fulda and Sachs]] [[Two-cycle engine|two-stroke]] engine); the [[Goggomobil]], and the  [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]]-designed [[Zündapp]] [[Zündapp Janus|Janus]],&lt;ref name="Casucci"&gt;Casucci, Piero.  "City Cars: The Answer to the World's Traffic Problems?", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Vol. 4, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; which placed passengers back to back, and featured two front hinged doors similar to the Isetta's. However, these early microcars weren't true city cars; most were designed, built, and sold cheaply, mainly for poor customers in war ravaged Europe. With the exception of a few examples, these were also not designed for specific use in cities.

[[File:1970 Fiat 500 L -- 2011 DC 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fiat 500]]]]
As the European economy improved, Fiat launched the new [[Fiat 500|500]] in 1957 and in 1959, [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] would introduce its well-known city car, the [[Mini]]. [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] joined Italian motoring magazine [[Quattroruote]] and Turin [[coachbuilder]] [[Officine Stampaggi Industriali|OSI]] to produce the DAF - OSI Citi Car, which used [[DAF Daffodil|Daffodil]] mechanicals and interior, and was one of the first cars with a continuously variable transmission.&lt;ref name="Casucci2"&gt;Casucci, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were other new projects from 1969 through 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Casucci, pp. 384–85.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, [[Daihatsu]] proffered an electric model, while [[Toyota]] showed the ''Town Spider'', with a choice of petrol or electric power,&lt;ref&gt;Casucci, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Motors]] displayed three two-seaters, one electric, one gasoline, and one hybrid. The GM products were capable of only {{convert|0|-|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15 seconds and {{convert|30|-|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} maximum, not good enough for normal city driving, nor could they meet the safety regulations which would be introduced in 1974.&lt;ref name="Casucci3"&gt;Casucci, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of these cars can be considered city cars today, these cars have been replaced by larger cars with each passing generation.  Exceptions are the smaller [[Fiat]]s, especially the 1957 [[Fiat 500]] and [[Fiat 126|126]].  They were in the region of {{convert|3.0|m|ftin|0}} in length, but had seating for four people, putting them outside the microcar category. In the 1970s the [[Citroën LNA]] and related three-door [[Peugeot 104]] offered compact city sized cars of around 3.3&amp;nbsp;m, and the [[Fiat Panda]] followed in 1980.

In Japan, regulations defining [[kei car]]s were established on 8 July 1949. Production of compliant vehicles started around 1955–1958 by [[Daihatsu]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], [[Subaru]], and [[Suzuki]].

===The boom===
[[File:2008 Smart ForTwo Passion convertible -- 04-22-2011 2.jpg|thumb|2008 [[Smart Fortwo]] convertible]]

In the late 1980s, superminis had physically grown so much that many buyers wanted even smaller four-seat cars.  In Japan, buyers had a wide selection to choose from in passenger cars, [[microvan]] and [[kei truck]]s, such as the [[Honda Today]] and the [[Honda Acty]], [[Subaru Sambar]] and [[Subaru Vivio]], [[Daihatsu Atrai]] and [[Daihatsu Mira]], [[Mitsubishi Minica]] and [[Mitsubishi Minicab]], and the [[Suzuki Fronte]] and [[Suzuki Wagon R]]. In Europe a number of small cars were launched, including the [[Autobianchi Y10|Lancia Y10]] ({{convert|3390|mm|ftin|0}} long) in 1985 and the [[Renault Twingo]] in 1993, which featured a [[multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]]-like design and interior room, despite its size and height {{convert|3430|mm|ftin|0}} long and {{convert|1420|mm|ftin|0}} tall.  Combined with an original exterior and interior design, it quickly became a best-seller, although it was not officially imported to right-hand drive markets including the United Kingdom. However, the [[Fiat Cinquecento]], launched towards the end of 1991, was made for right-hand drive markets, and was hugely popular.

In 1996, the [[Ford Ka]] was presented with its radical [[New Edge]] design. Its egg-shaped body did not leave much room in the rear seats, but many customers did not need them and preferred the Ka over more conservative designs. It was especially popular with British buyers.

During the second half of the 1990s, [[South Korea]]n brands [[Daewoo]] and [[Hyundai]] introduced their city car entries, both for the [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an markets.  The [[Hyundai Atos]], launched in 1997, was {{convert|3500|mm|ftin|0}} long and {{convert|1600|mm|ftin|0}} high, which was much taller than any European models (usually under {{convert|1450|mm|ftin|0}}) and provided considerable interior space.  Its boxy shape provoked mixed reactions. The [[Daewoo Matiz]] followed in 1998 with a [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] design and a moderate height ({{convert|1500|mm|ftin|0}}). These Korean city cars were much cheaper than most of the European models, especially the [[Opel Agila|Opel/Vauxhall Agila]] (2000), a badge engineered [[Suzuki Wagon R]], [[Volkswagen Lupo]] (1999) and the two-seater [[Smart Fortwo]] (1998). By the year 2000, city cars had increased massively in popularity with buyers in the space of a decade.

===Larger city cars===

[[File:SimpCit 2.JPG|thumb|SimpCit, electric city car.]]
As [[small family car]]s and [[supermini]]s grew in the 1990s to the 2000s, so did city cars.  After some new superminis grew to be over {{convert|3900|mm|ftin|0}} long (like the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Opel Corsa]], the [[SEAT Ibiza]] and the [[Volkswagen Polo]]), some automakers developed city car models more than {{convert|3650|mm|ftin|0}} long. The first of these models was the [[Nissan Micra]] (2002), which is {{convert|3720|mm|ftin|0}} long and smaller than many superminis of the late 1990s. Other cars are the [[Citroën C2]], [[Suzuki Cultus|Suzuki Swift]], [[Smart Forfour]], [[Tata Indica]], and [[Peugeot 1007]] (the last one which can also be labelled as a [[mini MPV]]). Fiat launched their new [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BEST CITY CAR: Fiat 500|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-reviews/38490/best-city-car|website=Auto Express|accessdate=8 January 2015|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007, somewhat bigger than the first 500, but still only {{convert|3546|mm|ftin|0}} long.

In addition, since the 2000s there has been a return of smaller city cars with lengths well under 3,200&amp;nbsp;mm such as the [[Tata Nano]] and [[Toyota iQ]]. Slightly larger, but still around 3,300&amp;nbsp;mm city cars released in the 2010s include the electric [[Bolloré Bluecar]] and [[Mitsubishi i-MiEV]], and traditionally powered [[BYD F0]], [[Citroën C1]] and related [[Toyota Aygo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best city cars|url=http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/recommended/best-city-cars|website=Car Buyer|accessdate=8 January 2015|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first announcement was an excess of events recorded after 56 days&lt;ref name=NN-2010-02-26/&gt; Juan Collar, who presented the results to a conference at the University of California, was quoted: "If it's real, we're looking at a very beautiful dark-matter signal".&lt;ref name=NN-2010-02-26&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100226/full/news.2010.97.html|title=A CoGeNT result in the hunt for dark matter|author=Eric Hand|publisher=Nature News|date=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Results from a Search for Light-Mass Dark Matter with a P-type Point Contact Germanium Detector |author=C.

This signal conflicts with other searches that have failed to find any evidence, such as [[XENON]] and [[Large Underground Xenon experiment|LUX]] but appears to confirm results from [[DAMA/LIBRA|DAMA]].

They observed an annual modulation in the event rate that could indicate light dark matter.&lt;ref name=Dacey2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=James Dacey |title=CoGeNT findings support dark-matter halo theory |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jun/15/cogent-findings-support-dark-matter-halo-theory |publisher=physicsworld |date=June 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However more recent work has shown that the excess of events attributed to a tentative dark matter signal was in fact due to an underestimated background from surface events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Jonathan|last2=McCabe|first2=Christopher|last3=Boehm|first3=Celine|title=Quantifying the evidence for Dark Matter in CoGeNT data|journal=JCAP|date=August 2014|volume=1408|page=014|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2014/08/014|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2014/08/014|arxiv=1405.0495|bibcode=2014JCAP...08..014D}}&lt;/ref&gt; After accounting for this background there is no evidence for a signal in data from the CoGeNT experiment and no tension with null results from other experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Aalseth|first1=C.E.|title=Maximum Likelihood Signal Extraction Method Applied to 3.4 years of CoGeNT Data|date=5 Feb 2015|arxiv=1401.6234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Jonathan|title=The Past and Future of Light Dark Matter Direct Detection|journal=Int.

In [[aerodynamics]], '''compression lift''' refers to an [[aircraft]] that uses [[shock wave]]s generated by its own [[supersonic]] flight to generate [[Lift (force)|lift]]. This can lead to dramatic improvements in lift for [[supersonic]]/[[hypersonic]] aircraft. [[Clarence Syvertson]] and [[Alfred J. Eggers]] discovered this phenomenon in 1956 as they analyzed abnormalities at the reentry of [[nuclear warhead]]s.&lt;ref name="Compression Lift"&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/design.shtml Compression Lift]&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic concept of compression lift is well known; "planing" boats reduce drag by "surfing" on their own [[bow wave|bow wake]] in exactly the same fashion. Using this effect in aircraft is more difficult, however, because the "wake" is not generated until supersonic speeds are reached, and is highly angled. Aircraft have to be carefully shaped to take full advantage of this effect. In addition the angle of the [[shock wave]]s varies greatly with speed, making it even more difficult to design a craft that gains significant lift over a wide range of speeds.

To date the only potential production aircraft that used compression lift has been the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB-70]] in the 1960s, although  with the cancellation of the program after only two prototypes had been built, it ended up being a testbed only. The compression lift decreased the [[induced drag]] of the XB-70 about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060103171730/http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950002360_1995102360.pdf North American Rockwell, NASA-CR-115702, B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report, Vol.III, NASA, 1972. pp. III-233-236 25 MB]&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher speed designs using compression lift, [[waverider]]s, remain an interesting possibility for [[hypersonic]] vehicle designs, although only testbed models have been flown.&lt;ref name="Compression Lift"/&gt; The [[Boeing X-51]] ([[WaveRider]]) also uses compression lift.

'''Conradson carbon residue''', commonly known as "Concarbon" or "CCR" is a laboratory test used to provide an indication of the [[petroleum coke|coke]]-forming tendencies of an oil. Quantitatively, the test measures the amount of carbonaceous residue remaining after the oil's [[evaporation]] and [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humboldt Testing Equipment|title=Conradson Carbon Residue Apparatus|url=http://www.humboldtmfg.com/conradson_carbon_residue_apparatus.html|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merriam-Webster|title=Conradson Carbon Test.|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conradson%20carbon%20test|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Standards Organization|title=Petroleum products – Determination of carbon residue – Conradson method|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=20865|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the test is applicable to petroleum products which are relatively non-volatile, and which decompose on distillation at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name=ASTM&gt;{{cite web|last1=ASTM International|title=Standard Test Method for Conradson Carbon Residue of Petroleum Products|url=http://www.pentasflora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/D189-Carbon-Residue.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Conradson carbon residue" and its common names can refer to either the test or the numerical value obtained from it.

==Test method==
A quantity of sample is weighed, placed in a crucible, and subjected to destructive distillation. During a fixed period of severe heating, the residue undergoes [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] and coking reactions . At the termination of the heating period, the crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is cooled in a desiccator and weighed. The residue remaining is calculated as a percentage of the original sample, and reported as Conradson carbon residue.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;

==Applications==
* For burner fuel, Concarbon provides an approximation of the tendency of the fuel to form deposits in vaporizing pot-type and sleeve-type burners.&lt;ref name="ASTM" /&gt;
* For [[diesel fuel]], Concarbon correlates approximately with combustion chamber deposits, provided that alkyl nitrates are absent, or if present, that the test is performed on the base fuel without additive.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;
*For [[motor oil]], Concarbon was once regarded as indicative of the amount of carbonaceous deposits the oil would form in the combustion chamber of an engine. This is now considered to be of doubtful significance due to the presence of additives in many oils.&lt;ref name="ASTM" /&gt;
* For [[gas oil]], Concarbon provides a useful correlation in the manufacture of gas there from.&lt;ref name="ASTM" /&gt;
* For [[delayed coker]]s, the Concarbon of the feed correlates positively to the amount of coke that will be produced.&lt;ref name=Coking&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colorado School of Mines|title=Delayed Coking|url=http://processengr.com/pdf_documents/co_school_mines_coker_chp5.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Shabron, John  |author2=Speight, James G.|title=Correlation between Carbon Residue and Molecular Weight|url=https://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/42_2_SAN%20FRANCISCO_04-97_0386.pdf|publisher=Western Research Institute|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given two interacting atoms A and B, the '''cophonicity''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|f|oʊ|ˈ|n|ɪ|s|ɪ|t|i}}) of the A-B atomic pair is a measure of the overlap of the A and B contributions to a specific range of vibrational frequencies. In the field of [[condensed matter physics]], cophonicity is a metric aimed at the parametrization of the dynamical interactions in terms of the atomic types forming the A-B pair.

[[File:Cophonicity definition.png|alt=Definition of cophonicity metric|thumb|400x400px|The cophonicity of a generic A-B atomic pair is a measure of the overlap of the single atomic contributions to a specific range of vibrational frequencies.]]
Considering the phonon density of states (pDOS) &lt;math&gt;g(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; in the first [[Brillouin zone]], the [[Moment (mathematics)|center mass]] &lt;math&gt;CM^A&lt;/math&gt; of the atom-projected pDOS &lt;math&gt;g^A\left(\omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; of an atom A is defined as

&lt;math&gt;
CM^A=\frac{\int\limits_{\omega_0}\limits^{\omega_1}\omega g^A\left(\omega\right) d\omega}{\int\limits_{\omega_0}\limits^{\omega_1} g^A\left(\omega\right)d\omega}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g^A\left(\omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the contribution of the atom A to &lt;math&gt;g(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;; the total density of states of the solid is &lt;math&gt;g(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as

&lt;math&gt;
g(\omega)=\sum_X{g^X\left(\omega\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

and obtained by summing over all atoms X of the unit cell. The integration interval &lt;math&gt;[\omega_0,\omega_1]&lt;/math&gt; is chosen in such a way that it encompasses all the phonon states relevant for the specific study. The integral at the denominator of the definition of &lt;math&gt;CM^A&lt;/math&gt; is the contribution of the atom A to the states in the frequency range &lt;math&gt;[\omega_0,\omega_1]&lt;/math&gt;; we call such quantity the ''phonicity of the A atom'' in that specific frequency range. The phonicity of an atom then represents the amount of phonon states that such atom contributes to form; in this respect, it can be regarded as the phonon counterpart of the atomic valence, that is the number of electrons with which an atom participates to form the electronic states of the system, counted as the integral of the atom-projected electronic density of states.

Let's consider a generic A-B atomic pair. The relative position &lt;math&gt;C_{ph}\text{(A-B)}&lt;/math&gt; of the center mass of &lt;math&gt;g^A\left(\omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the center mass of &lt;math&gt;g^B\left(\omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; is given as

&lt;math&gt;C_{ph}\text{(A-B)}=CM^A-CM^B&lt;/math&gt;

which is specified in the same units of the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. A positive (negative) sign of &lt;math&gt;C_{ph}\text{(A-B)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the A (B) atom contributes more to the high frequency modes of the specified range. The smaller is &lt;math&gt;|C_{ph}\text{(A-B)}|&lt;/math&gt;, the higher is the mixing of the A and B contributions to the frequency band, and the two atoms have the same weight in the determination of the modes specific of the considered energy range. We define the quantity &lt;math&gt;C_{ph}\text{(A-B)}&lt;/math&gt; as the ''cophonicity of the A-B atomic pair'', in analogy with the A-B [[Covalent bond|bond covalency]] definition formulated in terms of atomic contributions to the electronic density of states.&lt;ref name="covmetr" /&gt;

Cophonicity is then a characteristic of a specific atomic pair found in a system. According to the metric introduced above, &lt;math&gt;C_{ph}\text{(A-B)}=0&lt;/math&gt; would indicate a ''perfect cophonocity'', that is an equal participation of both atomic species to the formation of the phonon states in the considered range of energies.

The comparison between two cophonicity values, obtained considering distinct atomic couples embedded in two structures with different connectivity, will provide meaningful information under certain conditions. For example, &lt;math&gt;C_{ph}\text{(Mo-S)}&lt;/math&gt; in molybdenum disulfide  bulk and nanoclusters, despite calculated in the same frequency range, could refer to distinct sets of vibrational modes; this is due to the distinct topologies that, in turn, determine different electronic environments. In this case, any change of the cophonicity by means of substitutional defects could lead to non-correlated changes of the vibrational frequencies. However, if the two structures with distinct topologies are connected by [[Transformation (function)|continuous geometric transformations]], also the electronic environment of the atomic pairs, thus the vibrational frequencies and the associated modes, are related by such continuous transformations; in this case, the cophonicity of a specific atomic pair in one structure can be mapped into the cophonicity of the second one, granting the transferability of the definition, hence the reliability of the cophonicity comparison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">The '''Danelectro Commando''' is a combo [[guitar amplifier]] manufactured by [[Danelectro]] from 1954 to 1960. There is some evidence that it may be one of the many different amplifiers used by [[Little Walter]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.littlewalter.net/LWequipment.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuitry of this 30-watt amplifier is typical of its day, with a [[5Y3]] rectifier tube, one [[12AX7]] preamp tube, one [[12AX7]] for phase inversion, a [[6SN7]] additional gain stage,  four [[6V6]] power tubes, and a [[6SJ7]] (1954-1958) or a [[6AU6]] (1958-1960) for the built-in vibrato unit. What makes it unique is the cabinet. Employing a "suitcase" design, it contains eight 8-inch Rola 10610 alnicos speakers wired series / parallel in two arrays one in either side of the suitcase, with the amplifier and controls located at the top and bottom of one side.  The suitcase opens out so that both sides face forwards.

When closed, the amplifier is 22" × 22" x 10". It weighs 38&amp;nbsp;lbs, relatively lightweight for a valve combo amplifier.

The same amplifier was made by Danelectro under the following names: Danelectro Commando Model 88, Silvertone 1337, Montgomery Ward 35JDR8419, Montgomery Ward 55JDR8437, Montgomery Ward Airline 85GDR8518 where the first two letters of the Montgomery Ward code backwards represent the first year of design/production (but with the 35JDR8419 only being available in 1954). The schematic is readily available on the web under the name Montgomery Ward GDR 8517a.

The '''Dugi Archeological Site''' is a prehistoric [[latte stone]] site on the north side of [[Rota (island)|Rota Island]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].  The site is a rare inland site that survived the intensive sugar cane development introduced by the Japanese during the [[South Pacific Mandate]] period of the 1920s and 1930s.  It consists of sixteen deteriorated latte stone structures on three high terraces.  Some of the latte stones have fallen over and others are missing features normally found at these sites.&lt;ref name=desc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/basch/uhnpscesu/htms/parkrota/pt4.htm|title=Draft Reconnaissance Survey, Island of Rota: Resource Significance|publisher=National Park Service (via the University of Hawaii)|accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

In the UK, an electricity supplier is a [[Electricity retailing|retailer of electricity]]. For each [[Meter Point Administration Number|supply point]] the supplier has to pay the various costs of [[National Grid (UK)|transmission]], [[Distribution Network Operator|distribution]], meter operation, data collection, tax etc. The supplier then adds in energy costs and the supplier's own charge.

== MSP and GSP ==

MSP kWh is the amount of electricity consumed at the 'meter supply point', which is the customer's meter. GSP kWh is obtained by multiplying the MSP kWh by the Line Loss Factor (LLF, a figure &gt; 1) to include the amount of electricity lost when it is conducted through the distribution network, from the 'grid supply point' to the customer's meter. Some kWh elements of the bill are charged at MSP and some at GSP. The LLF for a particular supply depends on the DNO and the supply's characteristics and the time and date (day of week, season etc.).

== The bill ==
The consumer pays the supplier according to an agreed tariff, possibly including pass-through costs. A pass-through cost is a cost that is charged to the energy supplier, but is then "passed through" directly to the consumer.

===Transmission charges===
{{main|National Grid (UK)#Transmission costs}}

Transmission charges, known as "Transmission Network Use of System" (TNUoS), are paid to [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] to cover the expense of running the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgrideso.com/charging/transmission-network-use-system-tnuos-charges|title=Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS) charges|last=|first=|date=|website=National Grid ESO|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge is calculated annually using the [[National Grid (UK)#Triad demand|TRIAD]] method for large levels of demand, or based on usage between 4pm and 7pm for smaller demand levels.

====RCRC====
Residual Cashflow Reallocation Cashflow (RCRC), also known as the 'beer fund', is the net remainder of Balancing &amp; Settlement Code (BSC) Trading Charges for a given half-hour, which is payable to (in the case of a surplus) or by (in the case of a deficit) Trading Parties based on their market share of energy volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elexon.co.uk/pages/creditandpricing.aspx |title=Credit and Pricing |author=Elexon |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Trading Charges consist of:

*Information Imbalance Charges – A charge per MWh on the difference between a BM Unit's Metered Volume and its Expected Metered Volume (based on Final Physical Notification plus Balancing Services Volume). Due to a zero price, this charge is always zero
*System Operator BM Cashflow – A cashflow payable to or by the System Operator depending on whether BM Unit Cashflow plus Non-Delivery Charges is positive or negative, and is intended to keep BSCCo cash neutral
*Non-Delivery Charges – A charge levied on the Lead Parties of BM Units that fail to satisfy a Bid-Offer Acceptance on the Balancing Mechanism
*BM Unit Cashflow – A cashflow payable to or by Lead Parties of BM Units with Bid-Offer Acceptances
*Imbalance Charges – A cashflow payable to or by Trading Parties with an Imbalance Volume

As Information Imbalance Charges are always zero, and System Operator BM Cashflow nets with Non-Delivery Charges and BM Unit Cashflow to zero, RCRC is effectively the net of Imbalance Cashflows.

===Distribution charges===
The distribution charges, known as the "distribution use of system" (DUoS) charges, are paid to suppliers and passed on to the [[distribution network operator]] (DNO) on whose network the [[Meter Point Administration Number|meter point]] is located.&lt;ref&gt;Professional Cost Management Group, [http://www.pcmg.co.uk/services/energy/duos-distribution-use-of-system/ DUOS: Distribution Use of System], accessed 23 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The charges cover:

====Availability====
Supply availability, otherwise known as "supply capacity" or "kVA", if represented by its measured units, is the maximum kVA power allowed for a particular supply in a particular network and is set before the supply is energised. It is a figure agreed between the consumer and the supplier (set to a level required by the consumer in almost all cases except where power distribution may be physically limited to the supply) at the start of the contract. This supply availability is charged for every month, in effect as a standing charge, despite the fact that the maximum demand recorded in the month may be lower. If the kVA supply availability figure is exceeded (breached, in effect) by the value of the measured monthly maximum demand, also in kVA for this purpose, the higher figure of kVA from the maximum demand may be charged instead of the supply capacity. The new elevated kVA charge figure (or the supplier's nearest higher capacity band figure, if capacity is only allowed in banded levels 50 kVA apart for instance) may stay as the chargeable figure for twelve months depending on the electricity distribution area. This can cause temporary unnecessary high billing, as if a penalty, if the breach was avoidable. Alternatively, the capacity charge can just return to the original availability figure in the subsequent month's bill. Determining the correct capacity figure to allow for the maximum demand required for the supply can be a fine judgement if the capacity charge is to be kept to a minimum, and vigilance of maximum demand and efforts to keep the power demand lower than the agreed capacity can be required to avoid triggering a higher capacity charge during the contract.

•	Unit rates – these rates are split into 3 time periods; Red, Amber and Green. These charges vary per distribution company. The chart below shows the applicable time bands for each company.

====Reactive power====
This also varies with each distribution area, and is charged if the [[power factor]] for a supply is deemed too low.

==== Fixed charge ====
The fixed charge is in units of pence / [[MPAN]] / day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = WPD | title = WPD Use of System Charging Statement | url = http://www.westernpower.co.uk/docs/system-charges/LC14-v6-5-SWEB-Final-13-14.aspx | accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New DUoS charges will come into effect on 1 April 2018 under a proposal known as DCP228. Green and amber rates will rise and red rates will fall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.exchangeutility.co.uk/what-is-dcp228/ How will DCP 228 affect business energy?], accessed 23 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate Change Levy ===
{{main|Climate Change Levy}}

The Climate Change Levy is a p/kWh tax on certain electricity use. Exempt supplies include domestic supplies and supplies using less than the ''[[de minimis]]'' threshold of 1,000 kWh / month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = HM Revenue &amp; Customs

  | accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables Obligation===
{{main|Renewables Obligation (United Kingdom)}}

Suppliers meet the Renewables Obligation by submitting a certain number of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) each year to Ofgem, which demonstrates that the certified electricity has come from a renewable source. If a supplier is unable to produce the required number of ROCs, they must pay an equivalent cash amount, the 'cash out price'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro/about-ro |title=About the RO |author=Ofgem |accessdate=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy charge===
Energy charges pay per kWh (kilo watt hour).

===Data collection charge===
The data collection charge is a fee paid to the [[data collector]] for determining the energy consumption of the supply.

===Meter operation charge===
The meter operation charge is a fee paid to the [[meter operator]] for installing and maintaining the meter.

===VAT===
[[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|VAT]] is payable at the [[Value added tax#EU States|standard rate]] unless the supply meets certain conditions (e.g. domestic supplies, or supplies that use less than 1000 kWh per month) in which case they are charged at the [[Value-added tax (United Kingdom)#Rates|reduced rate]] of 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = HM Revenue &amp; Customs

  | accessdate = 2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing supplier==
For a [[MPAN#PC|non-half-hourly supply]], the [[Data collector|NHHDC]] sets the change of supplier (CoS) read from a meter read, a customer read or a deemed read. A deemed read is one estimated by the NHHDC based on any previous or subsequent readings. A CoS read can be disputed up to final reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Forces on sails''' result from movement of air that interacts with [[sail]]s and gives them motive power for sailing craft, including [[sailing ship]]s, [[sailboat]]s, [[Windsurfing|windsurfers]], [[ice boat]]s, and [[Land sailing|sail-powered land vehicles]]. Similar principles in a rotating frame of reference apply to [[Windmill sail|wind mill sails]] and [[wind turbine]] blades, which are also wind-driven. They are differentiated from [[force]]s on [[wing]]s, and [[propeller]] blades, the actions of which are not adjusted to the wind. [[Kites]] also power [[Kite boarding (disambiguation)|certain sailing craft]], but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article.

Forces on sails depend on wind speed and direction and the speed and direction of the craft. The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the "true wind" (the wind direction and speed over the surface) is called the [[point of sail]]. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the "[[apparent wind]]"—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into [[Drag (physics)|drag]]—the force component in the direction of the apparent wind—and [[Lift (force)|lift]]—the force component [[normal (geometry)|normal]] (90°) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force—resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)—and a lateral force, resisted by the underwater foils, ice runners, or wheels of the sailing craft.

For apparent wind angles aligned with the entry point of the sail, the sail acts as an [[airfoil]] and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. For apparent wind angles behind the sail, lift diminishes and drag increases as the predominant component of propulsion. For a given true wind velocity over the surface, a sail can propel a craft to a higher speed, on points of sail when the entry point of the sail is aligned with the apparent wind, than it can with the entry point not aligned, because of a combination of the diminished force from airflow around the sail and the diminished apparent wind from the velocity of the craft. Because of limitations on speed through the water, displacement sailboats generally derive power from sails generating lift on points of sail that include close-hauled through broad reach (approximately 40° to 135° off the wind). Because of low friction over the surface and high speeds over the ice that create high apparent wind speeds for most points of sail, iceboats can derive power from lift further off the wind than displacement boats.

Various mathematical models address lift and drag by taking into account the density of air, coefficients of lift and drag that result from the shape and area of the sail, and the speed and direction of the apparent wind, among other factors. This knowledge is applied to the design of sails in such a manner that sailors can adjust sails to the strength and direction of the apparent wind in order to provide motive power to sailing craft.

==Overview==
The combination of a sailing craft's speed and direction with respect to the wind, together with wind strength, generate an apparent wind velocity. When the craft is aligned in a direction where the sail can be adjusted to align with its leading edge parallel to the apparent wind, the sail acts as an airfoil to generate lift in a direction perpendicular to the apparent wind. A component of this lift pushes the craft crosswise to its course, which is resisted by a sailboat's keel, an ice boat's blades or a land-sailing craft's wheels. An important component of lift is directed forward in the direction of travel and propels the craft.

To understand forces and velocities, discussed here, one must understand what is meant by a "[[Euclidean vector|vector]]" and a "[[Scalar (physics)|scalar]]." Velocity ('''V'''), denoted as [[boldface]] in this article, is an example of a vector, because it implies both ''direction'' and ''speed''. The corresponding speed (''V'' ), denoted as ''[[italics]]'' in this article is a scalar value. Likewise, a force vector, '''F''', denotes ''direction'' and ''strength'', whereas its corresponding scalar (''F'' ) denotes strength alone. Graphically, each vector is represented with an arrow that shows direction and a length that shows speed or strength. Vectors of consistent units (e.g. '''V''' in m/s or '''F''' in [[Newton (unit)|N]]) may be added and subtracted, graphically, by positioning tips and tails of the arrows, representing the input variables and drawing the resulting derived vector.

===Components of force: lift vs. drag and driving vs. lateral force===
{{Main|Lift (force)|Lift-induced drag}}

Lift on a sail ('''L'''), acting as an [[airfoil]], occurs in a direction perpendicular to the incident airstream (the apparent wind velocity, '''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''', for the head sail) and is a result of pressure differences between the windward and leeward surfaces and depends on angle of attack, sail shape, air density, and speed of the apparent wind. [[Pressure]] differences result from the [[Stress (mechanics)#Normal and shear stresses|normal force]] per unit area on the sail from the air passing around it. The lift force results from the average pressure on the windward surface of the sail being higher than the average pressure on the leeward side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=G.K. |last=Batchelor |authorlink=George Batchelor |title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics |year=1967 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-66396-2 |pages=14–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved air flow. As air follows a curved path along the windward side of a sail, there is a pressure [[gradient]] perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside. To generate lift, a sail must present an "[[angle of attack]]" (α) between the [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord line]] of the sail and the apparent wind velocity ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Angle of attack is a function of both the craft's point of sail and how the sail is adjusted with respect to the apparent wind.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Weltner ''A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force'' Am. J. Phys. 55(1), January 1987 pg 52&lt;/ref&gt;

As the lift generated by a sail increases, so does [[lift-induced drag]], which together with [[parasitic drag]] constitutes total drag, ('''D'''). This occurs when the angle of attack increases with sail trim or change of course to cause the [[lift coefficient]] to increase up to the point of [[Stall (flight)|aerodynamic stall]], so does the lift-induced [[drag coefficient]]. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of parasitic drag, increases due to the formation of separated flow on the surface of the sail. Sails with the apparent wind behind them (especially going downwind) operate in a stalled condition.&lt;ref name = Clancy&gt;

Lift and drag are components of the total aerodynamic force on sail ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Since the forces on the sail are resisted by forces in the water (for a boat) or on the traveled surface (for an ice boat or land sailing craft), their corresponding forces can also be decomposed from total aerodynamic force into driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''') and lateral force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Driving force overcomes resistance to forward motion. Lateral force is met by lateral resistance from a keel, blade or wheel, but also creates a [[Sailing#Heeling|heeling]] force.

This resolves into forces felt by the sail, Lift ('''L''') and Drag ('''D'''), with vectors shown in red and angle of attack noted as α.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Effect of points of sail on forces===
{{Main|Apparent wind|Point of sail|High-performance sailing}}

Apparent wind ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the air velocity acting upon the leading edge of the most forward sail or as experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. It is the [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] of true wind velocity and the apparent wind component resulting from boat velocity ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''' = '''-V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''' '''+''' '''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'''). In [[nautical terminology]], wind speeds are normally expressed in [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and wind angles in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. The craft's point of sail affects its velocity ('''V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''') for a given true wind velocity ('''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from the wind in a "no-go" zone that is approximately 40° to 50° away from the true wind, depending on the craft. Likewise, the directly downwind speed of all conventional sailing craft is limited to the true wind speed.&lt;ref name=Jobson&gt;{{cite book | last = Jobson | first = Gary | title = Championship Tactics: How Anyone Can Sail Faster, Smarter, and Win Races | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-312-04278-7 | pages = 323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
;Effect of apparent wind on sailing craft at three points of sail
Boat velocity (in black) generates an equal and opposite apparent wind component (not shown), which adds to the true wind to become apparent wind.
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="300px"&gt;
File:Forces on sails for three points of sail.jpg|'''Apparent wind and forces on a ''sailboat''.'''&lt;br&gt;As the boat sails further from the wind, the apparent wind becomes smaller and the lateral component becomes less; boat speed is highest on the beam reach.
File:Ice boat apparent wind on different points of sail.jpg|'''Apparent wind on an ''iceboat''.'''&lt;br&gt;As the iceboat sails further from the wind, the apparent wind increases slightly and the boat speed is highest on the broad reach. The sail is sheeted in for all three points of sail.&lt;ref name = Kimball/&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
Sailing craft '''A''' is close-hauled. Sailing craft '''B''' is on a beam reach. Sailing craft '''C''' is on a broad reach.
&lt;/center&gt;

A sailboat's speed through the water is limited by the resistance that results from hull drag in the water. Sail boats on foils are much less limited. Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft. Craft with the higher forward resistance achieve lower forward velocities for a given wind velocity than ice boats, which can travel at speeds several multiples of the true wind speed.&lt;ref name = Kimball/&gt; Consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where it's possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind.&lt;ref name=Jobson/&gt;

For a sailboat, point of sail affects lateral force significantly. The higher the boat points to the wind under sail, the stronger the lateral force, which requires resistance from a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which requires resistance by weight of ballast from the crew or the boat itself and by the shape of the boat, especially with a catamaran. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become less important.&lt;ref name=Marchaj1/&gt; On ice boats, lateral forces are countered by the lateral resistance of the blades on ice and their distance apart, which generally prevents heeling.&lt;ref&gt;

Each sailing craft is a system that mobilizes wind force through its sails—supported by spars and rigging—which provide motive power and reactive force from the underbody of a sailboat—including the keel, centerboard, rudder or other underwater foils—or the running gear of an ice boat or land craft, which allows it to be kept on a course. Without the ability to mobilize reactive forces in directions different from the wind direction, a craft would simply be adrift before the wind.

Accordingly, motive and heeling forces on sailing craft are either ''components of'' or ''reactions to'' the total aerodynamic force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''') on sails, which is a function of apparent wind velocity ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''') and varies with point of sail. The forward driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''') component contributes to boat velocity ('''V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'''), which is, itself, a determinant of apparent wind velocity. Absent lateral reactive forces to '''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''' from a keel (in water), a skate runner (on ice) or a wheel (on land), a craft would only be able to move downwind and the sail would not be able to develop lift.

At a stable angle of heel (for a sailboat) and a steady speed, aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces are in balance. Integrated over the sailing craft, the total aerodynamic force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''') is located at the centre of effort (''CE''), which is a function of the design and adjustment of the sails on a sailing craft. Similarly, the total hydrodynamic force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''') is located at the [[Center of lateral resistance|centre of lateral resistance]] (''CLR''), which is a function of the design of the hull and its underwater appendages (keel, rudder, foils, etc.). These two forces act in opposition to one another with '''F&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' a reaction to '''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'''.&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;

Whereas ice boats and land-sailing craft resist lateral forces with their wide stance and high-friction contact with the surface, sailboats travel through water, which provides limited resistance to side forces. In a sailboat, side forces are resisted in two ways:&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;
*''Leeway'': [[Leeway]] is the rate of travel perpendicular to the course. It is constant when the lateral force on the sail ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;''') equals the lateral force on the boat's keel and other underwater appendages ('''P&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;'''). This causes the boat to travel through the water on a course that is different from the direction in which the boat is pointed by the angle (''λ'' ), which is called the "leeway angle."
*''Heeling'': The heeling angle (''θ'') is constant when the [[torque]] between the centre of effort (''CE'') on the sail and the centre of resistance on the hull (''CR'') over moment arm (''h'') equals the torque between the boat's centre of buoyancy  (''CB'') and its centre of gravity (''CG'') over moment arm (''b''), described as heeling moment.
All sailing craft reach a constant forward speed (''V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'') for a given wind speed (''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'') and point of sail, when the forward driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''') equals the forward resisting force ('''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''').&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt; For an ice boat, the dominant forward resisting force is aerodynamic, since the [[coefficient of friction]] on smooth ice is as low as 0.02. Accordingly, high-performance ice boats are streamlined to minimize aerodynamic drag.&lt;ref name = Kimball&gt;

===Force components on sails===
[[File:Bry.jpg|right|thumb|Windsurfers employ lift vertical to the water to reduce drag on the board by leaning the sail towards the wind.]]
The approximate locus of net aerodynamic force on a craft with a single sail is the centre of effort (''CE'' ) at the geometric centre of the sail. Filled with wind, the sail has a roughly spherical polygon shape and if the shape is stable, then the location of centre of effort is stable. On sailing craft with multiple sails, the position of centre of effort varies with the [[Sail-plan|sail plan]]. Sail trim or [[airfoil]] profile, boat [[Sailing#Trim|trim]] and [[Points of sail|point of sail]] also affect ''CE''.
&lt;ref name=Marchaj1/&gt;

Centre of effort of the sails. Lead. |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a given sail, the net aerodynamic force on the sail is located approximately at the maximum [[Draft (sail)|draught]] intersecting 
the [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] of the sail and passing through a plane intersecting the centre of effort, normal to the leading edge (luff), roughly perpendicular to the [[Airfoil|chord]] of the sail (a straight line between the leading edge (luff)
and the trailing edge (leech)).  Net aerodynamic force with respect to the air stream is usually considered in reference to the direction of the apparent wind ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''') over the surface plane (ocean, land or ice) and is decomposed into lift ('''L'''), perpendicular with '''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''', and drag ('''D'''), in line with '''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'''. For windsurfers, lift component vertical to the surface plane is important, because in strong winds windsurfer sails are leaned into the wind to create a vertical lifting component ( '''F&lt;sub&gt;VERT&lt;/sub&gt;''') that reduces drag on the board (hull) through the water.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Note that '''F&lt;sub&gt;VERT&lt;/sub&gt;''' acts downwards for boats heeling away from the wind, but is negligible under normal conditions.

The three dimensional vector relationship for net aerodynamic force with respect to apparent wind ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''') is:&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_T} = \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{F_{VERT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, net aerodynamic force may be [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] into the three [[translation (physics)|translational]] directions with respect to a boat's course over the surface: surge (forward/astern), sway (starboard/port—relevant to [[leeway]]), and heave (up/down). The scalar values and direction of these components can be dynamic, depending on wind and waves (for a boat).&lt;ref name=Marchaj1/&gt; In this case, '''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''' is considered in reference to the direction of the boat's course and is decomposed into driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'''), in line with the boat's course, and lateral force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;'''), perpendicular with the boat's course. Again for windsurfers, the lift component vertical to the surface plane ( '''F&lt;sub&gt;VERT&lt;/sub&gt;''') is important.

The three dimensional vector relationship for net aerodynamic force with respect to the course over the surface is:&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_T} = \mathbf{F_R} + \mathbf{F_{LAT}} + \mathbf{F_{VERT}}&lt;/math&gt;

The values of driving force (''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) and lateral force (''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) with apparent wind angle (α), assuming no heeling, relate to the values of lift (''L'' ) and drag (''D'' ), as follows:&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ F_R = L \cdot sin(\alpha) - D \cdot cos(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ F_{LAT} =  L \cdot cos(\alpha) + D \cdot sin(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;

===Reactive forces on sailing craft===
{{See also|Drag (physics)|Friction|Rolling resistance|Lift (force)|Keel|Rudder}}
Reactive forces on sailing craft include forward resistance—sailboat's hydrodynamic resistance (''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''), an ice boat's sliding resistance or a land sailing craft's rolling resistance in the direction of travel—which are to be minimized in order to increase speed, and lateral force, perpendicular to the direction of travel, which is to be made sufficiently strong to minimize sideways motion and to guide the craft on course.

'''Forward resistance''' comprises the types of drag that impede a sailboat's speed through water (or an ice boat's speed over the surface) include components of [[parasitic drag]], consisting primarily of [[Parasitic drag#Form drag|form drag]], which arises because of the shape of the hull, and [[Parasitic drag#Skin friction|skin friction]], which arises from the friction of the water (for boats) or air (for ice boats and land sailing craft) against the "skin" of the hull that is moving through it. Displacement vessels are also subject to [[Wave-making resistance|wave resistance]] from the energy that goes into displacing water into waves and that is limited by [[hull speed]], which is a function of waterline length, Wheeled vehicles' forward speed is subject to [[rolling resistance|rolling friction]] and ice boats are subject to [[Friction#Kinetic friction|kinetic or sliding friction]]. Parasitic drag in water or air increases with the square of speed (''V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Lateral force''' is a reaction supplied by the underwater shape of a sailboat, the blades of an ice boat and the wheels of a land sailing craft. Sailboats rely on [[keel]]s, [[centerboard]]s, and other underwater foils, including rudders, that provide [[Lift (force)|lift]] in the lateral direction, to provide hydrodynamic lateral force ('''P&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;''') to offset the lateral force component acting on the sail  ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;''') and minimize leeway.&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt; Such foils provide hydrodynamic lift and, for keels, ballast to offset heeling. They incorporate a wide variety of design considerations.&lt;ref&gt;

===Rotational forces on sailing craft===
The forces on sails that contribute to [[torque]] and cause rotation with respect to the boat's longitudinal (fore and aft), horizontal (abeam) and vertical (aloft) rotational [[Euler angle|axes]] result in: roll (e.g. heeling). pitch (e.g. pitch-poling), and yaw (e.g. [[Broach (sailing)|broaching]]). Heeling, which results from the lateral force component ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;'''), is the most significant rotational effect of total aerodynamic force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''').&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt; In stasis, heeling moment from the wind and righting moment from the boat's heel force (''F&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) and its opposing hydrodynamic lift force on hull (''F&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' ), separated by a distance (''h'' = "heeling arm"), versus its hydrostatic displacement weight (''W'' ) and its opposing buoyancy force (''Δ''), separated by a distance (''b'' = "righting arm")  are in balance:&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h \times F_H  = b  \times \Delta = h \times F_l  = b  \times W &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;(heeling arm × heeling force = righting arm × buoyancy force = heeling arm × hydrodynamic lift force on hull = righting arm × displacement weight)

Sails come in a wide variety of configurations that are designed to match the capabilities of the sailing craft to be powered by them. They are designed to stay within the limitations of a craft's [[Ship stability|stability]] and [[Power (physics)|power]] requirements, which are functions of hull (for boats) or chassis (for land craft) design. Sails derive power from wind that varies in time and with height above the surface. In order to do so, they are designed to adjust to the wind force for various points of sail. Both their design and method for control include means to match their lift and drag capabilities to the available apparent wind, by changing surface area, angle of attack, and curvature.

===Wind variation with elevation===
[[File:Matchrace kolk.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Wind gust increasing heeling moment on the right-hand [[J/22]]-class boat.]]
Wind speed increases with height above the surface; at the same time, wind speed may vary over short periods of time as gusts. These considerations may be described empirically.

Measurements show that wind speed, (''V'' (''h'' ) ) varies, according to a [[power law]] with height (''h'' ) above a non-zero measurement height datum (''h&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' —e.g. at the height of the foot of a sail), using a reference wind speed measured at the datum height (''V'' (''h&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) ), as follows:

&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that sails that reach higher above the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the centre of effort (''CE'' ) higher above the surface and increase the heeling moment.

Additionally, apparent wind direction moves aft with height above water, which may necessitate a corresponding [[Sail twist|twist in the shape of the sail]] to achieve attached flow with height.&lt;ref&gt;

===Wind variation with time===
Hsu gives a simple formula for a gust factor (''G '' ) for winds as a function of the exponent (''p'' ), above, where ''G'' is the ratio of the wind gust speed to baseline wind speed at a given height:
&lt;ref name=Hsu&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G = 1 + 2p &lt;/math&gt;
So, for a given windspeed and Hsu's recommended value of ''p'' = 0.126, one can expect ''G'' = 1.5 (a 10-knot wind might gust up to 15 knots). This, combined with changes in wind direction suggest the degree to which a sailing craft must adjust to wind gusts on a given course.

==Forces on sails==
A sailing craft's motive system comprises one or more sails, supported by spars and rigging, that derive power from the wind and induce reactive force from the underbody of a sailboat or the running gear of an ice boat or land craft. Depending on the angle of attack of a set of sails with respect to the apparent wind, each sail is providing motive force to the sailing craft either from lift-dominant attached flow or drag-dominant separated flow. Additionally, sails may interact with one another to create forces that are different from the sum of the individual contributions each sail, when used alone.

===Lift predominant (attached flow)===
[[File:Sail angles of attack and resulting flow patterns.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Sail angles of attack and resulting (idealized) flow patterns for attached flow, maximum lift, and stalled for a hypothetical sail. The stagnation streamlines (red) delineate air passing to the leeward side (top) from that passing to the windward (bottom) side of the sail.]]
Sails allow progress of a sailing craft to windward, thanks to their ability to generate lift (and the craft's ability to resist the lateral forces that result). Each sail configuration has a characteristic coefficient of lift and attendant coefficient of drag, which can be determined experimentally and calculated theoretically. Sailing craft orient their sails with a favorable angle of attack between the entry point of the sail and the apparent wind even as their course changes. The ability to generate lift is limited by sailing too close to the wind when no effective angle of attack is available to generate lift (luffing) and sailing sufficiently off the wind that the sail cannot be oriented at a favorable angle of attack (running downwind). Instead, past a [[Angle of attack#Critical angle of attack|critical angle of attack]], the sail [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalls]] and promotes [[flow separation]].

====Effect of angle of attack on coefficients of lift and drag====
{{Main|Lift (force)|Lift-induced drag}}
Each type of sail, acting as an airfoil, has characteristic coefficients of lift (''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) and lift-induced drag  (''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) at a given angle of attack, which follow that same basic form of:&lt;ref name = Clancy/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = {\frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}\rho {V_A}^2A}} &lt;/math&gt;
Where force (''F'') equals ''lift'' (''L'') for forces measured ''perpendicular'' to the airstream to determine ''C'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' or force (''F'') equals ''drag'' (''D'') for forces measured ''in line with'' the airstream to determine ''C'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' on a sail of area (''A'') and a given [[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|aspect ratio]] (length to average cord width). These coefficients vary with angle of attack (''α&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a headsail) with respect to the incident wind (''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a headsail).&lt;ref name=Weitner&gt;

This formulation allows determination of ''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' experimentally for a given sail shape by varying angle of attack at an experimental wind velocity and measuring force on the sail in the direction of the incident wind (''D''—drag) and perpendicular to it (''L''—lift). As the angle of attack grows larger, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this [[Angle of attack#Critical angle of attack|critical angle of attack]] causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the convex surface of the sail; there is less deflection of air to windward, so the sail as airfoil generates less lift.  The sail is said to be [[Stall (flight)|stalled]].&lt;ref name=Weitner/&gt; At the same time, induced drag increases with angle of attack (for the headsail: ''α&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ).

Among them were studies of cambered plates. The results shown are for plates of varying camber and aspect ratios, as shown.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; They show that, as aspect ratio decreases, maximum lift shifts further towards increased drag (rightwards in the diagram). They also show that, for lower angles of attack, a higher aspect ratio generates more lift and less drag than for lower aspect ratios.

If the lift and drag coefficients (''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'') for a sail at a specified angle of attack are known, then the lift (''L'') and drag (''D'') forces produced can be determined, using the following equations, which vary as the square of apparent wind speed (''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' ):&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Anderson |first=John D. |year=2004 |title=Introduction to Flight |edition=5 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078027673 |pages= 928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

;Polar diagrams, showing lift ('''L'''), drag ('''D'''), total aerodynamic force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'''), forward driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'''), and lateral force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;''') for upwind points of sail
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="300px"&gt;
File:Total aerodynamic force and components--Close-hauled.jpg|'''Close-hauled''': The lateral force is highest and driving force is lowest close to the wind.
File:Total aerodynamic force and components--Reach.jpg|'''Reach''': Lift more aligned with the direction of travel increases driving force and decreases lateral force.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
In these diagrams the direction of travel changes with respect to the apparent wind ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'''), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with point of sail. Constant '''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''' in these examples means that either '''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''' or '''V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''' varies with point of sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case [[Newton (unit)|Newtons]]). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the sail's angle of attack (''α'' ) is essentially constant, although the boom angle over the boat changes with point of sail to trim the sail close to the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force  ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''') into forward driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''') and lateral force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;''') vary with point of sail.  Forward driving force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''') increases, as the direction of travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force ('''F&lt;sub&gt;LAT&lt;/sub&gt;''') decreases.

In reference to the above diagrams relating lift and drag, Garrett explains that for a maximum speed made good to windward, the sail must be trimmed to an angle of attack that is greater than the maximum lift/drag ratio (more lift), while the hull is operated in a manner that is lower than its maximum lift/drag ratio (more drag).&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt;

===Drag predominant (separated flow)===
When sailing craft are on a course where the angle of attack between the sail and the apparent wind (''α'' ) exceeds the point of maximum lift on the ''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''–''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' polar diagram, separation of flow occurs.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The separation becomes more pronounced until at ''α'' = 90° lift becomes small and drag predominates. In addition to the sails used upwind, [[spinnaker]]s provide area and curvature appropriate for sailing with separated flow on downwind points of sail.&lt;ref name=Textor&gt;

Again, in these diagrams the direction of travel changes with respect to the apparent wind ('''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'''), which is constant for the sake of illustration, but would in reality vary with point of sail for a constant true wind. In the left-hand diagram (broad reach), the boat is on a point of sail, where the sail can no longer be aligned into the apparent wind to create an optimum angle of attack. Instead, the sail is in a stalled condition, creating about 80% of the lift as in the upwind examples and drag has doubled. Total aerodynamic force  ('''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''') has moved away from the maximum lift value. In the right-hand diagram (running before the wind), lift is one-fifth of the upwind cases (for the same strength apparent wind) and drag has almost quadrupled.&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt;

[[File:Downwind polar diagram to determine velocity made good at various wind speeds.jpg|thumb|Downwind polar diagram to determine velocity made good at various wind speeds for a hypothetical displacement sailboat and sail plan.]]
A [[velocity prediction program]] can translate sail performance and hull characteristics into a polar diagram, depicting boat speed for various windspeeds at each point of sail. Displacement sailboats exhibit a change in what course has the best [[velocity made good]] (VMG), depending on windspeed. For the example given, the sailboat achieves best downwind VMG for windspeed of 10 knots and less at a course about 150° off the wind. For higher windspeed the optimum downwind VMG occurs at more than 170° off the wind. This "downwind cliff" (abrupt change in optimum downwind course) results from the change of balance in drag forces on the hull with speed.&lt;ref name=Textor/&gt;

===Sail interactions===
Sailboats often have a jib that overlaps the mainsail—called a [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]]. Arvel Gentry demonstrated in 1981 that the genoa and the mainsail interact in a symbiotic manner, owing to the circulation of air between them slowing down in the gap between the two sails (contrary to traditional explanations), which prevents separation of flow along the mainsail. The presence of a jib causes the stagnation line on the mainsail to move forward, which reduces the suction velocities on the main and reduces the potential for boundary layer separation and stalling. This allows higher angles of attack.  Likewise, the presence of the mainsail causes the stagnation line on the jib to be shifted forward and allows the boat to point closer to the wind, owing to higher leeward velocities of the air over both sails.

==Sail performance design variables==
Sails characteristically have a coefficient of lift (''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'') and coefficient of drag (''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'') for each apparent wind angle. The planform, curvature and area of a given sail are dominant determinants of each coefficient.

===Sail terminology===
{{Main|Sail components}}
Sails are classified as [[Parts of a sail#Triangular sails|"triangular sails"]], [[Parts of a sail#Quadrilateral fore-and-aft sails|"quadrilateral fore-and-aft sails"]] (gaff-rigged, etc.), and [[Parts of a sail#Square sails|"square sails"]].&lt;ref name = Oxford&gt;{{Citation

The trailing lower corner, the ''clew'', is positioned with an [[outhaul]] on a boom or directly with [[Sheet (sailing)|a sheet]], absent a boom. Symmetrical sails have two clews, which may be adjusted forward or back.&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt;

The windward edge of a sail is called the ''luff'', the trailing edge, the ''leach'', and the bottom edge the ''foot''. On symmetrical sails, either vertical edge may be presented to windward and, therefore, there are two leaches. On sails attached to a mast and boom, these edges may be curved, when laid on a flat surface, to promote both horizontal and vertical curvature in the cross-section of the sail, once attached. The use of [[batten]]s allows a sail have an arc of material on the leech, beyond a line drawn from the head to the clew, called the ''roach''.&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt;

===Lift variables===
As with aircraft wings, the two dominant factors affecting sail efficiency are its planform—primarily sail width versus sail height, expressed as an [[aspect ratio]]—and cross-sectional curvature or [[Draft (sail)|draft]].

====Aspect ratio====
{{Main|Aspect ratio (aeronautics)}}
In [[aerodynamics]], the aspect ratio of a sail is the [[ratio]] of its length to its breadth ([[chord (aeronautics)|chord]]).  A high aspect ratio indicates a long, narrow sail, whereas a low aspect ratio indicates a short, wide sail.&lt;ref name=Kermode&gt;{{Citation

:&lt;math&gt;AR = {b^2 \over A}&lt;/math&gt;

Aspect ratio and [[planform]] can be used to predict the aerodynamic performance of a sail. For a given sail area, the aspect ratio, which is proportional to the square of the sail height, is of particular significance in determining [[lift-induced drag]], and is used to calculate the induced drag coefficient of a sail &lt;math&gt;C_{Di}\;&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=Clancy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_{Di} = \frac{(C_L)^2}{\pi e AR}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e\;&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Oswald efficiency number]] that accounts for the variable sail shapes. This formula demonstrates that a sail's induced drag coefficient decreases with increased aspect ratio.

====Sail curvature====
The horizontal curvature of a sail is termed "draft" and corresponds to the [[Lift (force)#Airfoil shape|camber of an airfoil]]. Increasing the draft generally increases the sail's lift force.&lt;ref name = Clancy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation	| last1 =	Abbott	| first1 =	I. H.	| last2 =	von Doenhoff	| first2 =	A.

Sail draft is adjusted for wind speed to achieve a flatter sail (less draft) in stronger winds and a fuller sails (more draft) in lighter winds.&lt;ref&gt;

On a staysail, tightening the luff with the halyard helps flatten the sail and adjusts the position of maximum draft. On a mainsail curving the mast to fit the curvature of the luff helps flatten the sail. Depending on wind strength, Dellenbaugh offers the following advice on setting the draft of a sailboat mainsail:&lt;ref name= Dellenbaugh&gt;{{Citation

*For light air (less than 8 knots), the sail is at its fullest with the depth of draft between 13-16% of the cord and maximum fullness 50% aft from the luff. 
*For medium air (8-15 knots), the mainsail has minimal twist with a depth of draft set between 11-13% of the cord and maximum fullness 45% aft from the luff. 
*For heavy (greater than15 knots), the sail is flattened and allowed to twist in a manner that dumps lift with a depth of draft set between 9-12% of cord and maximum fullness 45% aft of the luff.
Plots by Larsson ''et al'' show that draft is a much more significant factor affecting sail propulsive force than the position of maximum draft.&lt;ref name=Principles&gt;

The primary tool for adjusting mainsail shape is mast bend; a straight mast increases draft and lift; a curved mast decreases draft and lift—the backstay tensioner is a primary tool for bending the mast. Secondary tools for sail shape adjustment are the mainsheet, traveler, outhaul, and Cunningham.&lt;ref name= Dellenbaugh/&gt;

===Drag variables===
Spinnakers have traditionally been optimized to mobilize drag as a more important propulsive component than lift. As sailing craft are able to achieve higher speeds, whether on water, ice or land, the velocity made good (VMG) at a given course off the wind occurs at apparent wind angles that are increasingly further forward with speed. This suggests that the optimum VMG for a given course may be in a regime where a spinnaker may be providing significant lift.&lt;ref&gt;

''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≈ 4/3 for most sails with the apparent wind angle astern, so drag force on a downwind sail becomes substantially a function of area and wind speed, approximated as follows:&lt;ref name = Kimball/&gt;

Researchers plot pressure across the windward and leeward sides of test sails along the chord and calculate [[pressure coefficient]]s (static pressure difference over wind-induced [[dynamic pressure]]).&lt;ref name=Marchaj1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crook2&gt;{{cite web|last=Crook|first=A|title=An experimental investigation of high aspect-ratio rectangular sails|url=http://ctr.stanford.edu/ResBriefs02/crook2.pdf|work=see Figure 2|format=PDF|publisher=Center for Turbulence Research Annual Research Briefs|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132654/http://ctr.stanford.edu/ResBriefs02/crook2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Viola1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viola|first=Ignazio|author2=Pilate, J|author3=Flay, R.|title=Upwind sail aerodynamics: A pressure distribution database for the validation of numerical codes|journal=Intl J Small Craft Tech, 2011|year=2011|volume=153|issue=Part B1|format=PDF|url=http://www.ignazioviola.com/ignazio_maria_viola/home_files/Viola_IJSCT2011.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132655/http://www.ignazioviola.com/ignazio_maria_viola/home_files/Viola_IJSCT2011.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
Sail design differs from wing design in several respects, especially since on a sail air flow varies with wind and boat motion and sails are usually deformable airfoils, sometimes with a mast for a leading edge. Often simplifying assumptions are employed when making design calculations, including: a flat travel surface—water, ice or land, constant wind velocity and unchanging sail adjustment.&lt;ref name=WilkinsonS/&gt;

The analysis of the forces on sails takes into account the [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] [[surface force]], its [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of effort]] on a sail, its direction, and its variable distribution over the sail. Modern analysis employs [[fluid mechanics]] and [[aerodynamics]] airflow calculations for sail design and manufacture, using [[aeroelasticity]] models, which combine computational fluid dynamics and structural analysis.&lt;ref name=Fabio/&gt; Secondary effects pertaining to [[turbulence]] and separation of the [[boundary layer]] are secondary factors.&lt;ref name=WilkinsonS/&gt; Computational limitations persist.&lt;ref name=LEFD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Pressure PIV and Open Cavity Shear Layer Flow|url=http://www.me.jhu.edu/lefd/PPIV/index.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins U. Laboratory for Experimental Fluid Dynamics|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical results require empirical confirmation with [[wind tunnel]] tests on scale models and full-scale testing of sails. [[Velocity prediction program]]s combine elements of hydrodynamic forces (mainly drag) and aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) to predict sailboat performance at various windspeed for all points of sail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claughton, |first1=A R |last2=Wellicome |first2=J F |last3=Shenoi |first3=R A  |year=2006 |title=Sailing yacht design: theory |location=Southampton, UK  |pages=109–143 |isbn=0-85432-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fuiono Senio''' (died 17 May 1997) was a chief and [[environmentalist]] from Falealupo village on the island of [[Savai'i]] in Western Samoa. A logging company offered funds to the Samoan government to build a school for Senio's village if they could log the rainforest nearby. As the loggers were about to get to work, a visiting biologist offered to raise funds if logging stopped. The village elders agreed to accept the offer and set aside the rainforest from the coast to the interior ridge of Savai'i, as a rainforest preserve. The loggers returned, and Senio ran in front of them and threatened them with a [[machete]], telling them to go away. This brave act became well known throughout the South Pacific, where similar problems affected many poor island communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fa'asao Savai'i Society The Rain Forest and the Flying Foxes, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 1997, shared with [[Paul Alan Cox]], for their contributions to the protection of [[rainforest]]s of [[Falealupo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/94|title=Islands and Island Nations 1997.

An '''in-motion scale''' weighs products in a [[conveyor system]].  They can be used for rejecting under- and over- weight products.  Other types send the weights to a computer for data analysis and statistics.  They may also be known as dynamic scales, belt weighers, but most prominently as [[checkweigher]]s.

==Applications==

In-motion scales come in numerous variations based on application.  A simple version may have only one belt or chain, and use software for transmission-of-weight only.  Some are used to sort product by weight. Through the use of an infeed bed, weigh bed, and outfeed bed, in motion scales or dynamic scales can be equipped with [[Metal detector|metal detectors]], vision / camera systems and various types of rejection systems.  See [[checkweigher]].

'''Joel L. Lebowitz''' (born May 10, 1930 in Taceva ([[Tiachiv]]), then in [[Czechoslovakia]]) is a [[mathematical physicist]] widely acknowledged for his outstanding contributions to [[statistical physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and many other fields of [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]].

Lebowitz has published more than five hundred papers concerning statistical physics and science in general, and he is one of the founders and editors of the ''[[Journal of Statistical Physics]]'', one of the most important peer-reviewed journals concerning scientific research in this area. He has been president of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].

Lebowitz is the [[George William Hill Professor of Mathematics and Physics]] at [[Rutgers University]]. He is also an active member of the [[human rights]] community and a long-term co-Chair of the [[Committee of Concerned Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertynet.org/ccs/leaders.htm Committee of Concerned Scientists, Leadership List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626191304/http://www.libertynet.org/ccs/leaders.htm |date=2008-06-26 }}. Committee of Concerned Scientists. Accessed June 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Joel Lebowitz was born in Taceva, then in [[Czechoslovakia]], now [[Ukraine]], in 1930 into a [[Jew]]ish family.  During [[World War II]] he was deported with his family to [[Auschwitz]], where  his father, his mother, and his younger sister were killed in 1944. After being liberated from the camp, he moved to [[United States]] by boat, and he studied in an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] school, at [[Brooklyn College]], and at [[Syracuse University]]. Here he got a [[PhD]] in 1956 under the supervision of [[Peter G. Bergmann]]. Then he continued his research with [[Lars Onsager]], at [[Yale University]], where he got a faculty position. He moved to the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in 1957 and to the [[Belfer Graduate School of Science of Yeshiva University]] in 1959. Finally he got a faculty position at Rutgers University in 1977, where he holds the prestigious ''George William Hill Professor'' position. During his years at the Yeshiva University and Rutgers University he has been in contact with several scientists, and artists, like [[Fumio Yoshimura]] and [[Kate Millett]]. In 
1975 he founded the Journal of Statistical Physics. In 1979 he was president of the New York Academy of Sciences. He has been one of the most active supporters of dissident scientists in the former [[Soviet Union]], especially [[refusenik]] scientists.

==Contributions to science==
Lebowitz has had many important contributions to statistical mechanics and mathematical physics. He proved, along with [[Elliott H. Lieb|Elliott Lieb]], that the [[Coulomb interaction]]s obey the [[thermodynamic limit]]. He also established what are now known as [[Lebowitz inequalities]] for the ferromagnetic [[Ising model]]. His current interests are in problems of [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]] statistical mechanics.

He became editor-in-chief  the [[Journal of Statistical Physics]] in 1975, one of the most important journals in the field, and has been [[editor in chief]] ever since, till he resigned the position in September 2018. Lebowitz hosts a biannual series of conferences &lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.rutgers.edu/events/smm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; held, first at [[Yeshiva University]] and later at [[Rutgers University]], which has been running for 60 years. He is also known as a co-editor of an influential review series, '[[Phase transitions and critical phenomena]]'.

==Awards and honors==

He has been awarded several honors, such as the [[Boltzmann Medal]] (1992), the [[Nicholson Medal]] (1994) awarded by the [[American Physical Society]], the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Delmer S. Fahrney Medal]] (1995), the [[Henri Poincaré Prize]] (2000), the [[Volterra Award]] (2001), and many others. Among other recognitions, Lebowitz was awarded the [[Max Planck Medal]] in 2007 "for his important contributions to the statistical physics of equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems, in particular his contributions to the theory of phase transitions, the dynamics of infinite systems, and the stationary non-equilibrium states" and "for his promoting of new directions of this field at its farthest front, and for enthusiastically introducing several generations of scientists to the field."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/physicsnews/news.shtml#lebowitz06 Rutgers Physics News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, Pressemitteilung | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dpg-physik.de/presse/pressemit/2006/dpg-pm-2006-029.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he received the [[Grande Médaille]] of the French Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-sciences.fr/presse/communique/grandemedaille_2014.pdf Grande Médaille of the French Academy of Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082422/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/presse/communique/grandemedaille_2014.pdf |date=2014-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox lawrencium}}
'''Lawrencium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Lr''' (formerly Lw) and [[atomic number]] 103. It is named in honor of [[Ernest Lawrence]], inventor of the [[cyclotron]], a device that was used to discover many artificial [[radioactive]] elements. A radioactive [[metal]], lawrencium is the eleventh [[transuranic element]] and is also the final member of the [[actinide]] series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in [[particle accelerator]]s by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve [[isotopes of lawrencium]] are currently known; the most stable is &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Lr with a [[half-life]] of 11&amp;nbsp;hours, but the shorter-lived &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Lr (half-life 2.7&amp;nbsp;minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.

Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]] to [[lutetium]] in the [[periodic table]], and is a [[valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] element. It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th-period [[transition metal]]s: however, its [[electron configuration]] is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an [[atomic orbital|s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p]] configuration instead of the s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of [[lead]].

In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[Element naming controversy|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and while the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) initially established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element's name.

==History==
[[File:96904536.thumb3.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ghiorso]] updating the periodic table in April 1961, inscribing the symbol "Lw" in the position for element 103, as codiscoverers Latimer, Sikkeland, and Larsh (left to right) look on approvingly.]]
In 1958, scientists at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] claimed the discovery of element 102, now called [[nobelium]]. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same [[curium]] target used with [[nitrogen]]-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with [[decay energy]] around {{val|9|1|u=[[electronvolt|MeV]]}} and half-life around {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Lr ([[alpha decay]] [[decay energy|energy]] 8.87&amp;nbsp;MeV, half-life 0.6&amp;nbsp;s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of the strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103.&lt;ref name = "emsley2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="93TWG"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

Chem., Vol. 63, No. 6, pp. 879–886, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1960, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;[[californium|Cf]] with &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.&lt;ref name="emsley2011"/&gt;

The first important work on element 103 was carried out at Berkeley by the [[nuclear physics|nuclear-physics]] team of [[Albert Ghiorso]], Torbjørn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, Robert M. Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961. The first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly produced by bombarding a three-[[milligram]] target consisting of three isotopes of the element [[californium]] with [[boron]]-10 and boron-11 [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC).&lt;ref name="Lr"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Albert|last1=Ghiorso|authorlink=Albert Ghiorso|last2=Sikkeland|first2=T. |last3=Larsh|first3=A.

Scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]) raised several criticisms: all but one were answered adequately. The exception was that &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf was the most common isotope in the target, and in the reactions with &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons, and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five. This would lead to a narrow yield curve, not the broad one reported by the Berkeley team. A possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element 103.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt; This was an important intermediate step to the unquestioned discovery of element 103, although the evidence was not completely convincing.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt; The Berkeley team proposed the name "lawrencium" with symbol "Lw", after [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence]], inventor of the [[cyclotron]].

The first work at Dubna on element 103 came in 1965, when they reported to have created &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;103 in 1965 by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;[[americium|Am]] with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;[[oxygen|O]], identifying it indirectly from its [[decay product|granddaughter]] [[fermium]]-252. The half-life they reported was somewhat too high, possibly due to background events. Later 1967 work on the same reaction identified two decay energies in the ranges 8.35–8.50&amp;nbsp;MeV and 8.50–8.60&amp;nbsp;MeV: these were assigned to &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;103 and &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;103.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt; Despite repeated attempts, they were unable to confirm assignment of an alpha emitter with a half-life of eight seconds to &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;103.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=G.

Further experiments in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an [[actinide]] chemistry for the new element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date = 2005|title = Theoretical chemistry and physics of heavy and superheavy element|page = 57|publisher = Springer|isbn=1-4020-1371-X|author =Kaldor, Uzi|author2 =Wilson, Stephen|last-author-amp =yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;103 with half-life 20&amp;nbsp;s and alpha decay energy 8.38&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt; However, it was not until 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260,&lt;ref name=Silva16412&gt;Silva, pp. 1641–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eskola&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Phys.

[[File:Ernest Lawrence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The element was named after [[Ernest Lawrence]].]]
In 1971, the IUPAC granted the discovery of lawrencium to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, even though they did not have ideal data for the element's existence. However, in 1992, the [[IUPAC]] Trans-fermium Working Group (TWG) officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium, concluding that while the 1961 Berkeley experiments were an important step to lawrencium's discovery, they were not yet completely convincing; and while the 1965, 1968, and 1970 Dubna experiments came very close to the needed level of confidence taken together, only the 1971 Berkeley experiments, which clarified and confirmed previous observations, finally resulted in complete confidence in the discovery of element 103.&lt;ref name = "emsley2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="qqq"/&gt; Because the name "lawrencium" had been in use for a long time by this point, it was retained by IUPAC,&lt;ref name = "emsley2011"/&gt; and in August 1997, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol "Lr" during a meeting in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="qqq"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Lawrencium is the final member of the [[actinide]] series and is sometimes considered to be a [[group 3 element]], along with [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], and [[lutetium]], as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the [[period 7 element|7th-period]] [[transition metal]]s. In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[nobelium]], to the left of the 6d transition metal [[rutherfordium]], and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.58), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally.&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt; The [[enthalpy]] of [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of lawrencium is estimated to be 352&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons [[delocalized electron|delocalized]], a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of [[heat of vaporization]], [[bulk modulus]], and [[atomic volume]] of neighboring elements to lawrencium.&lt;ref name=Silva1644&gt;Silva, p. 1644&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily [[redox|oxidized]] by air, [[steam]], and [[acid]]s,&lt;ref name="Emsley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Emsley|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4BAg769RfKoC&amp;pg=PA368|date= 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|pages=278–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent [[metallic radius]] of 171&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]].&lt;ref name=Silva1644/&gt; It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=density/&gt;&lt;ref name=Penneman/&gt; It is also predicted to have a [[melting point]] of around 1900&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] (1627&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]), not far from the value for lutetium (1925&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Lide, D.

===Chemical===
[[File:F-block elution sequence.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Elution sequence of the late trivalent lanthanides and actinides, with ammonium α-HIB as eluant: the broken curve for lawrencium is a prediction.]]
In 1949, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], who devised the actinide concept that elements [[actinium|89]] to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements [[lanthanum|57]] to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member and that the Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion should be about as stable as Lu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in [[aqueous solution]]. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.&lt;ref name=Silva16447&gt;Silva, pp. 1644–7&lt;/ref&gt;

1969 studies on the element showed that lawrencium reacted with [[chlorine]] to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Its [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] was found to be similar to that of the chlorides of [[curium]], [[fermium]], and [[nobelium]] and much less than that of [[rutherfordium]] chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500&amp;nbsp;atoms of the isotope &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr, comparing it with divalent ([[nobelium|No]], [[barium|Ba]], [[radium|Ra]]), trivalent ([[fermium|Fm]], [[californium|Cf]], [[curium|Cm]], [[americium|Am]], [[actinium|Ac]]), and tetravalent ([[thorium|Th]], [[plutonium|Pu]]) elements. It was found that lawrencium [[extraction (chemistry)|coextracted]] with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it [[elution|eluted]] ahead of [[mendelevium|Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;]] in the elution sequence.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt; Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium(III) [[fluoride]] (LrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydroxide]] (Lr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) should both be insoluble in water.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt; Due to the [[lanthanide contraction|actinide contraction]], the [[ionic radius]] of Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; should be smaller than that of Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and it should elute ahead of Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; when [[ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate]] (ammonium α-HIB) is used as an eluant.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt; Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Lr confirmed lawrencium's trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as [[erbium]], and found that lawrencium's ionic radius was {{val|88.6|0.3|u=[[picometer|pm]]}}, larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from [[periodic trend]]s.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt; Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to {{val|88.1|0.1|u=pm}} and calculated an [[enthalpy of hydration]] value of {{val|−3685|13|u=kJ/mol}}.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt; It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt;

It has been speculated that the 7s electrons are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; or 6d electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Lr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Lr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the [[standard electrode potential]] of the ''E''°(Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;→Lr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) couple was calculated to be less than −1.56&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]], indicating that the existence of Lr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in aqueous solution was unlikely. The upper limit for the ''E''°(Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;→Lr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) couple was predicted to be −0.44&amp;nbsp;V: the values for ''E''°(Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;→Lr) and ''E''°(Lr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;→Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) are predicted to be −2.06&amp;nbsp;V and +7.9&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name=Silva16447/&gt; The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as [[rutherfordium|Rf]]&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; [[dubnium|Db]]&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; [[seaborgium|Sg]]&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;, and lawrencium continues the trend with Lr&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; being more stable than Rf&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last1 = Hoffman|first1 = Darleane C.|last2=Lee |first2=Diana M. |last3=Pershina |first3=Valeria |chapter = Transactinides and the future elements| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]| year = 2006| isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006| page=1686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the molecule lawrencium dihydride (LrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is predicted to be [[bent molecular geometry|bent]], the 6d orbital of lawrencium is not expected to play a role in the bonding, unlike that of [[lanthanum dihydride]] (LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has La–H bond distances of 2.158&amp;nbsp;Å, while LrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; should have shorter Lr–H bond distances of 2.042&amp;nbsp;Å due to the relativistic contraction and stabilization of the 7s and 7p orbitals involved in the bonding, in contrast to the core-like 5f subshell and the mostly uninvolved 6d subshell. In general, molecular LrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LrH are expected to resemble the corresponding [[thallium]] species (thallium having a 6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;6p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; valence configuration in the gas phase, like lawrencium's 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) more than the corresponding [[lanthanide]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balasubramanian|first1=K.|date=4 December 2001|title=Potential energy surfaces of Lawrencium and Nobelium dihydrides (LrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NoH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)|url=|journal=Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=116|issue=9|pages=3568–75|bibcode=2002JChPh.116.3568B|doi=10.1063/1.1446029|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electron configurations of Lr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Lr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are expected to be 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 7s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, unlike the lanthanides which tend to be 5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; as Ln&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than LrH, and Lr[[metal carbonyl|CO]] is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; just as it is for LuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and more generally all the LnCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the complex anion [Lr(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be [[HOMO/LUMO|its highest occupied molecular orbital]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Atomic===
A lawrencium atom has 103 electrons, of which three can act as [[valence electron]]s. In 1970, it was predicted that the ground-state [[electron configuration]] of lawrencium was [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (ground state [[term symbol]] &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt;), following the [[Aufbau principle]] and conforming to the [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium.&lt;ref name=Silva16434&gt;Silva, pp. 1643–4&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration.&lt;ref name=Silva16434/&gt; Though early calculations gave conflicting results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Nugent |first1 = L.

In 1988, a team of scientists led by Eichler calculated that lawrencium's [[enthalpy of adsorption]] on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium's electron configuration.&lt;ref name=Silva16434/&gt; The s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p configuration was expected to be more [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] than the s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d configuration, and be more similar to that of the [[p-block]] element [[lead]]. No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on [[quartz]] or [[platinum]] was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p configuration.&lt;ref name=Silva16434/&gt;

In 2015, the first ionization energy of lawrencium was measured, using the isotope &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr.&lt;ref name=Sato&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sato |first=T.

This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements (and hence being the true heavier congeners of [[scandium]] and [[yttrium]], instead of [[lanthanum]] and [[actinium]]), and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the [[alkali metal]]s [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] in some ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/04/lawrencium-experiment-could-shake-periodic-table |title=Lawrencium experiment could shake up periodic table |last1=Gunther |first1=Matthew |date=9 April 2015 |website=RSC Chemistry World |access-date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the [[IUPAC]] definition ("An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell"),&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=T06456|title=transition element}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and the [[group 3 element]]s, with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com |title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements |publisher=Webelements.com |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to [[curium]], which has an [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, and show the expected [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haire |first=R.

==Preparation and purification==
While the lightest (&lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Lr to &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Lr) and heaviest (&lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of [[dubnium]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Lr to &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Lr) can all be produced by bombarding actinide ([[americium]] to [[einsteinium]]) targets with light ions (from [[boron]] to neon). The two most important isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr and &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Lr, are both in this range. &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr can be produced by bombarding [[californium]]-249 with 70&amp;nbsp;MeV [[boron]]-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four [[neutron]]s), while &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Lr can be produced by bombarding [[berkelium]]-249 with [[oxygen]]-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an alpha particle, and three neutrons).&lt;ref name=Silva16423&gt;Silva, pp. 1642–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Both &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr and &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Lr have half-lives too short to allow a complete chemical purification process. Early experiments with &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr therefore used rapid [[solvent extraction]], with the [[chelating agent]] [[thenoyltrifluoroacetone]] (TTA) dissolved in [[methyl isobutyl ketone]] (MIBK) as the [[organic phase]], and with the [[aqueous phase]] being buffered [[acetate]] solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different [[pH]] ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24&amp;nbsp;MeV alpha particles.&lt;ref name=Silva16423/&gt; More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB to take place in enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;[[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name=Silva16423/&gt;

'''''Milking the Rhino''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]], produced by [[Kartemquin Films]], that examines the relationship between the indigenous African wildlife, the villagers who live amongst this wildlife and conservationists who look to keep tourism dollars coming in.  Both the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] of [[Kenya]] and the [[Ovahimba]] of [[Namibia]] have spent centuries as cattle farmers.  With their lands being turned into protected game reserves, these ancient tribes have turned to tourism as a means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awf.org/content/headline/detail/4237/ AWARD-WINNING MILKING THE RHINO, FEATURING AWF’S DR.

While some environmentalists think that community-based conservation is ideal for these villagers, the dangers of drought and the starvation of their cattle remains a constant reality.  Stuck between the always growing Western influence that wants Africa to remain a place for sight-seeing safaris and their own ancient cultures, the Maasai and Himba are at a crossroads of cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milkingtherhino.org/ "Milking the Rhino" - Official site]  Kartemquin Films.

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:1941 Western Flyer (17899878506).jpg|thumb|1941 Western Flyer]]
New Flyer was founded by John Coval in 1930 as the '''Western Auto and Truck Body Works Ltd'''. Reflecting an increased focus on bus manufacturing, it changed its name in 1948 to '''Western Flyer Coach'''.

In the 1960s, the company further focused on the [[Public transport|urban transit]] bus market. In 1971, the then-financially struggling Western Flyer was sold to the Manitoba Development Corporation, an agency of the [[Manitoba]] government, and renamed '''Flyer Industries Limited'''.&lt;ref name="stauss"&gt;Stauss, Ed (1988). ''The Bus World Encyclopedia of Buses''. Woodland Hills, CA (USA): Stauss Publications. {{ISBN|0-9619830-0-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 1986, Jan den Oudsten, a descendant of the family who formed Dutch bus manufacturer [[Den Oudsten|Den Oudsten Bussen BV]], purchased Flyer Industries from the Manitoba government, changing its name to '''New Flyer Industries Limited'''.

===A new beginning===
Under new leadership, New Flyer developed, tested, and introduced several innovative designs. The company designed and tested North America's first [[low-floor bus]] in 1988 and delivered the first production model, called the D40LF, to the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newflyer.com/about/history|title=New Flyer - History|website=www.newflyer.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, New Flyer delivered the first [[compressed natural gas]] bus in North America and the world's first [[Fuel cell|hydrogen fuel cell]] powered bus. In 1995, the company delivered the first low-floor [[articulated bus]] in North America to [[Strathcona County Transit]].

In March 2002, New Flyer was acquired by [[KPS Capital Partners]], an investment company that specializes in turning around struggling businesses. Later that year Jan den Oudsten retired as CEO. He was later inducted into the [[American Public Transportation Association]]'s Hall of Fame for his work at the company.

In 2003, [[King County Metro]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] placed an order for 213 hybrid buses, the world's first large order for hybrid buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New Flyer Receives Order for Up To 715 Buses From King County Metro|date=May 16, 2007|publisher=New Flyer Industries Inc|url=http://www.newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.47|accessdate=2017-07-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812122058/http://www.newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.47|archivedate=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2013, New Flyer was purchased by [[private equity]] firms, [[Harvest Partners]] and [[Lightyear Capital]]. The company's CEO, John Marinucci, called the purchase an indicator that the company's operational and financial turnaround had been accomplished. On August 19, 2005, New Flyer became a [[Public company|publicly traded company]] on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

2005 also saw a restyling of New Flyer's popular low-floor coaches with new front and rear endcaps, to modernize and streamline the exterior appearance of the bus.

In October 2008, New Flyer was named one of [[Canada's Top 100 Employers]], which was announced in [[The Globe and Mail]] newspaper, and the company was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine. Later that month, New Flyer was also named one of [[Manitoba's Top Employers]], which was announced by the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-new-flyer|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Canada's Top 100 Employers Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company converted to a corporate structure from a trust-like structure in October 2011.

In May 2012, New Flyer and [[Alexander Dennis]] announced a [[joint venture]] to design and manufacture medium-duty low-floor bus (or midi bus) for the North American market. The bus, called the New Flyer MiDi was based on the design of the Alexander Dennis [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200|Enviro200]]. Alexander Dennis engineered and tested the bus, and it was built and marketed by New Flyer under contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselprogress.com/Industry-News/3852/New-Flyer-In-Bus-Joint-Venture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531143929/http://www.dieselprogress.com/Industry-News/3852/New-Flyer-In-Bus-Joint-Venture/|archivedate=May 31, 2012|title=Industry News: New Flyer In Bus Joint Venture|magazine=Diesel Progress|location=Waukesha, Wisconsin|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the partnership around 200 buses were delivered to 22 operators in Canada and US. In May 2017, New Flyer and Alexander Dennis announced their joint venture would end and production of the bus would transition to Alexander Dennis' new North American factory in Indiana where it is produced alongside the double-deck [[Alexander Dennis Enviro500|Enviro500]] series bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Flyer and Alexander Dennis Agree to Transition MiDi® Bus to North American-Based Alexander Dennis Inc.|url=https://www.newflyer.com/rss/831-new-flyer-and-alexander-dennis-agree-to-transition-midi%C2%AE-bus-to-north-american-based-alexander-dennis-inc|publisher=New Flyer|accessdate=May 26, 2017|language=en-gb|date=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enviro200 joint venture terminates ''[[Buses (magazine)|Buses]]'' issue 748 July 2017 page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 New Flyer, in a joint venture with [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]], the [[Manitoba]] Government, [[Manitoba Hydro]] and [[Red River College]], unveiled a [[Electric bus|fully electric battery-powered bus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kusch |first=Larry |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/new-flyer-green-leader-156630045.html |title=New Flyer green leader |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date= June 2, 2012|accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian bus manufacturer [[Marcopolo S.A.]] acquired a 19.99% stake of New Flyer on January 23, 2013 for $116 million, the maximum it could acquire without offering to buy out other shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[The Canadian Press]]|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/brazilian-bus-maker-loads-up-stake-in-new-flyer-industries/article7716338/ |title=Brazilian bus maker loads up stake in New Flyer Industries |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As competing manufacturer [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] exited the North American market, New Flyer purchased the aftermarket parts business for its [[Orion International|Orion]] brand of heavy-duty transit buses for $29 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/new-flyer-buys-orion-parts-business-of-daimler-bus/article9208736/|title=New Flyer buys Orion parts business of Daimler Bus|date=2013-03-01|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Flyer also agreed to take on two outstanding bus manufacturing contracts for New York City Transit and the other for King County Metro in Seattle (giving New Flyer a total of 194 firm bus orders and options for an additional 291 buses). Under the agreement, New Flyer acquired the Orion parts inventory, the company's accounts, license to use proprietary part designs and agreed to provide parts for customer warranty support.

On June 21, 2013, New Flyer agreed to acquire competing heavy-duty transit bus manufacturer, [[North American Bus Industries]] (NABI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New Flyer confirms the successful closing of North American Bus Industries, Inc. acquisition and related financial transactions |date=June 21, 2013|publisher=New Flyer Industries|url=http://www.nabusind.com/news/New_Flyer_Aquires_NABI_Closing_Press_Release.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124031036/http://www.nabusind.com/news/New_Flyer_Aquires_NABI_Closing_Press_Release.pdf |archivedate=January 24, 2014|accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.145 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626063757/http://www.newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.145 |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of NABI's outstanding orders, New Flyer converted the former NABI factory in Anniston, AL into a fourth facility to produce the Xcelsior heavy-duty transit bus.

In November 10, 2015, New Flyer agreed to acquire motorcoach manufacturer, [[Motor Coach Industries]] from KPS Capital Partners for [[United States dollar|US$]]459 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/new-flyer-buys-motor-coach-1.3312102 | title=New Flyer buys Motor Coach Industries for $604M Cdn | publisher=[[CBC News]] | date=November 10, 2015 | accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the deal closing on December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newflyer.com/js/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=../../../images/downloads/investor-relations/events-presentations/2016/presentations/011416-NF-investor-presentation.pdf|title=New Flyer Industries Investor Presentation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newflyer.com|publication-date=January 14, 2016|access-date=August 8, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2016, Marcopolo S.A. reduced its stake in New Flyer to 10.8%, although it remains the largest individual shareholder.

On December 1, 2017, New Flyer acquired small and mid-sized bus manufacturer ARBOC Specialty Vehicles for US$95 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newflyer.com/2017/12/new-flyer-acquires-arboc-specialty-vehicles/ | title=New Flyer acquires ARBOC Specialty Vehicles | publisher=New Flyer Industries | date=December 1, 2017 | accessdate=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure is often done because [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] of the entire body is not yet available. Vitrification essentially eliminates the mechanical and chemical damage caused by ice formation,&lt;ref name="FahyWowk2015"&gt;

Meryman et al. independently reported in the same year that toxic effects of methanol, ethanol, and ammonium acetate in the frozen state are also detectable in thawed erythrocytes [46]. These non-nucleated cells did not show injury attributable to glycerol or Me2SO in the latter experiments, but evidence continued to emerge in support of putatively toxic effects of cryoprotectants during freezing [2,10,12,14,28], including such effects even in glycerolized erythrocytes [47,50,53], and by 1986 the overall evidence had become quite strong [17].}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of [[Cryoprotectant#Toxicity|cryoprotectant toxicity]] and side effects of [[Desiccation|dehydration]] of tissue due to the [[blood–brain barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a direct consequence of vitrification, storage of the vitrified brain directly in liquid nitrogen raises the further aspect of fractures,&lt;ref name=alcorfaq02&gt;http://www.alcor.org/FAQs/faq02.html&lt;/ref&gt; which are fewer in number but larger in scale in vitrified tissue than frozen tissue, a consequence of cooling from ''[[Glass transition|T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;]]'' (-135&amp;nbsp;°C) to liquid nitrogen's boiling point (-196&amp;nbsp;°C).

==Advantages==
Neuropreservation has several advantages over whole body preservation. It costs less; neuropatients are easier to transport in case of legal, social, or physical problems; it is possible to do a better job of perfusing and therefore cryoprotecting the brain when there is no need to consider other tissues, and its smaller volume allows more rapid and less expensive cooling.&lt;ref name="neuropreservation option" /&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]] has theorized that neuropatients will be revived after procedures have been perfected on whole body patients, and, therefore, have better chances for revival.&lt;ref name="daily mail"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neuropreservation was first proposed in 1965 by cryonics co-creator Evan Cooper, proposed again in a speculative scientific paper by [[Gerontology|gerontologist]] George M. Martin in 1971, and independently proposed yet again in 1974 by [[Mike Darwin]], and [[Fred and Linda Chamberlain]].  The Chamberlains were the founders of the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]].  In 1976 Fred’s father became the first of many neuropreservation patients at Alcor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Chamberlain | first=Fred &amp; Linda | title=FRC Jr. |  publisher=Lifepact   | date=July 16, 2006 | url=http://www.lifepact.com/frcjr.htm  | access-date=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the year 2000, neuropreservation was performed by surgical separation of the body from the head (called [[Head|cephalic]] isolation or "neuroseparation") at the end of [[cryoprotectant]] [[perfusion]] performed on the upper body via the ascending [[aorta]].&lt;ref name="neuropreservation option" /&gt;  After that year, Alcor began performing cephalic isolation before cryoprotectant perfusion, in deep [[hypothermia]], and then using the carotid and vetebral arteries directly for perfusion with cryoprotectants.

{{As of|2014}}, Alcor, Oregon Cryonics, and [[KrioRus]] are the only cryonics organizations that offer neuropreservation. Other organizations, such as the other major provider, [[Cryonics Institute]], avoid it because they are concerned about neuropreservation's negative effect on the public’s perception of cryonics and, especially, because of the adverse effect on the families of patients. Journalists and horror novelists invariably have a field day with "frozen severed heads", and focus not on the scientific or humanitarian purposes of cryonics, but on sensationalizing cryonics as grotesque or ridiculous. Their policy to always preserve the entire body prevents anyone leveling those claims at Cryonics Institute. Their goal is to preserve and eventually revive people, so they avoid processes like neurocryopreservation that could damage or otherwise put their patients at risk. Alcor claims there are good technical justifications for neuropreservation, and that they will continue to offer it.  Approximately three-quarters of the cryonics patients stored at Alcor are neuropatients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2731">'''Partial oxidation''' ('''POX''') is a type of [[chemical reaction]]. It occurs when a [[stoichiometry|substoichiometric]] fuel-air mixture is partially [[combustion|combusted]] in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich [[syngas]] which can then be put to further use, for example in a [[fuel cell]]. A distinction is made between ''thermal partial oxidation'' (TPOX) and ''catalytic partial oxidation'' (CPOX).

==Principle==
Partial oxidation is a technically mature process in which [[natural gas]] or a heavy hydrocarbon fuel ([[heating oil]]) is mixed with a limited amount of oxygen in an [[exothermic]] process.

* General reaction: &lt;chem&gt;{C_\mathit{n}H_\mathit{m}} + \frac\mathit{n}{2}{O2} -&gt; \mathit{n}{CO} + \frac\mathit{m}{2}H2&lt;/chem&gt;
* Idealized reaction for heating oil:  &lt;chem&gt;{C12H24} + 6O2 -&gt; {12CO} + 12H2&lt;/chem&gt;
* Idealized reaction for coal: &lt;chem&gt;{C24H12} + 12O2 -&gt; {24CO} + 6H2&lt;/chem&gt;

The formulas given for coal and heating oil show only a typical representative of these complex fuels. Water may be added to lower the combustion temperature and reduce soot formation.  Yields are below stoichiometric due to some fuel being fully combusted to carbon dioxide and water.

==TPOX==
[[TPOX]] (''thermal partial oxidation'') reaction temperatures are dependent on the [[air-fuel ratio]] or oxygen-fuel ratio.  Typical reaction temperatures are 1200[[Celsius|°C]] and above.

==CPOX==
In [[Catalytic partial oxidation|CPOX]] (''catalytic partial oxidation'') the use of a [[catalyst]] reduces the required temperature to around 800°C – 900°C.  

The choice of [[catalytic reforming|reforming]] technique depends on the [[sulfur]] content of the fuel being used.  CPOX can be employed if the sulfur content is below 50 [[Parts per million|ppm]].  A higher sulfur content can poison the catalyst, so the TPOX procedure is used for such fuels. However, recent research shows that CPOX is possible with sulfur contents up to 400ppm.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
1926 – Vandeveer and Parr at the [[University of Illinois]] used oxygen to replace air.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cXNmyTTGbRIC ''Industrial Gas Handbook'', Frank G. Kerry, p. 230].&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''particle segregation''', particulate [[solid]]s and also quasi solids, such as foams tend to segregate by virtue of differences in the size, and also physical properties such as volume, [[density]], shape and other properties of particles of which they are composed.&lt;ref&gt;Khan Ahmad;Smalley,I.J. 1973. Observation of particle segregation in vibrated granular systems. Powder Technology 8, 69-74&lt;/ref&gt; The process of segregation occurs during &lt;!--during what?--&gt;as well as during subsequent handling of completed mix and it is pronounced with free-flowing powders. Powders that are not free flowing or that exhibit high forces of cohesion or adhesion between particles of similar or dissimilar composition are often difficult to mix owing to [[Flocculation|agglomeration]]. The clumps of particles can be broken down in such cases by the use of mixtures that generate high [[shear force]]s or that subject the powder to impact. When these powders have been mixed, however, they are less susceptible to segregation because of the relatively high interparticulates forces that resist interparticulate motion, leading to unmixing.

Particles segregation is commonly called "demixing" in industrial environment.

==Segregation mechanisms==
The five major segregation mechanisms &lt;ref&gt;https://www.powderprocess.net/Segregation_demixing.html&lt;/ref&gt; are
* Percolation segregation
* Flotation segregation
* Elutriation
* Transport segregation
* Agglomeration segregation

===Percolation===
Sifting occurs when there is a significant variation of particle diameter in a mix. Interparticle motion causes the finer particles to sift through the coarser ones.

===Flotation===
Vibration of the mixture is bringing the small particles below the coarse one, which has as an effect to have coarse particles closer to the surface of the mixture.

===Elutriation===
In this mechanism, the lighter or fluffier particles form a 'fluidized' layer. Only coarser particles can penetrate the fluidized fines and the finer particles remain in the top layer.

===Transport===
The finer particles in a mix are susceptible to be airborne in the presence of airflow. They move away from the deposition point whereas the coarser particles tend to remain close to the deposition point.

===Agglomeration===
It can happen that some components form lumps. Those lumps will create non homogeneity in the mix since locally they will concentrate a lot of material of one case.

It uses ionized gas (physical plasma) for medical uses or dental applications &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sladek|first=R.E.J.|date=2006|title=Plasma needle : non-thermal atmospheric plasmas in dentistry|url=https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/plasma-needle-non-thermal-atmospheric-plasmas-in-dentistry|language=English|doi=10.6100/IR613009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Plasma, often called the fourth state of matter, is an ionized gas containing positive ions and negative ions or electrons, but is approximately charge neutral on the whole. The plasma sources used for plasma medicine are generally low temperature plasmas, and they generate ions, chemically reactive  atoms and molecules, and UV-photons. These plasma-generated active species are useful for several bio-medical applications such as sterilization of [[Implant (medicine)|implant]]s and surgical instruments as well as modifying [[Biomaterial Surface Modifications|biomaterial surface properties]]. Sensitive applications of plasma, like subjecting human body or internal organs to plasma treatment for medical purposes, are also possible. This possibility is profoundly{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} being investigated by research groups worldwide under the highly-interdisciplinary research field called 'plasma medicine'.

== Plasma sources ==
Plasma sources used in plasma medicine are typically "low temperature" plasma sources operated at [[Atmospheric-pressure plasma|atmospheric pressure]]. In this context, low temperature refers to temperatures similar to room temperature, usually slightly above. There is a strict upper limit of 50&amp;nbsp;°C when treating tissue to avoid burns. The plasmas are only partially ionized, with less than 1 ppm of the gas being charged species, and the rest composed of neutral gas.

=== Dielectric-barrier discharges ===
[[Dielectric barrier discharge|Dielectric-barrier discharges]] are a type of plasma source that limits the current using a dielectric that covers one or both electrodes. A conventional DBD device comprises two planar electrodes with at least one of them covered with a dielectric material and the electrodes are separated by a small gap which is called the discharge gap. DBDs are usually driven by high AC voltages with frequencies in the kHz range. In order to use DC and 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz power sources investigators developed the Resistive Barrier Discharge (RBD).&lt;ref&gt;Laroussi, M., Alexeff, I., Richardson, J. P., and Dyer, F. F “ The Resistive Barrier Discharge”, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 30, pp. 158-159, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; However, for medical application of DBD devices, the human body itself can serve as one of the two electrodes making it sufficient to devise plasma sources that consist of only one electrode covered with a [[dielectric]] such as [[alumina]] or [[quartz]]. DBD for medical applications&lt;ref&gt;Kuchenbecker M, Bibinov N, Kaemlimg A, Wandke D, Awakowicz P, Viöl W, J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.'' '''42''' (2009) 045212 (10pp)''&lt;/ref&gt; such as for the inactivation of bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;Laroussi, M., Richardson, J. P., and Dobbs, F. C. “ Effects of Non-Equilibrium Atmospheric Pressure Plasmas on the Heterotrophic Pathways of Bacteria and on their Cell Morphology”, Appl. Phys. Lett. 81, pp. 772-774, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment of skin diseases and wounds, tumor treatment &lt;ref&gt;Vandamme M., Robert E., Dozias S., Sobilo J., Lerondel S., Le Pape A., Pouvesle J.M., 2011. Response of human glioma U87 xenografted on mice to non thermal plasma treatment. Plasma Medicine 1:27-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and disinfection of skin surface are currently under investigation. The treatment usually takes place in the room air. They are generally powered by several kilovolt biases using either AC or pulsed power supplies.

=== Atmospheric pressure plasma jets ===
Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are a collection of plasma sources that use a gas flow to deliver the reactive species generated in the plasma to the tissue or sample. The gas used is usually helium or argon, sometimes with a small amount (&lt; 5%) of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixed in to increase the production of chemically reactive atoms and molecules. The use of a noble gas keeps temperatures low, and makes it simpler to produce a stable discharge. The gas flow also serves to generate a region where room air is in contact with and diffusing in to the noble gas, which is where much of the reactive species are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norberg|first=Seth A.|last2=Johnsen|first2=Eric|last3=Kushner|first3=Mark J.|date=2015-01-01|title=Formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by repetitive negatively pulsed helium atmospheric pressure plasma jets propagating into humid air|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0963-0252/24/i=3/a=035026|journal=Plasma Sources Science and Technology|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=035026|doi=10.1088/0963-0252/24/3/035026|issn=0963-0252|bibcode=2015PSST...24c5026N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large variety in jet designs used in experiments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=X|year=2012|title=On atmospheric-pressure non-equilibrium plasma jets and plasma bullets|journal=Plasma Sources Science and Technology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=034005|doi=10.1088/0963-0252/21/3/034005|bibcode=2012PSST...21c4005L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many APPJs use a dielectric to limit current, just like in a DBD, but not all do. Those that use a dielectric to limit current usually consists of a tube made of quartz or alumina, with a high voltage electrode wrapped around the outside. There can also be a grounded electrode wrapped around the outside of the dielectric tube. Designs that do not use a dielectric to limit the current use a high voltage pin electrode at the center of the quartz tube. These devices all generate ionization waves that begin inside the jet and propagate out to mix with the ambient air. Even though the plasma may look continuous, it is actually a series of ionization waves or "plasma bullets".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This ionization wave may or may not treat the tissue being treated. Direct contact of the plasma with the tissue or sample can result in dramatically larger amounts of reactive species, charged species, and photons being delivered to the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norberg|first=Seth A.|last2=Tian|first2=Wei|last3=Johnsen|first3=Eric|last4=Kushner|first4=Mark J.|date=2014-01-01|title=Atmospheric pressure plasma jets interacting with liquid covered tissue: touching and not-touching the liquid|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0022-3727/47/i=47/a=475203|journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=47|pages=475203|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/47/47/475203|issn=0022-3727|bibcode=2014JPhD...47U5203N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of design that does not use a dielectric to limit the current is two planar electrodes with a gas flow running between them. In this case, the plasma does not exit the jet, and only the neutral atoms and molecules and photons reach the sample.

Most devices of this type produce thin (mm diameter) plasma jets, larger surfaces can be treated simultaneously by joining many such jets or by multielectrode systems. Significantly larger surfaces can be treated than with an individual jet. Further, the distance between the device and the skin is to a certain degree variable, as the skin is not needed as a plasma electrode, significantly simplifying use on the patient.
Low temperature plasma jets have been used in various biomedical applications ranging from the inactivation of bacteria to the killing of cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Laroussi, M. “Low Temperature Plasma Jet for Biomedical Applications: A Review”, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 43, pp. 703-711, (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Plasma medicine can be subdivided into three main fields:
# Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure direct plasma for medical therapy
# Plasma-assisted modification of [[Biocompatibility|bio-relevant surfaces]]
# Plasma-based bio-decontamination and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]

===Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma===
One of challenges is the application of non-thermal plasmas directly on the surface of human body or on internal organs.  Whereas for [[surface modification]] and biological decontamination both low-pressure and [[Atmospheric-pressure plasma|atmospheric pressure plasmas]] can be used, for direct therapeutic applications only atmospheric pressure [[plasma source]]s are applicable.

The high [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of plasma is a result of different plasma components: [[electromagnetic radiation]] ([[ultraviolet|UV/VUV]], visible light, [[infrared|IR]], high-frequency electromagnetic fields, etc.) on the one hand and [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s and reactive chemical species, primarily [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], on the other. Besides surgical plasma application like [[argon plasma coagulation]] (APC),&lt;ref&gt;Zenker M, ''Argon plasma coagulation'', [http://www.egms.de/en/journals/dgkh/2008-3/dgkh000113.shtml GMS Krankenhaushyg Interdiszip 2008; 3(1):Doc15 (20080311)]&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on high-intensity lethal plasma effects, first and sporadic non-thermal therapeutic plasma applications are documented in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fridman G, Friedman G, Gutsol A, Shekter AB, Vasilets VN, Fridman A, ''Applied Plasma Medicine'', Plasma Process Polym 5:503-533 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the basic understanding of mechanisms of plasma effects on different components of living systems is in the early beginning.
Especially for the field of direct therapeutic plasma application, a fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms of plasma interaction with living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and tissue is essential as a scientific basis.

== Mechanisms ==
Though many positive results have been seen in the experiments, it is not clear what the dominant mechanism of action is for any applications in plasma medicine. The plasma treatment generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which include free radicals. These species include O, [[Ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Hydroxyl radical|OH]], [[Hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Hydroperoxyl|HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Nitric oxide|NO]], [[Peroxynitric acid|ONOOH]] and many others. This increase the [[oxidative stress]] on cells, which may explain the selective killing of cancer cells, which are already oxidatively stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=David B.|date=2012-01-01|title=The emerging role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in redox biology and some implications for plasma applications to medicine and biology|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0022-3727/45/i=26/a=263001|journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|language=en|volume=45|issue=26|pages=263001|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/45/26/263001|issn=0022-3727|bibcode=2012JPhD...45z3001G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, prokaryotic cells may be more sensitive to the oxidative stress than eukaryotic cells, allowing for selective killing of bacteria.

It is known that electric fields can influence cell membranes from studies on [[electroporation]]. Electric fields on the cells being treated by a plasma jet can be high enough to produce electroporation, which may directly influence the cell behavior, or may simply allow more reactive species to enter the cell. Both physical and chemical properties of plasma are known to induce uptake of nanomaterials in cells. For example, the uptake of 20 nm gold nanoparticles can be stimulated in cancer cells using non-lethal doses of cold plasma. Uptake mechanisms involve both energy dependent endocytosis and energy independent transport across cell membranes &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Zhonglei|last2=Liu|first2=Kangze|last3=Manaloto|first3=Eline|last4=Casey|first4=Alan|last5=Cribaro|first5=George P.|last6=Byrne|first6=Hugh J.|last7=Tian|first7=Furong|last8=Barcia|first8=Carlos|last9=Conway|first9=Gillian E.|date=2018-03-28|title=Cold Atmospheric Plasma Induces ATP-Dependent Endocytosis of Nanoparticles and Synergistic U373MG Cancer Cell Death|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23262-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5298|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-23262-0|pmid=29593309|pmc=5871835|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.5298H}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The role of the immune system in plasma medicine has recently become very convincing. It is possible that the reactive species introduced by a plasma recruit a systemic immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Vandana|last2=Lin|first2=Abraham|last3=Fridman|first3=Alexander|date=2015-10-16|title=Why Target Immune Cells for Plasma Treatment of Cancer|journal=Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=259–268|doi=10.1007/s11090-015-9676-z|issn=0272-4324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Müllberg Speyer - 2.JPG|thumb|240px|An inverter on a free-standing solar plant]]
[[File:Müllberg Speyer - 6 - Rückseite der östlichen Solarpanele.JPG|thumb|240px|Overview of solar-plant inverters]]

A '''power inverter''', or '''inverter''', is an electronic device or circuitry that changes [[direct current]] (DC) to [[alternating current]] (AC).&lt;ref&gt;''The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition'', IEEE Press, 2000,{{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}},  page 588&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The input [[voltage]], output voltage and frequency, and overall [[electrical power|power]] handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry.  The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source.

A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry.
'''Static inverters''' do not use moving parts in the conversion process.

Circuitry that performs the opposite function, converting AC to DC, is called a [[rectifier]].

==Input and output==

===Input voltage===

A typical power inverter device or circuit requires a relatively stable '''DC power source''' capable of supplying enough current for the intended power demands of the system.  The input voltage depends on the design and purpose of the inverter. Examples include:
* 12 V DC, for smaller consumer and commercial inverters that typically run from a rechargeable 12 V lead acid battery or automotive electrical outlet.&lt;ref name="solar_electric"&gt;http://www.solar-electric.com/lib/wind-sun/Pump-Inverter.pdf How to Choose an Inverter for an Independent Energy System&lt;/ref&gt;
* 24, 36 and 48 V DC, which are common standards for home energy systems.
* 200 to 400 V DC, when power is from photovoltaic solar panels. 
* 300 to 450 V DC, when power is from electric vehicle battery packs in vehicle-to-grid systems.
* Hundreds of thousands of volts, where the inverter is part of a [[high-voltage direct current]] power transmission system.

===Output waveform===

An inverter can produce a square wave, modified sine wave, pulsed sine wave, pulse width modulated wave (PWM) or sine wave depending on circuit design. 
The two dominant commercialized waveform types of inverters as of 2007 are modified sine wave and square wave.

There are two basic designs for producing household plug-in voltage from a lower-voltage DC source, the first of which uses a switching [[boost converter]] to produce a higher-voltage DC and then converts to AC. The second method converts DC to AC at battery level and uses a [[Utility frequency|line-frequency]] [[transformer]] to create the output voltage.&lt;ref name="WPI2"&gt;http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042507-092653/unrestricted/MQP_D_1_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Square wave.svg|thumb|120px|Square wave]]

====Square wave====

This is one of the simplest waveforms an inverter design can produce and is best suited to low-sensitivity applications such as lighting and heating. Square wave output can produce "humming" when connected to audio equipment and is generally unsuitable for sensitive electronics.

[[File:Simple sine wave.svg|thumb|120px|Sine wave]]

====Sine wave====

A power inverter device which produces a multiple step sinusoidal AC waveform is referred to as a ''sine wave inverter''. To more clearly distinguish the inverters with outputs of much less distortion than the ''modified sine wave'' (three step) inverter designs, the manufacturers often use the phrase ''pure sine wave inverter''. Almost all consumer grade inverters that are sold as a "pure sine wave inverter" do not produce a smooth sine wave output at all,&lt;ref name="Taylor  –  Moon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor-Moon|first1=Jonathan|title=Alabama Engineering University, Invertors, Prof.dr.Eng. Jonathan Taylor - Moon {{!}} Power Inverter {{!}} Photovoltaic System|journal=Scribd|date=2013|volume=7|issue=Convertor and invertor technologies|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/270206514/Alabama-Engineering-University-Invertors-Prof-dr-Eng-Jonathan-Taylor-Moon|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; just a less choppy output than the square wave (two step) and modified sine wave (three step) inverters. However, this is not critical for most electronics as they deal with the output quite well.

Where power inverter devices substitute for standard line power, a sine wave output is desirable because many electrical products are engineered to work best with a sine wave AC power source.  The standard electric utility provides a sine wave, typically with minor imperfections but sometimes with significant distortion.
 
Sine wave inverters with more than three steps in the wave output are more complex and have significantly higher cost than a modified sine wave, with only three steps,  or square wave (one step) types of the same power handling.  [[Switch-mode power supply]] (SMPS) devices, such as personal computers or DVD players, function on quality modified sine wave power.  AC motors directly operated on non-sinusoidal power may produce extra heat, may have different speed-torque characteristics, or may produce more audible noise than when running on sinusoidal power.

====Modified sine wave ====
The modified sine wave output of such an inverter is the sum of two [[square wave]]s one of which is phase shifted 90 degrees relative to the other.  The result is three level waveform with equal intervals of zero volts; peak positive volts; zero volts; peak negative volts and then zero volts.  This sequence is repeated.  The resultant wave very roughly resembles the shape of a sine wave. Most inexpensive consumer power inverters produce a modified sine wave rather than a pure sine wave.

The waveform in commercially available modified-sine-wave inverters resembles a square wave but with a pause during the polarity reversal.&lt;ref name="WPI2"/&gt; Switching states are developed for positive, negative and zero voltages. Generally, the peak voltage to [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage ratio does not maintain the same relationship as for a sine wave. The DC bus voltage may be actively regulated, or the "on" and "off" times can be modified to maintain the same RMS value output up to the DC bus voltage to compensate for DC bus voltage variations.

The ratio of on to off time can be adjusted to vary the RMS voltage while maintaining a constant frequency with a technique called [[pulse width modulation]] (PWM). The generated gate pulses are given to each switch in accordance with the developed pattern to obtain the desired output. Harmonic spectrum in the output depends on the width of the pulses and the modulation frequency. When operating induction motors, voltage harmonics are usually not of concern; however, harmonic distortion in the current waveform introduces additional heating and can produce pulsating torques.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Malcolm|title=Practical variable speed drives and power electronics |year=2003|publisher=Newnes|location=Oxford|isbn=0080473911|pages=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxW9F9WCixcC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous items of electric equipment will operate quite well on modified sine wave power inverter devices, especially loads that are resistive in nature such as traditional incandescent light bulbs.  Items with a [[switch-mode power supply]] operate almost entirely without problems, but if the item has a mains transformer, this can overheat depending on how marginally it is rated.

However, the load may operate less efficiently owing to the harmonics associated with a modified sine wave and produce a humming noise during operation. This also affects the efficiency of the system as a whole, since the manufacturer's nominal conversion efficiency does not account for harmonics. Therefore, pure sine wave inverters may provide significantly higher efficiency than modified sine wave inverters.

Most AC motors will run on MSW inverters with an efficiency reduction of about 20% owing to the harmonic content. However, they may be quite noisy. A series LC filter tuned to the fundamental frequency may help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windsun.com/Inverters/Inverter_selection.htm|title=Inverter Basics and Selecting the Right Model - Northern Arizona Wind &amp; Sun|author=|date=|website=www.windsun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common modified sine wave inverter topology found in consumer power inverters is as follows:
An onboard microcontroller rapidly switches on and off power [[MOSFET]]s at high frequency like ~50&amp;nbsp;kHz. The MOSFETs directly pull from a low voltage DC source (such as a battery). This signal then goes through step-up transformers (generally many smaller transformers are placed in parallel to reduce the overall size of the inverter) to produce a higher voltage signal. The output of the step-up transformers then gets filtered by capacitors to produce a high voltage DC supply. Finally, this DC supply is pulsed with additional power MOSFETs by the microcontroller to produce the final modified sine wave signal.

===Output frequency===

The AC output frequency of a power inverter device is usually the same as standard power line frequency, 50 or 60 [[hertz]]

If the output of the device or circuit is to be further conditioned (for example stepped up) then the frequency may be much
higher for good transformer efficiency.

===Output voltage===

The AC output voltage of a power inverter is often regulated to be the same as the grid line voltage, typically 120 or 240 VAC at the distribution level, even when there are changes in the load that the inverter is driving.  This allows the inverter to power numerous devices designed for standard line power.

Some inverters also allow selectable or continuously variable output voltages.

===Output power===

A power inverter will often have an overall power rating expressed in [[watt]]s or kilowatts. This describes the power that  
will be available to the device the inverter is driving and, indirectly, the power that will be needed from the DC source.
Smaller popular consumer and commercial devices designed to mimic line power typically range from 150 to 3000 watts.

Not all inverter applications are solely or primarily concerned with power delivery; in some cases the frequency and
or waveform properties are used by the follow-on circuit or device.

==Batteries==

The '''runtime''' of an inverter powered by batteries is dependent on the battery power and the amount of power being drawn from  the inverter at a given time. As the amount of equipment using the inverter increases, the runtime will decrease. In order to prolong the runtime of an inverter, additional batteries can be added to the inverter.&lt;ref&gt;Tripp Lite: Power Inverter FAQ, http://www.tripplite.com/support/inverter-faq&lt;/ref&gt;

When attempting to add more batteries to an inverter, there are two basic options for installation:
;Series configuration: If the goal is to increase the overall voltage of the inverter, one can [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] batteries in a series configuration. In a series configuration, if a single battery dies, the other batteries will not be able to power the load.
;Parallel configuration: If the goal is to increase capacity and prolong the runtime of the inverter, batteries can be connected [[parallel circuit|in parallel]]. This increases the overall [[ampere-hour]] (Ah) rating of the battery set.{{paragraph}} If a single battery is discharged though, the other batteries will then discharge through it. This can lead to rapid discharge of the entire pack, or even an over-current and possible fire. To avoid this, large paralleled batteries may be connected via diodes or intelligent monitoring with automatic switching to isolate an under-voltage battery from the others.

==Applications==

===DC power source usage===
[[Image:Inverter CJC01.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Inverter designed to provide 115 V AC from the 12 V DC source provided in an automobile. The unit shown provides up to 1.2 amperes of alternating current, or enough to power two sixty watt light bulbs.]]

An inverter converts the DC electricity from sources such as [[battery (electrical)|batteries]] or [[fuel cell]]s to AC electricity.  The electricity can be at any required voltage; in particular it can operate AC equipment designed for mains operation, or rectified to produce DC at any desired voltage.

===Uninterruptible power supplies===
An [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) uses batteries and an inverter to supply AC power when mains power is not available. When mains power is restored, a [[rectifier]] supplies DC power to recharge the batteries.

===Electric motor speed control===
Inverter circuits designed to produce a variable output voltage range are often used within motor speed controllers.
The DC power for the inverter section can be derived from a normal AC wall outlet or some other source. Control and 
feedback circuitry is used to adjust the final output of the inverter section which will ultimately determine the 
speed of the motor operating under its mechanical load. Motor speed control needs are numerous and include 
things like: industrial motor driven equipment, electric vehicles, rail transport systems, and power tools.
(See related: [[variable-frequency drive]] )
Switching states are developed for positive, negative and zero voltages as per the patterns given in the switching Table 1.The generated gate pulses are given to each switch in accordance with the developed pattern and thus the output is obtained.

====In refrigeration compressors====
An inverter can be used to control the speed of the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] motor to drive [[variable refrigerant flow]] in a [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] system to regulate system performance. Such installations are known as [[inverter compressor]]s. Traditional methods of refrigeration regulation use single-speed compressors switched on and off periodically; inverter-equipped systems have a [[variable-frequency drive]] that control the speed of the motor and thus the compressor and cooling output. The variable-frequency AC from the inverter drives a [[brushless motor|brushless]] or [[induction motor]], the speed of which is proportional to the frequency of the AC it is fed, so the compressor can be run at variable speeds—eliminating compressor stop-start cycles increases efficiency. A [[microcontroller]] typically monitors the temperature in the space to be cooled, and adjusts the speed of the compressor to maintain the desired temperature. The additional electronics and system hardware add cost to the equipment, but can result in substantial savings in operating costs.&lt;ref name="aia20090410"&gt;{{cite news |title = New and Cool: Variable Refrigerant Flow Systems|url = http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek09/0410/0410p_vrf.htm|accessdate = 2013-08-06|publisher = American Institute of Architects|newspaper = AIArchitect|date = 2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power grid===

They also need a means of detecting the presence of utility power for safety reasons, so as not to continue to dangerously feed power to the grid during a power outage.

[[Synchronverter]]s are inverters that are designed to simulate a rotating generator, and can be used to help stabilize grids. They can be designed to react faster than normal generators to changes in grid frequency, and can give conventional generators a chance to respond to very sudden changes in demand or production.

===Solar===
[[File:Sunny Boy 3000.jpg|thumb|Internal view of a solar inverter. Note the many large capacitors (blue cylinders), used to store energy briefly and improve the output waveform.]]
{{main|Solar inverter|}}

A [[solar inverter]] is a [[balance of system]] (BOS) component of a [[photovoltaic system]] and can be used for both [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]] and [[Stand-alone photovoltaic power system|off-grid]] systems. Solar inverters have special functions adapted for use with [[photovoltaic]] arrays, including [[maximum power point tracking]] and [[anti-islanding]] protection.
[[Solar micro-inverter]]s differ from conventional inverters, as an individual micro-inverter is attached to each solar panel. This can improve the overall efficiency of the system. The output from several micro-inverters is then combined and often fed to the [[electrical grid]].

===Induction heating===
Inverters  convert low frequency main AC power to higher frequency for use in [[induction heating]]. To do this, AC power is first rectified to provide DC power. The inverter then changes the DC power to high frequency AC power. Due to the reduction in the number of DC sources employed, the structure becomes more reliable and the output voltage has higher resolution due to an increase in the number of steps so that the reference sinusoidal voltage can be better achieved. This configuration has recently become very popular in AC power supply and adjustable speed drive applications. This new inverter can avoid extra clamping diodes or voltage balancing capacitors.

There are three kinds of level shifted modulation techniques, namely:
* Phase Opposition Disposition (POD)
* Alternative Phase Opposition Disposition (APOD)
* Phase Disposition (PD)

===HVDC power transmission===
With [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] power transmission, AC power is rectified and high voltage DC power is transmitted to another location. At the receiving location, an inverter in a [[static inverter plant]] converts the power back to AC. The inverter must be synchronized with grid frequency and phase and minimize harmonic generation.

===Electroshock weapons===
[[Electroshock weapon]]s and [[taser]]s have a DC/AC inverter to generate several tens of thousands of V AC out of a small 9 V DC battery. First the 9 V DC is converted to 400–2000 V AC with a compact high frequency transformer, which is then rectified and temporarily stored in a high voltage capacitor until a pre-set threshold voltage is reached. When the threshold (set by way of an airgap or TRIAC) is reached, the capacitor dumps its entire load into a [[pulse transformer]] which then steps it up to its final output voltage of 20–60 kV. A variant of the principle is also used in [[Flash (photography)#Electronic flash|electronic flash]] and [[bug zapper]]s, though they rely on a capacitor-based [[voltage multiplier]] to achieve their high voltage.

=== Miscellaneous ===
Typical applications for power inverters include:
* Portable consumer devices that allow the user to connect a [[battery (electrical)|battery]], or set of batteries, to the device to produce AC power to run various electrical items such as lights, televisions, kitchen appliances, and power tools.
* Use in power generation systems such as electric utility companies or solar generating systems to convert DC power to AC power.
* Use within any larger electronic system where an engineering need exists for deriving an AC source from a DC source.

==Circuit description==
[[Image:Inverter ckt 01cjc.png|thumb|260px|''Top:'' Simple inverter circuit shown with an [[electromechanical switch]] ''and automatic equivalent'' auto-switching device implemented with two transistors and split winding auto-transformer in place of the mechanical switch.]]
[[Image:Squarewave01CJC.png|thumb|260px|Square waveform with fundamental sine wave component, 3rd harmonic and 5th harmonic]]

===Basic design===
In one simple inverter circuit, DC power is connected to a [[transformer]] through the center tap of the primary winding. A switch is rapidly switched back and forth to allow current to flow back to the DC source following two alternate paths through one end of the primary winding and then the other. The alternation of the direction of current in the primary winding of the transformer produces [[alternating current]] (AC) in the secondary circuit.

The electromechanical version of the switching device includes two stationary contacts and a spring supported moving contact. The spring holds the movable contact against one of the stationary contacts and an electromagnet pulls the movable contact to the opposite stationary contact. The current in the electromagnet is interrupted by the action of the switch so that the switch continually switches rapidly back and forth. This type of electromechanical inverter switch, called a [[vibrator (electronic)|vibrator]] or buzzer, was once used in [[vacuum tube]] automobile radios. A similar mechanism has been used in door bells, buzzers and [[tattoo machine]]s.

As they became available with adequate power ratings, [[transistor]]s and various other types of [[semiconductor]] switches have been incorporated into inverter circuit designs. Certain ratings, especially for large systems (many kilowatts) use [[thyristor]]s (SCR). SCRs provide large power handling capability in a semiconductor device, and can readily be controlled over a variable firing range.

The switch in the simple inverter described above, when not coupled to an output transformer, produces a square voltage [[waveform]] due to its simple off and on nature as opposed to the [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] waveform that is the usual waveform of an AC power supply. Using [[Fourier analysis]], [[Periodic function|periodic]] waveforms are represented as the sum of an infinite series of sine waves. The sine wave that has the same [[frequency]] as the original waveform is called the fundamental component. The other sine waves, called ''harmonics'', that are included in the series have frequencies that are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency.

Fourier analysis can be used to calculate the [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD). The total harmonic distortion (THD) is the square root of the sum of the squares of the harmonic voltages divided by the fundamental voltage:
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{THD} =  {\sqrt{V_2^2 + V_3^2 + V_4^2 + \cdots + V_n^2} \over V_1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Advanced designs===
[[Image:H-bridge inverter cjc.png|thumb|right|150px|[[H bridge]] inverter circuit with transistor switches and antiparallel diodes]]
There are many different power circuit [[Topology (electronics)|topologies]] and [[Control system|control strategies]] used in inverter designs. Different design approaches  address various issues that may be more or less important depending on the way that the inverter is intended to be used.

The issue of waveform quality can be addressed in many ways. [[Capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s can be used to [[Electronic filter|filter]] the waveform. If the design includes a [[transformer]], filtering can be applied to the primary or the secondary side of the transformer or to both sides. [[Low-pass filters]] are applied to allow the fundamental component of the waveform to pass to the output while limiting the passage of the harmonic components. If the inverter is designed to provide power at a fixed frequency, a [[Resonance|resonant]] filter can be used. For an adjustable frequency inverter, the filter must be tuned to a frequency that is above the maximum fundamental frequency.

Since most loads contain inductance, feedback [[rectifier]]s or [[Antiparallel (electronics)|antiparallel]] [[diode]]s are often connected across each [[semiconductor]] switch to provide a path for the peak inductive load current when the switch is turned off. The antiparallel diodes are somewhat similar to the ''[[flyback diode|freewheeling diodes]]'' used in AC/DC converter circuits.

Fourier analysis reveals that a waveform, like a square wave, that is anti-symmetrical about the 180 degree point contains only odd harmonics, the 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.  Waveforms that have steps of certain widths and heights can attenuate certain lower harmonics at the expense of amplifying higher harmonics.  For example, by inserting a zero-voltage step between the positive and negative sections of the square-wave, all of the harmonics that are divisible by three (3rd and 9th, etc.) can be eliminated. That leaves only the 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th etc.  The required width of the steps is one third of the period for each of the positive and negative steps and one sixth of the period for each of the zero-voltage steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-334-power-electronics-spring-2007/lecture-notes/ch9.pdf|title=MIT open-courseware, Power Electronics, Spring 2007|author=|date=|website=mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing the square wave as described above is an example of [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM). Modulating, or regulating the width of a square-wave pulse is often used as a method of regulating or adjusting an inverter's output voltage. When voltage control is not required, a fixed pulse width can be selected to reduce or eliminate selected harmonics. Harmonic elimination techniques are generally applied to the lowest harmonics because filtering is much more practical at high frequencies, where the filter components can be much smaller and less expensive. ''Multiple pulse-width'' or ''carrier based'' PWM control schemes produce waveforms that are composed of many narrow pulses. The frequency represented by the number of narrow pulses per second is called the ''switching frequency'' or ''carrier frequency''. These control schemes are often used in variable-frequency motor control inverters because they allow a wide range of output voltage and frequency adjustment while also improving the quality of the waveform.

Multilevel inverters provide another approach to harmonic cancellation. Multilevel inverters provide an output waveform that exhibits multiple steps at several voltage levels. For example, it is possible to produce a more sinusoidal wave by having split-rail [[direct current]] inputs at two voltages, or positive and negative inputs with a central [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. By connecting the inverter output terminals in sequence between the positive rail and ground, the positive rail and the negative rail, the ground rail and the negative rail, then both to the ground rail, a stepped waveform is generated at the inverter output.  This is an example of a three level inverter:  the two voltages and ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rodriguez | first = Jose | authorlink = | title = Multilevel Inverters: A Survey of Topologies, Controls, and Applications | journal = IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 724–738 | publisher = IEEE |date=August 2002 | url = | doi =   10.1109/TIE.2002.801052| id = | accessdate = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More on achieving a sine wave===
[[Electrical resonance|Resonant]] inverters produce sine waves with [[LC circuit]]s to remove the harmonics from a simple square wave. Typically there are several series- and parallel-resonant LC circuits, each tuned to a different harmonic of the power line frequency. This simplifies the electronics, but the inductors and capacitors tend to be large and heavy. Its high efficiency makes this approach popular in large [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]] in data centers that run the inverter continuously in an "online" mode to avoid any switchover transient when power is lost.
(See related: [[Resonant inverter]])

A closely related approach uses a ferroresonant transformer, also known as a [[voltage regulator|constant voltage transformer]], to remove harmonics and to store enough energy to sustain the load for a few AC cycles. This property makes them useful in [[uninterruptible power supply#Offline|standby power supplies]] to eliminate the switchover transient that otherwise occurs during a power failure while the normally idle inverter starts and the mechanical relays are switching to its output.

====Enhanced quantization====
A proposal suggested in ''Power Electronics'' magazine utilizes two voltages as an improvement over the common commercialized technology, which can only apply DC bus voltage in either direction or turn it off. The proposal adds intermediate voltages to the common design. Each cycle sees the following sequence of delivered voltages: v1, v2, v1, 0, −v1, −v2, −v1.&lt;ref name="Hahn"&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Hahn|title=Modifi ed Sine-Wave Inverter Enhanced|url=http://powerelectronics.com/site-files/powerelectronics.com/files/archive/powerelectronics.com/mag/608PET21.pdf|publisher=Power Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three-phase inverters===
[[Image:3-phase inverter cjc.png|thumb|right|180px|Three-phase inverter with wye connected load]]

[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] inverters are used for [[variable-frequency drive]] applications and for high power applications such as [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] power transmission. A basic three-phase inverter consists of three single-phase inverter switches each connected to one of the three load terminals. For the most basic control scheme, the operation of the three switches is coordinated so that one switch operates at each 60 degree point of the fundamental output waveform. This creates a line-to-line output waveform that has six steps. The six-step waveform has a zero-voltage step between the positive and negative sections of the square-wave such that the harmonics that are multiples of three are eliminated as described above. When carrier-based PWM techniques are applied to six-step waveforms, the basic overall shape, or ''envelope'', of the waveform is retained so that the 3rd harmonic and its multiples are cancelled.

[[Image:6-step waveform CJC.png|thumb|left|500px|3-phase inverter switching circuit showing 6-step switching sequence and waveform of voltage between terminals A and C (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 2 states)]]
{{clear}}

To construct inverters with higher power ratings, two six-step three-phase inverters can be connected in parallel for a higher current rating or in series for a higher voltage rating. In either case, the output waveforms are phase shifted to obtain a 12-step waveform. If additional inverters are combined, an 18-step inverter is obtained with three inverters etc. Although inverters are usually combined for the purpose of achieving increased voltage or current ratings, the quality of the waveform is improved as well.

==Size==
Compared to other household electric devices, inverters are large in size and volume. In 2014 Google together with [[IEEE]] started an open competition to build a (much) smaller power inverter, with a $1,000,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.littleboxchallenge.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723134753/https://www.littleboxchallenge.com/ |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early inverters===
From the late nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century, DC-to-AC [[Electric power conversion|power conversion]] was accomplished using [[rotary converter]]s or [[motor-generator]] sets (M-G sets). In the early twentieth century, [[vacuum tubes]] and [[gas-filled tube]]s began to be used as switches in inverter circuits. The most widely used type of tube was the [[thyratron]].

The origins of electromechanical inverters explain the source of the term ''inverter''. Early AC-to-DC converters used an induction or synchronous AC motor direct-connected to a generator (dynamo) so that the generator's commutator reversed its connections at exactly the right moments to produce DC. A later development is the synchronous converter, in which the motor and generator windings are combined into one armature, with slip rings at one end and a commutator at the other and only one field frame. The result with either is AC-in, DC-out. With an M-G set, the DC can be considered to be separately generated from the AC; with a synchronous converter, in a certain sense it can be considered to be "mechanically rectified AC". Given the right auxiliary and control equipment, an M-G set or rotary converter can be "run backwards", converting DC to AC. Hence an inverter is an inverted converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Owen | first = Edward L. | authorlink = | title = Origins of the Inverter | journal = IEEE Industry Applications Magazine: History Department | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–66 | publisher = IEEE | date = January–February 1996 | url = | doi = 10.1109/2943.476602| id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlled rectifier inverters===
Since early transistors were not available with sufficient voltage and current ratings for most inverter applications, it was the 1957 introduction of the [[thyristor]] or [[silicon-controlled rectifier]] (SCR) that initiated the transition to [[solid state electronics|solid state]] inverter circuits.

[[Image:12-pulse inverter cjc.svg|thumb|left|250px|12-pulse line-commutated inverter circuit]]

The ''commutation'' requirements of SCRs are a key consideration in SCR circuit designs. SCRs do not turn off or ''commutate'' automatically when the gate control signal is shut off. They only turn off when the forward current is reduced to below the minimum holding current, which varies with each kind of SCR, through some external process. For SCRs connected to an AC power source, commutation occurs naturally every time the polarity of the source voltage reverses. SCRs connected to a DC power source usually require a means of forced commutation that forces the current to zero when commutation is required. The least complicated SCR circuits employ natural commutation rather than forced commutation. With the addition of forced commutation circuits, SCRs have been used in the types of inverter circuits described above.

In applications where inverters  transfer power from a DC power source to an AC power source, it is possible to use AC-to-DC controlled rectifier circuits operating in the inversion mode. In the inversion mode, a controlled rectifier circuit operates as a line commutated inverter. This type of operation can be used in HVDC power transmission systems and in [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] operation of motor control systems.

Another type of SCR inverter circuit is the current source input (CSI) inverter. A CSI inverter is the [[dual (electronics)|dual]] of a six-step voltage source inverter. With a current source inverter, the DC power supply is configured as a [[current source]] rather than a [[voltage source]]. The inverter SCRs are switched in a six-step sequence to direct the current to a three-phase AC load as a stepped current waveform. CSI inverter commutation methods include load commutation and parallel capacitor commutation. With both methods, the input current regulation assists the commutation. With load commutation, the load is a synchronous motor operated at a leading power factor.

As they have become available in higher voltage and current ratings, semiconductors such as transistors or [[IGBT]]s that can be turned off by means of control signals have become the preferred switching components for use in inverter circuits.

===Rectifier and inverter pulse numbers===
Rectifier circuits are often classified by the number of current pulses that flow to the DC side of the rectifier per cycle of AC input voltage. A [[Rectifier#Half-wave rectification|single-phase half-wave rectifier]] is a one-pulse circuit and a [[Rectifier#Full-wave rectification|single-phase full-wave rectifier]] is a two-pulse circuit. A three-phase half-wave rectifier is a three-pulse circuit and a three-phase full-wave rectifier is a six-pulse circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= | editor=D. R. Grafham and J. C. Hey, editors | others= | title=SCR Manual | year=1972 | url= | accessdate= | edition=Fifth | publisher=General Electric | location=Syracuse, N.Y. USA | language= | id= | pages=236–239 | chapter= | chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With three-phase rectifiers, two or more rectifiers are sometimes connected in series or parallel to obtain higher voltage or current ratings. The rectifier inputs are supplied from special transformers that provide phase shifted outputs. This has the effect of phase multiplication. Six phases are obtained from two transformers, twelve phases from three transformers and so on. The associated rectifier circuits are 12-pulse rectifiers, 18-pulse rectifiers and so on...

When controlled rectifier circuits are operated in the inversion mode, they would be classified by pulse number also. Rectifier circuits that have a higher pulse number have reduced harmonic content in the AC input current and reduced ripple in the DC output voltage. In the inversion mode, circuits that have a higher pulse number have lower harmonic content in the AC output voltage waveform.

'''Protactinium''' (formerly '''protoactinium''') is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Pa''' and [[atomic number]] 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray [[actinide]] metal which readily reacts with [[oxygen]], water vapor and inorganic [[acid]]s. It forms various [[chemical compound]]s in which protactinium is usually present in the [[oxidation state]] +5, but it can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states. Concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust are typically a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some [[uraninite]] ore deposits. Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research, and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent [[nuclear fuel]].

Protactinium was first identified in 1913 by [[Kasimir Fajans]] and [[Oswald Helmuth Göhring]] and named ''brevium'' because of the short [[half-life]] of the specific [[isotope]] studied, i.e. protactinium-234. A more stable isotope of protactinium, &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, was discovered in 1917/18 by [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]], and they chose the name proto-actinium, but the [[IUPAC]] finally named it "protactinium" in 1949 and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers. The new name meant "(nuclear) [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpschapters.org/northcarolina/NSDS/Protactinium.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[actinium]]" and reflected that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium. [[John Arnold Cranston]] (working with [[Frederick Soddy]] and [[Ada Hitchins]]) is also credited with discovering the most stable isotope in 1915, but delayed his announcement due to being called up for service in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH3023&amp;type=P John Arnold Cranston]. [[University of Glasgow]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest-lived and most abundant (nearly 100%) naturally occurring [[isotope]] of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a [[half-life]] of 32,760 years and is a decay product of [[uranium-235]]. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived [[nuclear isomer]] protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of [[uranium-238]]. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of [[thorium]]-233 as part of the chain of events used to produce [[uranium-233]] by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based [[nuclear reactor]]s and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in [[radiometric dating]] of [[sediment]]s which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various geological processes.

==History==
[[File:Mendelejevs periodiska system 1871.png|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'s 1871 periodic table with a gap for protactinium on the bottom row of the chart, between thorium and uranium]]
In 1871, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predicted]] the existence of an element between [[thorium]] and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="Emsley"/&gt; The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below [[tungsten]] in group VI, and thorium below [[zirconium]] in group IV, leaving the space below [[tantalum]] in group V empty and, until the 1950s, [[periodic table]]s were published with this structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s10698-004-5959-9|title=A Revised Periodic Table: With the Lanthanides Repositioned|author=Laing, Michael |journal=[[Foundations of Chemistry]]|volume=7|issue=3|date=2005|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element [[dubnium]].

In 1900, [[William Crookes]] isolated protactinium as an intensely radioactive material from uranium; however, he could not characterize it as a new chemical element and thus named it uranium-X (UX).&lt;ref name="Emsley"&gt;{{cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press|orig-year = 2001|location = Oxford, England, UK|isbn = 0-19-850340-7|chapter = Protactinium|pages = 347–349|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA348|date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Terms in Nuclear Science and Technology|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

==Isotopes==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[uranium]] --&gt;
{{main|Isotopes of protactinium}}
Twenty-nine [[radioisotope]]s of protactinium have been discovered, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa with a [[half-life]] of 32,760 years, &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa with a half-life of 27 days, and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Pa with a half-life of 17.4 days. All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 1.6 days, and the majority of these have half-lives less than 1.8 seconds. Protactinium also has two [[nuclear isomer]]s, &lt;sup&gt;217m&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (half-life 1.2 milliseconds) and &lt;sup&gt;234m&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (half-life 1.17 minutes).&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G.|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|date=2003|pages=3|volume=729|journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]]|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.

The primary [[decay product]]s of isotopes of protactinium lighter than (and including) &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa are [[actinium]] isotopes and the primary decay products for the heavier isotopes of protactinium are [[uranium]] isotopes.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Protactinium is one of the rarest and most expensive naturally occurring elements. It is found in the form of two isotopes – &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, with the isotope &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;Pa occurring in two different energy states. Nearly all natural protactinium is protactinium-231. It is an [[Alpha particle|alpha emitter]] and is formed by the decay of uranium-235, whereas the [[beta particle|beta radiating]] protactinium-234 is produced as a result of [[:File:Decay chain(4n+2, Uranium series).PNG|uranium-238 decay]]. Nearly all uranium-238 (99.8%) decays first to the shorter-lived &lt;sup&gt;234m&lt;/sup&gt;Pa isomer.&lt;ref name=ANL&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/protactinium.pdf Protactinium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307023843/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/protactinium.pdf |date=7 March 2008 }}, Argonne National Laboratory, Human Health Fact Sheet, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Protactinium occurs in [[uraninite]] (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 [[parts-per notation|parts]] &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore.&lt;ref name="Emsley"/&gt; Whereas the usual content is closer to 0.3 ppm&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; (e.g. in [[Jáchymov]], [[Czech Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grosse|first1=A. V.|last2=Agruss|first2=M. S.|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|volume=56|pages=2200|date=1934|doi=10.1021/ja01325a507|issue=10|title=The Isolation of 0.1 Gram of the Oxide of Element 91 (Protactinium)}}&lt;/ref&gt;), some ores from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] have about 3 ppm.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations on the order of one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in [[loam]] soils and clays, such as [[bentonite]].&lt;ref name=ANL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis, Rita (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=1PmjurlE6KkC&amp;pg=PA520 Handbook of elemental speciation II: species in the environment, food, medicine &amp; occupational health, Vol. 2], John Wiley and Sons, pp. 520–521, {{ISBN|0-470-85598-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In nuclear reactors===
Two major protactinium isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, are produced from thorium in [[nuclear reactor]]s; both are undesirable and are usually removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th via (''n'',2''n'') reactions produces &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is a major contributor to the long term [[radiotoxic]]ity of spent nuclear fuel.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Protactinium-233 is formed upon neutron capture by &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th. It further either decays to uranium-233 or captures another neutron and converts into the non-fissile uranium-234.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hébert, Alain|title=Applied Reactor Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sibA5ECQ8LoC&amp;pg=PA265|date=July 2009|publisher=Presses inter Polytechnique|isbn=978-2-553-01436-9|pages=265–}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27 days and high [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] for neutron capture (the so-called "[[neutron poison]]"). Thus instead of rapidly decaying to the useful &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U, a significant fraction of &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa converts to non-fissile isotopes and consumes neutrons, degrading [[neutron economy|the reactor efficiency]]. To avoid this, &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium [[molten salt reactor]]s, during their operation, so that it only decays to &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U. This is achieved using several meters tall columns of molten [[bismuth]] with lithium dissolved in it. In a simplified scenario, lithium selectively reduces protactinium salts to protactinium metal which is then extracted from the molten-salt cycle, and bismuth is merely a carrier. It is chosen because of its low [[melting point]] (271&amp;nbsp;°C), low vapor pressure, good solubility for lithium and actinides, and immiscibility with molten [[halide]]s.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Groult, Henri (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dR2DA50PUV4C&amp;pg=PA562 Fluorinated materials for energy conversion], Elsevier, pp. 562–565, {{ISBN|0-08-044472-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Uraninite-39029.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Protactinium occurs in [[uraninite]] ores.]]
Before the advent of nuclear reactors, protactinium was separated for scientific experiments from uranium ores. Nowadays, it is mostly produced as an intermediate product of [[nuclear fission]] in thorium high-temperature reactors:

:&lt;chem&gt;^{232}_{90}Th + ^{1}_{0}n -&gt; ^{233}_{90}Th -&gt;[\beta^-][22.3\ \ce{min}] ^{233}_{91}Pa -&gt;[\beta^-][26.967\ \ce{d}] ^{233}_{92}U&lt;/chem&gt; &lt;small&gt;(The times are half-lives.)&lt;/small&gt;

Protactinium metal can be prepared by reduction of its [[fluoride]] with [[calcium fluoride]],&lt;ref name=exp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marples|first1=J. A. C.|title=On the thermal expansion of protactinium metal|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica]]|volume=18|pages=815|date=1965|doi=10.1107/S0365110X65001871|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lithium]] or [[barium]] at a temperature of 1300–1400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=super/&gt;&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt;

==Physical and chemical properties==
Protactinium is an [[actinide]] which is positioned in the [[periodic table]] to the left of [[uranium]] and to the right of [[thorium]], and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of [[post-transition metal]]s. The estimated [[shear modulus]] of protactinium is similar to that of [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;Seitz, Frederick and Turnbull, David (1964) [https://books.google.com/books?id=F9V3a-0V3r8C&amp;pg=PA289 Solid state physics: advances in research and applications], Academic Press, pp. 289–291, {{ISBN|0-12-607716-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = Hammond, C.

At room temperature, protactinium crystallizes in the body-centered [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] structure which can be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (''fcc'') upon cooling from high temperature, at about 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=exp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, David A.

Protactinium exists in two major [[oxidation state]]s, +4 and +5, both in solids and solutions, and the +3 and +2 states were observed in some solid phases. As the electron configuration of the neutral atom is [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the +5 oxidation state corresponds to the low-energy (and thus favored) 5f&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; configuration.

Here ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are lattice constants in picometers, No is space group number and ''Z'' is the number of [[formula unit]]s per [[unit cell]]; ''fcc'' stands for the [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] symmetry. Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters.

===Oxides and oxygen-containing salts===
Protactinium oxides are known for the metal oxidation states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=g1268&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1268&lt;/ref&gt; Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO&lt;sub&gt;2.25&lt;/sub&gt;. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt;&lt;ref name=pacl4b/&gt; The black dioxide PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550&amp;nbsp;°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated [[nitric acid|nitric]], [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] or [[sulfuric acid]]s, but easily dissolves in [[hydrofluoric acid]].&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt; The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pacl4b&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elson|first1=R.|last2=Fried|first2=Sherman|last3=Sellers|first3=Philip|last4=Zachariasen|first4=W.

Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides with various metals. With alkali metals ''A'', the crystals have a chemical formula APaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [[perovskite structure]], or A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PaO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and distorted rock-salt structure, or A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;PaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; where oxygen atoms form a hexagonal close-packed lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated.&lt;ref name=g1269&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S056774087100284X|last1=Iyer|first1=P.

Protactinium oxides are [[Basic oxide|basic]]; they easily convert to hydroxides and can form various salts, such as [[sulfate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, etc. The nitrate is usually white but can be brown due to [[radiolysis|radiolytic]] decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400&amp;nbsp;°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide.&lt;ref name=target/&gt; The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with [[phosphoric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900&amp;nbsp;°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as [[hydrofluoric acid]], [[sulfur trioxide]] and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into the diphosphate PaP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups form pyramids of C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. Heating PaP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in air to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.&lt;ref name=papo3/&gt;

===Halides===
Protactinium(V) fluoride forms white crystals where protactinium ions are arranged in pentagonal bipyramids and [[Coordination number|coordinated]] by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.&lt;ref name=g1270&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1270&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PaCl5.svg|thumb|right|Coordination of protactinium (solid circles) and halogen atoms (open circles) in protactinium(V) fluoride or chloride.]]
Protactinium(V) fluoride and protactinium(V) chloride have a polymeric structure of monoclinic symmetry. There, within one polymeric chain, all the halide atoms lie in one graphite-like plane and form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions. The coordination 7 of protactinium originates from the 5 halide atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms belonging to the nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water.&lt;ref name=g1271/&gt; The pentachloride melts at 300&amp;nbsp;°C and sublimates at even lower temperatures.

Protactinium(V) fluoride can be prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with either [[bromine pentafluoride]] or [[bromine trifluoride]] at about 600&amp;nbsp;°C, and protactinium(IV) fluoride is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and [[hydrogen fluoride]] at 600&amp;nbsp;°C; a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove atmospheric oxygen leaks into the reaction.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt;

Protactinium(V) chloride is prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with [[carbon tetrachloride]] at temperature of 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt; The by-products (such as PaOCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are removed by fractional sublimation.&lt;ref name=pacl5/&gt; Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800&amp;nbsp;°C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400&amp;nbsp;°C; it can also be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt;

Protactinium bromides are produced by the action of [[aluminium bromide]], [[hydrogen bromide]], [[carbon tetrabromide]] or a mixture of hydrogen bromide and [[thionyl bromide]] on protactinium oxide. An alternative reaction is between protactinium pentachloride and hydrogen bromide or thionyl bromide.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt; Protactinium(V) bromide has two similar monoclinic forms, one is obtained by sublimation at 400–410&amp;nbsp;°C and another by sublimation at slightly lower temperature of 390–400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pabr5b&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/217737a0|last1=Brown|first1=D.|last2=Petcher|first2=T.

Protactinium iodides result from the oxides and [[aluminium iodide]] or [[ammonium iodide]] heated to 600&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt; Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum.&lt;ref name=g1271/&gt; As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PaF&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions which form a nearly perfect cube.&lt;ref name=g1275/&gt;

More complex protactinium fluorides are also known such as Pa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=g1271&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1271&lt;/ref&gt; and ternary fluorides of the types MPaF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PaF&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. These compounds can be obtained by evaporating a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A similar variation was observed for the M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (M = K, Rb or NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=trif&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asprey|first1=L.

===Other inorganic compounds===
Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of protactinium are known. PaOBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a monoclinic structure composed of double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms.&lt;ref name=pabr5b/&gt; PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural to that of other actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[carbon disulfide]] at 900&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt;

In hydrides and nitrides, protactinium has a low oxidation state of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250&amp;nbsp;°C, and the nitride is a product of ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=pao2/&gt; Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=g1277&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1277&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic compounds===
[[File:Uranocene-3D-balls.png|thumb|upright|The proposed structure of the protactinocene (Pa(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule]]
Protactinium(IV) forms a tetrahedral complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with four [[Cyclopentadienyl complex|cyclopentadienyl]] rings, which can be synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom.&lt;ref name=g1278&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], pp. 1278–1279&lt;/ref&gt; Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is analogous in structure to [[uranocene]]. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two [[cyclooctatetraene]] ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium [[cyclooctatetraene|cyclooctatetraenide]], K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, in [[tetrahydrofuran]].&lt;ref name=cene/&gt;

==Applications==
Although protactinium is located in the periodic table between uranium and thorium, which both have numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research.&lt;ref name=ANL/&gt;

Protactinium-231 arises from the decay of uranium-235 formed in nuclear reactors, and by the reaction &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Th&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2n and subsequent [[beta decay]]. It was once thought to be able to support a nuclear chain reaction, which could in principle be used to build [[nuclear weapon]]s: the [[physicist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Seifritz|de|3=Walter_Seifritz}} once estimated the associated [[critical mass]] as {{val|750|180|u=kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;Seifritz, Walter (1984) ''Nukleare Sprengkörper – Bedrohung oder Energieversorgung für die Menschheit'', Thiemig-Verlag, {{ISBN|3-521-06143-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the possibility of criticality of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa has been ruled out since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ganesan, S. |url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/sept10/researcharticle.pdf |title=A Re-calculation of Criticality Property of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa Using New Nuclear Data|journal=[[Current Science]]|year=1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages= 667–677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of highly sensitive [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]], an application of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa as a tracer in geology and [[paleoceanography]] has become possible. So, the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for [[radiometric dating]] of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of the formation of minerals.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; In particular, its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of [[North Atlantic]] water bodies during the last melting of [[Ice Age]] [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1038/nature02494|display-authors = 4|author = McManus, J.

These elements have 6, 5 and 4 valence electrons and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and protactinium, but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for protactinium. Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;Articles "Protactinium" and "Protactinium-231 – thorium-230 dating" in Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th edition, 1995, p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=H.|title=Uranium-thorium-protactinium dating systematics|journal=[[Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta]]|volume=62|pages=3437|date=1998|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00255-5|bibcode=1998GeCoA..62.3437C|issue=21–22|last2=Edwards|first2=R.Lawrence|last3=Murrell|first3=M.

==Precautions==
Protactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive and thus all manipulations with it are performed in a sealed [[glove box]]. Its major isotope &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa has a [[specific activity]] of {{convert|0.048|Ci|GBq|lk=on}} per gram and primarily emits alpha-particles with an energy of 5&amp;nbsp;MeV, which can be stopped by a thin layer of any material. However, it slowly decays, with a half-life of 32,760 years, into &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, which has a specific activity of {{convert|74|Ci|GBq}} per gram, emits both alpha and beta radiation, and has a much shorter half-life of 22 years. &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, in turn, decays into lighter isotopes with even shorter half-lives and much greater specific activities (SA), as summarized in the table below showing the decay chain of protactinium-231.&lt;ref name=ANL/&gt;

As protactinium is present in small amounts in most natural products and materials, it is ingested with food or water and inhaled with air. Only about 0.05% of ingested protactinium is absorbed into the blood and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 40% of the protactinium
deposits in the bones, about 15% goes to the liver, 2% to the kidneys, and the rest leaves the body. The biological half-life of protactinium is about 50 years in the bones, whereas in other organs the kinetics has a fast and slow component. So in the liver 70% of protactinium have a half-life of 10 days and 30% remain for 60 days. The corresponding values for kidneys are 20% (10 days) and 80% (60 days). In all these organs, protactinium promotes cancer via its radioactivity.&lt;ref name=ANL/&gt;&lt;ref name=target/&gt; The maximum safe dose of Pa in the human body is {{convert|0.03|µCi|kBq|abbr=on}}, which corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa. This isotope is 2.5{{e|8}} times more toxic than [[hydrocyanic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Palshin, E.S. |display-authors = etal|title = Analytical chemistry of protactinium| place =Moscow|publisher = Nauka|date = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum allowed concentrations of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa in the air in Germany is {{val|3|e=-4|u=Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=target&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2008.02.084|last1=Grossmann|date=2008|first1=R.|pages=122|volume=590|last2=Maier|journal=[[Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A]] |first2=H.|last3=Szerypo|first3=J.|last4=Friebel|first4=H.|title=Preparation of 231Pa targets|bibcode = 2008NIMPA.590..122G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Legacy of Luna''''' is a book written by [[Julia Butterfly Hill]] about her experiences while protecting a tree named [[Luna (Redwood Tree)|Luna]]. It is based on a true story, written like a diary of two years spent in an ancient redwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2037 |title= ''The Legacy of Luna'' (review) |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was published by HarperCollins Publishers Inc. in 2000.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of ''The Legacy of Luna'' called ''Luna'' was scheduled to be released in 2010{{update after|2010|12|31}}, directed by [[Deepa Mehta]]. [[Rachel Weisz]] was set to star as Hill and actively worked to get the project off the ground, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mick | last=Brown | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Rachel Weisz talks about starring in A Streetcar Named Desire | date=2009-08-01 | publisher= | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/5931197/Rachel-Weisz-talks-about-starring-in-A-Streetcar-Named-Desire.html | work =Daily Telegraph | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|I flew out to meet her in [[San Francisco]]. She’s a very strange character, a great person, and it’s an incredible story, an inspirational story. I’ve been desperately trying to get that movie together, but right now it’s very hard to get money for dramas, particularly a drama with a female at the centre of it.&amp;nbsp;... If you happen to know of anyone who’s a [[List of philanthropists|philanthropist]] and who’s interested in [[Conservation movement|conservation]]&amp;nbsp;...}}

'''Tungsten silicide''' ('''WSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''') is an inorganic compound, a [[silicide]] of [[tungsten]]. It is an electrically conductive [[ceramic]] material.

==Chemistry==
Tungsten silicide can react violently with substances such as [[strong acid]]s, [[fluorine]], [[oxidizer]]s, and [[interhalogen]]s.

==Applications==
It is used in [[microelectronics]] as a contact material, with [[resistivity]] 60–80&amp;nbsp;μΩ&amp;thinsp;cm; it forms at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. It is often used as a [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] over [[polysilicon]] lines to increase their conductivity and increase signal speed. Tungsten silicide layers can be prepared by [[chemical vapor deposition]], e.g. using [[monosilane]] or [[dichlorosilane]] with [[tungsten hexafluoride]] as source gases. The deposited film is non-[[stoichiometric]], and requires [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] to convert to more conductive stoichiometric form. Tungsten silicide is a replacement for earlier tungsten films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genus.com/cvd/cvd_materials.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20010907092419/http://www.genus.com/cvd/cvd_materials.html |archivedate=2001-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten silicide is also used as a [[barrier layer]] between silicon and other metals, e.g. tungsten.

Tungsten silicide also finds use in [[microelectromechanical systems]] and for [[oxidation]]-resistant coatings.

Films of tungsten silicide can be [[plasma etching|plasma-etched]] using e.g. [[nitrogen trifluoride]] gas.

A '''turbopump''' is a propellant pump with two main components: a [[rotodynamic pump]] and a driving [[gas turbine]], usually both mounted on the same shaft, or sometimes geared together. The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a [[combustion chamber]] or other use.

[[File:M-1 rocket turbopump.JPG|thumb|right|An axial turbopump designed and built for the [[M-1 (rocket engine)|M-1 rocket engine]]]]
There are two types of turbopumps: a [[centrifugal pump]], where the pumping is done by throwing fluid outward at high speed, or an [[axial-flow pump]], where alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid.

Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give relatively modest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial flow pumps work well with low-density fluids. Centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high-density fluids but require large diameters for low-density fluids.

Turbopumps operate in much the same way as [[turbocharger]] units for vehicles: higher fuel pressures allow fuel to be supplied to higher-pressure combustion chambers for higher-performance engines.

==History==
[[File:Rocket engine A4 V2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[V-2 rocket]] used a circular turbopump to pressurize the propellant.]]

===Early development===
High-pressure pumps for larger missiles had been discussed by rocket pioneers such as [[Hermann Oberth]].{{Specify|WHAT OBERTH WORK? (NEUFELD DOESN'T CITE IT)|date=February 2009}} In mid-1935 [[Wernher von Braun]] initiated a fuel pump project at the southwest German firm ''Klein, Schanzlin &amp; Becker'' that was experienced in building large fire-fighting pumps.&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;{{cite book |year=1995 |last=Neufeld|first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael Neufeld |title=The Rocket and the Reich |publisher=The [[Smithsonian Institution]] |isbn=0-674-77650-X |pages=80–1, &lt;!--THESE PAGES DO NOT HAVE INFO USED IN THIS WIKIARTICLE:116, 157--&gt;156, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|80}} &lt;!--NONE OF THE CITED NEUFELD PAGES APPEAR TO SAY THE FOLLOWING: The key idea to use [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({chem|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) to drive the pump came from collaboration with [[Hellmuth Walter]] and the first turbopump-fed rockets produced by the German Army Ordnance were developed for the second version of the [[Heinkel He 112#He_112R|Heinkel He 112]] flown in [[1939]]-[[1940]].

Using turbopumps in rockets was a breakthrough; the power of the rocket motors was increased by an [[order of magnitude]], making the lifting of heavy loads practical.--&gt;

=== Development from 1947 to 1949 ===

The principal engineer for turbopump development at [[Aerojet]] was [[George Bosco]]. During the second half of 1947, Bosco and his group learned about the pump work of others and made preliminary design studies. Aerojet representatives visited [[Ohio State University]] where Florant was working on hydrogen pumps, and consulted [[Dietrich Singelmann]], a German pump expert at Wright Field. Bosco subsequently used Singelmann's data in designing Aerojet's first hydrogen pump.&lt;ref name=nasahistory&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/ch3-18.htm |title=Liquid Hydrogen as a Propulsion Fuel, 1945-1959 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1948, Aerojet had selected centrifugal pumps for both [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. They obtained some German radial-vane pumps from the Navy and tested them during the second half of the year.&lt;ref name=nasahistory/&gt;

By the end of 1948, Aerojet had designed, built, and tested a liquid hydrogen pump (15&amp;nbsp;cm diameter). Initially, it used [[ball bearing]]s that were run clean and dry, because the low temperature made conventional lubrication impractical. The pump was first operated at low speeds to allow its parts to cool down to [[operating temperature]]. When temperature gauges showed that liquid hydrogen had reached the pump, an attempt was made to accelerate from 5000 to 35 000 revolutions per minute. The pump failed and examination of the pieces pointed to a failure of the bearing, as well as the [[impeller]]. After some testing, super-precision bearings, lubricated by oil that was atomized and directed by a stream of gaseous nitrogen, were used. On the next run, the bearings worked satisfactorily but the stresses were too great for the [[brazing|brazed]] impeller and it flew apart. A new one was made by milling from a solid block of [[aluminum]]. The next two runs with the new pump were a great disappointment; the instruments showed no significant flow or pressure rise. The problem was traced to the exit [[Diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]] of the pump, which was too small and insufficiently cooled during the cool-down cycle so that it limited the flow. This was corrected by adding vent holes in the pump housing; the vents were opened during cool down and closed when the pump was cold. With this fix, two additional runs were made in March 1949 and both were successful. Flow rate and pressure were found to be in approximate agreement with theoretical predictions. The maximum pressure was 26 atmospheres ({{cvt|26|atm|MPa psi}}) and the flow was 0.25 kilogram per second.&lt;ref name=nasahistory/&gt;

===After 1949===
The [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle main engine|Main Engine]]'s turbopumps spun at over 30,000 rpm, delivering 150&amp;nbsp;lb (68&amp;nbsp;kg) of liquid hydrogen and 896&amp;nbsp;lb (406&amp;nbsp;kg) of liquid oxygen to the engine per second.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P &amp; Peterson, C.(1992) Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Propulsion. New York: Addison-Wesley {{ISBN|0-201-14659-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centrifugal turbopumps==
{{main|Centrifugal pump}}
[[Image:Centrifugal 2.png|thumb|right|In centrifugal turbopumps a rotating disk throws the fluid to the rim.]]

Most turbopumps are centrifugal - the fluid enters the pump near the axis and the rotor accelerates the fluid to high speed. The fluid then passes through a diffuser which is a progressively enlarging pipe, which permits recovery of the [[dynamic pressure]]. The diffuser turns the high kinetic energy into high pressures (hundreds of [[Bar (unit)|bars]] is not uncommon), and if the outlet [[backpressure]] is not too high, high flow rates can be achieved.

==Axial turbopumps==
{{main|Axial-flow pump}}
[[Image:Axial compressor.gif|thumb|right|Axial compressors]]
Axial turbopumps also exist. In this case the axle essentially has propellers attached to the shaft, and the fluid is forced by these parallel with the main axis of the pump. Generally, axial pumps tend to give much lower pressures than centrifugal pumps, and a few bars is not uncommon. They are, however, still useful – axial pumps are commonly used as "inducers" for centrifugal pumps, which raise the inlet pressure of the centrifugal pump enough to prevent excessive [[cavitation]] from occurring therein.

== Complexities of centrifugal turbopumps ==

Turbopumps have a reputation for being extremely hard to design to get optimal performance. Whereas a well engineered and debugged pump can manage 70–90% efficiency, figures less than half that are not uncommon. Low efficiency may be acceptable in some applications, but in [[rocket]]ry this is a severe problem. Turbopumps in rockets are important and problematic enough that launch vehicles using one have been caustically described as a "turbopump with a rocket attached"–up to 55% of the total cost has been ascribed to this area.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Yulin, et al. Vibration of hydraulic machinery. Berlin: Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common problems include:
#excessive flow from the high-pressure rim back to the low-pressure inlet along the gap between the casing of the pump and the rotor,
#excessive recirculation of the fluid at inlet,
#excessive [[vortex]]ing of the fluid as it leaves the casing of the pump,
#damaging [[cavitation]] to impeller blade surfaces in low-pressure zones.

In addition, the precise shape of the rotor itself is critical.

== Driving turbopumps ==
[[Steam turbine]]-powered turbopumps are employed when there is a source of steam, e.g. the [[boiler]]s of [[steam ship]]s. [[Gas turbine]]s are usually used when electricity or steam is not available and place or weight restrictions permit the use of more efficient sources of mechanical energy.

One of such cases are [[rocket engine]]s, which need to pump [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] into their [[combustion chamber]]. This is necessary for large [[liquid rocket]]s, since forcing the fluids or gases to flow by simple pressurizing of the tanks is often not feasible; the high pressure needed for the required flow rates would need strong and heavy tanks.

[[Ramjet]] motors are also usually fitted with turbopumps, the turbine being driven either directly by external freestream ram air or internally by airflow diverted from combustor entry. In both cases the turbine exhaust stream is dumped overboard.

'''VIRGOHI21''' is an extended region of neutral [[hydrogen]] (HI) in the [[Virgo cluster]] discovered in 2005. Analysis of its internal motion indicates that it may contain a large amount of [[dark matter]], as much as a small [[galaxy]]. Since VIRGOHI21 apparently contains no stars, this would make it one of the first detected [[dark galaxy|dark galaxies]]. Skeptics of this interpretation argue that VIRGOHI21 is simply a [[galactic tide#Galaxy collisions|tidal tail]] of the nearby galaxy [[NGC 4254]].

==Observational properties==
VIRGOHI21 was detected through [[radio telescope]] observations of its neutral hydrogen [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm emissions]]. The detected hydrogen has a mass of about 100 million [[solar mass]]es and is about 50 million [[light-year]]s away.&lt;ref name="PPARC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/d_galaxy2.asp |title=New evidence for a Dark Matter Galaxy |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310211525/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/d_galaxy2.asp |archivedate=2007-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing the [[Doppler shift]] of the emissions, astronomers determined that the gas has a high velocity-profile width; that is, different parts of the cloud are moving at high speed relative to other parts. Follow-up [[Hubble space telescope]] deep observations of the region have detected very few stars (a few hundred).

==Dark galaxy interpretation==
If the high velocity-profile width of VIRGOHI21 is interpreted as [[galaxy rotation curve|rotation]], it is far too fast to be consistent with the gravity of the detected hydrogen. Rather, it implies the presence of a [[dark matter]] halo with tens of billions of solar masses. Given the very small number of stars detected, this implies a mass-to-light ratio of about 500, far greater than that of a normal galaxy (around 50). The large gravity of the dark matter halo in this interpretation explains the perturbed nature of the nearby [[spiral galaxy]] [[NGC 4254]] and the bridge of neutral hydrogen extending between the two entities.

Under this interpretation, VIRGOHI21 would be the first discovery of the [[dark galaxy|dark galaxies]] anticipated by simulations of dark-matter theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Minchin, Robert | author2=Davies, Jonathan | author3=Disney, Michael | author4=Boyce, Peter | author5=Garcia, Diego | author6=Jordan, Christine | author7=Kilborn, Virginia | author8=Lang, Robert | author9=Roberts, Sarah | author10=Sabatini, Sabina | author11=van Driel, Wim | title=A Dark Hydrogen Cloud in the Virgo Cluster | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | date=2005 | volume=622 | issue=1 | pages=L21–L24 | doi=10.1086/429538 | bibcode=2005ApJ...622L..21M|arxiv = astro-ph/0502312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although other dark-galaxy candidates have previously been observed, follow-up observations indicated that these were either very faint ordinary galaxies or tidal tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dark Galaxies or Tidal Debris?

==Tidal tail interpretation==
Sensitive maps covering a much wider area, obtained at [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] (WSRT) and at [[Arecibo Observatory]] revealed that VIRGOHI21 is embedded within a much more extensive tail originating in NGC 4254.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minchin | first1 = R.

The original paper describing VIRGOHI21 as a dark galaxy provides several objections to the tidal-tail interpretation: that high-velocity interactions do not generally produce significant tails, that the high velocity needed is out-of-place in this part of the Virgo cluster and that the observed velocity profile is opposite from that expected in a tidal tail. In addition, according to Robert Minchin of the Arecibo Observatory, "If the hydrogen in VIRGOHI21 had been pulled out of a nearby galaxy, the same interaction should have pulled out stars as well".&lt;ref name ="newscientist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12100-dark-galaxy-continues-to-puzzle-astronomers.html |title=Dark galaxy' continues to puzzle astronomers |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=[[New Scientist]]|author=Stuart Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the tidal-tail interpretation counter these objections with simulations and argue that the apparently inverted velocity profile is due to the orientation of the tail with respect to Earth-based observers.

Although {{as of|2009|lc=on}} the nature of VIRGOHI21 remains a contentious issue, its identification as a dark galaxy seems much less certain now than immediately after its discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10432">[[Image:Paraquat.svg|thumb|220px|[[Paraquat]] is a prominent viologen.]]
'''Viologens''' are organic compounds with the formula (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt;.  In some viologens, the pyridyl groups are further modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = V06624 | title = viologens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viologen [[paraquat]] (R = methyl), is a widely used [[herbicide]].

Other viologens have been commercialized because they can change color reversibly many times through [[Redox|reduction and oxidation]].  The name viologen alludes to violet, one color it can exhibit, and the [[radical ion|radical cation]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is colored intensely blue.

==Types of viologens==
As bi[[pyridinium]] derivatives, the viologens are related to [[4,4'-bipyridyl]].  The basic nitrogen centers in these compounds are [[alkylated]] to give viologens:
:(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 RX   →   [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
The alkylation is a form of [[quaternization]].  When the alkylating agent is a small [[alkyl halide]], such as [[methyl chloride]] and [[methyl bromide]], the viologen salt is often water soluble.  A wide variety of alkyl substituents have been investigated.  Common derivatives are methyl (see paraquat), long chain alkyl, and benzyl.

==Redox properties==
Viologens, in their dicationic form, typically undergo two one-electron reductions.  The first reduction affords the deeply colored radical cation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bockman T. M. |author2=Kochi J. K. | year = 1990 | title = Isolation and oxidation-reduction of methylviologen cation radicals. Novel disproportionation in charge-transfer salts by X-ray crystallography | url = | journal = J. Org. Chem. | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 4127–4135 | doi = 10.1021/jo00300a033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: [V]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   {{EqmR}}  [V]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
The radical cations are blue for 4,4'-viologens and green for 2,2'-derivatives. The second reduction yields a yellow [[Quinone|quinoid]] compounds:
: [V]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   {{EqmR}}  [V]&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

The [[electron transfer]] is fast because the redox process induces little [[chemical structure|structural change]].
[[File:MVredox.png|thumb|180px|[[Redox couple]] for viologen.  The 2+ species on the left is colorless, the 1+ species on the right is deep blue or red, depending on the identity of R.&lt;ref name= Mortimer/&gt;]]

==Research==
Viologens have highly reversible redox reactions, and are relatively inexpensive among redox-active organic compounds.  They are convenient [[colorimetric]] reagents for biochemical redox reactions.

Their tendency to form [[host-guest complex]]es is key to the [[molecular machines]] recognized by the 2016 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].
[[Image:Rotaxane Crystal Structure EurJOrgChem page2565 year1998.png|thumb|Structure of a [[rotaxane]] that has a [[cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene)|cyclobis(paraquat-''p''-phenylene)]] (green), a [[macrocycle|macrocyclic]] bis(viologen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= High Yielding Template-Directed Syntheses of [2]Rotaxanes |year= 1998 |journal= [[Eur.

Fraser |last4= White |first4= Andrew J. P. |last5= Williams |first5= David J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Viologens are used in the negative [[electrolytes]] of some experimental [[flow batteries]]. Viologens have been modified to optimize their performance in such batteries, e.g. by incorporating them into redox-active polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Redox Active Polymers as Soluble Nanomaterials for Energy Storage|authors=Burgess, Mark; Moore, Jeffrey S.; Rodriguez-Lopez, Joaquin|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|year=2016|volume=49|pages=2649-2657|doi=10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viologen [[catalyst]]s have been reported to have the potential to oxidize [[glucose]] and other [[carbohydrate]]s catalytically in a mildly [[alkaline]] solution, which makes direct carbohydrate [[fuel cell]]s possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dean R. Wheeler |author2=Joseph Nichols |author3=Dane Hansen |author4=Merritt Andrus |author5=Sang Choi |author6=Gerald D. Watt  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Viologen Catalysts for a Direct Carbohydrate Fuel Cell | year = 2009 | journal = [[J. Electrochem. Soc.]] | volume = 156 | issue = 10 | pages =  B1201–B1207 | doi = 10.1149/1.3183815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified viologens and related compounds==
[[Diquat]] is an isomer of viologens, being derived from 2,2'-bipyridine (instead of the 4,4'-isomer). It also is a potent herbicide that functions by disrupting electron-transfer.
[[File:Diquat Structural Formula V1.svg|thumb|right|144px|[[Diquat]] is related to viologens but is derived from [[2,2'-Bipyridine|2,2'bipyridine]].]]

Extended viologens have been developed based on [[conjugated system|conjugated]] [[oligomer]]s such as based on [[aryl]], [[ethylene]], and [[thiophene]] units are inserted between the [[pyridine]] units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = W. W. Porter, T. P. Vaid and A. L. Rheingold | title = Synthesis and Characterization of a Highly Reducing Neutral "Extended Viologen" and the Isostructural Hydrocarbon 4,4' '' '-Di-''n''-octyl-''p''-quaterphenyl | year = 2005 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 127 | issue = 47 | pages = 16559–16566 | doi = 10.1021/ja053084q | pmid = 16305245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bipolaron]] di-octyl bis(4-pyridyl)biphenyl viologen '''2''' in ''scheme 2'' can be reduced by [[sodium amalgam]] in [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] to the neutral viologen '''3'''.

[[Image:Viologen reducing agent.png|center|400 px|Scheme 2. Viologen reducing agent]]

The [[resonance structure]]s of the quinoid '''3a''' and the [[biradical]] '''3b''' contribute equally to the hybrid structure. The driving force for the contributing '''3b''' is the restoration of [[aromaticity]] with the [[biphenyl]] unit.  It has been established using [[X-ray crystallography]] that the molecule is, in effect, [[coplanar]] with slight nitrogen [[pyramidalization]], and that the central carbon bonds are longer (144&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]) than what would be expected for a [[double bond]] (136&amp;nbsp;pm). Further research shows that the diradical exists as a mixture of [[diradical|triplet]]s and [[diradical|singlet]]s, although an [[Electron spin resonance|ESR]] signal is absent. In this sense, the molecule resembles [[Non-Kekulé molecule|Tschischibabin's hydrocarbon]], discovered during 1907. It also shares with this molecule a blue color in solution, and a metallic-green color as crystals.

Compound 3 is a very strong [[reducing agent]], with a [[redox potential]] of &amp;minus;1.48&amp;nbsp;V.

== Mechanism of action ==
Viologens with 2,2'-, 4,4'-, or 2,4'-bipyridylium are highly toxic because these bipyridyl molecules readily form stable [[free radicals]].&lt;ref name="Moreland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreland|first1=D. E.|title=Mechanisms of Action of Herbicides|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|date=1 January 1980|volume=31|issue=1|pages=597–638|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[delocalization]] of charge, which allows for the molecule to stay as a free radical and these structures can be easily stabilized because the [[nitrogens]] can be readily hydrogenated. When in the body, these viologens interfere with [[electron transport chain]], often causing [[cell death]].&lt;ref name="Moreland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roede"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roede|first1=J. R.|last2=Miller|first2=G. W.|title=Diquat|journal=Encyclopedia of Toxicology (Third Edition)|date=1 January 2014|pages=202–204|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864543001378|publisher=Academic Press|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-386454-3.00137-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These molecules act as [[redox]] cycling agents and are able to transfer their electron to molecular oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bus|first1=J S|last2=Aust|first2=S D|last3=Gibson|first3=J E|title=Paraquat toxicity: proposed mechanism of action involving lipid peroxidation.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=1 August 1976|volume=16|pages=139–146|issn=0091-6765|doi=10.1289/ehp.7616139|pmc=1475222|pmid=1017417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roede"/&gt; Once the electron has been transferred to the molecular oxygen, it forms a [[superoxide]] radical that causes [[disproportionation]], simultaneous [[Redox|reduction and oxidation]].

These reactive free radicals can cause [[oxidative stress]], which leads to cell death and one example of this is [[lipid peroxidation]]. When in a cellular system, the superoxide radicals react with unsaturated lipids, which contain a reactive hydrogen, and produce lipid hydroperoxides.&lt;ref name="Bus"/&gt; These lipid hydroperoxides then decompose into lipid free radicals, and causes a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, damaging the cellular [[macromolecules]] and eventually causing cell death. The superoxide radicals have also been found to deplete [[NADPH]], alter other redox reactions that naturally occur in the organism, and interfere with how iron is stored and released in the body.&lt;ref name="Roede"/&gt;

== Applications ==
The widely used herbicide [[paraquat]] is a viologen.  This application is the largest consumer of this class of compounds.

Viologens have been commercialized as [[electrochromic]] systems because of their ability to change color reversibly many times upon [[Redox|reduction and oxidation]].  In some applications, N-heptyl viologens are used.  Conducting solid supports such as [[titania (chemistry)|titania]] and [[indium tin oxide]] have been used.&lt;ref name=Mortimer&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Mortimer, R. J.|title=Electrochromic Materials|encyclopedia=Annu. Rev. Mater. Res.|year=2011|volume=41|pages=241–268|doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-062910-100344|bibcode=2011AnRMS..41..241M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17077">The '''water-gas shift reaction''' (WGSR) describes the reaction of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[water vapor]] to form [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrogen]] (the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (not water) is known as [[water gas]]):
: CO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   {{eqm}}  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The water gas shift reaction was discovered by Italian physicist [[Felice Fontana]] in 1780. It was not until much later that the industrial value of this reaction was realized. Before the early 20th century, hydrogen was obtained by reacting steam under high pressure with iron to produce iron, iron oxide and hydrogen.  With the development of industrial processes that required hydrogen, such as the [[Haber–Bosch]] ammonia synthesis, a less expensive and more efficient method of hydrogen production was needed.&lt;ref name="Lamm Catalysts" /&gt;  As a resolution to this problem, the WGSR was combined with the [[Coal gasification|gasification of coal]] to produce a pure hydrogen product.  As the idea of [[hydrogen economy]] gains popularity, the focus on hydrogen as a replacement fuel source for hydrocarbons is increasing.

==Applications==
The WGSR is an important industrial reaction that is used in the manufacture of [[ammonia]], [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[methanol]], and hydrogen. It is also often used in conjunction with [[steam reforming]] of methane and other hydrocarbons. In the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]], the WGSR is one of the most important reactions used to balance the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO ratio. It provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide, which is important for the production of high purity hydrogen for use in ammonia synthesis.

The water-gas shift reaction may be an undesired side reaction in processes involving water and carbon monoxide, e.g. the rhodium-based [[Monsanto process]]. The iridium-based [[Cativa process]] uses less water, which suppresses this reaction.

===Fuel cells===
The WGSR can aid in the efficiency of [[fuel cell]]s by increasing hydrogen production. The WGSR is considered a critical component in the reduction of carbon monoxide concentrations in cells that are susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning such as the [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell|proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell]].&lt;ref name="Lamm Catalysts" /&gt;   The benefits of this application are two-fold: not only would the water gas shift reaction effectively reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide, but it would also increase the efficiency of the fuel cells by increasing hydrogen production.&lt;ref name="Lamm Catalysts" /&gt;  Unfortunately, current commercial catalysts that are used in industrial water gas shift processes are not compatible with fuel cell applications.&lt;ref name=Callaghan /&gt; With the high demand for clean fuel and the critical role of the water gas shift reaction in hydrogen fuel cells, the development of water gas shift catalysts for the application in fuel cell technology is an area of current research interest.

Catalysts for fuel cell application would need to operate at low temperatures. Since the WGSR is slow at lower temperatures where equilibrium favors hydrogen production, WGS reactors require large amounts of catalysts, which increases their cost and size beyond practical application.&lt;ref name="Lamm Catalysts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamm|first=editors, Wolf Vielstich, Hubert Gasteiger, Arnold|title=Handbook of fuel cells : fundamentals, technology, applications|year=2003|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-49926-9|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial LTS catalyst used in large scale industrial plants is also pyrophoric in its inactive state and therefore presents safety concerns for consumer applications.&lt;ref name=Callaghan /&gt; Developing a catalyst that can overcome these limitations is relevant to implementation of a hydrogen economy.

==Reaction conditions==
The equilibrium of this reaction shows a significant temperature dependence and the equilibrium constant decreases with an increase in temperature, that is, higher carbon monoxide conversion is observed at lower temperatures.

===Temperature dependence===
[[File:WGS Keq.fw.png|400px|thumbnail|right|A plot of the temperature dependence of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;, the value of which approaches 1 at {{val|1100|ul=K}}.&lt;ref name=Callaghan /&gt;]]
The water gas shift reaction is a moderately [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic]] reversible reaction. Therefore, with increasing temperature the reaction rate increases but the conversion of reactants to products becomes less favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratnasamy|first=Chandra|author2=Wagner, Jon P. |title=Water Gas Shift Catalysis|journal=Catalysis Reviews|date=September 2009|volume=51|issue=3|pages=325–440|doi=10.1080/01614940903048661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its exothermic nature, high carbon monoxide conversion is [[Thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control|thermodynamically]] favored at low temperatures. Despite the thermodynamic favorability at low temperatures, the reaction is [[Thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control|kinetically]] favored at high temperatures. 
The water-gas shift reaction is [[Chemical equilibrium#Effect of temperature|sensitive to temperature]], with a tendency to shift towards reactants as temperature increases due to [[Le Chatelier's principle]]. Over the temperature range 600–2000&amp;nbsp;K, the equilibrium constant for the WGSR has the following relationship:&lt;ref name=Callaghan /&gt; 
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; K_\mathrm{eq} = 10^{-2.4198 + 0.0003855T + \frac{2180.6}{T}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Practical concerns==
In order to take advantage of both the [[thermodynamics]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of the reaction, the industrial scale water gas shift reaction is conducted in multiple [[adiabatic process|adiabatic stages]] consisting of  a high temperature shift (HTS) followed by a low temperature shift (LTS) with intersystem cooling.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;  The initial HTS takes advantage of the high reaction rates, but is thermodynamically limited, which results in incomplete conversion of carbon monoxide and a 2-4% carbon monoxide exit composition. To shift the equilibrium toward hydrogen production, a subsequent low temperature shift reactor is employed to produce a carbon monoxide exit composition of less than 1%. The transition from the HTS to the LTS reactors necessitates intersystem cooling. Due to the different reaction conditions, different catalysts must be employed at each stage to ensure optimal activity.  The commercial HTS catalyst is the iron oxide–chromium oxide catalyst and the LTS catalyst is a copper-based catalyst. The order proceeds from high to low temperature due to the susceptibility of the copper catalyst to poisoning by sulfur that may remain after the steam reformation process.&lt;ref name=Callaghan /&gt;  This necessitates the removal of the sulfur compounds prior to the LTS reactor by a guard bed in order to protect the copper catalyst. Conversely, the iron used in the HTS reaction is generally more robust and resistant toward poisoning by sulfur compounds. While both the HTS and LTS catalysts are commercially available, their specific composition varies based on vendor. An important limitation for the HTS is the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CO ratio where low ratios may lead to side reactions such as the formation of metallic iron, methanation, carbon deposition, and [[Fischer–Tropsch reaction]].

===Low temperature shift ===
The typical composition of a commercial LTS catalyst has been reported as 32-33% CuO, 34-53% ZnO, 15-33% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Callaghan&gt;{{cite thesis|type=PhD|publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute|last=Callaghan|first=Caitlin|title=Kinetics and catalysis of the water-gas-shift reaction: A Microkinetic and Graph Theoretic Approach|year=2006|url=https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-050406-023806/unrestricted/ccallaghan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active catalytic species is CuO. The function of ZnO  is to provide structural support as well as prevent the poisoning of copper by sulfur. The Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; prevents dispersion and pellet shrinkage.  The LTS shift reactor operates at a range of 200–240&amp;nbsp;°C. The upper temperature limit is due to the susceptibility of copper to thermal sintering. These lower temperatures also reduce the occurrence of side reactions that are observed in the case of the HTS.  Noble metals such as platinum, supported on ceria, have also been used for LTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jain |first1=Rishabh |title=Synthesis of nano-Pt onto ceria support as catalyst for water–gas shift reaction by reactive spray deposition technology |journal=Applied Catalysis A: General |volume=475|pages=461–468|doi=10.1016/j.apcata.2014.01.053|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926860X14000593|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High temperature shift catalysts===
The typical composition of commercial HTS catalyst has been reported as 74.2% Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 10.0% Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.2% MgO (remaining percentage attributed to volatile components).&lt;ref name="Newsome 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newsome|first=David S.|title=The Water-Gas Shift Reaction|journal=Catalysis Reviews: Science and Engineering|year=1980|volume=21|issue=2|pages=275–318|doi=10.1080/03602458008067535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chromium acts to stabilize the iron oxide and prevents [[sintering]]. The operation of HTS catalysts occurs within the temperature range of 310 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C to 450 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The temperature increases along the length of the reactor due to the [[exothermic]] nature of the reaction. As such, the inlet temperature is maintained at 350 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C to prevent the exit temperature from exceeding 550 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. Industrial reactors operate at a range from atmospheric pressure to 8375 kPa (82.7 atm).&lt;ref name="Newsome 1980" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
While the WGSR has been extensively studied for over a hundred years, the mechanism remains under debate. A universal rate expression and mechanistic understanding have proven elusive, reflecting the many reaction variables, vagarities of the catalyst, and the proprietary nature of commercial processes.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith R J|first=Byron|author2=Muruganandam Loganthan |author3=Murthy Shekhar Shantha |title=A Review of the Water Gas Shift Reaction|journal=International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering|year=2010|volume=8|pages=1–32|doi=10.2202/1542-6580.2238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main mechanisms have been proposed: an associative ‘Langmuir–Hinshelwood’ mechanism, and a regenerative ‘redox’ mechanism. While the regenerative mechanism is generally implemented to describe the WGS at higher temperatures, at low temperature both the redox and associative mechanisms are suitable explanations.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe dissertation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giuseppe|first=Brenna|title=NEW CATALYST FOR THE H2 PRODUCTION BY WATER-GAS SHIFT REACTION PROCESSES|journal=Dissertation|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associative mechanism===
In 1920 Armstrong and Hilditch first proposed the associative mechanism. In this mechanism CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are adsorbed onto the surface of the metal catalyst followed by the formation of an intermediate and the desorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the initial step, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociates into a metal adsorbed OH and H. The hydroxide then reacts with CO to form a carboxyl or formate intermediate which subsequently decomposes into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the metal adsorbed H, which ultimately yields H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. While this mechanism may be valid under LTS conditions, the redox mechanism which does not involve any long lived surface intermediates is a more suitable explanation of the WGS mechanism at higher temperatures.

===Redox mechanism===
The regenerative ‘redox’ mechanism is the most commonly accepted mechanism for the WGSR. It involves a regenerative change in the oxidation state of the catalytic metal. In this mechanism, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is activated first by the abstraction of H from water followed by dissociation or disproportionation of the resulting OH to afford atomic O. The CO is then oxidized by the atomic O forming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which returns the catalytic surface back to its pre-reaction state. Alternatively, CO may be directly oxidized by the OH to form a carboxyl intermediate, followed by the dissociation or disproportionation of the carboxyl. Finally H is recombined to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are desorbed from the metal. The principal difference in these mechanisms is the formation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The redox mechanism generates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by reaction with adsorbed oxygen, while the associative mechanism forms CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via the dissociation of an intermediate. The mechanism of [[decarboxylation]] is debated; it may involve [[β-hydride elimination]], or it may require the action of an external base.

===Homogeneous models===
[[Metal carbonyl]]s catalyze the WGSR in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=G.|author2=B. H. Davis |title=Low temperature water-gas shift catalysts|journal=Catalysis|year=2007|volume=20|pages=122–285|doi=10.1039/B601305H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism entails nucleophilic attack of water or hydroxide on a M-CO center, generating a [[metallacarboxylic acid]].&lt;ref name="Lamm Catalysts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barakat|first=Tarek|author2=Rooke, Joanna C. |author3=Genty, Eric |author4=Cousin, Renaud |author5=Siffert, Stéphane |author6= Su, Bao-Lian |title=Gold catalysts in environmental remediation and water-gas shift technologies|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=1 January 2013|volume=6|issue=2|pages=371|doi=10.1039/c2ee22859a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamics===
The WGSR is [[exergonic]], with the following [[thermodynamic parameters]] at room temperature (298 K):
:{|class=wikitable
![[Thermodynamic free energy|Free energy]]
|ΔG&lt;sup&gt;⊖&lt;/sup&gt; = –6.82 kcal 
|-
![[Enthalpy]]
|ΔH&lt;sup&gt;⊖&lt;/sup&gt; = –9.84 kcal
|-
![[Entropy]]
|ΔS&lt;sup&gt;⊖&lt;/sup&gt; = –10.1 cal/deg
|}

In aqueous solution, the reaction is less exergonic.&lt;ref&gt;King, A. D.; King, R. B.; Yang, D. B., "Homogeneous catalysis of the water gas shift reaction using iron pentacarbonyl", J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, vol. 102, pp. 1028-1032. {{DOI|10.1021/ja00523a020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse water-gas shift==
[[Image:In-Situ Resource Utilization Testbed.gif|right|thumb|250px|ISRU RWGS testbed (NASA KSC)]]
[[File:RWGS reactor flowchart.png|420px|thumbnail|right|Reverse water-gas shift flow cycle]]
Depending on the reaction conditions, the equilibrium for the water gas shift can be pushed in either the forward or reverse direction. The reversibility of the WGSR is important in the production of ammonia, methanol, and [[Fischer–Tropsch]] synthesis where the ratio of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO is critical. The RWGS reaction is also gaining interest in the context of the human missions to Mars primarily for its potential to produce water and oxygen.&lt;ref name="RWGS process"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlow|first=Jonathan E.|author2=Parish |title=Operation, Modeling and Analysis of the Reverse Water Gas Shift Process|year=2003|doi=10.1063/1.1541409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zubrin|first=R.|title=[[The Case for Mars]]|page=153 | isbn = 0-684-83550-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mars atmosphere is about 95% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which can be utilized by the RWGS reaction given a source of hydrogen. Coupling the RWGS with the [[water electrolysis]] process will yield methane and oxygen. Post electrolysis, the hydrogen produced can be recycled back into the RWGS reactor for the continued conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Because this reaction is only mildly [[endothermic]], the thermal power needed to drive this reaction can potentially be produced by a [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier reactor]].

Each tiny cube (such as the one representing biological water) corresponds to approximately 1,000 km³ of water, with a mass of about 1 trillion tonnes (200,000 times that of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] or five times that of [[Lake Kariba]], arguably the heaviest man-made object).

}}

Water is distributed across earth. Most [[water]] in the Earth's atmosphere and crust comes from the [[world ocean]]'s saline [[seawater]], while [[freshwater]] accounts for only 2.5% of the total. Because the oceans that cover roughly 78% of the area of the Earth reflect blue light, the [[Earth]] appears blue from space, and is often referred to as the ''blue [[planet]]'' and the ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]''. An estimated 1.5 to 11 times the amount of water in the oceans may be found hundreds of miles deep within the Earth's interior, although not in liquid form.

The [[oceanic crust]] is young, thin and dense, with none of the rocks within it dating from any older than the breakup of [[Pangaea]]. Because water is much denser than any [[gas]], this means that water will flow into the "depressions" formed as a result of the high density of oceanic crust. (On a planet like [[Venus]], with no water, the depressions appear to form a vast plain above which rise plateaux). Since the low density rocks of the [[continental crust]] contain large quantities of easily eroded salts of the [[alkali metals|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], salt has, over [[Origin of water on Earth|billions of years]], accumulated in the oceans as a result of [[evaporation]] returning the fresh water to land as [[rain]] and [[snow]].

As a result, the vast bulk of the water on Earth is regarded as ''saline'' or ''salt water'', with an average [[salinity]] of 35‰ (or 3.5%, roughly equivalent to 34 grams of salts in 1&amp;nbsp;kg of seawater), though this varies slightly according to the amount of [[runoff (water)|runoff]] received from surrounding land. In all, water from oceans and marginal seas, saline [[groundwater]] and water from saline [[closed lake]]s amount to over 97% of the water on Earth, though no closed [[lake]] stores a globally significant amount of water. ''Saline'' groundwater is seldom considered except when evaluating water quality in arid regions.

The remainder of the Earth's water constitutes the planet's ''fresh water'' resource. Typically, fresh water is defined as water with a salinity of ''less than 1 percent that of the oceans'' - i.e. below around 0.35‰. Water with a salinity between this level and 1‰ is typically referred to as ''marginal water'' because it is marginal for many uses by humans and animals. The ratio of salt water to fresh water on Earth is around 40 to 1.

The planet's fresh water is also very unevenly distributed. Although in warm periods such as the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleogene]] when there were no glaciers anywhere on the planet all fresh water was found in rivers and streams, today most fresh water exists in the form of ice, snow, groundwater and soil moisture, with only 0.3% in liquid form on the surface. Of the liquid surface fresh water, 87% is contained in lakes, 11% in swamps, and only 2% in rivers. Small quantities of water also exist in the atmosphere and in living beings. Of these sources, only river water is generally valuable.

Most lakes are in very inhospitable regions such as the glacial lakes of [[Canada]], [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Russia]], [[Lake Khövsgöl]] in [[Mongolia]], and the [[African Great Lakes]]. The [[North America]]n [[Great Lakes]], which contain 21% of the world's fresh water by volume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/basicinfo.html |title=Great Lakes&amp;nbsp;– U.S. EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111122929/http://biology.usgs.gov/luhna/chap6.html |url=http://biology.usgs.gov/luhna/chap6.html |archivedate=2012-01-11 |title=LUHNA Chapter 6: Historical Landcover Changes in the Great Lakes Region |publisher=Biology.usgs.gov |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fereidoun|last=Ghassemi| year=2007|title=Inter-basin water transfer| publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-86969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the exception. They are located in a hospitable region, which is heavily populated. The [[Great Lakes Basin]] is home to 33 million people.&lt;ref name="envCanada"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/grandslacs-greatlakes/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=B4E65F6F-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101103624/http://www.ec.gc.ca/grandslacs-greatlakes/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=B4E65F6F-1 |archivedate=2015-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canada|Canadian]] cities of [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], [[St. Catharines]], [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara]], [[Oshawa]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Barrie]], and the [[United States of America|United States]] cities of [[Duluth]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Chicago]], [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], are all located on shores of the Great Lakes.

Although the total volume of groundwater is known to be much greater than that of river runoff, a large proportion of this groundwater is saline and should therefore be classified with the saline water above. There is also a lot of [[Fossil water|''fossil'' groundwater]] in arid regions that has never been renewed for thousands of years; this must not be seen as renewable water.

However, fresh groundwater is of great value, especially in arid countries such as India. Its distribution is broadly similar to that of surface river water, but it is easier to store in hot and dry climates because groundwater storages are much more shielded from evaporation than are [[dam]]s. In countries such as [[Yemen]], groundwater from erratic rainfall during the rainy season is the major source of [[irrigation]] water.

Because [[groundwater recharge]] is much more difficult to accurately measure than [[surface runoff]], groundwater is not generally used in areas where even fairly limited levels of surface water are available. Even today, estimates of total groundwater recharge vary greatly for the same region depending on what source is used, and cases where fossil groundwater is [[water exploitation|exploited]] beyond the recharge rate (including the [[Ogallala Aquifer]]&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, Marc; ''Cadillac Desert: The American West and its Disappearing Water''; pp. 438-442. {{ISBN|0-14-017824-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are very frequent and almost always not seriously considered when they were first developed.

== Distribution of saline and fresh water ==

The total volume of water on Earth is estimated at 1.386 billion km³ (333 million cubic miles), with 97.5% being salt water and 2.5% being fresh water. Of the fresh water, only 0.3% is in liquid form on the surface.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091601/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html Where is Earth's water?], [[United States Geological Survey]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakins, B.W. and G.F.

Gleick, Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the lower mantle of inner earth may hold as much as 5 times more water than all surface water combined (all oceans, all lakes, all rivers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harder|first=Ben|title=Inner Earth May Hold More Water Than the Seas|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/03/0307_0307_waterworld.html|work=National Geographic|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of river water==
The total volume of water in rivers is estimated at 2,120&amp;nbsp;km³ (510 cubic miles), or 2% of the surface fresh water on Earth.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; Rivers and basins are often compared not according to their static volume, but to their flow of water, or [[surface runoff]]. The distribution of river runoff across the Earth's surface is very uneven.

There can be huge variations within these regions.

H.; ''Australia’s surface water resources''. {{ISBN|978-0-644-02617-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, even in well-watered continents, there are areas that are extremely short of water, such as [[Texas]] in North America, whose renewable water supply totals only 26&amp;nbsp;km³/year in an area of 695,622&amp;nbsp;km², or [[South Africa]], with only 44&amp;nbsp;km³/year in 1,221,037&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The areas of greatest concentration of renewable water are:

* The [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco River|Orinoco]] Basins (a total of 6,500&amp;nbsp;km³/year or 15 percent of global runoff)

== Variability of water availability ==

Variability of water availability is important both for the functioning of aquatic species and also for the availability of water for human use: water that is only available in a few wet years must not be considered renewable. Because most global runoff comes from areas of very low climatic variability, the total global runoff is generally of low variability.

Indeed, even in most arid zones, there tends to be few problems with variability of runoff because most usable sources of water come from high mountain regions which provide highly reliable glacier melt as the chief source of water, which also comes in the summer peak period of high demand for water. This historically aided the development of many of the great [[civilization]]s of ancient history, and even today allows for agriculture in such productive areas as the [[San Joaquin Valley]].

However, in [[Australia]] and [[Southern Africa]], the story is different. Here, runoff variability is much higher than in other continental regions of the world with similar climates.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, T.A. and Finlayson, B.L.; Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges. {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically temperate ([[Köppen climate classification]] C) and arid (Köppen climate classification B) climate rivers in Australia and Southern Africa have as much as three times the coefficient of variation of runoff of those in other continental regions.&lt;ref name="PMF"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peel, Murray C. |author2=McMahon, Thomas A. |author3=Finlayson, Brian L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004 |title=Continental differences in the variability of annual runoff: update and reassessment |journal=[[Journal of Hydrology]] |volume=295 |issue=1–4 |pages=185–197 |doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.03.004|bibcode=2004JHyd..295..185P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that, whereas all other continents have had their soils largely shaped by [[Quaternary]] [[glaciation]] and [[orogeny|mountain building]], soils of Australia and Southern Africa have been largely unaltered since at least the early [[Cretaceous]] and generally since the previous [[ice age]] in the [[Carboniferous]]. Consequently, available nutrient levels in Australian and Southern African soils tend to be orders of magnitude lower than those of similar climates in other continents, and native flora compensate for this through much higher rooting densities (e.g. [[proteoid root]]s) to absorb minimal [[phosphorus]] and other nutrients. Because these roots absorb so much water, runoff in typical Australian and Southern African rivers does not occur until about 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12&amp;nbsp;inches) or more of rainfall has occurred. In other continents, runoff will occur after quite light rainfall due to the low rooting densities.

The consequence of this is that many rivers in Australia and Southern Africa (as compared to ''extremely few'' in other continents) are theoretically impossible to regulate because rates of evaporation from dams mean a storage sufficiently large to theoretically regulate the river to a given level would actually allow very little draft to be used. Examples of such rivers include those in the [[Lake Eyre Basin]]. Even for other Australian rivers, a storage three times as large is needed to provide a third the supply of a comparable climate in southeastern North America or southern China. It also affects aquatic life, favouring strongly those species able to reproduce rapidly after high [[flood]]s so that some will survive the next drought.

Tropical (Köppen climate classification A) climate rivers in Australia and Southern Africa do not, in contrast, have markedly lower runoff ratios than those of similar climates in other regions of the world. Although soils in tropical Australia and southern Africa are even poorer than those of the arid and temperate parts of these continents, vegetation can use organic phosphorus or phosphate dissolved in rainwater as a source of the nutrient. In cooler and drier climates these two related sources tend to be virtually useless, which is why such specialised means are needed to extract the most minimal phosphorus.

There are other isolated areas of high runoff variability, though these are basically due to erratic rainfall rather than different hydrology. These include:&lt;ref name="PMF"/&gt;

* The [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]]

{{Infobox yttrium}}

'''Yttrium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Y''' and [[atomic number]] 39. It is a silvery-metallic [[transition metal]] chemically similar to the [[lanthanide]]s and has often been classified as a "[[rare-earth element]]".&lt;ref name="IUPAC1" /&gt; Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in [[rare-earth mineral]]s, and is never found in nature as a free element. &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y is the only stable [[isotope]], and the only isotope found in the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]].

In 1787, [[Carl Axel Arrhenius]] found a new mineral near [[Ytterby]] in [[Sweden]] and named it ''[[gadolinite|ytterbite]]'', after the village. [[Johan Gadolin]] discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789,&lt;ref name="Krogt" /&gt; and [[Anders Gustaf Ekeberg]] named the new [[oxide]] ''[[yttria]]''. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by [[Friedrich Wöhler]].&lt;ref name="CRC2008" /&gt;

The most important uses of yttrium are [[LED]]s and [[phosphor]]s, particularly the red phosphors in television set [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; Yttrium is also used in the production of [[electrode]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, [[electronic filters]], [[laser]]s, [[superconductor]]s, various medical applications, and [[Trace element|tracing]] various materials to enhance their properties.

Yttrium has no known [[Biology|biological]] role. Exposure to yttrium compounds can cause [[Respiratory disease|lung disease]] in humans.&lt;ref name="osha" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Properties===
Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline [[transition metal]] in [[group 3 element|group 3]]. As expected by [[periodic trend]]s, it is less [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than its predecessor in the group, [[scandium]], and less electronegative than the next member of [[period 5 element|period 5]], [[zirconium]]; additionally, it is more electronegative to its successor in its group, [[lanthanum]], being closer in electronegativity to the later [[lanthanide]]s due to the [[lanthanide contraction]].&lt;ref name ="Greenwood1997p946" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite book|url = http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elements.pdf|title = The Elements|chapter=Yttrium|author = Hammond, C. R.|accessdate = 2008-08-26|publisher = [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]|pages = 4–33|format=pdf|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626181434/http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elements.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008|deadurl=yes|isbn = 978-0-04-910081-7|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yttrium is the first [[d-block]] element in the fifth period.

The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] of a protective oxide ({{chem|Y|2|O|3}}) film that forms on the surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] when yttrium is heated to 750&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] in [[water vapor]].&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt; When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or [[swarf|turnings]] of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="CRC2008" /&gt; [[Yttrium nitride]] (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt;

===Similarity to the lanthanides===
{{details|Rare-earth element}}
The similarities of yttrium to the [[lanthanide]]s are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a [[rare-earth element]],&lt;ref name="IUPAC1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is always found in nature together with them in [[rare-earth mineral]]s.&lt;ref name="Emsley498"&gt;[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, [[scandium]],&lt;ref name="ECE810"&gt;[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 810.&lt;/ref&gt; and if physical properties were plotted against [[atomic number]], it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides [[gadolinium]] and [[erbium]].&lt;ref name="ECE815"&gt;[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt;

It often also falls in the same range for reaction order,&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt; resembling [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] in its chemical reactivity.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves as if it were one of them.&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p945"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the [[lanthanide contraction]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p1234"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively [[valency (chemistry)|trivalent]], whereas about half the lanthanides can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in aqueous solution ([[cerium|Ce&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[samarium|Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[europium|Eu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]], and [[ytterbium|Yb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]]).&lt;ref name="ECE817"&gt;[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 817&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compounds and reactions===
{{category see also|Yttrium compounds}}

As a trivalent transition metal, yttrium forms various [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic compounds]], generally in the oxidation state of +3, by giving up all three of its [[valence electron]]s.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p948"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=948}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is [[yttrium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Y|2|O|3}}), also known as yttria, a six-[[coordinate covalent bond|coordinate]] white solid.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p947"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yttrium forms a water-insoluble [[fluoride]], [[hydroxide]], and [[oxalate]], but its [[bromide]], [[chloride]], [[iodide]], [[nitrate]] and [[sulfate]] are all [[solubility|soluble]] in water.&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt; The Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]] is colorless in solution because of the absence of electrons in the d and f [[electron shell]]s.&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt;

[[Water]] readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form {{chem|Y|2|O|3}}.&lt;ref name="Emsley498" /&gt; Concentrated [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]s do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt;

With [[halogen]]s, yttrium forms [[halide|trihalides]] such as [[yttrium(III) fluoride]] ({{chem|YF|3}}), [[yttrium(III) chloride]] ({{chem|YCl|3}}), and [[yttrium(III) bromide]] ({{chem|YBr|3}}) at temperatures above roughly 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="osha" /&gt; Similarly, [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[selenium]], [[silicon]] and [[sulfur]] all form [[binary compound]]s with yttrium at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt;

[[Hapticity]] is a term to describe the coordination of a group of contiguous atoms of a [[ligand]] bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character ''eta'', η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where [[carborane|carboranyl]] ligands were bound to a d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-metal center through a η&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-hapticity.&lt;ref name="Schumann" /&gt; Vaporization of the [[graphite intercalation compound]]s graphite–Y or graphite–{{chem|Y|2|O|3}} leads to the formation of [[endohedral fullerene]]s such as Y@C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; [[Electron spin resonance]] studies indicated the formation of Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and (C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ion pairs.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; The [[carbide]]s Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, and YC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be hydrolyzed to form [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name="ECE817" /&gt;

===Isotopes and nucleosynthesis===
{{main|Isotopes of yttrium}}
Yttrium in the [[Solar System]] was created through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], mostly by the [[s-process]] (≈72%), but also by the [[r-process]] (≈28%).&lt;ref name="Pack"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume = 71|issue = 18|date = 2007|doi = 10.1016/j.gca.2007.07.010|title = Geo- and cosmochemistry of the twin elements yttrium and holmium|first = Andreas|last = Pack|author2 = Sara S.

The s-process is a slow [[neutron]] capture of lighter elements inside pulsating [[red giant]] stars.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mira 1997.jpg|thumb|alt=Grainy irregular shaped yellow spot with red rim on a black background|[[Mira]] is an example of the type of red giant star where most of the yttrium in the solar system was created]]
Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the [[nuclear fission]] of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In the context of [[nuclear waste]] management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are &lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;Y and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y, with half-lives of 58.51&amp;nbsp;days and 64&amp;nbsp;hours, respectively.&lt;ref name="NNDC" /&gt; Though &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y has a short half-life, it exists in [[secular equilibrium]] with its long-lived parent isotope, [[strontium-90]] (&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr) with a half-life of 29&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="CRC2008" /&gt;

All group 3 elements have an odd [[atomic number]], and therefore few stable [[isotope]]s.&lt;ref name ="Greenwood1997p946"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scandium]] has one [[stable isotope]], and yttrium itself has only one stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y, which is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide [[rare earths]] contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be, due in part to the s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by [[beta decay|electron emission]] (neutron → proton).&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Essentially, a [[neutron]] becomes a [[proton]] while an [[electron]] and [[antineutrino]] are emitted.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with [[atomic mass number]]s (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;
See: [[magic number (physics)|magic number]]. This stability is thought to result from their very low [[neutron cross-section|neutron-capture cross-section]]. {{harv|Greenwood|1997|pp=12–13}}. Electron emission of isotopes with those mass numbers is simply less prevalent due to this stability, resulting in them having a higher abundance.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC2008"&gt;{{Cite book|author = CRC contributors|editor = Lide, David R.|chapter = Yttrium

==History==
In 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist [[Carl Axel Arrhenius]] found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of [[Ytterby]] (now part of the [[Stockholm Archipelago]]).&lt;ref name="Krogt" /&gt; Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element [[tungsten]],&lt;ref name="Emsley496"&gt;[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; he named it ''ytterbite''&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Ytterbite'' was named after the village it was discovered near, plus the -ite ending to indicate it was a mineral.&lt;/ref&gt; and sent samples to various chemists for analysis.&lt;ref name="Krogt"&gt;[[#Krogt|Van der Krogt 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johan Gadolin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|alt= Black and white bust painting of a young man with neckerchief in a coat. The hair is only faintly painted and looks grey.|[[Johan Gadolin]] discovered yttrium oxide]]
[[Johan Gadolin]] at the [[University of Åbo]] identified a new oxide (or "[[Earth (chemistry)|earth]]") in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gadolin1794|Gadolin 1794]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[#Stwertka1998|Stwertka 1998]], p. 115 says that the identification occurred in 1789 but is silent on when the announcement was made. [[#Krogt|Van der Krogt 2005]] cites the original publication, with the year [[#Gadolin1794|1794, by Gadolin]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Gustaf Ekeberg]] confirmed the identification in 1797 and named the new oxide ''yttria''.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p944"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=944}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades after [[Antoine Lavoisier]] developed the first modern definition of [[chemical element]]s, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been ''yttrium''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Earths were given an -a ending and new elements are normally given an -ium ending&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] found that samples of yttria contained three oxides: white [[yttrium oxide]] (yttria), yellow [[terbium(III,IV) oxide|terbium oxide]] (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored [[erbium oxide]] (called 'terbia' at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|volume=60

The great geochemical divide of the rare earths into the "cerium group" and the "yttrium group" was exemplified by the original discoveries of ceria in 1803, and of yttria in 1794. What could be called "1794 yttria" is equivalent to the xenotime and Longnan ionic clay compositions, about two thirds being yttrium oxide by weight, and approximately 4–7% of each of the even-Z heavy lanthanides and 0.5 to 1.5% of the odd-Z heavy lanthanides, in accordance with the Oddo-Harkins Rule.  Rare earth orebody compositions today can be seen to be linear-combinations of the 1794-Yttria and 1803-Ceria compositions, to a first approximation. This is true for acidic rock environments. Alkalic rocks are low in yttria, and have a distorted ceria composition, enriched in lanthanum accompanying a lower relative neodymium content. The composition of the Earth's crust, as exemplified by shale composites, North American or Australian, shows the rare earth content to be about 80% of 1803-Ceria and about 20% of 1794-Yttria. --&gt;

Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 1952

{{As of|2018|April}} there are reports of the discovery of very large reserves of rare-earth elements on a tiny Japanese island. [[Minami-Tori-shima|Minami-Torishima Island]], also known as Marcus Island, is described as having "tremendous potential" for rare-earth elements and yttrium (REY), according to a study published in Scientific Reports.

"This REY-rich mud has great potential as a rare-earth metal resource because of the enormous amount available and its advantageous mineralogical features," the study reads. The study shows that more than 16 million tons of rare-earth elements could be "exploited in the near future."

Including ytrrium (Y), which is used in products like camera lenses and mobile phone screens, the rare-earth elements found are: Europium (EU), Terbium (Tb) and Dysprosium (Dy).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/04/19/treasure-island-rare-metals-discovery-on-remote-pacific-atoll-is-worth-billions-dollars.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
Since yttrium is chemically so similar to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores ([[rare-earth mineral]]s) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the distinction is not perfect. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower [[atomic mass]].&lt;ref name="Morteani"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = European Journal of Mineralogy |date = 1991|volume = 3|issue = 4|pages = 641–650|url = http://eurjmin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/3/4/641|title = The rare earths; their minerals, production and technical use|first = Giulio|last = Morteani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanazawaa"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Alloys and Compounds|date = 2006|volume = 408–412|pages = 1339–1343|doi = 10.1016/j.jallcom.2005.04.033|title = Rare earth minerals and resources in the world|first = Yasuo|last = Kanazawa|author2=Kamitani, Masaharu  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method for obtaining pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in [[sulfuric acid]] and fractionate it by [[ion exchange]] [[chromatography]]. With the addition of [[oxalic acid]], the yttrium oxalate precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[yttrium fluoride]] is obtained.&lt;ref name="Holleman" /&gt;  When quaternary ammonium salts are used as extractants, most yttrium will remain in the aqueous phase.  When the [[Counterion|counter-ion]] is nitrate, the light lanthanides are removed, and when the counter-ion is thiocyanate, the heavy lanthanides are removed. In this way, yttrium salts of 99.999% purity are obtained. In the usual situation, where yttrium is in a mixture that is two-thirds heavy-lanthanide, yttrium should be removed as soon as possible to facilitate the separation of the remaining elements.

A technique called [[Selective internal radiation therapy|radioembolization]] is used to treat [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] and [[Metastatic liver disease|liver metastasis]]. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe at a time and may require multiple procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemoembolization and Radioembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma |journal=Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology |volume=11 |issue=6 |date=2013 |pages=604–611 |pmid=23357493|pmc=3800021|author1=Salem |first1=R |last2=Lewandowski |first2=R.

Yttrium is a key ingredient in the [[yttrium barium copper oxide]] (YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') [[superconductor]] developed at the [[University of Alabama]] and the [[University of Houston]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt; This superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above [[liquid nitrogen]]'s boiling point (77.1&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt; Since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the [[liquid helium]] required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.

The actual superconducting material is often written as YBa&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Cu&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;7–''d''&lt;/SUB&gt;, where ''d'' must be less than 0.7 for superconductivity. The reason for this is still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.

The theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the [[BCS theory]] of 1957. It is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/century/html/ybco_text.htm |publisher=Imperial College|accessdate=2009-12-20|title=Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide – YBCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This superconductor is a black and green, multi-crystal, multi-phase mineral. Researchers are studying a class of materials known as [[perovskite]]s that are alternative combinations of these elements, hoping to develop a practical [[high-temperature superconductor]].&lt;ref name="Stwertka116" /&gt;
