'''ASTM A193/A193M''' is a specification from the [[ASTM International]] that primarily govern industrial [[piping]] applications.  In the assembly of an [[industrial plant]], many complex components are bolted together of which include parts such as [[valve]]s, piping, and [[pressure vessel]]s.  ASTM A193 defines the methodology to procure and certify externally [[threaded fastener]]s according to specific chemical and mechanical criteria.  It is standards such as this that allow [[industrial process]] applications to be safely engineered so they do not exceed the [[tensile strength]] of the [[fastener]]s that hold them together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTM A193 / A193M - 16 Standard Specification for  Alloy-Steel and Stainless Steel Bolting for High Temperature  or High Pressure Service and Other Special Purpose Applications|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/A193.htm|website=www.astm.org|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Latin Dictionary''''' (or '''''Harpers' Latin Dictionary''''', often referred to as '''Lewis and Short''' or '''L&amp;S''') is a popular English-language [[lexicography|lexicographical]] work of the [[Latin language]], published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Brothers]] of [[New York City|New York]] in 1879 and printed simultaneously in the United Kingdom by [[Oxford University Press]].

==History==

The work is usually referred to as Lewis and Short after the names of its editors, [[Charlton T. Lewis]] and [[Charles Short (lexicographer)|Charles Short]]. It was derived from the 1850 English translation by [[Ethan Allen Andrews (lexicographer)|Ethan Allen Andrews]] of an earlier Latin-German dictionary, ''Wörterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache'', by the German [[Philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm Freund]], in turn based on [[Immanuel Johann Gerhard Scheller|I.J.G. Scheller]]’s Latin–German dictionary of 1783. The Andrews translation was partially revised by Freund himself, then by [[Henry Drisler]], and was finally edited by Short and Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;See the advertisement of the book itself, [[s:A Latin Dictionary|available on WikiSource]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of labour between the two editors was remarkably unequal. Short, a very thorough but slow worker, produced material for the letters A through C, but B and C were lost by Harpers, meaning that his work now only appears in the letter A (216 pages), while Lewis, who worked in the time he could spare from his law practice, was solely responsible for the entries beginning with the letters B through Z (1803 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Lewis published a heavily abridged version the dictionary, entitled ''An Elementary Latin Dictionary,'' for the use of students. Sometimes called the ''Elementary Lewis,'' it is still in print today.

The adoption of the book by Oxford University Press was the result of the failure of its own project to create a new Latin-English dictionary in 1875. [[Henry Nettleship]] and [[John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor|John Mayor]] had been commissioned to produce a new Latin dictionary based on a fresh reading of the sources, but after Mayor withdrew from the project, Nettleship was unable to complete it on his own; he eventually published his research as notes on Lewis and Short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Press had earlier published John Riddle’s 1835 translation of Scheller’s Latin–German dictionary, this was a much more expensive book. The Press thus adopted ''Harpers' Latin Dictionary'' as a stopgap measure, paying Harper and Brothers 10 per cent royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of various circumstances, however, no replacement was attempted until 1933, with the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'', which was completed in 1983.

The dictionary's [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059 full text] is available on-line from the [[Perseus Project]]. Lewis and Short is also available for offline consultation, by means of various applications.

==Comparison with other dictionaries==
Among classicists, Lewis and Short has been largely superseded by the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'', called the '''''OLD''''' for short. Lewis and Short incorporated material from existing Latin dictionaries; the ''OLD'', by contrast, started from scratch, following procedures similar to those of the well-regarded ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Thanks to the increased availability of modern editions, the ''OLD'' editors had access to a larger variety of classical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |issn=0026-8232 |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=223–25 |last=Mueller |first=Janel M. |authorlink=Janel Mueller |title=Review of Oxford Latin Dictionary by P. G. W. Glare |journal=Modern Philology |date=1985-11-01 |jstor=437022 |doi=10.1086/391471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although classicists still consult Lewis and Short, they tend to prefer the ''OLD''.

On the other hand, Lewis and Short remains a standard reference work for medievalists, renaissance specialists, and early modernists, as the dictionary covers Late and Medieval Latin, if somewhat inconsistently. The ''OLD'', when used on its own, rarely meets their needs, since it was decided early in the ''OLD'''s planning that the work would not encompass works written later than AD 200. A few exceptions were made for especially important texts from the late classical period, such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|De Civitate Dei]]'', but for periods later than that the ''OLD'' is considerably less useful. The ''[[Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources]]'' supplements the ''OLD'' for medieval usage of Latin words.

In cases where Lewis and Short do not answer a medieval usage question, J. F. Niermeyer's ''Mediae Latinitatis Lexicon Minus'' often supplies an answer. The ''Lexicon Minus'' was completed in 1976 by C. van de Kieft after Niermeyer's death, and has since become a standard reference work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1093/ehr/XCIII.CCCLXVIII.655 |issn=0013-8266 |volume=93 |issue=368 |pages=655–656 |last=Brooke |first=C. N. L. |authorlink=Christopher N. L. Brooke |title=Review of Mediae Latinitatis Lexicon Minus by J.F. Niermeyer; C. van de Kieft |journal=The English Historical Review |accessdate=2013-10-19 |date=July 1978 |url=http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/XCIII/CCCLXVIII/655.full.pdf+html?frame=sidebar }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent editions of the ''Lexicon Minus'' have corrections and expansions; also, in later editions all words are defined in English, French and German, making it of greater international importance than Lewis and Short. The ''Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis'' completed in 1678 by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Charles du Fresne]] (commonly referred to as '''''Du Cange''''' after the author's title, the ''Sieur du Cange'') is now less frequently used, as Niermeyer's ''Lexicon Minus'' incorporates much of its information.

On occasion people confuse Lewis and Short (or '''L&amp;S''') with '''Liddell and Scott''', its [[Greek language|Greek]] counterpart, entitled ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''. The 1945 and later editions of Liddell and Scott are commonly referred to by the abbreviation '''''LSJ''''' after the names of its editors [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]], [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott]] and the editor of the 1945 revision, [[Henry Stuart Jones|Jones]].

The '''Al Jazeera bombing memo''' is an unpublished memorandum made within the [[United Kingdom|British]] government which is said to be the minutes of a discussion between [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]. ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' published a story on its front page on 22 November 2005 that said the memo quotes Bush speculating about a U.S. bombing raid on [[Al Jazeera]]'s world headquarters in the [[Qatar]]i capital [[Doha]] and other locations. The story said that Blair persuaded Bush to take no action.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|title=EXCLUSIVE - Bush Plot to Bomb His Arab Ally |work=[[The Daily Mirror]] (online) |authors=Kevin Maguire and Andy Lines |type=containing specific information from the memo. |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16397937 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128012515/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D16397937%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D94762%26headline%3Dexclusive--bush-plot-to-bomb-his-arab-ally-name_page.html |accessdate=31 October 2016 |archive-date=28 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details of the memo ==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:MirrorUK Bush AlJazeera plot.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Cover of the Daily Mirror with story headline.]] --&gt;
The five-page memorandum is said by the ''Mirror''&lt;ref name=mirror /&gt; to be a record of the meeting between the two leaders which took place on 16 April 2004 at the height of [[Operation Vigilant Resolve]], an assault on [[Fallujah]] by [[U.S. Marines]] and Iraqi security forces. Al Jazeera reporters were in the city providing video footage of the conflict. The day before the meeting, [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] described Al Jazeera's coverage as "vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable."{{ref|yahoo_news}} Al Jazeera reporters defended their live broadcasts of the civilian casualties by stating "the pictures do not lie".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/03/154214'''], ''www.democracynow.org'', February 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN-archived"&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy Now! in Doha...The Story Behind the Other Downing Street Memo Where Bush Told Blair He Wanted to Bomb Al Jazeera |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/3/democracy_now_in_doha_the_story |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724043142/http://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/3/democracy_now_in_doha_the_story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White House]] has dismissed the allegations made in the article.{{ref|washington_post}}
Given that [[Qatar]] is an ally of the United States and the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Iraq War]], many commentators have speculated that even if the reports of the memorandum are accurate, they may simply be recording a statement which the President did not intend to be taken seriously. A White House official told [[CNN]] "We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response," and a Pentagon official called the ''Daily Mirror'' report "absolutely absurd."{{ref|cnn}}
A [[BBC News]] correspondent has suggested that if President Bush did indeed make the comments they were intended as "some kind of joke."{{ref|bbc}}

Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' on 28 November [[Andreas Whittam Smith]] countered, observing that "official note takers don't normally record jokes". He also pointed to the alleged leaker's "25 years' experience of tough postings in place such as [[Islamabad]] and [[Khartoum]], ... often involved in intelligence work" and concluded that he "must have felt exceptionally troubled by what he was seeing."{{ref|independent}}

According to a report in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{ref|telegraph}}:
:"People who have seen the document say the real reason that it is being suppressed by the Government is because it contains a potentially damaging private discussion between the two leaders about the controversial United States attack on the Iraqi city of Fallujah last year."
The report also stated that, when questioned about the matter at the Commonwealth conference in [[Malta]], Blair branded the claims a "[[conspiracy theory]]."

== Official secrets and UK publication ban ==

[[David Keogh]], a civil servant at the [[Cabinet Office]], and Leo O'Connor, a research assistant to former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Tony Clarke (English politician)|Tony Clarke]], [[O'Connor - Keogh official secrets trial|were charged]] under the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1695513.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Michael | last=Evans | title=Secrets leak civil servant opposed Iraq war | date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the unauthorised disclosure of the memo (Keogh under section three, O'Connor under section five). When O'Connor gave the memo to Clarke, Clarke returned it to [[Downing Street]]. All news organisations in the United Kingdom have been warned by [[Attorney General]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] against further publication of information from the leaked memo; Goldsmith has mentioned the possibility of prosecution under section five of the Official Secrets Act 1989 if published details from the memorandum are considered to damage interests of the United Kingdom abroad{{ref|times}}. On 29 November 2005, Keogh and O'Connor appeared at Bow Street Magistrates Court in Central London. Following a 15-minute hearing the case was adjourned until 10 January 2006. [http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/11/29/britain.jazeera.reut/ (CNN)] On 10 May 2007, Keogh was found guilty on two counts of making a "damaging disclosure" by revealing the memo and was sentenced to 6 months in jail. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 in costs to the prosecution. O'Connor was sentenced to 3 months in jail. [http://uk.reuters.com/article/email/idUKL1060345320070510 (Reuters)]

[[Boris Johnson]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]], editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'' and a supporter of the war, has stated that he will publish the memorandum if he receives a copy of it in the hope it will put speculation about what Bush may or may not have actually said to rest{{ref|boris_johnson}}.
[[Ian Hislop]], editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'', made a similar promise in an exchange with Johnson on the television show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' (broadcast on 25 November, but recorded the previous day).

The trial judge in 2005 made an order under Section 11 of the [[Contempt Of Court Act 1981]], banning in perpetuity any connection in the UK media between the trial and Al Jazeera. "Any journalist will have to ensure in his own mind that they are not making an impermissible link", he said. There have been no U.K. reports linking the trial and remarks by David Blunkett on Channel 4 stating that "taking out" Al-Jazeera was discussed in a conversation with Tony Blair at the start of the Iraq war. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619084828/http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=371632&amp;rel_no=1] Reporters Without Borders has condemned the ban [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713180013/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=22223].

In an appeal against the ban, lodged by a group of UK Media companies, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips partly lifted the ban. The UK media will now be able to repeat previously published allegations, but it will still be illegal to suggest that these allegations accurately represented evidence given in secret during the trial. It will also be illegal to print a particular phrase uttered in open court by Keogh when he was asked about the document. [https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,2138236,00.html]

== Previous U.S. bombings of Al Jazeera offices ==
Al Jazeera's offices have previously been hit by United States weaponry. On 13 November 2001 a U.S. missile hit Al Jazeera's office in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the U.S. invasion of that country. Although no Al Jazeera staff were hurt in the attack, the building was destroyed and some employees' homes were damaged. At the time, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali, managing editor, said that the coordinates of the office were well known to everyone including the Americans.{{ref|bbc_south_asia}}

When former [[David Blunkett|British Home Secretary David Blunkett]] published his memoirs in late 2006, it was revealed he had advised Prime Minister Tony Blair in late March 2003 to bomb the Al Jazeera television transmitter in Baghdad. "There wasn't a worry from me because I believed that this was a war and in a war you wouldn't allow the broadcast to continue taking place", Blunkett said.&lt;ref&gt;Former British home secretary admits calling for bombing of Al-Jazeera, By Chris Marsden, Thu, 2006-10-26, [http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/2773 (link)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jazeera, a media revolution, October 25, 2006 [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/azzam_tamimi/2006/10/aljazeera_on_its_tenth_anniver.html (link)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jazeera mulls legal action over Blunkett's comments, AFP, Thursday, October 19, 2006 [http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1059214 (link)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2003 a U.S. missile hit an electricity generator at Al Jazeera's office in Baghdad. The resulting fire killed reporter [[Tareq Ayyoub]] and wounded another staff member.{{ref|bbc_middle_east}}
On 24 February, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali had sent a letter with the coordinates of the offices to [[Victoria Clarke]], the [[U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs]]{{ref|SFBG}} (the location had not been officially requested by the U.S. government). This incident, which occurred during the U.S. assault on Baghdad and after criticism of Al Jazeera's coverage from those supportive of the war aims of the United States forces, gave rise to suspicions that the network had been targeted.

[[Frank Gaffney]] published an opinion piece on 29 September 2003 calling for Al Jazeera to be "taken down" "one way or another" because it constitutes "enemy media".{{ref|Fox_news}}{{ref|huff_post}}

The '''Apartheid Museum''' is a [[museum]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa illustrating [[apartheid]] and the 20th century [[history of South Africa]]. The museum, part of the [[Gold Reef City]] complex, was opened in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  title =Apartheid Museum| url =http://www.sahistory.org.za/places/apartheid-museum| website =South African History Online| date = | accessdate =19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apartheid Museum allows visitors to experience the racial segregation that occurred during apartheid by separating them by racial appearance classified by the width of the nose, the kinks in hair, skin pigmentation, and size of lips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/10/arts/oppression-in-black-and-white-south-african-museum-recreates-apartheid.html|title=Oppression in Black and White; South African Museum Recreates Apartheid|last=Swarns|first=Rachel L.|date=2001-12-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retrato do 2º visconde de Santarém (c. 1850).png|thumb|right|The 2nd Viscount of Santarém, c. 1850 ([[Lisbon Geographic Society]])]]
The '''''Atlas do Visconde de Santarém''''' known sometimes in English as the ''Viscount of [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]]''{{'}}s world atlas, is an important compendium [[lithography|lithographic]] reproductions of [[medieval]] European [[map]]s and navigation [[charts]].

There were three editions, all published in Paris: 1841, 1842-1844 with far fewer plates, and in 1849, the third edition and considered to be the best.  This edition contains 145 maps on 77 plates, arranged in 4 parts.

Part I includes medieval [[mappa mundi]]s and [[planispheres]] from the 6th through 14th centuries.

Part II contains European [[portolan chart]]s and maps from the early 15th century, prior to the beginning of Portuguese exploration.

Part III provides a selection of ''mappa mundis'', dated from 1459 to the 17th century, showing the extent of Portuguese and Spanish explorations;

Part IV includes Portuguese portolan charts prepared ca. 1434-1530, including the 26 maps in the Livro of Francisco Rodrigues? (ca. 1513). Santarem published and distributed each plate in small but varying quantities, and the makeup of extant copies consequently varies widely. Complete copies are very rare.

==Biographical==
Manuel Francisco de Barros e Sousa de Mesquita de Macedo Leitão e Carvalhosa, second Viscount of [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], was born in Lisbon on November 18, 1791, the son of a prominent Portuguese nobleman. A staunch supporter of the monarchy he was, while still young, appointed Guarda-Mor (state archivist) of the royal archives at the Torre do Tombo in Lisbon, and in 1827 even became Minister of the Interior and of Marine and Overseas Territories; he was to hold neither post for long. His support of the [[Miguelist]] (absolutist) side in the [[Liberal_Wars|Civil War]] meant he was relieved from his function as royal archivist in 1833, forced forced into exile, and finally settled down in Paris, from where he never returned to Portugal - although he was later rehabilitated, and in 1842 even restored to his position as Guarda-Mor.
In Paris he devoted himself entirely to historical and cartographical studies, focusing on the [[Age of Discovery]] and the Portuguese role in it. Numerous publications{{Vague|date=November 2017}} resulted from this activity, among them first and foremost his 'Essai sur I'Histoire de la Cosmographie et de la Cartographie pendant le Moyen-âge' (1849–1852) and the famous accompanying 'Atlas composé de Mappemondes, de Portulans et de cartes hydrographiques et historiques depuis le VIe jusq’au XVIIe siècle…' 
He lived for many years in his house in the Rue Blanche 47, where he died from [[tuberculosis]] on January 17, 1856. 

As a statesman Santarém may have been anything but a success, but as a man of science he has rendered his country and the science of historical cartography many and important services{{Vague|date=November 2017}}; it was in fact he who coined the term '[[cartography]]' and who gave historical cartography a sound scientific basis. The constitutional Portuguese government, with whom he - in spite of his Absolutist inclinations - was on very good terms, repeatedly called in his collaboration and his knowledge of the history of cartography and discovery whenever conflicts arose with other powers, regarding Portuguese claims to territories in Africa. The Government even supported financially - although in an insufficient measure{{Quantify|date=November 2017}} - the publication of his works and especially of the 'Atlas', which was beset with many financial problems, and which he, at the end of his life, considered to be far from accomplished. Also his 'Essai' has remained a 'torso': of the six volumes he planned to compile only three were actually published, extending only to the 15th century. This is all the more regretable as a number of the maps and charts in it, which he intended to discuss in the remaining volumes, now figure in the 'Atlas' without any commentary. 
Santarém himself had reported in 1855 that Volume IV was 'all written and ready for the printer'. After his death in early 1856, the Secretary of the [[Lisbon_Academy_of_Sciences|Real Academia de Ciências]] was in 1857 entrusted with the task of seeing Vol. IV through the press and preparing the manuscripts of the remaining volumes for publication, but 'although the man was well-paid during three years for the work expected from him, nothing was published and, still worse, Santarém's original text went astray and could never be found again'[1].

Santarém's best and most detailed biographer is undoubtedly Jordão A. de Freitas[2] whose book, however, is written in Portuguese and therefore rather difficult to access {{To whom?|date=November 2017}}. The same disadvantage{{Non_sequitur|date=November 2017}} applies to the chapter devoted to Santarém by [[Armando Cortesão]] in his work on Portuguese cartographers and cartography[3].In the latter's 'History of Portuguese Cartography[3] written in English, however, an excellent account is given of Santarem's life and work[4]. The short biographical note given here is largely based on this text. 

In 1985 a facsimile edition of the third and last edition (1849) of his ‘Atlas’ was published by Rudolf Muller, bookseller and publisher in [[Amsterdam]].

There is now{{when|date=November 2017}}, available in English, a biographical and bibliographical text about Visconde de Santarém in Dicionário de Historiadores Portugueses (Dictionary of Portuguese Historians), written by Daniel Estudante Protásio, a Portuguese researcher who has studied the life and works of Santarém since 1994 [5]. Other texts written by Protásio in Portuguese can also be downloaded at his personal page at Academia.edu [6]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6477">[[File:Domick Petra I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The pavilion housing the Cabin of Peter the Great]]
The '''cabin of Peter the Great''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Domik Petra I'' or ''Domik Petra Pervogo'' or ''Domik Petra Velikogo'') is a small wooden house which was the first [[St Petersburg]] "palace" of Tsar [[Peter the Great]].

The [[log cabin]] was constructed in three days in May 1703,{{efn|''Explorations in St Petersburg'' and ''Saint Petersburg: Museums, Palaces, and Historic Collections'' say 1703; Petriva dates it to 1707.}} by soldiers of the [[Semyonovskiy Regiment]].{{sfnp|Fitzlyon|Zinovieff|Hughes|2003|p=44|ps=}}  At that time, the new St Petersburg was described as "a heap of villages linked together, like some plantation in the West Indies".{{sfnp|Hughes|1998|p=216|ps=}} The date of its construction is now considered to mark the foundation of the city.

The design is a combination of an [[izba]], a traditional Russian countryside house typical of the 17th century, and the Tsar's beloved Dutch [[Baroque]], later to evolve into the [[Petrine Baroque]]. Peter built similar ''domiki'' elsewhere in Russia - for example, in [[Voronezh]], and [[Vologda]].  The wooden cabin in St Petersburg covers only {{convert|60|m2|ft2}}{{r|Explorations}} and contains three rooms - living room, bedroom, and study.  It has large ornate windows and a high hipped roof of wooden tiles.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=57|ps=}}{{efn|Cowles describes Peter the Great "living for years in a small log cabin, composed of three rooms."}} Inside, the wooden walls were painted with red oil to resemble brick, and the rooms came to be known as the "red chambers" (''krasnyie khoromtsy'').{{sfnp|Giangrande|Norwich|2003|p=18|ps=}}{{efn|''The Companion Guide to St Petersburg '' translates this as the "fair mansion".}} There are no fires or chimneys, as it was intended to be used only in the warmer summer months. It was occupied by the Tsar between 1703 and 1708,{{sfnp|Giangrande|Norwich|2003|p=18|ps=}} while Peter supervised the construction of the new imperial city and the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]].

[[File:Peter I bust (Zabello).jpg|thumb|200px|Bust of Peter the Great, in front of his cabin]]
The cabin was moved to its present location, 6 Petrovskaia Naberezhnaia,{{sfnp|Giangrande|Norwich|2003|p=18|ps=}} in 1711 from its original site on the north bank of the [[River Neva]] close to the present [[Winter Palace]]. Peter had it encased for its protection within a red brick pavilion in 1723, and ordered that it be preserved for posterity as a memorial to his modesty, and the creation of St Petersburg ''[[ex nihilo]]''.  [[Catherine the Great]] ordered the shelter for the cabin to be renovated in 1784, and the protective brick pavilion was reconstructed by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in the 1840s.{{sfnp|Giangrande|Norwich|2003|p=18|ps=}}  Nicholas I also had the bedroom converted into a chapel dedicated to Christ the Redeemer, and iron railings were added in 1874.

Peter's ''domiki'' were used to mark significant dates, such as the [[Anniversary|bicentenary]] of Peter's birth in 1672.  They became a centre of devotion to the [[tsar]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and the Russian [[motherland]] (''[[Mother Russia|rodina]]'').  An image of the log cabin was included on the [[Peter the Great (Fabergé egg)|Peter the Great]] [[Fabergé egg]], created in 1903 to celebrate the bicentenary of the founding of St Petersburg.  After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], they became symbols of Russian heroic labour.

A prized national monument, the contents were removed, and the Cabin was boarded up and [[camouflage]]d during the [[Second World War]].  It was the first St Petersburg [[museum]] to reopen in September 1944, after the end of the [[Siege of Leningrad]].  Personal and domestic objects owned and used by Peter are still displayed within, and a bust of Peter by [[Parmen Zabello]] stands outside. The cabin is open to the public{{r|Explorations}} as a branch of the [[Russian Museum]].{{r|Museum}}

The film has won two National Awards at the [[60th National Film Awards]], including [[National Film Award for Best Biographical Film|Best Biographical Film]] and [[National Film Award for Best Non-Feature Film Editing|Best Editing]] for Irene Dhar Malik.&lt;ref name="60thaward"&gt;{{cite press_release|title=60th National Film Awards Announced|url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2013/mar/d2013031801.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Press Information Bureau (PIB), India|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in India on 3 May 2013 to coincide with the centenary of [[Indian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PK Nair, the reel historian|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pk-nair-the-reel-historian-celluloid-man/1/269134.html |date=3 May 2013l |publisher=India Today |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Celluloid Man: PK Nair &amp; the future of our cinematic past |url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/artbeat/the-celluloid-man-pk-nair-a-the-future-of-our-cinematic-past |publisher=Sunday Guardian |date=May 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
P. K. Nair’s fascination with cinema began as a child and he watched his first few films lying on the white sand floor of a cinema in Trivandrum. He was a collector even then - collecting ticket stubs, lobby cards, even weighing machine tickets sporting pictures of the stars of the day. He grew up to be a great collector of films.

1,700 films were made in India during the silent film era, of which only nine survive thanks to the efforts of Nair. He travelled to remote parts of India to collect and save cans of rare films. The fact that [[Dadasaheb Phalke]] is recognized today as the father of Indian cinema is Nair’s doing. He tried to save any film that he could get his hands on, be it world cinema, Hindi popular films or regional Indian cinema. He even took world cinema to the villages of India.

He has influenced generations of Indian film students especially the Indian New Wave filmmakers such as [[Mani Kaul]], [[Kumar Shahani]], [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]], [[Ketan Mehta]], [[Saeed Akhtar Mirza]], [[Jahnu Barua]], [[Girish Kasaravalli]], [[John Abraham (director)]], [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] and [[Kundan Shah]].

The film is woven with interviews of several filmmakers and film personalities who have been influenced directly and indirectly by P. K. Nair, among them [[Krzysztof Zanussi]], [[Lester James Peries]], [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]], [[Saeed Akhtar Mirza]], [[Gulzar]], [[Basu Chatterjee]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Girish Kasaravalli]], [[Jahnu Barua]], [[Jaya Bachchan]], [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Saira Banu]], [[Sitara Devi]], [[Santosh Sivan]], [[Rajkumar Hirani]], [[Shyam Benegal]], [[Mahesh Bhatt]], [[Yash Chopra]], [[Ramesh Sippy]], [[Mrinal Sen]] and Surama Ghatak.

Besides the interviews, the film has rare footage from early Indian masterpieces like ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'', ''Kaliya Mardan'', ''Gallant Hearts'', ''Marthanda Verma'', ''Jamai Babu'', ''[[Fearless Nadia]]'', ''[[Sant Tukaram]]'', ''[[Achut Kanya]]'', ''[[Kismat (1968 film)|Kismat]]'', ''[[Chandralekha (1948 film)|Chandralekha]]'' and ''[[Kalpana (1948 film)|Kalpana]]'' - all films that were archived and thus saved by Nair.

==Production==
The production started at the end of 2010 and the film was completed in June 2012.

The film has been shot in Warsaw, Colombo, Pune, Nasik, Mumbai, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Heggodu, Bengaluru and Kolkata, and eleven cinematographers worked on it: [[Santosh Thundiyil]], K. U. Mohanan, [[Abhik Mukhopadhyay]], [[P. S. Vinod]], H. M. Ramachandra, R. V. Ramani, Vikas Sivaraman, [[Mahesh Aney]] and Kiran Deohans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Publications/InCamera/Celluloid_Man.htm InCamera, 29 August 2012: ''Celluloid Man''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910143026/http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Publications/InCamera/Celluloid_Man.htm |date=10 September 2012 }} Linked 2013-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot on 16mm film and then converted to 35mm, with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.85: 1.

==Awards==
''Celluloid Man'' has won two National Awards in India at the [[60th National Film Awards]] for the Best Historical / Biographical Reconstruction and for Best Editing in 2013. It has also won the "Nestor The Chronicler" award for the best archival film for ''Celluloid Man'' at the XII Kyiv International Documentary Film Festival 2013, Ukraine.

'''Mișu''' or '''Mihail Ion Văcărescu''' ([[Francization|Francized]] ''Michel Vacaresco''; 1842 or 1843 – June 12, 1903), most commonly known as '''Claymoor''', was a [[Wallachia]]n, later [[Romania]]n fashion journalist and gossip columnist, the son of poet [[Iancu Văcărescu]]. A retired cavalry officer in the [[Romanian Land Forces]], he began writing in his late twenties or early thirties, reaching his fame as a contributor to the Francophone daily ''[[L'Indépendence Roumaine]]''. He was widely respected for his verdicts on fashion, and, as an arbiter of taste, contributed to his paper's renown; however, people of his day also ridiculed him for his florid literary style, his political involvement with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], and his apparent homosexuality.

Claymoor's period of prominence, at the height of the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', ended with his sudden death. By that time, he had also left a mark as one of Romania's first film critics. Although his almanac was still published, he himself was largely forgotten in the [[Kingdom of Romania]] by the end of World War I. Traces of his memory are preserved in disguised portrayals and parodies by writers such as [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Petru Dumitriu]].

==Biography==

===Early life and debut===
Văcărescu's exact birth date remains unknown.&lt;ref name="angh722"&gt;Lucreția Angheluță, Salomeea Rotaru, Liana Miclescu, Marilena Apostolescu, Marina Vazaca, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831–1918). Vol. IV: R–Z'', p. 722. Bucharest: [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], 1996.  {{ISBN|973-27-0501-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strj768"&gt;Mihail Straje, ''Dicționar de pseudonime, anonime, anagrame, astronime, criptonime ale scriitorilor și publiciștilor români'', p. 768. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1973.  {{OCLC|8994172}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he died at the age of 60&lt;ref name="ipadresa"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/o_adresa_high-life "O adresă high-life"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2010&lt;/ref&gt; or 61,&lt;ref name="ferr99"&gt;Ferrari, "Le Monde &amp; La Ville. Renseignements mondains", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', July 26, 1899, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that he was born in 1842 or 1843. It also certain that he was of aristocratic upbringing, from the [[Văcărescu family]], and directly related to other prominent families of [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Wallachian boyars]]; unlike them, he had inherited little wealth. He was the son of the more famous Wallachian poet [[Iancu Văcărescu|Iancu (Ioan) Văcărescu]], and as such grandson of [[Alecu Văcărescu|Alecu]] and grandnephew of [[Ienăchiță Văcărescu]]. His great-grandfather [[Ianache Văcărescu]] had served [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] during the [[Pruth River Campaign]], and had been executed alongside him.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancestors of the journalist had been in constant conflict with the [[Phanariote]] princes who succeeded Brâncoveanu: Ienăchiță and his brothers were most likely poisoned, while Alecu was imprisoned under false charges.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 10–11, 15–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Iancu was also a dissident during the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime. Arrested for various intervals, he had his land confiscated by Prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 21, 23&lt;/ref&gt; After Ghica's downfall, he ran in the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|first princely election]], winning just 21 votes from 179.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cristian Preda]], ''Rumânii fericiți. Vot și putere de la 1831 până în prezent'', pp. 52–54. Iași: [[Polirom]], 2011.  {{ISBN|978-973-46-2201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aunt, [[Marițica Bibescu|Marițica Văcărescu-Ghica]], went on to marry the winner of that race, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], after a years-long scandal. She was also a poet, although her work remained unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Crutzescu, notes to [[Grigore Lăcusteanu]], ''Amintirile colonelului Lăcusteanu. Text integral, editat după manuscris'', pp. 258, 260. Iași: [[Polirom]], 2015.  {{ISBN|978-973-46-4083-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihail's mother Ecaterina (1819–1891), also a boyaress, descended from the [[Cantacuzino family]] through a [[Moldavia]]n offshoot, and claimed ownership of an estate in [[Pașcani]]. Despite her generous dowry, the family faced bankruptcy and, during Mihail's infancy, had to go into real estate as landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt; She had eight other children with Iancu, six of whom survived into adulthood: Eufrosina m. Greceanu (1837–1870), a homemaker and courtesan; Ioan (1839–1914), a career soldier and father of writer [[Elena Văcărescu]]; Maria m. Fălcoianu (1841–1912); Ecaterina m. Lahovary (1846–1917); Alexandrina m. Darvary (1851–1899); Constantin (1850–1899).&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 25–27, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt; Claymoor's cousins also included Theodor C. Văcărescu, the diplomat.&lt;ref name="ibepoca"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bulei]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/in-epoca-lui-claymoor-2992169 "În epoca lui Claymoor"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A graduate of [[Lycée Henri-IV]] in Paris, Văcărescu always endured as a "great friend of France", according to his colleagues at ''[[Le Figaro]]''.&lt;ref name="ferr99"/&gt; Orphaned at age 20, when his father died "of a cold", he and his siblings split his fortune between them and Iancu's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; His first calling was the army, and he reached an Captain's rank&lt;ref name="vnsvn"&gt;"Svonuri", in ''[[Voința Națională]]'', January 5 (17), 1891, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the cavalry corps of the [[United Principalities]], later retiring to take up work for the [[Bucharest]] daily press.&lt;ref name="cbac60–1"&gt;Bacalbașa, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; According to several accounts, he was by then openly gay, or, as historian [[Ion Bulei]] writes, "a notorious pederast".&lt;ref name="ibepoca"/&gt; Writer-diplomat Gheorghe Crutzescu also notes that Claymoor "did not quite like women", although he was particularly fond of [[cross-dressing]] acts such as [[La Belle Otero]] and the [[Barrison Sisters]].&lt;ref name="ghcr118"&gt;Crutzescu, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1890, he was involved in a legal conflict with a Major Baldovici, and rumor spread in the rival press that he had tried to seduce him and other army subordinates.&lt;ref name="vnsvn"/&gt; However, Bacalbașa disputes such "mean-spirited" rumors as "fables".&lt;ref name="cbac61"&gt;Bacalbașa, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Văcărescu's first experience with Francophone journalism was at ''La Roumanie'' daily (1873–1876), where he used the pen name Velréas.&lt;ref name="strj768"/&gt; He later had a stint at the left-wing paper ''[[Românul]]'' (1877–1879), where he began using his consecrated pen name.&lt;ref name="strj768"/&gt; As Claymoor, he began his activity at ''[[L'Indépendence Roumaine]]'' in 1879&lt;ref name="ibepoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ferr03"/&gt; or 1880,&lt;ref name="strj768"/&gt; taking over for the Frenchman Ulysse de Marsillac.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, as Babylas, he was writing for ''La Roumanie Ilustrée''.&lt;ref&gt;George Potra, ''Din Bucureștii de altădată'', p. 244. Bucharest: [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; These early chronicles coincided with the introduction of electric lighting, which, from ca. 1882, allowed open-air night parties to become fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; His regular chronicle was the ''Carnet du High-life'', which later spawned an ''Almanach du High-Life''.&lt;ref name="ipadresa"/&gt; Claymoor's first almanac had been ''La Vie à Bucarest 1882–1883'' ("Life in Bucharest 1882–1883"), published with Theil &amp; Weiss company,&lt;ref name="angh722"/&gt; followed by ''La Lanterne Mondaine'' ("Worldly Lantern") in 1884.&lt;ref name="strj768"/&gt; That year, in February, Claymoor had a row with the editor of ''L'Indépendence Roumaine'', [[Alexandru Ciurcu]], and briefly left to work for ''Gazette de Roumanie''. In his own words, this was a "rather burlesque incident", sparked by Ciurcu's attempt to remove from the fashion column "all those parties he was never invited to."&lt;ref&gt;"Informațiuni", in ''Telegraphul", February 16, 1884, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arbiter of fashion===
Claymoor soon became one of the regulars at the journalists' hangout, [[Casa Capșa]], frequenting a society that also included [[Nicolae Filipescu]] and [[N. T. Orășanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Costescu, p. 378. See also Crutzescu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Memoirist [[Constantin Bacalbașa]] recalls him as "perfectly collegial", "a very decent man". However, he also cautions that Claymoor "was a journalist, but by no means was he one of the journalistic world; he lived inside the boyar society that had spawned and raised him".&lt;ref name="cbac61"/&gt; More controversially, from 1888, when he became a Romanian delegate to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris World Fair]],&lt;ref&gt;Georges Bibesco, ''Exposition universelle 1889. La Roumanie avant-pendant-après'', p. 366. Paris: Imprimerie Typographique J. Kugelmann, 1890&lt;/ref&gt; Claymoor was depicted as a political client of the ruling [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"O rușine națională", in ''[[Voința Națională]]'', December 20, 1888 (January 1, 1889), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of that have it that he was also considered for the [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefecture]] of [[Constanța County]] by the [[Theodor Rosetti]] cabinet.&lt;ref name="dlmdobr"&gt;Dolman, "Scrisori din Dobrogea (Corespondența partic. a ''Telegraphuluĭ'')", in ''Telegraphul'', August 10, 1888, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Informațiuni", in ''[[Lupta]]'', April 17, 1888 (second edition), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A local correspondent for ''Telegraphul'' noted, tongue-in-cheek: "High-society ladies are in favor of [his] appointment, and so is the [[Islam in Romania|Muslim population]], especially now [in August 1888] that we are celebrating [[Eid al-Adha|Bayram]]."&lt;ref name="dlmdobr"/&gt;

Writer George Costescu describes ''L'Indépendence Roumaine'' as adhering to "Western journalistic norms", and notes Claymoor's role in pioneering locally the genre of "fashion reports": "the crafty Mihail Văcărescu-Claymoor chronicled all the political and diplomatic receptions, all artistic reunions and balls, concerts, fêtes and weddings involving Bucharest's elite families."&lt;ref&gt;Costescu, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was criticized by anti-elitists. In 1912, the left-wing [[George Ranetti]] argued that ''Carnet du High-life'' would have been "more or less justified in a city like Paris", but asked: "what point could it serve in Romania?" In the absence of an aristocratic culture, Claymoor only "fed the vanities" of a commercial "plutocracy".&lt;ref name="knrâiea"&gt;[[George Ranetti|Kiriak Napadarjan]], "Vorba lui Vlahuță: 'Râiea'!", in ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'', Nr. 36/1912, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Bulei sees the ''Carnet'' as copying from ''Le Figaro'' and ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', "but with its [[Dâmbovița River|Dâmbovița]] relish." He suggests that some of the chronicles—for instance one describing Zoe Sturdza, wife of the politician [[Dimitrie Alexandru Sturdza|D. A. Sturdza]]—were unintentionally amusing.&lt;ref name="ibepoca"/&gt;

Early reviewers were similarly inclined. In 1890, ''Amiculu Familiei'' newspaper described Claymoor as "a sad figure in [Romanian] journalism". It deplored the Frenchified culture which had produced Claymoor, but also noted that his metaphorical style was being laughed at by the Belgian paper ''La Réforme''.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Șor., "Din viéța de Bucureșcĭ", in ''Amiculu Familiei'', Nr. 15/1890, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as Bacalbașa notes, Claymoor's writings made him "a tiny celebrity": "for 24 years Bucharest has had its Claymoor epoch."&lt;ref name="cbac60–1"/&gt; According to the same source, Claymoor could describe "wonderfully and competently the ladies' full attire at the various soirées that he attended. Some claimed that [Claymoor] was being paid by luxury seamstresses, but this was never proven true."&lt;ref name="cbac61"/&gt; Reportedly, subscribing to ''L'Indépendence Roumaine'' and "only reading Claymoor's notebook therein" was a central preoccupation for girls just out of boarding school.&lt;ref&gt;Amint., "Zeflemelele. 'Fetele noastre'. III", in ''[[Lupta]]'', September 22, 1895, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crutzescu: "not being cited by Claymoor [...] was a catastrophe, an insult that equated social death. Which is why Claymoor's home was always full of diverse gifts, from ladies who wished not to be forgotten, or overlooked."&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Văcărescu's recommendations were such "that all fashionable society would adopt both the seamstress and the attire."&lt;ref name="cbac61"/&gt;

At times, his contributions doubled as theater criticism, such as when, in 1884, he chronicled ''[[O scrisoare pierdută]]'', by the Romanian classic [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]. His overall negative judgment of the play was itself judged negatively by later critics.&lt;ref name="mfedi20"&gt;Mihai Florea, "Este nouă noua ediție Caragiale?", in ''Teatrul'', Nr. 10/1959, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Repeatedly included in retrospectives as one of Caragiale's detractors,&lt;ref name="mfedi20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], "Unde îi sunt detractorii?", in ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 7/2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; he also criticized Caragiale and [[Paul Gusty]] for adapting and staging an anti-war play in 1888. However, he applauded their production of [[Adolf Wilbrandt|Wilbrandt]]'s ''Tochter des Herrn Fabricius''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Cioculescu]], "Caragiale director al Teatrului Național", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 9/1939, p. 650&lt;/ref&gt; His competence in the field was doubted early on by columnist [[Dimitrie R. Rosetti|Dimitrie Rosetti-Max]]. When, in 1887, it was announced that Claymoor would be staff critic for a French troupe touring Bucharest, Rosetti-Max remarked: "This leads me to suspect that the troupe doesn't even have costumes yet, and that Claymoor [...] is there to assess whether the artistes' [[Corsage (bodice)|corsages]] pass midnight inspection".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dimitrie R. Rosetti|D. R. R.]], "Teatrul romanesc", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', September 19, 1887 (second edition), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Claymoor earned more respect as a pioneer cinema critic: in 1896–1897, he was among the first to chronicle the earliest Romanian film shows and, as film historian Dinu-Ioan Nicola argues, had "surprising critical intuitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Dinu-Ioan Nicola, [http://filmarchives.tnnua.edu.tw/ftp/20100325023827.pdf "Sur les traces du film roumain muet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429153818/http://filmarchives.tnnua.edu.tw/ftp/20100325023827.pdf |date=2016-04-29 }}, in ''[[Journal of Film Preservation]]'', Vol. XXVI, N° 54, April 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Having been present at a screening of Paul Menu's "Romanian vistas" in May 1897, Claymoor prophesied that "cinema will reestablish truth and the sincerity of our lives will be transmitted over the ages, beyond ourselves. To us it is entertainment. To future generations, it will be a priceless document".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Manuela Cernat, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160322082035/http://www.istoria-artei.ro/resources/files/SCIA.TMC%202011-2012-Manuela%20Cernat.pdf "Cinematograful ''în'' istorie (I)"], in ''Studii și Cercetări de Istoria Artei. Teatru, Muzică, Cinematografie'', Issues 5–6 (49–50), 2011–2012, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by one anonymous witness, Claymoor was personally involved in film promotion, making excuses for the technical difficulties and delays. His ''Carnet'', "I believe, has reached the peak of its glory during these days."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ștefan Oprea, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/OPREAaug6.html "Bunica cinefilă (I)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Having contributed directly to ''L'Indépendence Roumaine''{{'}}s success (it became the second-most popular newspaper by 1897),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Emanuel Bădescu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/duelul-emanoil-lahovary-nicolae-filipescu-de-emanuel-badescu-14532738 "Duelul Emanoil Lahovary–Nicolae Filipescu"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', July 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Claymoor made a return trip to Paris in 1899.&lt;ref name="ferr99"/&gt; He died in Bucharest on June 12, 1903, after falling down in front of ''L'Indépendence Roumaine'' office, just as he was bringing in his latest ''Carnet'' chronicle. Although he is sometimes assumed to have died there, on the spot,&lt;ref name="ibepoca"/&gt; he actually did so at his sister's home.&lt;ref name="ferr03"&gt;Ferrari, "Le Monde &amp; La Ville. Deuil", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', June 28, 1903, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate cause of death was a [[peptic ulcer]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Claymoor was buried at [[Bellu cemetery]], Plot 17.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', p. 277. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972; Crutzescu, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[objets d'art]]'' were auctioned off by January 1904,&lt;ref&gt;"Ocasiune! Obiectele defunctului Văcărescu Claymoor", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', January 9, 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''Almanach du High-Life'' continued to be published over the following years.&lt;ref name="ipadresa"/&gt;

==Legacy==
By the 1920s, Bacalbașa claims, "nobody so much as remember[ed] this [...] arbiter of female elegance".&lt;ref name="cbac61"/&gt; Crutzescu also noted in passing that Claymoor's writing style was antiquated, "so very obnoxious".&lt;ref name="ghcr118"/&gt; His "yellowing notebooks", Crutzescu writes, revealed a world "of bearded and mustachioed gents and ladies with [[Crinoline|malakoffs]] that, when stirred, will rustle the way dead leaves do."&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to Ranetti, his "aping of the Paris press" created a school of party chroniclers, or "Claymoorlings". These journalists, Ranetti noted, were even active at ''[[Adevărul]]'', a nominally working-class paper.&lt;ref name="knrâiea"/&gt;

Claymoor also endured as the hero of "so many anecdotes" relating to his lifestyle and his alleged vanities. By the end of his life, he was completely bald, but was hiding it. One such story claims that his wig came off while bathing on the [[Romanian Black Sea resorts|Romanian littoral]] and he went chasing for it in the water.&lt;ref name="cbac61"/&gt; Claymoor's likeness is also preserved in the work of various cartoonists, including his Capșa colleague [[Constantin Jiquidi]], who drew him [[Drag (clothing)|doing drag]].&lt;ref&gt;Costescu, p. 378 and Plate II, pp. 328–329; [[Traian Demetrescu]], ''Profile literare'', p. 49. Craiova: Editura Tipografiei D. I. Benvenisti, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of his career in journalism, Claymoor's style irritated more senior writers, prompting them to caricature him in their fiction. In 1883, [[Ion Ghica]] and [[Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio]] had sketched out a comedy of mores, which, if finalized, was to feature a leading character based on Claymoor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Cioculescu]], "Ion Ghica", in Șerban Cioculescu, [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', pp. 438–439. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973; Ion Roman, "Ion Ghica", in [[Ion Ghica]], ''Opere, I'', pp. 72–73. Bucharest: [[Editura pentru literatură]], 1967.  {{OCLC|830735698}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Bacalbașa]] also refers to Claymoor as the favorite writer of [[Moș Teacă]]'s ignorant wife, and gives him a brief role in one of his sketches (where Claymoore's homosexuality is again hinted at).&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Bacalbașa]], "Moș Teacă și Mealy. La teatrul liric", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', October 18, 1893, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Claymoor is more famous as the target of satires by Caragiale, in his ''[[Momente și schițe]]'' series—one of his favorite techniques here was to [[pastiche]] Claymoor's "pirouettes-and-colored-ribbons" prose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silvian Iosifescu]], "I. L. Caragiale", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 343. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Caragiale's sketch "High-life", first published on Christmas Eve 1899,&lt;ref name="ipadresa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="migreș"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Iovănel, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2010/11/o-ingrozitoare-gresala-de-tipar/ "O îngrozitoare greșală de tipar"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 298, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is entirely dedicated to Claymoor, who appears as "Edgar Bostandaki" or "Turturel" ("Turtledove"), chronicler for the fictional ''Voice of the Aurochs''. A licentious typo subverts his description of a high-society dame as an "indefatigable [[sylphid]]", and he has to deal with her husband's wrath (readers were left unsure as to what the hinted typo was).&lt;ref name="ipadresa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="migreș"/&gt;

There are other supposed echoes of Claymoor in Romanian prose. Author Radu Cernătescu claims that Claymoor is the character "Poponel", appearing in ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]''—a 1929 novel by [[Mateiu Caragiale]] (son of Ion Luca).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cosmin Ciotloș]], [http://www.romlit.ro/cum_grano_salis "Cum grano salis"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2010&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts other accounts, according to which "Poponel" is based on another Romanian aristocrat, who was still alive in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Cioculescu]], ''Caragialiana'', p. 351. Bucharest: [[Editura Eminescu]], 1974. {{OCLC|6890267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caragiale Jr was publicly friends with a gay man, Count Ferdinand de Montesquiou-Fézensac. A distant relative of Claymoor's,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Corneliu Șenchea, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180127112833/https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/crai-si-zurgagii-scandalurile-mondene-de-odinioara-partea-ii "Crai și zurgagii – scandalurile mondene de odinioară (partea II)"], in ''Historia'', December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Count had died nine years before ''Craii''{{'}}s publication.&lt;ref&gt;"Echos", in ''[[Action Française]]'', December 4, 1920, p. 1; {{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/precizri_la_biografia_lui__matila_c._ghyka "Precizări la biografia lui Matila C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2017">'''''Communio et progressio''''' is a pastoral instruction of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], issued by the  [[Pontifical Council for Social Communications]] on 23 May 1971. It was prepared in accordance with the [[Second Vatican Council]]’s 1963 decree ''[[Inter Mirifica]]''. The Council having abandoned the general use of the [[nihil obstat]] and [[imprimatur]] to approve publications, and of the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|index]] to restrict access to undesirable publications, the new pastoral instruction outlined the relations with public media that Church authorities were henceforth to adopt: recognition of the freedom of information and free choice of information, the legitimate independence of the activity of journalists and media institutions, and the need to educate members of the Church in the discriminating use of media.

== Features ==
IRC server features, mostly extensions to RFC 1459. Probably also implementations of RFC 2810, RFC 2811, RFC 2812, RFC 2813, and possibly [[IRCX]].

* +channels (In early IRCds, these were simply named channels. At least one modern IRCd (IRCD) uses the + prefix for modeless channels, i.e. no modes are supported other than +t, which is forced. Since no user can become a chanop, no topic can be set. This is described in RFC 2811.)
* #channels ("+channels" were later replaced with "#channels" in version 2.7, numeric channels were removed entirely and channel bans (mode +b) were implemented.)
* &amp;channels (irc2.8, those that exist only on the current server, rather than the entire network)
* !channels (irc2.10, those that are theoretically safe from suffering from the many ways that a user could exploit a channel by "riding a netsplit"; IRCds using timestamping provide (most of) this functionality on #channels)
* %#channels (#channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX)
* %&amp;channels (&amp;channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX)
* %!channels (!channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX)

== Temporal characteristics ==
Different display technologies have vastly different temporal characteristics, leading to perceptual differences for motion, flicker, etc.
[[Image:Display technology temporal characteristics.gif|center|750px|Sketch of some common display technologies' temporal behaviour]]

The figure shows a sketch of how different technologies present a single white/grey frame. Time and intensity is not to scale. Notice that some have a fixed intensity, while the illuminated period is variable. This is a kind of [[pulse-width modulation]]. Others can vary the actual intensity in response to the input signal.

*Single-chip DLPs use a kind of "chromatic multiplexing" in which each color is presented serially. The intensity is varied by modulating the "on" time of each pixel within the time-span of one color. Multi-chip DLPs are not represented in this sketch, but would have a curve identical to the plasma display.
*LCDs have a constant (backlit) image, where the intensity is varied by blocking the light shining through the panel.
*CRTs use an electron beam, scanning the display, flashing a lit image. If interlacing is used, a single full-resolution image results in two "flashes". The physical properties of the phosphor are responsible for the rise and decay curves.
*Plasma displays modulate the "on" time of each sub-pixel, similar to DLP.
*Movie theaters use a mechanical shutter to illuminate the same frame 2 or 3 times, increasing the flicker frequency to make it less perceptible to the human eye.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">[[File:Códice de Roda.jpg|thumb|300px|''Roda Codex'', 1r.]]The '''''Códice de Roda''''' or '''''Códice de Meyá''''' (Roda or Meyá codex) is a [[medieval]] manuscript that represents a unique source for details of the 9th and early 10th century [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and neighbouring principalities.  It is currently held in [[Madrid]] as [[Real Academia de la Historia]] cód. 78.&lt;ref name="GV"&gt;García Villada&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[codex]] is thought to date from the late 10th century, although there are additions from the 11th century, and it was compiled in Navarre, perhaps at [[Nájera]], written in a [[Visigothic script|visigothic]] [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]] in several different hands with [[cursive]] marginal notes.  It is {{convert|205|x|285|mm|abbr=on}}, and contains 232 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s.&lt;ref name="GV" /&gt;  The manuscript appears to have been housed at Nájera in the 12th century, and later in the archives of the cathedral at [[Roda de Isábena]] at the end of the 17th century.  In the next century, it was acquired by the [[prior]] of Santa María de Meyá, passing into private hands, after which only copies and derivative manuscripts were available to the scholarly community until the rediscovery of the original manuscript in 1928.&lt;ref name="Lacarra45"&gt;Lacarra (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex includes copies of well-known [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] texts, as well as unique material.  The first two-thirds of the compilation reproduces a single work, [[Paulus Orosius]]' ''Historiarum adversum paganos libri VII''.  Also notable are [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum|History of the Vandals and Suebi]]'' and ''[[Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum|History of the Goths]]'', the ''[[Chronica prophetica]]'' (a chronicle related to the ''[[Codex Vigilanus|Chronicon Albeldense]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{emc1|John Wreglesworth|Crónica profetica|400}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[genealogy of Jesus]]. Unique items include a lists of [[Arab]] rulers and of the [[Christian]] kings of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]]-[[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Frankish Empire|France]], a chronicle of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'', a necrology of the [[Bishops of Pamplona]] and the ''[[De laude Pampilone epistola]]''. It also includes a [[chant]] in honour of an otherwise unknown [[Leodegundia Ordóñez]], [[List of Navarrese royal consorts|Queen of Navarre]].&lt;ref name="GV"&gt;García Villada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacarra45" /&gt;  Still, the manuscript is perhaps best known for its genealogies of the dynasties ruling on both sides of the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref name="Lacarra45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacarra92"&gt;Lacarra (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The genealogies in the Roda Codex have played a critical role in interpreting the scant surviving historical record of the dynasties covered.  The family accounts span as many as five generations, ending in the first half of the 10th century.  These include the [[List of Navarrese monarchs#House of .C3.8D.C3.B1iguez.2C .3F 824.E2.80.93905|Íñiguez]] and [[Jiménez dynasty|Jiménez]] rulers of [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Pamplona]], the counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]], [[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Toulouse]] and the duchy of [[Duke of Gascony|Gascony]].  It has recently been suggested that these genealogies, reminiscent of the work of [[Ibn Hazm]], were prepared in an [[Al-Andalus|Iberian Muslim]] context in the [[Ebro]] valley and passed to Navarre at the time the codex was compiled.&lt;ref name="Lacarra45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacarra92" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7402">A '''DNS zone''' is any distinct, contiguous portion of the domain name space in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) for which administrative responsibility has been delegated to a single manager.

The domain name space of the [[Internet]] is organized into a hierarchical layout of subdomains below the [[DNS root]] domain. The individual domains of this tree may serve as delegation points for administrative authority and management. However, usually it is furthermore desirable to implement fine-grained boundaries of delegation, so that multiple sub-levels of a domain may be managed independently. Therefore, the domain name space is partitioned into areas (''zones'') for this purpose. A zone starts at a domain and extends downward in the tree to the leaf nodes or to the top-level of subdomains where other zones start.&lt;ref&gt;D.B.Terry, M. Painter, D.W.Riggle, S.Zhou, University of California Berkeley, ''The Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server'', Report No. UCB/CSD 84/182 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a [[domain name server]]. Historically, it is defined in the [[zone file]], an operating system [[text file]] that starts with the special DNS record type ''Start of Authority'' (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the [[BIND|Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server]] (BIND) software package, and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.

==Domains and zones==
Most top-level [[domain name registry]] operators offer their name spaces to the public or to entities with mandated geographic or otherwise scoped purpose for registration of second-level domains. Similarly an organization in charge of a lower level domain may operate its name space similarly and subdivide its space.

Each registration or allocation of subdomain space obligates the registrant to maintain an administrative and technical infrastructure to manage the responsibility for its zone, including sub-delegation to lower-level domains. Each delegation confers essentially unrestricted technical autonomy over the allocated space. An area of one or more subdomains that has been delegated for management is called a DNS zone. A zone always starts at a domain boundary to include all leaf nodes (hosts) in the domain, or it ends at the boundary of another independently managed zone.

As each domain is further divided into sub-domains, each becoming a DNS zone itself with its own set of administrators and DNS servers, the tree grows with the largest number of leaf nodes at the bottom. At this lowest level, in the end-nodes or leaves of the tree, the term ''DNS zone'' becomes essentially synonymous with the term "[[Domain name|domain]]", both in terms of use and administration. The term ''domain'' is used in the business functions of the entity assigned to it and the term ''zone'' is usually used for configuration of DNS services.

==Internet infrastructure DNS zones==
The top-level domain [[.arpa|arpa]] serves as a delegation zone for various technical infrastructure aspects of DNS and the Internet, and does not implement the registration and delegation system of the country and generic domains.
The name ''arpa'' is a remnant of the [[ARPANET]], one of the predecessor stages of the Internet. Intended as a transitional aid to the DNS system, deleting the domain arpa was later found to be impractical. Consequently, the name was officially redefined as an acronym for ''Address and Routing Parameter Area''. It contains sub-zones used for reverse resolution of IP addresses to host names ([[IPv4]]: in-addr.arpa, [[IPv6]]: ip6.arpa), telephone number mapping ([[ENUM]], e164.arpa), and uniform resource identifier resolution (uri.arpa, urn.arpa).

Although the administrative structure of this domain and its sub-domains is different, the technical delegation into zones of responsibility is similar and the DNS tools and servers used are identical to any other zone. Sub-zones are delegated by components of the respective resources. For example,  8.8.2.5.5.2.2.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa., which might represent an E.164 telephone number in the [[ENUM]] system, might be sub-delegated at suitable boundaries of the name. An example of an [[IP address]]es in the reverse DNS zone is 166.188.77.208.in-addr.arpa, which represents the address 208.77.188.166 and resolves to the domain name ''www.example.com''.  In the case of IP addresses, the reverse zones are delegated to the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) to which the IP address block is assigned. When an ISP allocates a range to a customer, it usually also delegates the management of that space to the customer by insertion of name server resource records pointing to the customer's DNS facilities into their zone, or provides other management tools. Allocations of single IP addresses for networks connected through [[network address translation]] (NAT) typically do not provide such facilities.

==Example of zone authority in DNS queries==
As an example of the DNS resolving process, consider the role of a recursive [[Domain Name System#DNS resolvers|DNS resolver]] attempting to look up the address "en.wikipedia.org.". It begins with a list of addresses for the most authoritative name servers it knows about – the [[Root name server|root zone name servers]] (indicated by the full stop or period), which contains name server information for all [[top-level domain]]s of the Internet.

When querying one of the root name servers, it is possible that the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] will not directly contain a record for "en.wikipedia.org.", in which case it will provide a referral to the authoritative name servers for the "org." [[top level domain]] (TLD). The resolver is issued a referral to the authoritative name servers for the "org." zone, which it will contact for more specific information. Again when querying one of the "org." name servers, the resolver may be issued with another referral to the "wikipedia.org." zone, whereupon it will again query for "en.wikipedia.org.". Since ({{as of|2010|7|lc=on}}) "en.wikipedia.org." is a [[CNAME]] to "text.wikimedia.org." (which is in turn a CNAME to "text.esams.wikimedia.org."), and the "wikipedia.org." name servers also happen to contain authoritative data for the "wikimedia.org." zone, the resolution of this particular query occurs entirely within the queried name server, and the resolver will receive the address record it requires with no further referrals.

If the last name server queried did not contain authoritative data for the target of the CNAME, it would have issued the resolver with yet another referral, this time to the zone ''text.wikimedia.org.''.  However, since the resolver had previously determined the authoritative name servers for the zone ''org.'', it does not need to begin the resolution process from scratch but instead start at zone ''org.'', thus avoiding another query to the root name servers.

There is no requirement that resolving should involve any referrals at all.  Looking up ''en.wikipedia.org.'' on the root name servers always results in referrals, but if an [[alternative DNS root]] is used which is set up to contain a record for ''en.wikipedia.org.'', then the record is returned on the first query.

[[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist Albania]] maintained '''[[labour camps]]''' ({{sq|Kampe pune}}, meaning ''work camps'') throughout the territories it controlled. The first Communist Albanian labour camps were around [[Tirana]] (although several other camp systems were developed in the north and south of the country as well). A number of camps existed between 1946 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_2/AH1959.html] Communist camps in Albania&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency''''' is a publication of the erstwhile British India first published in the year 1894 and printed at the Government Central Press, [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]) in 1896. Since the early 19th Century the [[English East India Company]] and later the [[British Empire]] annexed most of Western India and collectively named the provinces in Western India as [[Bombay Presidency]].

Most of these texts are now available free to read online as scanned books (see External Links).

Each volume in the publications consists of the historic, geographic and demographic information of the numerous British and princely states under the presidency. The general editor of the first edition was [[James Macnabb Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=32266|first=Peter|last=Harnetty|title=Campbell, Sir James Macnabb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''German Army Handbook 1939–1945''''', by W. J. K. Davies, is a small book covering the organization, equipment, and doctrine of the German ''Heer'' (and incidentally the ''Waffen-SS'') in during [[World War II]]. Though brief, it includes a thorough collection of tables, diagrams, illustrations, and photographs, and is useful as a concise introduction to the nature of the [[Wehrmacht]]'s ground forces of the period.

In the [[European Union]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/85 |title=Chapter 4: The Internet Threat |work=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind |first=James |last=Boyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''green paper''' is a tentative government report and consultation document of [[policy]] proposals for debate and discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82326.stm |title=Green Paper |publisher=BBC News | date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green papers may result in the production of a [[white paper]]. They may be considered as [[grey literature]].

==Canada==
A green paper in [[Canada]], like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted [[legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/green-paper |title=Green Paper |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/green-papers/ |title=Green Papers |publisher=The UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careandsupportreform/what-green-paper|title=What is a Green Paper?|date=2009-06-18|website=The Guardian|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
A green paper released by the [[European Commission]] is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.

==Examples==
===Discussion of defence policy in Australia, 2000===
A major review of [[defence policy]] in [[Australia]] culminated in a white paper issued in December 2000. Prior to this, a discussion paper was released in June 2000. This discussion paper was in nature what is known as a green paper (and was sometimes referred to as such).

===Copyright in the knowledge economy, 2008===
The purpose of the 2008 EU green paper on [[copyright]] was to foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science and education can best be disseminated in the online environment. The green paper, which was published on 16 July 2008, aimed to set out a number of issues connected with the role of copyright in the "[[knowledge economy]]" and intended to launch a consultation on these issues (see [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf this document]). The EU asked for answers and comments to be submitted up to 30 November 2008.

'''Historypin''' is a digital, [[user-generated]] archive of historical photos, videos, audio recordings and personal recollections. Users are able to use the location and date of their content to "pin" it to [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref&gt;Leith, Sam [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/04/historypin-photography-sam-leith "With Historypin, photography has entered the fourth dimension"], ''The Guardian'', 4 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[Google Street View]] is available, users can overlay historical photographs and compare it with the contemporary location. [http://www.historypin.com/photos/search/streetview/1/geo/45.507453,-73.551997/yaw/296.9/pitch/-2.59/zoom/0/auto_open/2429062/ (Street Viewed Photo)]

This content can be added and explored online and via a series of Smartphone applications

The project was created by the non-profit company Shift (formerly We Are What We Do), as part of their inter-generational work, with funding and support from [[Google]] as part of a series of commitments to [[digital inclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Charlotte [http://www.historytoday.com/blog/news-blog/charlotte-crow/historypin-patchwork-history "Historypin: Patchwork History"], ''History Today'', 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The website has over 200,000 assets and recollections "pinned" to the Historypin map around the world, with higher contributions in the UK, USA and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Skipworth, Hunter [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/7854922/Historypin-turns-Google-Street-View-into-a-window-on-the-past.html "Historypin turns Google Street View into a window on the past"], ''The Telegraph'', 26 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The beta version of the website was launched in June 2010 at the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institute]] in London by Nick Stanhope, CEO of Shift and the full project was launched at the [[Museum of the City of New York]] in July 2011.

The '''Kaliningrad Regional Museum of History and Arts''' ({{lang-ru|Калининградский областной историко-художественный музей}}) is a [[museum]] along the [[Lower Pond (Kaliningrad)|Lower Pond]] in [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]. The building was built in 1912 by Berlin architect, Richard Zeil, originally the [[city hall]] ('''Stadthalle''') and also a [[performing arts center]] in [[Königsberg]], [[Germany]].
== History ==
[[image:Stadthalle Königsberg.jpg|thumb|Stadthalle in Königsberg]]
The Stadthalle was planned by Oberbürgermeister [[Siegfried Körte]] in 1907 and opened in the [[Rossgarten|Vorder-Roßgarten]] district in 1912 according to designs by Richard Seel.  It included concert halls (Körtesaal, Krohnesaal, and Gebauhrsaal), a restaurant, and a garden cafe in front of the castle pond ''[[Schlossteich]]''. 
The halls were named after the initiators: [[:de:Siegfried Körte|Siegfried Körte]], [[:de:Theodor Krohne|Theodor Krohne]] and [[:de:Carl Julius Gebauhr|Carl Julius Gebauhr]].
The Königsberger Philharmonie often performed in the 1,600-seat center. 
=== World War II ===
The Stadthalle was used as a military hospital during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Mühlpfordt, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The building was heavily damaged by the 26 August 1944 [[Bombing of Königsberg in World War II]]. After the war it was part of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Kaliningrad.

The former Stadthalle was restored from 1981-86.

== {{Museum|History}} Kaliningrad Regional Museum of History and Arts ==
Since 1991 it has hosted the Kaliningrad Regional Museum of History and Arts. The museum, founded in 1946, previously had multiple locations throughout the city. It includes exhibits on regional nature, archaeology, history, World War II, and post-war Kaliningrad. The museum also has branches in the city and the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].
The museum has five halls, each of which is dedicated to a specific topic. 
=== Nature Hall ===
The hall is dedicated to the nature of the Kaliningrad region.  Here are animal and bird droppings, minerals from the Kaliningrad region.  There are several displays in the hall: the Baltic Sea, the [[Curonian Lagoon]], the Curonian forest, the Poyma River, the bog, the mixed forest. 

=== Archeological Hall ===
The archeological hall is dedicated to the earliest era of the region's history.  The exhibition includes late [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]] , [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]], until region conversion to [[Protestantism]]. 

The archaeological site is not only about the ancient Prussia, but also about the Vikings that settled in Prussia in ''Cranz'', (present-day [[Zelenogradsk]]). 

A large part of the archaeological collection is composed of exhibits from the Prussian Museum, which were considered lost and found.  The rest of the items were discovered by Soviet and Russian archeologists after the war.

=== Regional history hall === 
This hall is dedicated to the history of the region, from the time of the conquest of Prussia by the [[Teutonic Order]] Knights (3rd century) until 1945.  The hall features samples of old weapons, furniture, household items. 

=== War Room ===
The War Room is dedicated to World War II.  Here are samples of weapons, military uniforms and other items related to war.  The "Königsberg attack" corpse is in the hall. 

=== "Memory horizons" hall ===
This hall is dedicated to the post-war history of the region.  The exhibition features the life and lifestyle of the first residents, products of the first Kaliningrad enterprise, including amber products, as well as dismantled monuments of Lenin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1531">'''Konrad of Lichtenau''' (died 1240) was a medieval German chronicler from [[Swabia]].

Konrad was born to a noble Swabian family and spent time at court, before he becoming a [[Premonstratensian]] in [[Rome]] at the court of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]].  In 1226, he became Abbot of the [[Ursberg Abbey|Ursperg Monastery]] in [[Bavaria]], where he died.

==''Chronicon Urspergense''==
For many years, Konrad was believed to be the only author of the ''Chronicon Urspergense'', a chronicle of world history for the time of King [[Ninus]] of Assyria to AD 1229.  However, it has since been proven that the work was written in several parts by several different people.

The first part, which covers the period up to 1125, was written, in part at least, by [[Ekkehard of Aura]]; a continuation, from 1126 to 1225, was added by Abbot Burchard (d. 1230), who preceded Konrad as Abbot of Ursperg. Konrad himself continued the work to 1229 and made the final redaction. Later contributors, such as Kaspar Hedio, updated the chronicle down to 1537.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7844">'''Myron A. Farber''' (born c. 1938) is an [[United States|American]] newspaper reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', whose investigations into the deaths of several patients at an [[Oradell, New Jersey]], hospital led to the murder trial of Dr. [[Mario Jascalevich]], a physician at the hospital who was alleged to have used a powerful muscle relaxant in what became known as the "Dr. X" case. After refusing to turn over notes from his investigation in response to a subpoena from the defense attorney in the case, Farber was jailed for contempt and the newspaper fined, ending up spending 40 days in jail with fines of $285,000 assessed. Appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the case set a precedent for the limitations of [[shield laws in the United States]].

=="Dr. X" case==

===Initial investigation===
Farber's initial involvement in what would become known as the Dr. X case began in June 1975 when the paper received a letter from a woman claiming that as many as 40 patients had been murdered at a hospital by its chief surgeon. The letter handed to him offered no information as to where the alleged murders had occurred or who the murderer was- if there was anything at all to the letter.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;Farber, Myron. [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/On_Not_Naming_Names.html "On Not Naming Names "], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'', September 2005. Accessed October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farber pursued the case by speaking with someone in the forensic toxicology field who was able to recall a case at [[Riverdell Hospital]], a private medical facility that had since closed. Further investigation led to the identification of Dr. Mario Jascalevich as the hospital's chief surgeon. While Jascalevich's surgical patients routinely survived, those of a new surgeon were dying at a significantly high rate. This new surgeon, together with directors of the hospital, opened Jascalevich's locker on October 31, 1966, and found 18 near empty vials of [[curare]], a powerful muscle relaxant that could cause death if not administered in conjunction with artificial respiration.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

===Trial and jail===
Attorney [[Raymond A. Brown]] blamed other doctors at the hospital of framing Jascalevich to cover up their own ineptitude and charged that Farber had conspired with prosecutors to advance their respective careers by pointing the finger of blame at Jascalevich.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Joseph. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/nyregion/12brown.html "Raymond A. Brown, Civil Rights Lawyer, Dies at 94"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 11, 2009. Accessed October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Brown subpoenaed the reporter,
Farber testified in the case but cited the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]] when he refused to turn over thousands of pages of the reporter's notes that the defense had requested, citing a compelling right to protect the identity of the sources used in the articles from individuals who had spoken to him with the expectation that their confidence would be maintained.&lt;ref name=Trautwein&gt;Corcoran, David. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/02/nyregion/theodore-trautwein-judge-in-landmark-press-case-dies-at-80.html "Theodore Trautwein, Judge in Landmark Press Case, Dies at 80"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 2, 2000. Accessed October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the deadlock "a head-on collision between the First and [[Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]s", citing the conflict between the reporter's and newspaper's right of [[Freedom of the Press]] and the defendant's [[Right to a fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948246,00.html "Press: Piercing a Newsman's Shield"], [[Time (magazine)]]'', August 7, 1978. Accessed October 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Trial judge William J. Arnold had Judge [[Theodore Trautwein]] address the issues related to the release of the papers in his role as assignment judge for all Bergen County courts. In July 1978, Trautwein sentenced Farber to six months in jail and assessed fines of $5,000 each day to ''The Times'', saying that Farber had chosen placing "your privilege and your concept of your constitutional rights above the rights of the people of this state and this defendant"&lt;ref name=Trautwein/&gt;

When Farber was about to be jailed, his attorneys filed for an emergency stay on a weekend and [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] Justice [[Morris Pashman]] arrived in his golfing attire to grant the stay. When the full court heard the case the next day, Pashman was the only dissenter as the court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered that Farber serve time in jail. When the court reaffirmed the lower court action in a decision in September 1978, Pashman and fellow Justice [[Alan B. Handler]] were the only dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;[[William H. Honan|Honan, William H.]] [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/nyregion/morris-pashman-87-champion-of-free-speech-on-new-jersey-s-highest-court.html "Morris Pashman, 87, Champion of Free Speech on New Jersey's Highest Court"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 1999. Accessed October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

With several breaks for appeals, Farber ended up spending a total 40 days in the Bergen County Jail and was not released until October 24 after Jascalevich was acquitted. The [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] upheld Trautwein's decision and stripped reporters of shield law protections, though the [[New Jersey Legislature]] responded by passing even stronger shield laws to protect reporters.&lt;ref name=Trautwein/&gt;

Trautwein's actions in regard to Farber have been used as a [[case study]] in both law schools and schools of journalism. Jane E. Kirtley of the [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]] cited how "Farber's case roused journalists out of their complacency", noting that "Going to jail for more than a month is significant in anyone's eyes."&lt;ref name=Trautwein/&gt;

In November 1978, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to take the case, citing the fact that neither the [[United States Constitution]] nor existing state shield laws provide journalists with an absolute privilege to refuse to provide information demanded in a criminal case by a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Linda.

===Pardon===
In January 1982, [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Brendan Byrne]] issued a pardon to reporter M. A. Farber and ordered that $101,000 in fines be returned to ''The Times''. The paper's attorney, [[Floyd Abrams]], was planning efforts to file for the return of the additional $185,000 that had been assessed in civil contempt fines.&lt;ref&gt;Friendly, Johnathan.

'''Madame John's Legacy''' is a [[historic house museum]] at 632 Dumaine Street in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  Completed in 1788, it is one of the oldest houses in the French Quarter, and was built in the older [[French Colonial|French colonial style]], rather than the more current [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish colonial style]] of that time.  It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1970 for its architectural significance.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Madame John's Legacy|url={{NHLS url|id=70000256}} |format=pdf|date=July 3, 1975 |author=Patricia Heintzelman |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=70000256|title=''Accompanying 4 photos, exterior, from 1975.''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(0.99&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Louisiana State Museum]] owns the house and provides tours.

==Description and history==
Madame John's Legacy stands north of [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], on the southwest side of Dumaine Street between Royal and Chartres Streets.  The building's name derives from a story by New Orleans author [[George Washington Cable]], and refers to a building that previously stood on the site.  It is a French colonial raised cottage, its ground level a full-height basement built out of brick, and a wood frame main level above. The exterior is clad in wooden boards.  Behind the main building is an open courtyard, with a brick slave quarters, kitchen, and garconnière at the rear of the property probably dating to the 1820s.  The basement level of the house appears shorter than it was when built, in part because the street level has been raised in the intervening centuries.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

Although archival records point to 1788 as the date of completion for its construction, archaeological investigations suggest that the house possibly incorporates a significant amount of an earlier one built on the site circa 1730 by François Marin and occupied by his widow, the New Orleans businesswoman Elisabeth Réal, until her death in 1777. Following the 1788 fire, owner Manuel de Lanzos instructed the American contractor Robert Jones to recycle as much brick and iron hardware as possible from his damaged house, suggesting that enough of it survived the fire to be included in the rebuilding. Whether entirely rebuilt in 1788 or a restoration of a damaged structure, the house managed to survive the 1794 fire unscathed. It underwent a number of alterations in the 19th century, most notably as part of a conversion to apartments in the late 19th century.  In 1947 the house was donated to the [[Louisiana State Museum]] and operated as a museum until 1965, when it was closed due to hurricane damage.  It was subjected to a painstaking restoration in the early 1970s, restoring it as much as possible to its late 18th-century appearance, and reopened.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

[[Image:MadamJohnsLegacyPlaques.jpg|250px|left]]
This house is briefly seen in the 1994 movie ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' in a scene where caskets are being carried out of the house while Louis ([[Brad Pitt]]) is describing Lestat ([[Tom Cruise]]) and Claudia ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) going out on the town. Part of ''[[12 Years a Slave]]'' was also filmed at the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Torbett |first=Melanie |title='Twelve Years a Slave' movie has Cenla roots |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131020/LIFESTYLE/310200008/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131027100712/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131020/LIFESTYLE/310200008/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 27, 2013 |work=[[The Town Talk]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |date=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martyrs' Memorial''' is a memorial and museum in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. Located next to the Amman Sport city, the museum was established in 1977 upon [[King Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]]'s wishes. The museum showcases a rare collection of Jordan's military weapons, clothing and vehicles. It also serves as a memorial to the martyrs who gave their lives in the service of Jordan as early as 1915, starting with the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolution]] which was led by King Hussein's grandfather [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUSEUM – The Martyrs’ Memorial and Museum, Jordan|url=http://www.military-history.org/articles/museum-the-martyrs-memorial-and-museum-jordan.htm|website=Military History Monthly|accessdate=30 December 2016|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tour to Jordan|url=http://www.jewishmag.com/133mag/jordan/jordan.htm|website=www.jewishmag.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museo Correr''' ({{IPA-it|muˈzɛo korˈrɛr}}) is a museum in [[Venice]], northern Italy.  Located in [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square, Venice]], it is one of the 11 civic museums run by the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]].  The museum extends along the southside of the square on the upper floors of the Procuratorie Nuove.  With its rich and varied collections, the Museo Correr covers both the art and history of Venice.

==History==
The Museo Correr originated with the collection bequeathed to the city of [[Venice]] in 1830 by [[Teodoro Correr]]. A member of a traditional Venetian family, Correr was a meticulous and passionate collector, dedicating most of his life to the collection of both works of art and documents or individual objects that reflected the history of Venice. Upon his death, all this material was donated to the city, together with the family's [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] palace which then housed it. The nobleman also left the city funds to be used in conserving and extending the collections and in making them available to the public.
[[File:Teodoro Correr.png|thumb|200px|left|Teodoro Correr.&lt;br /&gt;Portrait by [[Bernardino Castelli]]]]
The period when he was gathering his collections was a very particular one, as the Republic of Venice had fallen in 1797 and for decades thereafter the city would be under foreign rulers and out of real necessity, many Venetian families were eager to sell off their valuable collections. Several collections ended up being bought by foreigners, but in the early decades of the 19th century there were still many pieces on the market. An insatiable collector, Correr, from his youth bought all sorts of objects and dedicated all his resources in putting together an incredible amount of material. Correr would reveal himself to have a sharp eye, putting together a collection that was undoubtedly very original. He was explicit about his intention that the collections should be made available to the public, and the museum was finally open in 1836.

Over the years, the contents of the museum would be catalogued and organized to provide scholars with a study facility and the general public with the opportunity to see the best from each individual collection. Subsequent bequests, donations and acquisitions would be added to the collection, ultimately leading to various pieces being housed on other venues.

=== From the Correr Collection to the Musei Civici Veneziani ===
Among the new pieces were the collections donated by several important Venetian families, such as the Molin, the Zoppetti, the Tironi, the Sagredo, and the [[Emmanuele Antonio Cicogna|Cicogna]], and these included significant paintings, [[maiolica]], glass pieces, and bronzes. In 1887, the enlarged collection was moved from [[Palazzo Correr]] to the nearby [[Fondaco dei Turchi]], where it was laid out in a new display. However, in 1922, the Museo Correr was moved again to its present location in [[Piazza San Marco]].

In the 1990s, the entire civic museums system was redesigned, all under a single municipal administration. In 1996, thanks to an agreement with the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Culture]], the ''St. Mark's Square Museums'' ticket was launched, granting entrance not only to the Museo Correr, but also the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], the [[Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Venice|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]] and the Monumental Rooms of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]]. Finally, in March 2008, the Museo Correr became part of the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]] system.

== The museum ==
The building that encloses the far end of the [[Piazza San Marco]] is known as the [[Napoleonic Wing]]. The design and early building works date from the period when [[Venice]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] (1806–1814), in which [[Napoleon]] was represented by the vice-regent [[Eugène de Beauharnais]]. The two long wings that run the length of the Square are the [[Procuratie Vecchie]] and the [[Procuratie Nuove]], which had housed the offices and residences of some of the main individuals of the Venetian Republic.

When the city came under Napoleonic rule, the French emperor and his court realized that public representation of imperial power posed certain logistical and political problems. Having rejected the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] because of its complex past, these turned to the Procuratie Nuove, the former residence of the ''Procuratore di San Marco'', along the southern edge of the Square. Designed in 1582 by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], this structure itself had at the time been intended to complete the vast project for the reorganization of the Piazza San Marco, which had begun with [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]] in the mid-16th century. From 1586 to 1596, works were complete on the ten arcades that extended beyond Sansovino's Library, and then, around 1640, the rest of the Procuratie Nuove was completed by [[Baldassarre Longhena]]. And this was the building which, by January 1807, Napoleon decreed should become the Imperial Palace.

All the interiors within the Procuratie Nuove were changed with the re-decoration reflecting the  taste for [[Neoclassicism]], together with the Napoleonic Wing – which now stands opposite the [[St. Mark's Basilica]] – which was designed by [[Giuseppe Soli]] and [[Lorenzo Santi]] and incorporated to the palace.

When Venice moved under Austrian dominion in 1814, the palace served as the [[House of Habsburg]] and emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] would stay there until 1815.

In 1866, after Venice became part of unified Italy, the palace passed to the House of [[Savoy]]. In 1919, [[Victor Emmanuel III]], king of Italy, handed it over to the State for use by the Ministry of Education. Hence, in 1920, part of the building was used to house the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, and then in 1922 another area became home to the Museo Correr.

=== Neoclassical Palace and Canova Collection ===
An antechamber leads into the Napoleonic Gallery which runs across the end of the [[Piazza San Marco]]. Comprising a Ballroom, Throne Room and Banqueting Hall, this is the core of the public area of the palace, exhibiting artworks by [[Antonio Canova]].

=== Venetian life and culture ===
The first floor of the Museo Correr illustrates the life and culture of the Venetian Republic over the centuries of its political grandeur and independence.

* Rooms 6 and 7 illustrate the period when the [[Doge]]'s power was at its highest and then charts the decline of the figure during the last years of the Republic, including works by [[Giovanni da Asola]], [[Andrea Michieli]], [[Girolamo Pilotti]], [[Gian Antonio Guardi]], [[Lazzaro Bastiani]], [[Joseph Heintz the Younger]], [[Michele Giambono]], [[Matteo Pagan]], [[Cesare Vecellio]], and [[Giambattista Brustolon]].
* Room 8 houses the architectural library in solid walnut which once stood in [[Palazzo Pisani a San Stefano]] in [[San Vidal]] (where the [[Venice Conservatory]] is now) and contains rare manuscripts, printed works produced in the period from the early 16th to the 18th century, and the museum's large collection of ''commissioni ducali''.
* Rooms 9 and 10 exhibit portraits of Venetian aristocrats and officials who served the Republic, including senators and ''[[Procuratore di San Marco]]''. [[Nautical maps]] and charts in ink and [[watercolor]] are also on display, dating from the 15th to the 16th century, and showing continental Europe and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] as far as the area of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Finally, the rooms also exhibit collections of [[topography|topographical]] instruments dating from the 17th and 18th century.
* Room 11 displays the Museo Correr's [[numismatic]] collection, an almost complete series of coins minted by the Venetian Republic from its origins (early 9th century AD) to its fall (1797), organized chronologically. Some 18th-century machinery from the [[Mint (coin)|Mint]] and medals are also exhibited, together with a painting by [[Tintoretto]], ''Saint Justina and the Treasurers''.
* Room 12 explores [[Venice]]'s natural affinity with the sea and its hegemony over the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There are also original navigational instruments and other implements used on-board and paintings celebrating the great naval battles fought by the Venetians.
* Room 13 illustrates what once was the [[Venetian Arsenal]], an industrial-scale complex of shipyards and docks which was the mainstay of Venice's maritime power. Displays include artworks by [[Antonio Di Natale]], [[Michele Marieschi]], [[Giacomo Franco]], and [[Alessandro Longhi]], as well as 18th-century wooden models and navigational instruments which were used in the Arsenal in the designing and building of ships.
* Room 14, ''Venice Forma Urbis'', exhibits [[cartography|cartographical]] renderings of Venice, such as the famous bird's-eye view by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], and paintings, all exploring the city's birth and expansion.
* Rooms 15 and 16 display pieces related to the city's military power. The armors date from the 16th and 17th century, while the swords, knives, war clubs and maces date from the 14th to the 16th century. There is also an example of an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] tent, some parade falchions from the late-16th century, barrel cannons, barrel firearms, and pistols.
* Rooms 17 and 18 exhibit works associated with the  Venetian general [[Francesco Morosini]], who led the city's forces several times against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

===  Art collections ===
Beginning in Room 19, the art collection in Museo Correr is divided into two parts. On the first floor, four rooms house the collection of small bronzes, including pieces by [[Veneto]] region sculptors from the late 15th to the first decades of the 17th century. On the second floor, 19 rooms display the Picture Gallery, which focuses primarily on Venetian painting up to the 16th century. There are also rooms dedicated to [[maiolica]]-work and to carved ivories.

The Picture Gallery starts at the end of Room 14 and comprises  examples of Venetian paintings from the very earliest days right up to the beginning of the 16th century.

Repeatedly re-organized during the history of the museum, the gallery still substantially reflects the original collection left by [[Teodoro Correr]], comprising artworks by [[Giovanni Bellini]] (including the early ''[[Crucifixion (Giovanni Bellini)|Crucifixion]]'', ''[[Transfiguration of Christ (Bellini)|Transfiguration of Christ]]'', a ''Madonna and Child'' and ''[[Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels]]''), [[Antonello da Messina]], [[Cosmè Tura]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]] (''[[Man with Red Hat]]'' and ''[[Two Venetian Ladies]]''), and others. Further bequests, gifts, loans, and acquisitions have added to this heritage. Other artists who are present throughout the exhibition rooms include [[Paolo Veneziano]], [[Lorenzo Veneziano]], [[Stefano Veneziano]], [[Jacobello di Bonomo]], [[Michele Giambono]], [[Jacobello del Fiore]], [[Gentile da Fabriano]], [[Pisanello]], [[Matteo Giovannetti]], [[Bartolomeo Vivarini]], [[Leonardo Boldrini]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Younger]], [[Jacopo Bellini]], [[Alvise Vivarini]], [[Cima da Conegliano]], [[Lorenzo Lotto]], [[Boccaccio Boccaccino]], and several other important Italian and European artists.

The '''Museum of Antiquities''' was an [[archaeological]] museum at the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]]. It opened in 1960 and in 2009 its collections were merged into the [[Great North Museum: Hancock]].&lt;ref name=last&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/content.phtml?ref=1208183792 |title=Last chance to visit University Museums |publisher=[[Newcastle University]] |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2008-04-24 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The museum was originally opened in 1960, and was jointly run by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]] and the University of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref name="hu-berlin1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/umacj/2/allason-jones-lindsay-27/XML/AllasonJones_xdiml.xml |title=University museums and outreach: the Newcastle upon Tyne case study |publisher=Edoc.hu-berlin.de |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the main archaeology museum in [[north east England]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ghosts/treasurehunt/newcastle.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It covered the history of the region, especially [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period in general. It included a full-scale reconstruction of the 3rd-century temple dedicated to the Roman god [[Mithras]] at [[Carrawburgh]].  Overall, the period from early prehistory to the 17th century was covered. The University's memorabilia shop was also located inside.

As part of the [[Great North Museum]] Project the museum, along with [[Shefton Museum]] was moved to the [[Hancock Museum]].  On 19 April 2008 the museum closed in preparation for the relocation to the newly renovated Hancock Museum, which reopened in May 2009.&lt;ref name=last/&gt;

The building that housed the Museum of Antiquities was demolished in 2011/2012.  It dated from the end of the Second World War and had originally been a coke testing station.&lt;ref name="hu-berlin1"/&gt;

== Awards ==
The museum was a finalist for the [[Gulbenkian Prize]] for Museum of the Year in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3399679.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Museum prize shortlist unveiled |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-01-16 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was also supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8105">'''Original order''' is a concept in [[archival theory]] that a group of records should be maintained in the same order as they were placed by the record's creator. Along with [[provenance]], original order is a core tenet of the archival concept of ''[[respect des fonds]].'' By keeping records in their original order, additional contextual information about the record's creator and the environment of their creation is preserved.

== History ==
The idea that archivists should arrange their records according to the order in which they were originally organized comes from Prussian archivists in the late nineteenth century. While trying to manage the arrangement of records within the Prussian State Archives, the archivists came up with ''Registraturprinzip'', which formed the basis for what we know as original order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=T.R.|date=|title=Archival Principles of Arrangement|url=http://www.americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.24.1.l330351406231083?code=same-site|journal=National Archives|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though assuredly a feature of earlier archival practice, the first noteworthy articulation of the practice of original order was presented in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' (also known as [[Archival appraisal#Muller, Feith &amp; Fruin – Dutch Manual, 1898|The Dutch Manual]]) in 1898, where, in the chapter on the arrangement of archival documents, point #16 states: "The system of arrangement must be based on the original organization of the archival collection, which in the main corresponds to the organization of the administrative body that produced it."

== Principle==
The [[Society of American Archivists]] ''Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology'' calls original order a "fundamental principle of archives" and posits two primary purposes: preserving "relationships and evidential significance" of records and facilitating use of the records by maintaining "the record creator's mechanisms to access.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Order|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/o/original-order|work=Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAA definition qualifies that original order is not necessarily the order of the records upon their delivery to an archive, noting that the original order may need to be created by the archivist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/restoration-of-original-order|work=Restoration of Original Order|publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists such as Maria Guercio have argued that "the principal role of the record is, in fact, that of rendering the act or fact, which is the subject of the record in its original administrative context, accessible and knowable across time and space."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guercio|first=Maria|title=Principles, Methods, and Instruments for the Creation, Preservation, and Use of Archival Records in the Digital Environment|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.64.2.n88455np210p8j5v?code=same-site|journal=The American Archivist|volume=64|issue=2|pages=238–269|doi=10.17723/aarc.64.2.n88455np210p8j5v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original order "exists to preserve the original context of records," and some records depend on their original context to tell their whole story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-2/archives-in-context-and-as-context-by-kate-theimer/#archives-in-context-and-as-context-by-kate-theimer-n-2|title=» Archives in Context and as Context Journal of Digital Humanities|website=journalofdigitalhumanities.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the common sets of core values of archivists, original order is one of the factors that sets archives apart from other institutions.

== Critique ==
The principle of original order has been critiqued by many archivists. [[T. R. Schellenberg]] argued that the principle emerged from countries with a registry system of archival custodianship, in which registrars played an important role as intermediary between the agency or institution creating records and the archive that acquired and preserved them. The imposition of order by these registrars ensured records were logically and consistently organized prior to their delivery to the archive. For Schellenberg, writing in the 1960s, this registrar function no longer existed and records instead often were delivered to an archive absent any coherent or comprehensible system of organization. Per Schellenberg:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...in most modern filing systems, the original order given record items contributes little to an understanding of organic activity, and an archivist should therefore preserve the order only if it is useful... Methods of filing are unimportant to an archivist, except from the point of view of their utility in making records accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schellenberg|first=T.R.|title=The Management of Archives|year=1965|publisher=Nation Archives and Records Administration|location=Washington D.C.|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics have noted that even the restoration of a presumed original order can risk erasing evidence of the management of a group of records after their original creation and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=Deborah|title=Protecting Provenance: Response to the Report of the Working Group on Description at the Fonds Level|journal=Archivaria|year=1989|volume=28|pages=141–145|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/11575/12521}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the shifting, malleable nature of large organizations, in which groups of records can pass through multiple custodians prior to their transfer to an archive, makes even identifying an original order difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duchein|first=Michael|title=Theoretical Principles and Practical Problems of Respect des fonds in Archival Science|journal=Archivaria|year=1983|volume=16|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12648/13813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Nesmith also argue that original order "retains little meaning in postmodern archives where origins are never final, but the subjects of new histories waiting to be done. When records arrive at an archives, they will have an order of some kind, but it will not likely be the actual original order of the records, as documents can be easily and repeatedly moved around prior to archiving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesmith|first=Tom|date=|title=Reopening Archives: Bringing New Contextualities into Archival Theory and Practice|url=https://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12523|journal=Archivaria|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" In today's modern age, technology ensures that [[fonds]] and collections are continuously growing, which makes knowing the original order difficult.

Another criticism of original order is that it prioritizes the system of arrangement of records creators over an arrangement that best suits future users and researchers. This "usability" critique "acknowledges the evidential superiority of documents over filing systems by placing primary emphasis on access to documents.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boles|first=Frank|title=Disrespecting Original Order|journal=The American Archivist|year=1982|volume=45|issue=1|page=31|url=http://archivists.metapress.com/content/94g0502t2g81053g/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of an archival collection and ongoing processing or rearrangement may also impact ideas of what constitutes "original" order and what contextual information is prioritized for preservation, as Heather MacNeil details in recounting the ongoing "custodial intervention" of one collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacNeil|first=Heather|title=Archivalterity: Rethinking Original Order|journal=Archivaria|date=Fall 2008|volume=66|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/13190/14459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1883">'''Papyrus Oxyrhynchus III 466''' (P. Oxy. III,466) is a fragmentary 2nd century  [[Greek language|Greek]] [[papyrus]] manuscript  containing instructions for [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]], including the description of various grips and holds, constituting the earliest [[historical European martial arts]] [[combat treatise|manual]]. The papyrus was given to [[Columbia University]] by the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] in 1907.

The text is in three columns with 13, 15 and 10 lines, respectively.
Each instruction is followed by ''plexon'' (πλέξον) "tangle", translated  by Miller (2004) as "mix it up!" (in the sense of "execute!"). Poliakoff (1987) translates "you fight it out".

[[File:Les trois Parques-Marco-Bigio.jpg|thumb|''The Three Parcae'' (1540-1550), by Marco Bigio, in Villa Barberini, Rome]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], the '''Parcae''' (singular, '''Parca''') were the female [[personification]]s of [[destiny]] who directed the lives (and deaths) of humans and gods. They are often called the [[Fates]] in English, and their [[interpretatio graeca|Greek equivalent]] were the '''[[Moirai]]'''.

==Names and history==
The Parcae controlled the metaphorical thread of life of every mortal and immortal from birth to death. Even the gods feared them, and by some sources [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was also subject to their power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The names of the three Parcae are:
* '''[[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]''' (Greek equivalent ''[[Clotho]]''), who spun the thread of life from her [[distaff]] onto her [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]];&lt;ref name="Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea"&gt;John Day, ''God's Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea: Echoes of a Canaanite Myth in the Old Testament'', CUP Archive, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;308.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]''' (Greek ''[[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]''), who measured the thread of life with her rod;&lt;ref name="Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea"/&gt;
* '''[[Morta (mythology)|Morta]]''' (Greek ''[[Atropos]]''), who cut the thread of life and chose the manner of a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Tels de Jong ''Sur quelques divinites romaines de la naissance et de la prophetie'' 1959, pp. 70–77; 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Ramat "Morta" in ''Archivio glottologico italiano'' 40, 1960, pp. 61–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Waszinsk ''Gnomon'' 34, 1962, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant documents referencing these deities are three small [[stelae]] ''(cippi)'' found near ancient [[Lavinium]] shortly after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 4, chapt.&lt;/ref&gt; They bear the inscription:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Neuna fata, Neuna dono, Parca Maurtia dono''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The names of two of the three Roman Parcae are recorded (''Neuna'' = Nona, ''Maurtia'' = Morta) and connected to the concept of ''fata''.&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Tels De Jong ''Sur quelques divinites romaines de la naissance et de la prophetie'' 1959 pp. 67–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Sketches - WGA20439.jpg|thumb|left|''The Three Parcae Spinning the Fate of [[Marie de' Medici]]'' (1622-1625) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
Nona was supposed to determine a person's lifespan on the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies lustricus|dies lustricus]]'', that is, the day on which the name of the child was chosen, which occurred on the ninth day from birth for a male and the eighth for a female.&lt;ref&gt;S. Breemer and J. H. Waszinsk ''Mnemosyne'' 3 Ser. 13, 1947, pp. 254–270: on personal destiny as linked to the collation of the ''dies lustricus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recurrence of the [[nundinae]] was also considered a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|dies festus]]'' and as such ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#nefas|nefas]]'' by some Roman scholars as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cornelius Labeo]], because on it the ''[[Flamen dialis#Flaminica Dialis|flaminica dialis]]'' offered the sacrifice of a goat to Jupiter in the [[Regia]].&lt;ref&gt;Macr. ''Sat.'' I 16, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sources for the Parcae is ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]], II 654, V 532, VIII 452, XV 781.
{{clear}}

Another source is [[Aeneid]] by [[Virgil]], in the opening of Book I.

In mythology the Parcae were located on a higher hierarchical level than the highest gods  :

"''The power of the Parcae was great and extend. Some suppose that they were subjected to none of the gods but Jupiter; while others support that even Jupiter himself was obedient to their commands; and indeed we see the father of the gods, in Homer's Iliad, unwilling to see Patroclus perish, yet obliged, by the superior power of the Fates, to abandon him to his destiny''" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lemprière |first1=John |title=A Classical Dictionary: Containing a Copious Account of All the Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors; with the Value of Coins, Weights and Measures, Used Among the Greeks and Romans; and a Chronological Table |date=1827 |publisher=Collin &amp; Company |page=580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;
	
"''So that we have the clearest evidence of the poet for it, that whatever happens to us is under the influence of the Parcae. Jupiter himself can not interfere to save his son Sarpedon.''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wieland ( Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown ) |first1=Christoph Martin |title=Lucian of Samosata |date=1820 |page=723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Raiders of the Lost Ark''''' is a 1981 American [[Action film|action]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], written by [[Lawrence Kasdan]] from a story by [[George Lucas]] and [[Philip Kaufman]]. It was produced by [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] for [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd., with Lucas and [[Howard Kazanjian]] as executive producers.

The first installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' film franchise]], it stars [[Harrison Ford]] as archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]], who battles a group of [[Nazism|Nazis]] searching for the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. It co-stars [[Karen Allen]] as Indiana's former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]]; [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]] as Indiana's rival, French [[archaeologist]] [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#René Belloq|René Belloq]]; [[John Rhys-Davies]] as Indiana's sidekick, [[Sallah]]; [[Ronald Lacey]] as [[Gestapo]] agent [[Arnold Toht]]; and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Indiana's colleague, [[Marcus Brody]].

The film originated from Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the [[Serial film|serials]] of the 1930s and 1940s. Production was based at [[Elstree Studios]], England, but filming also took place in [[La Rochelle, France]], [[Tunisia]], [[Hawaii]], and [[California]] from June to September 1980.

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1936, archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]] braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in [[Peru]] and retrieves a [[Golden Idol|golden idol]]. He is confronted by rival archaeologist [[List of Indiana Jones characters#René Belloq|René Belloq]] and the indigenous [[Jibito|Hovito]] people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting [[floatplane]].

Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] agents. They inform Jones that the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the [[University of Chicago]]. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of [[Tanis]] in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], and that he possesses the headpiece of an [[ancient Egypt]]ian object known as "the Staff of [[Ra]]". Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the [[Ark of the Covenant]]&amp;nbsp;— the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra (used to project a beam of [[sunlight]] on a building in a diorama of the city) is the key to finding the [[Well of Souls]], a secret chamber in [[Tanis]], [[Egypt]], in which the Ark is buried.

The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]] and discovers that Ravenwood has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter [[Marion Ravenwood|Marion]]. Jones visits Marion at her [[tavern]], where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Arnold Ernst Toht|Arnold Toht]]. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece but Jones returns to the bar and fights the Nazis to save Marion. During the fight, the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece and flees the tavern screaming in agony. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.

The pair travels to [[Cairo]], where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger [[Sallah]]. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with a replica of the headpiece (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Jones discovers Marion is alive when he finds her bound and gagged in a tent. He refuses to release her out of fear of alerting the Nazis. Jones, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Colonel Dietrich|Colonel Dietrich]] arrive and seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the [[flying wing]] that was to transport the Ark to [[Berlin]]. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to [[London]] aboard [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]] ''Bantu Wild''.

The next day, a Nazi [[U-boat]] appears and intercepts the ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the [[Aegean Sea]]. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with an [[RPG-2]], but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact and kill Marion in the process. The Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq, dressed as an [[Israelite]] [[High priest of Israel|kohen gadol]], performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark and finds it full of sand. Ghosts emerge from the Ark, destroying the equipment the Nazis are using to film the opening, and Jones tells Marion to close her eyes and not look. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the ghosts are suddenly revealed to be [[wikt:angel of death|angels of death]].  A [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|vortex of flame]] forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all.  Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror as the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes.  Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Jones and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky.  The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it.  Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.

In [[Washington, D.C.]], the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Marcus Brody|Marcus Brody]] that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied by "top men". The Ark is then shown being stored in a giant government warehouse ([[Area 51|Hangar 51]]) among countless similar crates.

* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]], an [[archaeology]] professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones claims that he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. Spielberg suggested casting Ford as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating that he did not want Ford to become his "[[Robert De Niro|Bobby De Niro]]" or "that guy I put in all my movies"—a reference to [[Martin Scorsese]], who [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|often worked with]] Robert De Niro.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; Desiring a lesser known actor, Lucas persuaded Spielberg to help him search for a new talent.

* [[Karen Allen]] as [[Marion Ravenwood]], a spirited, tough former lover of Indiana's. She is the daughter of Abner Ravenwood, Indiana Jones' mentor, and owns a bar in Nepal. Allen was cast after auditioning with Matheson and [[John Shea]]. Spielberg was interested in her, as he had seen her performance in ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]''.

* [[John Rhys-Davies]] as [[Sallah]], "the best digger in Egypt" according to Indiana, who has been hired by the Nazis to help them excavate Tanis. He is an old friend of Indiana, and agrees to help him obtain the Ark, though he fears disturbing it.

Lucas replied, "OK. What about 'Jones'?" Indiana was the name of Lucas' [[Alaskan Malamute]], whose habit of riding in the passenger seat as Lucas drove was also the inspiration for ''Star Wars''{{'}} [[Chewbacca]].&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; Spielberg was at first reluctant to sign on, as Lucas had told him that he would want Spielberg for an entire trilogy, and Spielberg did not want to work on two more scripts. Lucas told him, however, that he already had the next two movies written, so Spielberg agreed.  But when the time came for the first sequel, it was revealed that Lucas had nothing written for either sequel.&lt;ref name="makingthetrilogy" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Indianagrabsidol.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jones attempting to take the [[Golden Idol]] in the opening of the film.]] --&gt;
The following year, Lucas focused on developing ''Raiders'' and the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', during which [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between January 23–27, 1978, for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a boulder,&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; which was inspired by [[Carl Barks]]' [[Uncle Scrooge]] comic "The Seven Cities of Cibola". Lucas later acknowledged that the idea for the idol mechanism in the opening scene and deadly traps later in the film were inspired by several Uncle Scrooge comics.&lt;ref name=Barks&gt;E.

Press of Mississippi, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas came up with a submarine, a monkey giving the [[Hitler salute]], and [[Marion Ravenwood]] punching Jones in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=mcbride /&gt; Kasdan used a 100-page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft,&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p.122–123&lt;/ref&gt; which he worked on for six months.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; Ultimately, some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a mine chase,&lt;ref&gt;Script [http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html 3rd Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421180850/http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html |date=April 21, 2012 }}, scene 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; an escape in [[Shanghai]] using a rolling gong as a shield,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html Script 3rd Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421180850/http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html |date=April 21, 2012 }}, scene 148–155&lt;/ref&gt; and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of which made it into the prequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt;

Spielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Spielberg saw him as a Bondian playboy, Lucas felt the character's academic and adventurer elements made him complex enough. Spielberg had a darker vision of Jones, interpreting him as an [[alcoholic]] similar to [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character Fred C. Dobbs in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948). This characterization fell away during the later drafts, though elements survive in Jones's reaction when he believes Marion to be dead.&lt;ref name=mcbride /&gt;  Costume designer [[Deborah Nadoolman]] credits ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1954), starring [[Charlton Heston]], as an influence on the development of the character, noting that the crew watched the film together several times. Nadoolman based the look of Ford's costume on that of Heston's, and observed that Indiana is a "kinder and gentler" Harry Steele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Mike French &amp; Gilles Verschuere | title = Debora Nadoolman interview | publisher = TheRaider.net | date = September 14, 2005 | url = http://www.theraider.net/features/interviews/deborah_nadoolman.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140327132541/http://www.theraider.net/features/interviews/deborah_nadoolman.php | archivedate = March 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--See discussion--&gt;

Initially, the film was rejected by every major studio in [[Hollywood]], mostly due to the $20 million budget and the deal Lucas was offering.&lt;ref name=twenty-five&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.empireonline.com/indy/day3/ | title = Raiders Of The Lost Ark: An Oral History | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = April 24, 2008 | accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Paramount agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at [[Elstree Studios]], with Lucas trying to keep costs down.&lt;ref name="lucas prod"&gt;Hearn, pp. 127-134&lt;/ref&gt; With four illustrators, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was Spielberg's most [[storyboard]]ed film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to keep costs down and to follow the "quick and dirty" feel of the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste", Spielberg said. "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie."&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949205-1,00.html | title = Slam!

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] began on June 23, 1980, at [[La Rochelle]], France, with scenes involving the Nazi submarine,&lt;ref name="lucas prod" /&gt; which had been rented from the production of ''[[Das Boot]]''. The U-boat pen was a real one from [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; The crew moved to [[Elstree Studios]]&lt;ref name="lucas prod" /&gt; for the [[Well of Souls]] scenes, the opening sequence temple interiors and Marion Ravenwood's bar.&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060818/index.html | last = Fromter | first = Marco | title = Around the World with Indiana Jones | publisher = Lucasfilm | date = August 18, 2006 | accessdate = March 11, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207151651/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060818/index.html | archivedate = February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Well of Souls scene required 7,000 snakes. The only venomous snakes were the [[cobras]], but one crew member was bitten on set by a python.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; The bulk of the snakes' numbers were made up with giant but harmless legless lizards known as [[Scheltopusik]]s (''Pseudopus apodus'') which occur from the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] of southeastern Europe to [[Central Asia]]. Growing to 1.3 m they are the largest [[legless lizard]]s in the world and are often mistaken for snakes despite some very obvious differences such as the presence of eyelids and external ear openings, which are both absent from all snakes, and a notched rather than forked tongue. In the finished film, during the scene in which Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a reflection in the glass screen that protected Ford from the snake was seen,&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; an issue that was corrected in the 2003 digitally-enhanced re-release. Unlike Indiana, neither Ford nor Spielberg has a fear of snakes, but Spielberg said that seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him "want to puke".&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt;

The opening scene in the Peruvian jungle was filmed on the island of [[Kauai]], one of the islands of Hawaii, to which Spielberg would return for ''[[Jurassic Park]]''. The first shot features a misty view of Kalalea Mountain, the culminating point in [[Anahola, Hawaii]]. The "temple" location is on the Huleia River, on the Kipu Ranch, south from Kaumualii Highway on the east coast, just south of [[Lihue]], the island's main town. Kipu is a working cattle ranch, not generally open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldwide guide to movie locations|work=Movie-locations.com|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/Raiders_Of_The_Lost_Ark.html#.VLsLLCcUpug}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peruvian section (but actually filmed in Hawaii) featured live [[tarantulas]] of a Mexican species (''[[Brachypelma]]'') on [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Alfred Molina]], and are harmless to humans, and in fact of a species which are commonly kept as exotic pets. A [[fiberglass]] boulder 22&amp;nbsp;feet (7&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes from the temple; Spielberg was so impressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that he gave the boulder a more prominent role in the film and told Reynolds to let the boulder roll another {{convert|50|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people= Norman Reynolds (Production Designer) | title= Making the Trilogy | medium= DVD | time= 17:40 | quote="Steven said 'Why don't we make it another 50ft longer?' Which of course we did"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes set in [[Egypt]] were filmed in [[Tunisia]], and the canyon where Indiana threatens to blow up the Ark was shot in Sidi Bouhlel, just outside [[Tozeur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Raiders of The Lost Ark |author=Taylor, Derek |date= 1981|publisher= Ballantine Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canyon location had been used for the [[Tatooine]] scenes from 1977's ''Star Wars'' (many of the location crew members were the same for both films&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt;) where [[R2-D2]] was attacked by [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Jawa|Jawas]].&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby Sedala, a harsh place due to heat and disease. Several cast and crew members fell ill and Rhys-Davies [[Defecation|defecated]] in his costume during one shot.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; Spielberg averted disease by eating only [[canned food]]s from England, but did not like the area and quickly condensed the scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised: the scene where Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised as was the entire plane fight. During that scene's shooting, a wheel went over Ford's knee and tore his left leg's [[cruciate ligament]], but he refused local medical help and simply put ice on it.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt;

The fight scenes in the town were filmed in [[Kairouan]], while Ford was suffering from [[dysentery]]. Stuntman [[Terry Richards (actor)|Terry Richards]] had practiced for weeks with his sword to create the scripted fight scene, choreographing a fight between the swordsman and Jones' whip.&lt;ref name=RCNews&gt;{{cite web|title=Indiana Jones Stuntman Terry Richards Interview|publisher=Red Carpet News|date=2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol8AFk4yZrs|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after filming the initial shots of the scene, after lunch due to Ford's dysentery, Ford and Spielberg agreed to cut the scene down to a gunshot, with Ford saying to Spielberg "Let's just shoot the sucker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Urban Legends of Indiana Jones | publisher=Lucasfilm | date=January 13, 2004 | url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20040113/index.html | accessdate=March 11, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612222640/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20040113/index.html | archivedate = June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later voted in at No.5 on [[Playboy magazine|''Playboy'']] magazine's list of best all time scenes.&lt;ref name=RCNews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Independent| title=Terry Richards: Stuntman who battled four James Bonds, Luke Skywalker and Rambo and was famously shot dead by Indiana Jones|author=Hayward, Anthony|date=July 9, 2014| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/terry-richards-stuntman-who-battled-four-james-bonds-luke-skywalker-and-rambo-and-was-famously-shot-dead-by-indiana-jones-9593218.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the truck chase was shot by [[second unit]] director [[Michael D.

Spielberg then filmed all the shots with Ford himself in and around the truck cab.&lt;ref name=makingthetrilogy /&gt; Lucas directed a few other second unit shots, in particular the monkey giving the Nazi salute.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

The interior staircase set in [[Washington, D.C.]] was filmed in [[San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]]. The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]'s campus in [[Stockton, California]], stood in for the exterior of the college where Jones works, while his classroom and the hall where he meets the American intelligence agents was filmed at the [[Royal Masonic School for Girls]] in [[Rickmansworth]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], which was again used in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]''. His home exteriors were filmed in [[San Rafael, California]].&lt;ref name=world /&gt; Opening sequence exteriors were filmed in [[Kauai]], Hawaii, with Spielberg wrapping in September in 73&amp;nbsp;days, finishing under schedule in contrast to his previous film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''.&lt;ref name="lucas prod" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mcbride /&gt; The Washington, D.C. coda, although it appeared in the script's early drafts, was not included in early edits but was added later when it was realized that there was no resolution to Jones' relationship with Marion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/indexp4.html | title = Twenty-Five Reasons to Watch Raiders Again | publisher = Lucasfilm | date = June 12, 2006 | accessdate = March 11, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610051833/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/indexp4.html | archivedate = June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shots of the [[Douglas DC-3]] Jones flies on to Nepal were taken from ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'', and a street scene was from a shot in ''[[The Hindenburg (film)|The Hindenburg]]''.&lt;ref name=time /&gt; Filming of Jones boarding a Boeing [[Boeing 314|Clipper]] flying-boat was complicated by the lack of a surviving aircraft.

After viewing the film's rough cut, Lucas's then-wife and frequent collaborator [[Marcia Lucas]] opined that there was no emotional closure, because Marion did not appear at the ending. Although Marcia is not credited in the film, her suggestion led to Spielberg reshooting the final exterior sequence with Ford and Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.co.uk/news/3-ways-which-marcia-lucas-helped-save-star-wars-0|title=3 ways in which Marcia Lucas helped save Star Wars|year=2017|website=SYFY UK|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final scene, where the Ark is placed in a vast warehouse, was Spielberg's homage to ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', where Kane's lost childhood sled, "Rosebud", is similarly treated.&lt;ref name="McGee2011" /&gt; 

=== Visual effects and sound design ===
The special visual effects for ''Raiders'' were provided by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am [[flying boat]] in the water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Thomas G.|date= |title= Industrial Light &amp; Magic: The Art of Special Effects|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 140|isbn= |author-link= }} 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Thomas G.|date= |title= Industrial Light &amp; Magic: The Art of Special Effects|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 66|isbn= |author-link= }} 1986&lt;/ref&gt; superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating,&lt;ref name="Industrial Light p. 62"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Thomas G.|date= |title= Industrial Light &amp; Magic: The Art of Special Effects|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 62|isbn= |author-link= }} 1986&lt;/ref&gt; a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (The [[PG-13]] rating was not created until 1984.)&lt;ref name=magic&gt;{{Cite video|title=The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones|type=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.&lt;ref name="Industrial Light p. 62" /&gt; [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]] and [[Keith Short]] created the Ark prop based on the paintings of [[James Tissot]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Nancy Rose and Malcolm Warner (1999) ''James Tissot: Victorian Life, Modern Love''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Burtt]], the sound effects supervisor, made extensive use of traditional [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]] work in yet another of the production's throwbacks to days of the [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] [[Serial film|serials]]. He selected a [[.30-30 Winchester]] rifle for the sound of Jones' [[pistol]]. Sound effects artists struck leather jackets and [[baseball glove]]s with a [[baseball bat]] to create a variety of punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over concrete were used for the slithering noises. The sliding lid on a toilet cistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, and the sound of the boulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral. Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous [[Wilhelm scream]] when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on ''Star Wars''. He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|title=The Sound of Indiana Jones|type=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Pangrazio]] created the final shot's matte painting on glass over three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vashivisuals.com/raiders-lost-ark-warehouse-matte-painting/|title=Raiders of the Lost Ark – Matte Painting|last=Nedomansky|first=Vashi|date=May 6, 2014|website=VashiVisuals|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Williams]] composed the score for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', which was the only score in the series performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the same orchestra that performed the scores for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga. The score most notably features the well-known "Raiders March". This piece came to symbolize Indiana Jones and was later used in the scores for the other three films. Williams originally wrote two different candidates for Jones's theme, but Spielberg enjoyed them so much that he insisted that both be used together in what became the "Raiders March".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people=[[John Williams]]|title=The Music of Indiana Jones|type=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternately eerie and apocalyptic theme for the Ark of the Covenant is also heard frequently in the score, with a more romantic melody representing Marion and, more broadly, her relationship with Jones. The score as a whole received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, but lost to the score to ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' composed by [[Vangelis]].

=== Home media ===
The film was released on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]] and [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|VideoDisc]] in [[pan and scan]] only, and on [[laserdisc]] in both pan and scan and [[widescreen]]. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in [[THX]] and made available in widescreen. The outer package was labeled '''''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''''' for consistency with [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|the film's prequel]] and [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|its sequel]]. The subsequent [[DVD]] release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/15081|title=10 Awesome Indiana Jones Facts|date=May 21, 2008|publisher=[[Mental floss]]|author=Miss Cellania|accessdate=May 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525201745/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/15081|archivedate=May 25, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the theatrical release of ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', ''Raiders'' (along with ''The Temple of Doom'' and ''The Last Crusade'') was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008.

=== Critical reception ===
The film was highly acclaimed by critics and audiences alike. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 95% "Certified Fresh" rating with a 9.2/10 average rating. The sites critical consensus stating: "Featuring bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action,&amp;nbsp;''Raiders of the Lost Ark''&amp;nbsp;is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Raiders of the Lost Ark | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/raiders_of_the_lost_ark/ | accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an 85% rating on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Metacritic|title=Raiders of the Lost Ark|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/raiders-of-the-lost-ark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and accolades ===
The film was subsequently nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration ([[Norman Reynolds]], [[Leslie Dilley]], and [[Michael D. Ford]]). It also received a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing.

== Influence==
Following the success of ''Raiders'', a prequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|The Temple of Doom]]'', and two sequels, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', were produced, with a third sequel set for release in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title='Indiana Jones 5' Delayed a Year; Disney Shifts 'Wreck-It Ralph 2', 'Gigantic' and More|url=http://collider.com/indiana-jones-5-release-date-delayed-2020/|accessdate=August 6, 2017|work=Collider|date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A television series, entitled ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', was also spun off from this film, and details the character's early years. Numerous other books, [[Indiana Jones Comics|comics]], and video games have also been produced.

In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the first century of cinema. In 2007, AFI updated the list and placed it at number 66. They also named it as the 10th most thrilling film, and named Indiana Jones as the second greatest hero. In 1999, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Indiana Jones has become an icon, being listed as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s third favorite action hero, while noting "some of the greatest action scenes ever filmed are strung together like pearls" in this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20041669_20041686_20153598_22,00.html|title=25 Awesome Action Heroes|date=October 23, 2007|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Marc Bernadin|accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An amateur, near shot-for-shot remake was made by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb, then children in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]]. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of the film, called ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation]]'', it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, when it was discovered by [[Eli Roth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=15348|title=Raiders of the Lost Ark shot-for-shot teenage remake review!!!|date=May 31, 2003|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|author=Harry Knowles|authorlink=Harry Knowles|accessdate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/03/raiders200403|title=Raiders of the Lost Backyard|author=Jim Windolf|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acclaimed by Spielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said he looked forward to seeing their names on the big screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2003-05-30/screens_feature4.html|title=Lost Ark Resurrected|date=May 30, 2003|work=[[Austin Chronicle]]|author=Sarah Hepola|accessdate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] purchased the trio's life rights with the goal of producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=17079|title=Sometimes, The Good Guys Win!!!

In 2014, film director [[Steven Soderbergh]] published an experimental black-and-white version of the film, with the original soundtrack and dialogue replaced by an electronic soundtrack. Soderbergh said his intention was to encourage viewers to focus on Spielberg's extraordinary staging and editing: "This filmmaker forgot more about staging by the time he made his first feature than I know to this day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension765.com/sdr/18-raiders|title=Raiders|work=Extension765.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing the film's legacy in 1997, Bernard Weinraub, film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which had initially reviewed the film as "deliriously funny, ingenious, and stylish",&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)|date=June 12, 1981|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Vincent Canby]]|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that "the decline in the traditional family G-rated film, for 'general' audiences, probably began" with the appearance of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. "Whether by accident or design," found Weinraub, "the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children."&lt;ref name="The New York Times 3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/22/movies/movies-for-children-and-their-parents-are-far-from-pollyanna.html|title=Movies for Children, and Their Parents, Are Far From 'Pollyanna'|date=July 22, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Bernard Weinraub|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, in 2005, viewers of [[Channel 4]] rated the film as the 20th-best [[family film]] of all time, with Spielberg taking best over-all director honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4553694.stm|title=ET Crowned 'Greatest Family Film'|date=December 23, 2005|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the Blu-ray release, a limited one-week release in [[IMAX]] theaters was announced for September 7, 2012. Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt supervised the format conversion. No special effects or other visual elements were altered, but the audio was enhanced for [[surround sound]].&lt;ref name="IMAX"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-to-receive-imax-re-release/?ref=movies|title=That's a Big Boulder, Indy: Steven Spielberg on the Imax Rerelease of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=August 14, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 replica mystery ===
In December 2012, the [[University of Chicago]]'s admissions department received a package in the mail addressed to Henry Walton Jones, Jr., Indiana Jones' full name. The address on the stamped package was listed for a hall that was the former home of the university's geology and geography department. Inside the manila envelope was a detailed [[replica]] journal similar to the one Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of [[Marion Ravenwood]]. The admissions department posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, looking for any information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part of a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on [[eBay]]. The package with the journal had fallen out in transit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a complete address and postage, which turned out to be fake. All contents were from a [[Guam]] "prop replicator" who sells them all over the world. The university will display its replica in the main lobby of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Raiders of the Lost Ark' mystery solved – Package's origins determined |author=Schwartz, Terri |date=December 18, 2012 |publisher=Screener |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-mystery-solved-packages-origins-determined/ |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds''''' is a book first published by Reader's Digest Services Pty Ltd of [[Sydney]], Australia in 1976 and reprinted several times, with a completely revised edition issued in 1986.

==Description==
The book is small [[folio (printing)|folio]] in size, 330&amp;nbsp;mm in height by 230&amp;nbsp;mm in width.  It describes and illustrates [[bird]] species recorded from Australia, mostly at one species per page, using photographs sourced from the [[National Photographic Index of Australian Wildlife]].  The distinctive, mainly blue, cover features a photograph of a pair of [[olive-backed sunbird]]s.

Before the individual species accounts which fill most of the book there is a [[foreword]] by [[Alexander Hugh Chisholm|Alec H. Chisholm]] and sections on “Where birds live” and “Naming and identifying birds”, while following the species accounts are chapters on “Rare visitors, escaped captives and unsuccessful introductions”, “Classification by order and family”, “Behaviour that distinguishes species” by [[Ian Rowley]], “Migrants and nomads” and “How birds' numbers are regulated” by [[Harold James Frith|H.J. Frith]], “Birds of prehistoric Australia” by [[Gerard Frederick van Tets|G.F. van Tets]], and “The mysterious origins of Australian birds” by [[Richard Schodde]], before the indexes and acknowledgments.

===First edition===
The consultant editor of the 616-page first edition was H.J. Frith.  A review by Simon Bennett in the [[Emu (journal)|Emu]], the journal of the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]], said
&lt;blockquote&gt;”The Reader's Digest book is a co-operative effort, combining contemporary expertise in Australian ornithologywith the photographic excellence of the National Photographic Index of Australian Birds.”&lt;ref name=SCB&gt;Bennett (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”Almost every species is illustrated by one or sometimes two colour photographs. These are of high quality and no doubt represent the best published assemblage of photographs of Australian birds.  The few poor quality and black-and-white photographs can be excused; the picture of the [[Paradise parrot|Paradise Parrot]], for example, is the only one known and is of considerable historic interest.  Although not all photographs were taken in the field, the techniques used convey a natural setting.”&lt;ref name=SCB/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”The text accurately summarizes much that is known of Australian birds. The list of contributors is like a ''Who's Who'' of Australian ornithology, which makes the reviewer's job difficult.  The information is presented in an easily read style, free from jargon.  It is good to see many ecological and conservational concepts in the text.  The only major criticism relates to the information on distribution.  Some of the maps are not consistent with the text (e.g. [[Black butcherbird|Black Butcherbird]] and [[Noisy miner|Noisy Miner]]s) or with published information.”&lt;ref name=SCB/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first edition was reprinted, with minor corrections, in 1977, 1979, 1982 and 1983.

===Second edition===
Frith died in 1982; when a thoroughly revised and updated edition ({{ISBN|0949819999}}) was issued in 1986 the consultant editors were Richard Schodde and Sonia Tidemann.  Chisholm's foreword was replaced by one by the new editors, the chapters at the back of the book were moved to the front, and new material (e.g. a chapter on “The functions of feathers”) was added.  In the foreword Schodde and Tidemann say
&lt;blockquote&gt;”One of the many purposes of this book is to provide the information that will allow general appreciation of the life style and habitat needs of Australia's birds.  From the moment it appeared, the ''Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds'' became the pacemaker as the most comprehensive and authoritative of popular references to the birds of our continent.  Its authority stemmed – as now – from its association with the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]'s Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research.  Most of the first edition, published in 1976, was compiled by staff of the Division; its then Chief, Dr H. J. Frith, was consultant editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

“The second edition seeks to maintain that standing, its input increased by members of the Division and augmented by additions from other new contributors whose help- we gratefully acknowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

“Because few [[field guide]]s were then available, the first edition featured identification notes and the biology of our birds.  Many gaps have since been filled, allowing us to stress their habits more: where they live, what they feed on and how they breed, aspects not emphasised in any other publication on Australian birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

“The comprehensiveness of the new text springs from a careful updating of information from research on all species.  Readers who skim its surface will notice at once the expanded text, the corrections in classification – though these are few – and the many changes to maps of distribution, based on the ''[[Atlas of Australian Birds]]'' just published by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.  Others who dig deeper will find that the accounts of most species have been revised extensively and many completely rewritten, including all additional species; not one species has been left unadjusted.”&lt;ref&gt;Schodde &amp; Tidemann (1986), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second edition was reprinted in 1988, 1990 and 2007.

[[File:Secretary Kerry Receives a Tour of the Vatican from the Vatican Protocol Chief (11948814624).jpg|thumb|[[John Kerry]] in the ''Sala Regia'' (2014). At the end of the hall is the entrance to the [[Cappella Paolina]].]]
The '''Sala Regia''' (Regal Room) is a state hall in the [[Apostolic Palace]], in [[Vatican City]].

Although not intended as such, this broad room is really an [[antechamber]] to the [[Sistine Chapel]], reached by the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]]. To the left of the entrance formerly stood the papal [[throne]], which is now at the opposite side before the door leading to the [[Cappella Paolina|Pauline Chapel]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=The Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was begun under [[Pope Paul III]] by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] and was completed in 1573. The elegant [[barrel vault]] is graced by the very impressive [[plaster]] decorations of [[Perino del Vaga]]. The [[stucco]] [[Ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] over the doors are by [[Daniele da Volterra]].

The walls were decorated by [[Livio Agresti]], [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Taddeo Zuccari]]. The frescoes depict momentous turning-points in the history of the Church, including the return of [[Pope Gregory XI]] from [[Avignon]] to [[Rome]], the [[Battle of Lepanto]], the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;Howe, E. "Architecture in Vasari's 'Massacre of the Huguenots'," ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 39, 1976 (1976), pp. 258-261 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/751147 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; the raising of the ban from [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the reconciliation of [[Pope Alexander III]] with [[Frederick Barbarossa]] and Peter II of Aragon offering the Kingdom to Pope Innocent III.

The hall was originally used for the reception of [[prince]]s and royal [[ambassador]]s, hence its name. [[papal consistory|Consistories]] were held in it, but were later transferred to the [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] on November 19, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/world/article/Pope-decries-surge-of-polarization-over-race-10624883.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the area has also provided an occasional musical [[recital]] in the presence of the [[pope]]; during a [[Papal conclave|conclave]] it was used as a [[promenade]] for the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

'''''Schott's Miscellanies''''' are a set of best-selling books by [[Ben Schott]]. They consist of a collection of [[trivia]] generally centred on the culture of the United Kingdom (and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[European Union]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]). [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|Bloomsbury]] published the first book in 2002, to widespread acclaim. The books are as follows: ''Schott's Original Miscellany'', ''Schott's Food &amp; Drink Miscellany'', ''Schott's Sporting, Gaming &amp; Idling Miscellany'', and ''Schott's Quintessential Miscellany''. Together the first three books have sold over two million copies, and ''Schott's Original Miscellany'' has been translated into more than 13 languages (including Japanese). Schott also compiled the annual ''[[Schott's Almanac]]'', a modern take on the traditional [[almanac]].{{cn|date=July 2013}}

In December 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, which described ''Schott's Original Miscellany'' as "the publishing sensation of the year", produced a special edition of its ''G2'' section with selections from the book's 2006 edition.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

{{Chinese Military Texts}}

'''''Sun Bin's Art of War''''' is an [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] classic work on [[military strategy]] written by [[Sun Bin]], an alleged descendant of [[Sun Tzu]] who served as a military strategist in the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] during the [[Warring States period]]. According to historical records from the [[Han Dynasty]], ''Sun Bin's Art of War'' contained an extensive 89 chapters, with four volumes of pictures attached, but was lost by the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. As a consequence, ''Sun Bin's Art of War'' is sometimes conflated with Sun Tzu's ''[[The Art of War]]''.

==Rediscovery of the lost works==
[[File:Han Copy of Sun Bing Military Tactics.jpg|thumb|A [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC - 220 AD) copy of Sun Bing's ''Art of War'' (in a [[scroll]] of wooden strips), from a tomb of [[Shandong province]], now in the Military Museum]]
In April 1972, bamboo slips of both [[Sun Tzu]]'s and [[Sun Bin]]'s works were [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|unearthed in the Yinque Hills]] ([[Linyi]] city, [[Shandong]] province). Due to natural erosion, some of the bamboo slips were damaged and difficult to reinterpret. After the initial collection and study by experts, the Cultural Relic Press published a new edition of ''Sun Bin's Art of War'', divided into two volumes, each containing 15 chapters, from the 364 bamboo slips, with a total of 11,000 words.

After a decade of textual research and study, the Cultural Relic Press made a major adjustment to the book: the second volume was no longer considered to be Sun Bin's writings; the first volume was edited and one chapter detailing five types of training was added. The current edition of ''Sun Bin's Art of War'' contains 16 chapters from 222 bamboo slips, with a total of 4891 words.

==Contents==

===Chapter 1 : Capturing Pang Juan===
Describes the four stratagems employed in the [[Battle of Guiling]]:
#A southward march at the initial stage of the war, to avoid a decisive battle with [[Pang Juan]]
#Launching a false attack and feigning retreat and defeat in Pingling, which reinforced Pang Juan's determination to attack [[Handan]]
#Direct advance on [[Kaifeng]] (capital city of the [[Wei (state)|Wei state]]) to force Pang Juan to turn back to rescue Wei
#Ambush at Guiling to destroy the enemy in one move

===Chapter 2: Meeting King Wei===
Sun Bin discusses with [[King Wei of Qi]] about war and states: "Only victory in war can bring about authority and prosperity". Sun believes that the historically progressive unification accomplished in war had been an important means of facilitating the submission of [[feudal]] lords. To start a war, one must have "a storage of materials, a just cause for war" and must "be well-prepared before launching an attack". Sun also pointed out that "Warmongers will inevitably lose and those who expect to make a fortune out of war will also suffer defeat and disgrace".

===Chapter 3: King Wei asks for advice===
Sun Bin advises King Wei and [[Tian Ji]], engaging them in a comprehensive discussion on his basic thoughts about strategy and tactics. The chapter focuses on resolute attacks on weakly defended key enemy positions and on the military philosophy of using [[Tao]] and flexible principles to attain victory.

===Chapter 4: Tian Ji asks how to construct a defence===
Set in the [[Battle of Maling]], Sun Bin and Tian Ji discuss the problems of battlefield positions in field operations. The combination of terrain, weapons and the types of soldiers is emphasized.

===Chapter 5: Selection of the best soldiers===
Comments on the basic principles of building and training an army, and on the factors of field command that will determine victory or defeat. On the topic of building an army, Sun Bin focuses on the employment of the best soldiers in terms of field command.
He stresses 'five factors that will lead to constant victory':
#''The commander who has won the sovereign's trust and has an independent command will win.''
#''The one who knows the art of war will win.''
#''The one who gets uniform support from his soldiers will win.''
#''The one whose subordinates work in concert with each other will win.''
#''The one who is good at analysing and utilising terrain will win.''

There are also five corollaries that will lead to constant defeat:
#''The one whose command is constrained by the sovereign will be defeated.''
#''The one who does not know the art of war will be defeated.''
#''The one who does not have the support of his soldiers will be defeated.''
#''The one whose subordinates do not work in harmony will be defeated.''
#''The one who does not know to use spies will be defeated.''

===Chapter 7: Eight formations===
Discusses the methods of a commander and the principles of battle formation.
It emphasises that a commander must ''be well versed in both meteorology and geography. He also must get the support of his people at home, while understanding the actual situation of his enemy. In a direct battle, he knows well the basic points of the eight formations. If one is sure of victory he will fight; if unsure he should not fight.'' Sun Bin also emphasises ''that in laying a formation, the army can be divided into three divisions. In each, the best soldiers should be placed as a vanguard and every team should be followed with a sustainable reserve.''&lt;br&gt;
He emphasises ''dividing the army into three teams'' and ''engaging one team in battle in while leaving the other two strictly in defence.''&lt;br&gt;
Sun Bin says that an army must take an advantageous geographical position to attack enemy in a less defensible position. ''When land is flat there should be more armed chariots; when terrain is difficult, more cavalry should be sent: and when is narrow and blocked, there should be more archers sent.''

===Chapter 14: Organisation of military posts===
Chapter 14 is similar to military rules and regulations of the later ages.
It may be divided into three parts:
#Regulations for army organization and command, emphasising that all types of organizations, units and systems must complete and appropriately meet the requirements for battle.
#Regulations for military operations under different enemy situations, different terrain, and different climates. Its focus is to emphasize flexibility in command and in the employment of soldiers, and on the need to make decisions according to the situation.
#Specific rules on marching, camping, patrolling, guarding, war preparations and logistics.

'''''The Muppet Christmas Carol''''' is a 1992 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy-drama]] film produced by [[The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Productions]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. Adapted from [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', it is the fourth theatrical film to feature [[the Muppets]], and the first to be produced following the death of Muppets creator [[Jim Henson]] in 1990. The film was directed by [[Brian Henson]] in his directorial debut from a screenplay by [[Jerry Juhl]], and stars [[Michael Caine]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], alongside Muppet performers [[Dave Goelz]], [[Steve Whitmire]], [[Jerry Nelson]], and [[Frank Oz]] portraying various roles, including [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] narrating the film as Dickens and [[Kermit the Frog]] as [[Bob Cratchit]]. Although artistic license is taken to suit the aesthetic of the Muppets, ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' otherwise follows Dickens's original story closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Muppets Take On Dickens' 'Carol' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1992-12-11 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-11/entertainment/ca-1527_1_muppet-christmas-carol |accessdate=2018-08-07|first=Peter|last=Rainer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' was released on December 11, 1992, to modest box office success and mostly positive reviews. As well as Jim Henson, the film is dedicated to fellow puppeteer [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]], who died eleven months before its release.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! --&gt;
On [[Christmas Eve]], in 19th Century [[London]], [[Charles Dickens]] (played by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo the Great]]) and his friend [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] act as [[narrator]]s throughout the film. [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] ([[Michael Caine]]), a surly money-lender, does not share the merriment of Christmas. Scrooge rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol singing [[Bean Bunny]]. His loyal employee [[Bob Cratchit]] (played by [[Kermit the Frog]]) and the other bookkeepers request to have Christmas Day off since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. Scrooge leaves for home while the bookkeepers celebrate Christmas. In his house, Scrooge encounters the ghosts of his late business partners [[Jacob Marley|Jacob and Robert Marley]] (played by [[Statler and Waldorf]]), who warn him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife like they were, informing him that three spirits will visit him during the night.

At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life, Dickens and Rizzo hitching a ride too. They visit his lonely school days, and then his time as an employee under Fozziwig ([[Mr. Fezziwig]] from the original story, played by [[Fozzie Bear]]), who owned a [[rubber chicken]] factory. Fozziwig and his mother throw a Christmas party, where Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, whom he falls in love with. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him when he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge dismisses the Ghost as he returns to the present.

At two o'clock, Scrooge meets the gigantic, merry [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred’s house where Scrooge is made fun of. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with their small dinner, Scrooge taking pity on Bob's ill son [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] (played by [[List of Muppets#Robin the Frog|Robin the Frog]]). The Ghost of Christmas Present abruptly ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely not survive until next Christmas. Scrooge and the Ghost go to a cemetery, where the latter fades away. The [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] then approaches Scrooge, appearing as a tall, silent cloaked figure. While Dickens and Rizzo abandon the audience to avoid being frightened, the Ghost takes Scrooge into the future.

Scrooge and the Ghost witness a group of businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague where they would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided. In a den, Scrooge recognizes his [[charwoman]], his laundress, and the local [[Funeral director|undertaker]] trading several stolen possessions of the deceased to a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Old Joe. The Ghost transports Scrooge to Bob's house, discovering Tiny Tim has died. Scrooge is escorted back to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out his own grave, revealing Scrooge as the man who died. Realizing this, Scrooge decides to change his ways.

Awakening in his bedroom on Christmas Day, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner, and ventures out with Bean, Dickens, Rizzo, and the charity workers to spread happiness and joy around London. Scrooge goes to the Cratchit house, at first putting on a stern demeanor, and then revealing he intends to raise Bob's salary and pay off his mortgage. Dickens narrates how Scrooge became a secondary father to Tiny Tim, who escaped death. Scrooge, the Cratchits, and the neighborhood celebrate Christmas.

==Production==
Following [[Jim Henson]]'s death in 1990, [[talent agent]] Bill Haber approached his son [[Brian Henson|Brian]] with the idea of filming an adaptation. Haber told Henson that "''Christmas Carol'' is the greatest story of all time, you should do that" and later informed Henson that he sold the idea to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as a television movie.&lt;ref name="Howwemade"&gt;{{cite interview|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/21/how-we-made-the-muppet-christmas-carol|title=How we made: The Muppet Christmas Carol|subject=Brian Henson, Steve Whitmire|interviewer=Ben Beaumont-Thomas|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime Muppets writer [[Jerry Juhl]] was hired to write the script and decided to insert [[Charles Dickens]] as the stand-in narrator in order to remain faithful to the original prose of the written material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Brian Henson|interviewer=Alyssa Fikse|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/2015/12/the-muppet-christmas-carol-fascinating-facts/2/|title=The ‘Rainbow Connection’ Connection And Other ‘Muppet Christmas Carol’ Facts|work=[[Uproxx]]|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson stated that Gonzo was chosen because he was the least likely choice to play Charles Dickens,&lt;ref name="Henson3" /&gt; while Rizzo the Rat was added to inject some humor and serve as a [[Greek chorus]].&lt;ref name="mentalfloss"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristy|last=Puchko|title=14 Things You Might Not Know About 'The Muppet Christmas Carol'|work=[[Mental Floss]]|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established Muppet characters were initially written to portray the ghosts, with various accounts stating [[Robin the Frog]] or [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] was to be the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[Miss Piggy]] to be the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]], and Gonzo (before he was written to portray Dickens) or [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] as the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]].&lt;ref name="Howwemade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henson3" /&gt; However, the idea was scrapped in favor of new Muppet characters that would better underline the ominous nature.&lt;ref name="mentalfloss" /&gt; After the script was submitted for approval to ABC, the executives of [[Walt Disney Pictures]] offered to purchase the script for a feature film instead of a television movie.&lt;ref name="Henson3"&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Brian Henson|interviewer=Alyssa Fikse|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/2015/12/brian-henson-interview/3/|title=Brian Henson On What Makes ‘A Muppet Christmas Carol’ So Special And His Father's Legacy|work=Uproxx|date=December 23, 2015|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English actors [[David Hemmings]], [[Ron Moody]], and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and comedian [[George Carlin]] were considered to portray Ebenezer Scrooge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heaney|first=Katie|title=14 Things You Didn’t Know About "The Muppet Christmas Carol"|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/14-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-muppet-christmas-carol#.jkvZGmP3a|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson later offered the role to [[Michael Caine]], who replied: "I'm going to play this movie like I’m working with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me."&lt;ref name="Howwemade" /&gt; Production took place at the [[Shepperton Studios]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ghosts of Music Past: 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' songwriter Paul Williams undergoes a metamorphosis no less powerful than Scrooge's |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 13, 1992 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-13/entertainment/ca-3948_1_muppet-christmas-carol |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |first=Don |last=Heckman}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming, in order to allow for the Muppets and the human actors to be in the shot, floors had to be removed and re-inserted, with Michael Caine having to walk across narrow planks between the Muppets and their performers.&lt;ref name="dvdaudiocommentary" /&gt; Additionally, the buildings in the London street scenes were constructed by hand but diminished in size in order to achieve the appearance that the streets were relatively longer. When the musical sequence "It Feels Like Christmas" ends with the [[crane shot]], the short buildings became visibly seen in the background, in which Brian Henson explained on the DVD [[audio commentary]] that they were aware of the problem during shooting, but eventually decided that the closing shot was worth it as they believed not many people would notice the error.&lt;ref name="dvdaudiocommentary"&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=The Muppet Christmas Carol|others=Brian Henson |type=Audio commentary|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|location=Burbank, California|id=B000065V41|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
Disney appeared to have high expectations for the film, being their widest-released film of the holiday season and the second-widest release under the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] banner that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David J. |last=Fox |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-15/entertainment/ca-1985_1_weekend-box-office |title=Weekend Box Office : 'Home Alone' Passes $100 Million |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1992-12-15 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film opened in sixth place, initially reported to have collected $5.9 million in box office estimates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David J. |last=Fox |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-14/entertainment/ca-1593_1_weekend-moviegoing |title='Good Men' Salutes Its $16 Million |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 14, 1992 |accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later revised to have grossed $5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1992&amp;wknd=50&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 11-13, 2015 |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' grossed a total of $27.3 million in North America.&lt;ref name="boxoffice" /&gt; Despite being a modest box office success, ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' did not make much of an impact during its theatrical release, having to face competition from ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'' and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s own ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.

===Critical response===
The film received mostly favorable reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/muppet_christmas_carol/|title=The Muppet Christmas Carol|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]], reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', summarized the film as not a "great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there ''is'' a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE1DA1330F932A25751C1A964958260 |title=The Muppet Christmas Carol – Review/Film; Kermit, Etc. Do Dickens Up Green |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1992-12-11 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film three stars out of four, praised the technical achievements, but felt it "could have done with a few more songs than it has, and the merrymaking at the end might have been carried on a little longer, just to offset the gloom of most of Scrooge's tour through his lifetime spent spreading misery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-muppet-christmas-carol-1992 |title=The Muppet Christmas Carol Movie Review (1992) |publisher=rogerebert.com |date= December 11, 1992|accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the television program ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'', his partner ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' film critic [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film a Thumbs Down although he was favorable towards Michael Caine's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A Few Good Men / The Muppets Christmas Carol / Passion Fish (1992) |url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/MKBUAR3U7GW3/A-Few-Good-Men--The-Muppets-Christmas-Carol--Passion-Fish-1992 |publisher=Siskel &amp; Ebert |accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from ''The Chicago Tribune'', [[Dave Kehr]] reviewed the film as "a talky, plodding film that seems likely to bore children and adults in equal measure." Nevertheless, Kehr praised Val Strazovec's production design and John Fenner's cinematography believing its "shadowy, naturalistic lighting creates a new look for a puppet film", but derided Paul Williams's songs as unmemorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kehr |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Kehr |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-11/entertainment/9204220855_1_jerry-juhl-muppet-christmas-carol-miss-piggy |title=`Muppet Christmas Carol` Is Short On Holiday Spirit |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 11, 1992 |accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the production design and criticized Williams's songs, writing ''Muppets Christmas Carol'' is "not as enchanting or amusing as the previous entries in the Muppet series. But nothing can really diminish the late [[Jim Henson]]'s irresistibly appealing characters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Variety Staff |url=https://variety.com/1991/film/reviews/the-muppet-christmas-carol-1200429198/ |title=Review: 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 31, 1991 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving the film three stars out of five, Almar Haflidason of the [[BBC]] wrote the film is "liberal but fun adaptation of a classic" that "turns out to be quite touching as Muppet movies go. Less pleasing are the forgettable songs that offer both clumsy word construction and dire music that eats away at the aesthetic quality of the movie. But you'll be too busy looking out for the assorted Muppets to care much."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Almar |last=Haflidason |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/12/14/a_muppet_christmas_carol_1992_review.shtml |title=Films – review – The Muppet Christmas Carol |publisher=BBC |date=December 14, 2000 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Muppet Christmas Carol'' has a 73% approval rating, based on 40 reviews, with a rating average of 6.5 out of 10. The critical consensus states "It may not be the finest version of Charles Dickens' tale to grace the screen, but ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' is funny and heartwarming and serves as a good introduction to the story for young viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/muppet_christmas_carol/ |title=The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
This is the first ''Muppet'' film co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures—and the rights to the Muppets featured in the film would later be purchased by the [[The Walt Disney Company|studio's parent company]]. In addition to theatrical releases, the film has also been made available on home video formats. It was released on VHS in the US on November 5, 1993, in the UK on November 19 and twice on DVD in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]. The first DVD release on October 8, 2002, was in a full-screen-only format. [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] re-released the film on DVD on November 29, 2005, in conjunction with Kermit the Frog's 50th-anniversary celebration; this time the DVD contained both full-screen and widescreen presentations. The film was also released in Region 2.

[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] released a 20th-anniversary collector's edition on [[Blu-ray]], DVD, and [[digital copy]] on November 6, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/DisneyBuena_Vista/The_Muppet_Christmas_Carol_20th_Anniversary_Edition_Dated_for_Blu-ray/9849|title='The Muppet Christmas Carol: 20th Anniversary Edition' Dated for Blu-ray|publisher=High-Def Digest|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release doesn't include the film's extended cut. However, the song "When Love Is Gone" and its accompanying scene can be viewed in its entirety on the full-screen version of the anniversary edition of ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'', though it is cut in the widescreen format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Kenneth|title=The Muppet Christmas Carol Blu-ray Review|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Muppet-Christmas-Carol-Blu-ray/35027/#Review|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=6 November 2012|date=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The film's [[Film score|original score]] was composed by [[Miles Goodman]] with songs written by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]. Williams previously worked with the Muppets on the soundtrack to ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979) in which he and [[Kenneth Ascher]] were nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for writing "[[Rainbow Connection]]". Goodman previously scored several films that were directed by Muppet performer [[Frank Oz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plume|first=Kenneth|title=INTERVIEW WITH FRANK OZ|date=10 February 2000|publisher=IGN|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/10/interview-with-frank-oz-part-3-of-4|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Muppet Christmas Carol: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' contains all of the songs from the film, which were written by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], as well several cues from the score by [[Miles Goodman]]. The performances are by the Muppet characters as well as Caine, and the album also includes the songs "Room in Your Heart" and "Chairman of the Board" that were recorded but never filmed. As with all Muppet films (except ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (1999)), ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' was shot as a [[Musical film|musical]]. The soundtrack album peaked at number 189 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The soundtrack was digitally re-released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on November 6, 2012.

==="When Love Is Gone"===
"When Love Is Gone" was a song performed by the character Belle (portrayed by [[Meredith Braun]]) as she laments that Scrooge's love of money has replaced his love of her. The song itself was deleted from the original 1992 theatrical edition by [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], who believed that the following scene would not appeal to young children. Instead, the song appeared in (and was played during) the [[end credits]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grace|first=Willie|url=http://stylemagazine.com/news/2014/dec/12/why-muppet-christmas-carols-deleted-song-was-cut-r/|title=Why The Muppet Christmas Carol's song Was cut, But Really Should Have Stayed|work=Houston Style Magazine|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson objected to this decision. The concluding song, "The Love We Found", is a direct counterpoint to it.&lt;ref name="dvdaudiocommentary" /&gt;

Director [[Brian Henson]] commented: ""When Love Is Gone" was not in the theatrical release, and is presently missing from some copies of the movie, which is a real shame." The song titled "When Love Is Gone" is only included on some home media releases of ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' which are now out of print.

The song is included on all of the 1993 [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/brian-henson-interview/|title=Brian Henson On What Makes "A Muppet Christmas Carol" So Special And His Father's Legacy|work=UPROXX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LaserDisc version includes the only widescreen presentation of this song ever released.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/05208/1729-AS/Muppet-Christmas-Carol-The | LaserDisc Database - Muppet Christmas Carol, The [1729 AS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 and 2005 [[DVD]] releases do retain the song, but only in the [[Aspect ratio|full-screen]] version of the film. A 2012 standalone DVD release of the film uses the same disc from the 2005 release, so it also contains the song. However, a different DVD was used for the 2012 Blu-ray combo pack which does not contain the song.&lt;ref&gt;http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Christmas_Carol_(video) | The Muppet Christmas Carol (video) - Muppet Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[iTunes Store]] digital release includes the song and scene as an "extra". The [[VHS tape]], [[LaserDisc]] and select [[DVD]] releases are the only way to view ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' on [[home video]] along with the following scene intact.

'''''They Shaped Our Century''''' is a book which profiles the 100 people who had the greatest influence on [[South Africa]] during the twentieth century. The final list of 100 names was decided by an online survey run by South African media giant [[Media24]]. After voting closed, brief biographies were written for each person on the list; the book was published in 1999 by Human &amp; Rousseau, in English and Afrikaans. This survey preceded the [[SABC3's Great South Africans|SABC Great South Africans]] survey by three years, and evoked less public outcry.  

There were two father-son pairs and two husband-wife pairs in the final list, namely [[Ernest Oppenheimer|Ernest]] and [[Harry Frederick Oppenheimer|Harry Oppenheimer]], [[Govan Mbeki|Govan]] and [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Nelson Mandela|Nelson]] and [[Winnie Mandela]], and [[Walter Sisulu|Walter]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]]. One of the list candidates, [[André Brink]], is also an author of some of the biographies in the book.

== Procedure of the survey ==

An initial list of 120 names was compiled by historian Trwella Cameron and publisher JJ Human. The names of [[B. J. Vorster]] and [[Chris Hani]] were initially deliberately left out. Users of [[Media24]]'s web portal were asked to vote on the initial list and to submit suggestions for additions to the list. From the submissions, it was determined by the publisher that both B.J. Vorster and Chris Hani should be included in the list after all. People who were not South Africans, but who influenced South Africa, were also eligible for the list. During the survey and in the book, no labels such as "politician", "sportsperson", "activist" etc. were provided for the names.

Originally voting was scheduled to end in July 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1999/07/27/5/1.html |title=Kies invloedrykste Suid-Afrikaner |work=Beeld |date=27 July 1999 |language=Afrikaans |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the deadline was later extended to 31 August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1999/08/06/5/9.html |title=Mandela gewildste in SA Tsafendas skop stof in Allan Boesak se oë |work=Beeld |date=6 August 1999 |language=Afrikaans |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then into October.

The voting portal contained a discussion forum so people could argue the merits or demerits of candidates. Members of the public could vote in favour of a candidate but could also vote against a candidate. All candidates' names on the web site linked to short profiles about them.

One of the ways in which this list differs from [[SABC3]]'s [[Great South Africans (TV series)|Great South Africans]] list is that it contains very few sportsmen, and certainly none of the post-1994 heroes that featured prominently in the SABC list. The biographies printed in ''They Shaped Our Century'' are often cited as a source of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pressly |first=Donwald |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-07-18-a-statesman-to-all |title=A statesman to all |work=Mail &amp; Guardian |date=18 July 2003 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SABC survey was not limited to internet users and received coverage from many media outlets. In the SABC survey, one could vote for a candidate but not against a candidate.

== Criticism ==

Criticism against the survey included questions about why [[Gustav Preller]] did not make the list, or why statesmen [[J. B. M. Hertzog|Hertzog]] and [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn|Steyn]] were ranked below sportsman [[Gary Player]], sportsman [[Danie Craven]] and stage artist [[Pieter-Dirk Uys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steyn |first=Jaap |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2000/01/11/8/6.html |title=Vergissing grotesk Internet-kiesers oor rol van taal |work=Beeld |date=11 January 2000 |language=Afrikaans |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic acclaimed the biographic article about Mandela (by [[Vincent Maphati]]) but derided the articles about Verwoerd as less than satisfactory.  It was also said that the survey compared apples with oranges, and questions were raised about whether [[Chris Barnard]] could truly have been said to have had more influence than [[Harry Oppenheimer]], [[Jan Smuts]] and Gary Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Naudé |first=Charles |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1999/11/29/11/7.html |title=Hulle in SA het ons eeu gevorm Meningsverskil oor invloedrykheid kan verwag word |work=Beeld |date=29 November 1999 |language=Afrikaans |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey's own web site fielded questions about the omission of [[Barney Barnato]], Ysuf Veriava, Johan de Villiers, and [[Sammy Marks]].

== Top 20 ==

These are the top 20 names published in the book. The labels are arbitrary and are not an indication of the field in which they contributed most to South Africa.
