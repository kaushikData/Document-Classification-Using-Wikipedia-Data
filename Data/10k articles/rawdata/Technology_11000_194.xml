'''Artificial psychology''' is a theoretical discipline proposed by Dan Curtis (b. 1963). The theory considers the situation when an [[artificial intelligence]] approaches the level of complexity where the intelligence meets two conditions:

'''Condition I'''
* A: Makes all of its decisions autonomously
* B: Is capable of making decisions based on information that is
:# New
:# [[Abstract object|Abstract]]
:# Incomplete
* C: The artificial intelligence is capable of reprogramming itself based on the new data
* D: And is capable of resolving its own programming conflicts, even in the presence of incomplete data. This means that the intelligence autonomously makes value-based decisions, referring to values that the intelligence has created for itself.

'''Condition II'''
* All four criteria are met in situations that are not part of the original operating program

When both conditions are met, then, according to this theory, the possibility exists that the intelligence will reach irrational conclusions based on real or created information. At this point, the criteria is met for intervention which will not necessarily be resolved by simple re-coding of processes due to extraordinarily complex nature of the [[codebase]] itself; but rather a discussion with the intelligence in a format which more closely resembles classical (human) [[psychology]].

If the intelligence cannot be reprogrammed by directly inputting new code, but requires the intelligence to reprogram itself through a process of analysis and decision based on information provided by a human, in order for it to overcome behavior which is inconsistent with the machines purpose or ability to function normally, then artificial psychology is by definition, what is required.

The level of complexity that is required before these thresholds are met is currently a subject of extensive debate. The theory of artificial psychology does not address the specifics of what those levels may be, but only that the level is sufficiently complex that the intelligence cannot simply be recoded by a software developer, and therefore dysfunctionality must be addressed through the same processes that humans must go through to address their own dysfunctionalities. Along the same lines, artificial psychology does not address the question of whether or not the intelligence is conscious.

As of 2015, the level of artificial intelligence does not approach any threshold where any of the theories or principles of artificial psychology can even be tested, and therefore, artificial psychology remains a largely theoretical discipline.

The [[Philippine]] government has commenced a project to develop a locally-designed and manufactured [[Automated Guideway Transit System]] (AGTS) through its [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST). Two prototype lines has been set up by the DOST, one within the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] campus and another in Bicutan in [[Taguig]].

==Background==
The Philippine government through the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST) has made efforts to develop a locally designed [[Automated Guideway Transit System]] (AGTS) to curb heavy traffic and air pollution in [[Metro Manila]]. The DOST's AGTS was conceptualized to be similar to that of a [[monorail]] system but at one-fifth of its cost. AGTS lines are intended to be set up in Metro Manila to augment or serve as a "feeder" to the existing [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System]].&lt;ref name="pcieerd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alcasid|first=Edgilyn |title=Filipino-made Automated Guide-Way Transit System (AGT) eyes to curb air pollution and traffic |url=http://pcieerd.dost.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=127&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=455 |accessdate=21 October 2018 |publisher=Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development |date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype system was developed by the DOST with the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] as a means to demonstrate AGT technology as an efficient mode of transport for the country.&lt;ref name="pcieerd"/&gt;

The project is part of the DOST's broader High-Impact Technology Solutions (HITS) project. The leading implementing agency is the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC)&lt;ref name="testrun"&gt;{{cite news |title=DOST Chief, UP Prez test run the first ever Filipino-developed train |url=http://www.dost.gov.ph/knowledge-resources/news/35-2012-news/206-dost-chief-up-prez-test-run-the-first-ever-filipino-developed-train.html |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=Department of Science and Technology |date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other child agencies of the DOST involved are the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) which funded the project under the Makina at Teknolohiya para sa Bayan (MakiBayan) Program of the MIRDC&lt;ref name="testrun"/&gt;, and Project Management and Engineering Design Services Office (PMEDSO).&lt;ref name="pcieerd"/&gt;

The UP National Center for Transportation Studies, College of Engineering, and the National Institute of Geological Sciences are also involved in the project as consultants to the DOST.&lt;ref name="testrun"/&gt;

The project’s lead implementing agency in DOST— the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC)—constructed the train’s main mechanical frameworks or “rolling stocks”, and subcontracted local companies  and Fil-Asia Automotive to construct the guideway and the coaches, respectively, based on the design team’s specifications.

==History==
A {{convert|465|km|mi|sp=us}} prototype elevated line, which ran from CP Garcia Street to Jacinto Street near the College of Fine Arts was first established within the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] campus in [[Quezon City]]. The first test run for the AGTS was made at this line on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tupaz |first1=Voltaire |title=UP, DOST to design cheaper train after test run |url=https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/33-editors-pick-moveph/18032-up,-dost-to-design-cheaper-train-after-test-run |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=Rappler |date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Metals Industry Research and Development Center constructed the [[rolling stock]]s or main mechanical frameworks used for the DOST's AGTS. Construction of the coaches were also subcontracted to Fil-Asia Automotive.&lt;ref name="testrun"/&gt;

At least two [[rolling stock]] prototypes has been developed as part of the AGTS project of the DOST, the AGT 30 and the AGT 120. The former was used in the University of the Philippines line while the latter was used in the Bicutan line.&lt;ref name="pcieerd"/&gt;

The AGT 30, can carry 30 passenger per coach and has two passenger sections with safety features. It also has a communication and automated fare collection system. The prototype has two coaches with full airconditioning and has a suspension system, solid tires for guide wheels and extra wide automatic sliding doors. The full load top speed of each coach is {{convert|30|to|45|km/h|mi/h|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="pcieerd"/&gt; The AGT 120 has a larger capacity, with its capacity of 120 passenger per coach. The target maximum speed of each coach is {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="pcieerd"/&gt;

==Track design and compatibility==
DOST's AGTS was initially conceptualized as a monorail in 2011 but modifications made to the prototype has revised the project. The current design of the AGTS makes use of a railroad track with two rails instead of only one rail used in monorails.&lt;ref name="testrun"/&gt;Miescor Builders, a subcontractor of the MIRDC, was responsible for the guideway.&lt;ref name="testrun"/&gt;

'''Bertha Benz''' ({{Audio|Bertha Benz.ogg|pronunciation}}, born '''Bertha Ringer''', 3 May 1849 – 5 May 1944) was a [[Germany|German]] automotive pioneer. She was the business partner and wife of automobile inventor [[Karl Benz]]. On 5 August 1888, she was the first person to drive an automobile over a long distance.&lt;ref name="long trip"&gt;{{Citation |title= Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time |first= Patrick |last=Robertson |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |year=2011 |page= 91 |ISBN= 9781608197385 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&amp;pg=PT91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |access-date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, she brought the [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen]] worldwide attention and got the company its first sales.

==Biography==
=== Early life and marriage ===
[[File:Bertha Benz at the age of 18.jpg|thumb|right|Bertha Benz at age 18, circa 1867]]
Bertha Ringer was born in 1849 to a wealthy family in [[Pforzheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Two years before her marriage to Karl Benz, she used part of her dowry to invest in his failing iron construction company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bertha Benz Hits the Road, 125 Years Ago – History in the Headlines|url = http://www.history.com/news/bertha-benz-hits-the-road-125-years-ago|website = HISTORY.com|access-date = 13 October 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924041731/http://www.history.com/news/bertha-benz-hits-the-road-125-years-ago|archivedate = 24 September 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an unmarried woman, she was able to do so; after she married Benz, according to German law, Bertha lost her legal power to act as an investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicero.de/kapital/bertha-benz-die-erste-frau-am-steuer/41482|title=Bertha Benz: die erste Frau am Steuer|author=Angela Elis|publisher=Cicero|access-date= 1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July 1872, Bertha Ringer married Karl Benz. As he moved on to a new manufacturing venture, [[Karl Benz#Benz &amp; Cie. and the Benz Patent Motorwagen|Benz &amp; Cie]], he continued to use her dowry as financial support. He finished his work on his first horseless carriage in December 1885. Although Bertha financed the development process, and would hold patent rights under modern law, as a married woman she was not allowed to apply for the patent.&lt;ref&gt;"Frauen in der Geschichte des Rechts&amp;nbsp;— Von der Frühen Neuzeit bis zum Gegenwart", Ute Gerhard e.a., Beck'se Verlagsbuchhandlung, München 1997, {{ISBN|3-406-42866-5}}, Pag 464&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they had five children: Eugen (1873–1958), Richard (1874–1955), Clara (1877–1968), Thilde (1882–1974), and Ellen (1890–1973).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== The Patent Motor Car ===
[[Image:Motorwagen Serienversion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen]] Number 3 of 1886, used by Bertha Benz for the highly publicized first long distance [[road trip]], {{Convert|106|km|abbr=on}}, by automobile]]
In 1886, Benz presented the [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen|Patent-Motorwagen]] [[automobile]] to the world. Within the decade, 25 vehicles had been built. With cutting-edge [[bicycle]] constructions, the Model I was the original Patent Motor Car and the world's first automobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpma.de/service/klassifikationen/ipc/ipcprojekt/einekurzegeschichtedesautomobils/geburtstagdesautos/index.html |title=Der Streit um den "Geburtstag" des modernen Automobils |language=German |trans-title=The dispute over the "birthday" of the modern automobile |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-12-22 |website= |publisher=German Patent and Trade Mark Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102082130/https://www.dpma.de/service/klassifikationen/ipc/ipcprojekt/einekurzegeschichtedesautomobils/geburtstagdesautos/index.html |archive-date=2017-01-02 |access-date=2018-08-05 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/The-Benz-Patent-Motor-Car-from-1888--The-worlds-oldest-original-car.xhtml?oid=9361444 |title=The Benz Patent Motor Car from 1888 – The world’s oldest original car |website=Daimler |language=en-EN |access-date=2018-08-05 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model II was converted to a four-wheeler for test purposes, making it the only one of this model.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The first Patent Motor Car sold in small production runs was the Model III. It had powered rear wheels with a ringed steel and solid rubber, steerable front wheel. Various options from which to choose were provided for customers, such as seat arrangements and a folding top.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===First cross-country automobile journey===
[[Image:Benz-Wohnhaus-Ladenburg.jpg|thumb|Last home of Karl and Bertha Benz, now the location of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation in [[Ladenburg]], Baden-Württemberg]]
On 5 August 1888, 39-year-old Bertha Benz drove from [[Mannheim]] to [[Pforzheim]] with her sons Richard and Eugen, thirteen and fifteen years old respectively, in a Model III, without telling her husband and without permission of the authorities, thus becoming the first person to drive an automobile a significant distance,&lt;ref name="long trip" /&gt; though illegally. Before this historic trip, motorized drives were merely very short trials, returning to the point of origin, made with assistance of mechanics. Following wagon tracks, this pioneering tour covered a one-way distance of about {{convert|106|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsies.com/map.do?fileId=jaqjwnoubtjswpwi|title=Motorradtour Mannheim – Bertha Benz Memorial Route Hinfahrt – GPSies|author=stefanhock|work=GPSies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aug. 12, 1888: Road Trip!

Although the ostensible purpose of the trip was to visit her mother, Bertha Benz had other motives&amp;nbsp;— to prove to her husband, who had failed to adequately consider marketing his invention, that the automobile in which they both had heavily invested would become a financial success once it was shown to be useful to the general public; and to give her husband the confidence that his constructions had a future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mercedes-benz.at/content/austria/mpc/mpc_austria_website/de/home_mpc/passengercars/home/passengercars_world/legend_and_history/personage/bertha_benz.html|title=Bertha Benz – Die Starke|publisher=Mercedes-Benz|access-date=1 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228152310/http://www2.mercedes-benz.at/content/austria/mpc/mpc_austria_website/de/home_mpc/passengercars/home/passengercars_world/legend_and_history/personage/bertha_benz.html|archivedate=28 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She drove back to Mannheim several days later.

The novel trip received a great deal of publicity, as she had sought. The drive was a key event in the technical development of the automobile. The pioneering couple introduced several improvements after Bertha's experiences. She reported everything that had happened along the way and made important suggestions, such as the introduction of an additional [[gear]] for climbing hills and brake linings to improve brake-power. Her trip proved to the burgeoning [[automotive industry]] that [[test drive]]s were essential to their business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Later life===
In 1944, on her 95th birthday, Bertha Benz was honoured with the title ''Honourable Senator'', by the [[Technical University of Karlsruhe]]. This is her husband's alma mater and they had awarded an honorary doctorate degree to him in his lifetime. Two days later, Bertha Benz died in her villa in Ladenburg, where the workshop of Karl Benz had been built after they had moved there in 1906 and he established a solely family-held business, Benz and Sons. Karl Benz later wrote the following in his memoirs: "Only one person remained with me in the small ship of life when it seemed destined to sink. That was my wife. Bravely and resolutely she set the new sails of hope."

In 2008, the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bertha-benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home Bertha Benz Memorial Route] (German-government-approved non-profit official site)&lt;/ref&gt; was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's path during the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. Now it is possible to follow the 194&amp;nbsp;km of signs indicating her route from [[Mannheim]] via [[Heidelberg]] to [[Pforzheim]] ([[Black Forest]]) and back.

The ''Bertha Benz Challenge'', embedded in the framework of the ceremony of ''Automobile Summer 2011'', the big official German event and birthday party commemorating the invention of the automobile by Karl Benz over {{time ago|1888|8|5}}, took place on Bertha Benz Memorial Route on 10 and 11 September 2011. It was a globally visible signal for new automobile breakthroughs, and was only open for sustainable mobility&amp;nbsp;— future-oriented vehicles with alternative drive systems, ''i.e.'', hybrid and electric, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles, and other extremely economical vehicles. The motto is ''Bertha Benz Challenge – Sustainable Mobility on the World's Oldest Automobile Road!''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[http://mediacenter.dw-world.de/english/video/#!/61615/Made_in_Germany/Program=3066/ The history of the Automobile includes the Bertha Benz Challenge, watch minutes 01:40 to 05:42 of the complete report (26:22 minutes).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202062847/http://mediacenter.dw-world.de/english/video/#!/61615/Made_in_Germany/Program=3066/ |date=2 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aktuell – Bertha-Benz-Challenge Offen nur für Elektroautos und zukunftsgerechte Fahrzeuge.|url = http://www.bertha-benz-challenge.de/|website = www.bertha-benz-challenge.de|access-date = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2011 [[Deutsche Welle]] (DW-TV) broadcast worldwide in its series, ''Made in Germany'', a TV documentary on the invention of the automobile by Karl Benz, highlighting the very important role of his wife, Bertha Benz.  The report is not only on the history of the automobile, but takes a look at its future as well, shown by the Bertha Benz Challenge on 10 and 11 September 2011.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The documentary ''The Car is Born'', produced by [[Ulli Kampelmann]], centered on the first road trip by Bertha Benz.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id=BKF1GFJtuHQ | title=Carl &amp; Bertha Benz – The Car is Born – Trailer}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a television movie about the life of Karl and Bertha Benz was made, titled ''Karl &amp; Bertha'', which premiered on 11 May&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swr.de/carlundbertha Genialer Tüftler und bedingungslose Unterstützerin], [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was aired by [[Das Erste]] on 23 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753569/|title=Carl &amp; Bertha (TV Movie 2011)|date=25 May 2011|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://programm.daserste.de/pages/programm/detail.aspx?id=30C8FA62CEBE516F83D1AE6F7AE2B2C0 ARD-Themenwoche "Der mobile Mensch" Karl &amp; Bertha] (English: ''"The mobile man" Karl &amp; Bertha''), [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer of the movie&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{YouTube | id=gS9_XyEwyI4 | title=Carl &amp; Bertha – Eine Liebe für das Automobil – SWR – DAS ERSTE}} (English: ''Carl &amp; Bertha – a love of the automobile'')&lt;/ref&gt; and a "making of" special were released on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id=yHIFE4vOeEo | title=Making of 'Carl &amp; Bertha' (Film)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a short video depicting Bertha's first trip was published by Mercedes-Benz USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mercedes-Benz USA|title=Bertha Benz: The First Driver|date=2018-08-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBL_G-C51Dk&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">A '''black hole starship''' is a theoretical idea for enabling [[interstellar travel]] by [[spacecraft propulsion|propelling]] a [[starship]] by using a [[black hole]] as the energy source. The concept was first discussed in science fiction, notably in the book ''[[Imperial Earth]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and in the work of [[Charles Sheffield]], in which energy extracted from a [[Rotating black hole|Kerr-Newman black hole]] is described as powering the rocket engines in the story "Killing Vector" (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield, Charles, "Killing Vector," [[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy Magazine]], March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more detailed analysis, a proposal to create an [[artificial black hole]] and using a [[parabolic reflector]] to reflect its [[Hawking radiation]] was discussed in 2009 by Louis Crane and Shawn Westmoreland.&lt;ref name="cranewestmoreland2009"&gt;Louis Crane and Shawn Westmoreland, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1803 Are Black Hole Starships Possible]" (ArXiv preprint 12 Aug 2009). Retrieved 7 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Their conclusion was that it was on the edge of possibility, but that [[quantum gravity]] effects that are presently unknown will either make it easier, or make it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.000-dark-power-grand-designs-for-interstellar-travel.html |title=Dark power: Grand designs for interstellar travel |journal=New Scientist |date=25 November 2009 |issue=2736 |last=Chown |first=Marcus}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts were also sketched out by Bolonkin.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bolonkin, Alexander, ''Life. Science. Future,'' lulu.com, 2011, pp. 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. For example, in [[nuclear fusion]] or [[Nuclear fission|fission]], only a small proportion of the mass is converted into energy, so enormous quantities of material would be needed. Thus, a nuclear starship would greatly deplete Earth of fissile and fusile material. One possibility is [[antimatter]], but the manufacturing of antimatter is hugely energy-inefficient, and antimatter is difficult to contain. The Crane and Westmoreland paper states:

{{Pull quote|1=On the other hand, the process of generating a &lt;abbr title="black hole"&gt;BH&lt;/abbr&gt; from collapse is naturally efficient, so it would require millions of times less energy than a comparable amount of antimatter or at least tens of thousands of times given some optimistic future antimatter generator. As to confinement, a BH confines itself. We would need to avoid colliding with it or losing it, but it won't explode. Matter striking a BH would fall into it and add to its mass. So making a BH is extremely difficult, but it would not be as dangerous or hard to handle as a massive quantity of antimatter. Although the process of generating a BH is extremely massive, it does not require any new Physics. Also, if a BH, once created, absorbs new matter, it will radiate it, thus acting as a new energy source; while antimatter can only act as a storage mechanism for energy which has been collected elsewhere and converted at extremely low efficiency. (None of the other ideas suggested for interstellar flight seems viable either. The proposal for an interstellar ramjet turns out to produce more drag than thrust, while the idea of propelling a ship with a laser beam runs into the problem that the beam spreads too fast.)}}

==Criteria==
According to the authors, a black hole to be used in space travel needs to meet five criteria:&lt;ref name="io9_2009" /&gt;

# has a long enough lifespan to be useful,
# is powerful enough to accelerate itself up to a reasonable fraction of the speed of light in a reasonable amount of time,
# is small enough that we can access the energy to make it,
# is large enough that we can focus the energy to make it,
# has mass comparable to a starship.

Black holes seem to have a sweet spot in terms of size, power and lifespan which is almost ideal. A black hole weighing 606,000 metric tons (6.06 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; kg) would have a [[Schwarzschild radius]] of 0.9 [[Metre#SI prefixed forms of metre|attometers]] (0.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;18&lt;/sup&gt; m, or 9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;19&lt;/sup&gt; m), a power output of 160 [[Watt#Petawatt|petawatts]] (160 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; W, or 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; W), and a 3.5-year lifespan. With such a power output, the black hole could accelerate to 10% the speed of light in 20 days, assuming 100% conversion of energy into kinetic energy. Assuming only 10% conversion into kinetic energy would only take 10 times longer to accelerate to 0.1''c'' (10% of the [[speed of light]]).&lt;ref name="cranewestmoreland2009" /&gt;

Getting the black hole to act as a power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.&lt;ref name="io9_2009"&gt;Tim Barribeau, [http://io9.com/5391989/a-black-hole-engine-that-could-power-spaceships "A Black Hole Engine That Could Power Spaceships"], io9, Nov. 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="io9_2014"&gt;Jeff Lee [http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-to-power-a-starship-with-an-artificial-black-hole-1502929100 "How to power a starship with an artificial black hole"], io9, Jan. 6, 2014 (retrieved 7 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; This would, however, generate an enormous amount of heat as radiation is absorbed by the dish.

== Criticism ==
It is not clear that a starship powered by Hawking radiation can be made feasible within the laws of known physics. In the standard black hole thermodynamic model, the average energy of emitted quanta increases as size decreases, and extremely small black holes emit the majority of their energy in particles other than photons.&lt;ref&gt;

Lee of [[Icarus Interstellar]] states a typical quantum of radiation from a one-attometer black hole would be too energetic to be reflected. Lee further argues absorption (for example, by [[pair production]] from emitted gamma rays) may also be infeasible: A titanium "Dyson cap", optimized at 1&amp;nbsp;cm thickness and a radius around 33&amp;nbsp;km (to avoid melting), would absorb almost half the incident energy, but the maximum spaceship velocity over the black hole lifetime would be less than 0.0001''c'' (about 30 km/s), according to Lee's calculations.&lt;ref name="acceleration" /&gt;

Govind Menon of [[Troy University]] suggests exploring the use of a rotating (Kerr-Newmann) black hole instead: "With non-rotating black holes, this is a very difficult thing...we typically look for energy almost exclusively from rotating black holes. Schwarzschild black holes do not radiate in an astrophysical, gamma ray burst point of view. It is not clear if Hawking radiation alone can power starships."&lt;ref name="io9_2009" /&gt;

}}

'''Broadcast Wave Format''' ('''BWF''') is an extension of the popular Microsoft [[WAV]] audio format and is the recording format of most file-based [[Non-linear editing|non-linear]] [[Digital recording|digital recorders]] used for [[Film production|motion picture]], radio and [[television production]]. It was first specified by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] in 1997, and updated in 2001 and 2003.

The purpose of this file format is the addition of [[metadata]] to facilitate the seamless exchange of sound data between different computer platforms and applications.  It specifies the format of metadata, allowing audio processing elements to identify themselves, document their activities, and supports [[timecode]] to enable synchronization with other recordings.  This metadata is stored as extension chunks in a standard digital audio WAV file.

Files conforming to the Broadcast Wave specification have names ending with the [[file extension]] .WAV.

== Details ==
In addition to the common WAVE chunks, the following extension chunks can appear in a Broadcast Wave file:&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3285.pdf EBU BWF User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Original Bext chunk (Broadcast Extension - 'bext')
* [[iXML]] chunk ('iXML')
* Quality chunk ('qlty')
* MPEG audio extension chunk ('mext')
* Peak Envelope chunk ('levl')
* link chunk ('link')
* axml chunk ('axml')

Since the only difference between a BWF and a "normal" WAV is the extended information in the file header (Bext-Chunk, Coding-History, etc...), a BWF does not require a special player for playback.

Unfortunately, this compatibility also preserves the [[WAV#Limitations|filesize limitation]] that WAV files have (4 GB of audio data per data chunk).
In order to be able to store audio which would exceed this limit, 2 different chunks exist allowing the audio material to be spread across several files: ''cont'' &amp; ''link'' (see list above)

Since there is no official naming convention for these subsequent files, and it is still desirable to see at a glance which ones belong to a continuous piece of audio, a lot of programs apply a numbering scheme to the file suffix: ''.wav, .w01, .w02, ..., .wNN''.

Each of those segments is a regular Wave/BWF file, but players that are aware of the continue/link chunk will treat all segments as one single, long piece of audio when opening the first segment ".wav".

As an extension, [[RF64]] is a BWF-compatible multichannel file format enabling file sizes to exceed 4 GB that has been specified in 2006.

The axml chunk allows users to incorporate data compliant with the XML format with the audio; the chunk may contain data fragments from one or more schema.

On August 2012, the European Broadcasting Union published a specification for embedding [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC) in the axml chunk of the Broadcast Wave Format.

BWF is specified for use in [[MXF]] by [[SMPTE]] standard 382.

BWF is specified for use in [[AES31]].

The '''Centro Nacional de Tecnologia Electrônica Avançada S.A''' (CEITEC - National Center for Advanced Electronic Technology) is a Brazilian [[technology]] center specialized in [[project]] development and fabrication in [[microelectronics]], i.e. [[integrated circuit]]s, or "chips". This center is one of the agents for the Brazilian Microelectronics Program (PNM - ''Programa Nacional de Microelectrônica'').

The main objective of CEITEC is to provide an incentive to the production of [[semiconductor]] components and microelectronics [[education]]. This project is part of the technology and industrial development policy of the federal Brazilian government. The initiative is a result of a partnership between governmental entities, [[university|universities]], [[research]] centers and companies and will be operating in [[Porto Alegre]], state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in a 13,650 m² facility divided into:

== Research and  Products==

*'''Chip do Boi'''

Chip do Boi is CEITEC S.A.’s first commercial product and is the first chip designed in Brazil by Brazilian engineers in a company that was home grown and home funded to reach volume production at a world-class semiconductor manufacturing facility. This IC device is used for cattle tracking – essentially an electronic cow ID. Embedded in an ear ring, the chip can be read within a distance of 50&amp;nbsp;cm. The chip was designed in entirely in Brazil and is competitively priced. This device is being manufactured at [[X-Fab]] Silicon Foundries in Germany.This company has been chosen by CEITEC to produce the Chip do Boi design at its facilities because X-Fab CMOS 0.6 micron technology is the same that will soon be available in CEITEC’s own factory that will be the first of its kind in Latin America to manufacture RF analog/digital products. It can produce up to 100 million chips per year using 6-inch wafers.

CEITEC’s Chip do Boi is an advanced LF-RFID device designed for use in Brazil’s cattle industry as part of a leading-edge system to track livestock. Forecasted domestic demand for the chip is as high as 1.5 million units for 2012 with an expected minimum growth rate of 10 percent a year over the next decade.

*'''Transportation Chip'''

The chip contains all vehicle data, including chassis and national registration numbers, taxes and fines not paid, etc.

*'''Blood Bag Chip'''

The chip is embedded in an electronic tag. It ensures the traceability and safety of blood products.

== Design House ==

The Design House worked on projects funded by FINEP.

== Objectives ==

=== General ===
*To offer [[infrastructure]] in form of labs, equipment and human resources to companies, research and development (R&amp;D) centers and universities in order to promote the microelectronic technology in Brazil.
*Stimulate the local development in microelectronic projects and education, which implies new qualified jobs and income distribution.

=== Specific ===
*Support human resources qualification in integrated circuit production processes;
*Provide integrated circuit production services to industries and for scientific and technological research purposes;
*Stimulate the construction of a national network of technological services, enabling the qualification of electronics products and processes;
*Transfer technology on microelectronics to companies in the electronics sector for the competitive qualification of products, processes, and services.

'''CMD640''', the California Micro Devices Technology Inc product 0640, is an [[AT Attachment|IDE]] interface chip for the [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] and [[VESA Local Bus|VLB]] buses. CMD640 had some sort of hardware acceleration: [[WDMA (computer)|WDMA]] and Read-Ahead (prefetch) support.

CMD Technology Inc was acquired by [[Silicon Image Inc.]] in 2001.

== Hardware bug ==

The original CMD640 has a [[data corruption]] bug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/ide/cmd640.c - linux/drivers/ide/pci/cmd640.c Version 1.02  Sep 01, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--These chips are basically fucked by design, and getting this driver to work on every motherboard design that uses this screwed chip seems bloody well impossible. However, we're still trying.--&gt; The data corruption bug is similar to the bug affecting the contemporaneous PC Tech [[RZ1000]] chipset. Both chipsets were used on a number of motherboards, including those from [[List of Intel chipsets#Pentium chipsets|Intel]].

Мodern operating systems have a workaround for this bug by prohibiting aggressive acceleration mode and losing about 10% of the performance.

'''CMD Group''', formerly Reed Construction Data and Construction Market Data, is a provider of [[business information]] for the [[North America]]n construction industry. CMD is owned by [[Warburg Pincus]] (51%) and [[Reed Business Information]] (49%). Its historical roots lie in Construction Market Data, founded in 1982 to publish construction leads and market data. In 2000, London-based [[Reed Elsevier]] purchased this original CMD Group, transitioning the company to Reed Construction Data.

In October 2014 [[private equity firm]] Warburg Pincus in New York purchased a majority stake in the company, and Reed Construction Data changed its name to CMD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt; The Norcross, Ga.-based provider of North American construction data said the new name is a nod to the company’s original name: Construction Market Data. The new brand includes an updated logo and website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2014/10/01/reed-construction-data-rebrands-itself-as-cmd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The company tracks data on hundreds of thousands of projects per year, providing coverage of construction projects in both the United States and Canada. The company provides monthly analysis and data for all aspects of the construction industry. CMD also provides a detailed view of construction activity, including historical data, current-year projections and a five-year forecast. Their research helps customers forecast to find those market segments experiencing the greatest growth and plan tactical marketing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In October 2009, Reed Construction Data (which is now Construction Market Data a division of ConstructCONNECT) filed suit in [[United States district court|federal court]] against [[McGraw-Hill Construction]], charging that the company's Dodge Report had unlawfully accessed confidential and trade secret information from Reed since 2002 by using a series of fake companies to pose as Reed customers.

'''Cold roll laminators''' use a [[plastic]] film which is coated with an [[adhesive]] and [[Gloss (material appearance)|glossy]] backing which does not adhere to the glue. When the glossy backing is removed, the adhesive is exposed, which then sticks directly onto the item which needs to be laminated. This method, apart from having the obvious benefit of not requiring expensive equipment, is also suitable for those items which would be damaged by [[heat]].   Cold laminators range from simple two roller, hand crank machines up to large and complex motor driven machines with high precision rollers, adjustable roller pressure and other advanced features.

Cold lamination increased in popularity with the rise of wide format [[inkjet]] printers, which often used inks and papers incompatible with hot lamination.  A large percentage of cold laminate for use in the print industry is PVC, although a wide range of other materials are available.  Cold laminating processes are also used outside of the print industry, for example coating sheet glass or [[stainless steel]] with protective films.

Cold roll laminators are also used for laying down adhesive films in the sign making industry, for example mounting a large print onto a board.  A practiced operator can apply a large adhesive sheet in a fraction of the time it takes to do so by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3103">'''Emmett Norman Leith''' (March 12, 1927 in [[Detroit, Michigan]] – December 23, 2005 in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]) was a [[professor]] of [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Michigan]] and, with [[Juris Upatnieks]] of the University of Michigan, the co-inventor of three-dimensional [[holography]].

Leith received his B.S. in [[physics]] from [[Wayne State University]] in 1949 and his M.S. in physics in 1952.  He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Wayne State in 1978. Much of Leith's holographic work was an outgrowth of his research on [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) performed while a member of the Radar Laboratory of the University of Michigan's [[Environmental Research Institute of Michigan|Willow Run Laboratory]] beginning in 1952.  Leith joined the University of Michigan as a research assistant and was promoted to graduate research assistant in 1955, research associate in 1956, research engineer in 1960, associate professor in 1965, and full professor in 1968.&lt;ref name="Johnston2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Johnston|title=Holographic visions: a history of new science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hQRP6kj6vIC|accessdate=20 February 2012|date=1 June 2006|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-857122-3|page=83n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Leith and his coworker Juris Upatnieks at the [[University of Michigan]] displayed the world's first three-dimensional hologram at a conference of the [[Optical Society of America]] in 1964.

==Honors and awards==

He received the 1960 [[IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award]] and the [[Stuart Ballantine Medal]] in 1969. In 1975 he was awarded the [[William F. Meggers Award]] by the [[Optical Society]]. In 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] awarded Leith with the [[National Medal of Science]] for his research.  He was awarded the 1985 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200857/http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/awards/osaawards/awardsdesc/ivesquinn/ Frederic Ives Medal] by the [[Optical Society of America|OSA]].

'''Episerver''' is a global software company offering [[Web content management system|web content management (WCM)]] (or [[Content Management System|CMS]]), [[E-commerce|digital commerce]], and [[digital marketing]], through the Episerver Digital Experience Cloud software platform. Episerver also offers [[personalization]] through Peerius, a company acquired in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamturk|first1=Venus|title=Episerver Buys Peerius to Boost Autonomous Personalization|url=http://www.cms-connected.com/News-Articles/August-2016/Episerver-Buys-Peerius-to-Boost-Autonomous-Persona|website=CMS Connected|publisher=CMS-Connected|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Episerver was founded in 1994 in Stockholm, Sweden, by Mikael Runhem. Then known as Elektropost Stockholm AB, the company focused on internet-based electronic mail. Elektropost Stockholm AB expanded to provide technology for building websites and introduced the first version of the EPiServer CMS platform in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guseva|first1=Irina|title=Web CMS Vendor EPiServer Acquired by a Surprising Buyer|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/web-cms-vendor-episerver-acquired-by-a-surprising-buyer-009167.php|website=CMSWire|publisher=Simpler Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=Nov 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2002, the first version of EPiServer CMS that was based on [[Microsoft]]’s [[.NET Framework]], EPiServer CMS 4.0, was launched. In 2006, Mikael Runhem changed the company’s name to EPiServer AB. In 2007, the second .NET-based version of EPiServer CMS was launched, version 5.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 2010, the company was owned by a group of investors, including Amadeus Capital, Martin Bjäringer, Monterro Holdings, Northzone Ventures, Mikael Runhem and family and employees. In November 2010, this group sold the company to [[IK Investment Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IK Investment Partners acquires Episerver|url=http://www.episerver.com/about-us/pressroom/press-release-archive-2010/ik-investment-partners-acquires-episerver/|website=Episerver|accessdate=Nov 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=March 2018}}

In December 2014, IK Investment Partners sold Episerver to [[Accel-KKR]], a technology-focused private equity investment firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Backaitis|first1=Virginia|title=Not a Rumor: Accel-KKR Invests in Episerver|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/digital-marketing/not-a-rumor-accelkkr-invests-in-episerver-027418.php|website=CMSWIre|publisher=Simpler Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=Dec 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stern-Peltz|first1=Mikkel|title=IK sells EPiServer to Accel-KKR|url=http://www.unquote.com/nordics/official-record/73218/ik-sells-episerver-to-accel-kkr|website=Unquote|publisher=Mergermarket Limited|accessdate=Dec 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accel-KKR had also recently purchased Ektron, a Nashua, New Hampshire-based CMS company. In January 2015, Episerver and Ektron merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Episerver and Ektron merge|url=http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/News/News/EPiServer-and-Ektron-merge-101724.aspx|website=KMWorld|publisher=Information Today Inc.|accessdate=Jan 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seebacher|first1=Noreen|title=Told You So: Ektron is Merging with Episerver|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/told-you-so-ektron-is-merging-with-episerver-027861.php|website=CMSWire|publisher=Simpler Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=Jan 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two former executives from KANA Software, CEO Mark Duffell and CMO James Norwood, were appointed President and CEO and Executive Vice President Strategy and CMO of Episerver, respectively. Martin Henricson, CEO of the former Episerver business assumed the role of Executive Chairman for the merged entity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The company combined its software into the Episerver Digital Experience Cloud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Episerver and Ektron merge and target the mid-market for digital experience|url=https://www.ovum.com/episerver-and-ektron-merge-and-target-the-mid-market-for-digital-experience/|website=Ovum|publisher=Informa PLC|accessdate=Feb 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2015, Episerver launched the first major release of its platform following the Ektron merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicastro|first1=Dom|title=Episerver Taps Ektron Roots in New Release|url=http://www.cmswire.com/web-cms/episerver-taps-ektron-roots-in-new-release/|website=CMSWire|publisher=Simpler Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=Jun 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, the company rebranded itself, changing EPiServer to Episerver, and including the shortened name “Epi”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Backaitis|first1=Virginia|title=Episerver Tries to Rebuild its Brand|url=http://www.cmswire.com/web-cms/episerver-tries-to-rebuild-its-brand/|website=CMSWire|publisher=Simpler Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=Nov 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Episerver acquired Peerius, a London UK-based commerce personalization company. The brand now is fully integrated as EpiPersonalization into the Episerver Platform. Former Peerius CEO Roger Brown left the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1254">A '''fiber optic display''' is a light-emitting display that uses [[fiber optic]]s to display images, text, and notification lights. Fiber-optic displays can either be static or dynamic, with the typical lighting source being [[halogen light bulb]]s.

==Static fiber optic displays==
Static fiber optic displays have been commonly used for some types of [[traffic signal]]s.  One common use for static fiber optic displays are [[lane control lights]], which display either a green downward-pointing arrow or a red X to indicate the open/closed status of road lanes.

==Dynamic fiber optic displays==
Dynamic fiber optic displays typically display alphanumeric text, and utilize electromechanical shutters to open or close the ends of the fiber strands to display an alphanumeric pixel.  These type of displays were commonly used as [[variable-message sign]]s on highways.  Compared to [[eggcrate display]]s, dynamic fiber optic displays offered lower energy consumption due to requiring fewer bulbs, and offered improved nighttime legibility.  For daytime legibility, they were sometimes combined with [[flip-disc display]]s to be reflective in daylight and emissive at night.

Media having this common property may be termed ''dispersive media''. Sometimes the term '''''chromatic'' dispersion''' is used for specificity.
Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe [[light]] and other [[electromagnetic wave]]s, dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as [[acoustic dispersion]] in the case of sound and seismic waves, in [[gravity wave]]s (ocean waves), and for telecommunication signals along [[transmission line]]s (such as [[coaxial cable]]) or [[optical fiber]].}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7138">The '''Grand Alliance''' (GA) was a [[consortium]] created in 1993 at the behest of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to develop the American [[digital television]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]], [[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]]) and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] specification, with the aim of pooling the best work from different companies.  It consisted of [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], [[General Instrument|General Instrument Corporation]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Philips|Philips Consumer Electronics]], [[David Sarnoff Research Center]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]], and [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith Electronics Corporation]].  The Grand Alliance [[Digital television|DTV]] system is the basis for the [[ATSC standard]].

Recognizing that earlier proposed systems demonstrated particular strengths in the FCC's [[Richard E. Wiley|Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service]] (ACATS) testing and evaluation process, the Grand Alliance system was proposed to combine the
advantages of all of the previously proposed terrestrial digital HDTV systems.  At the time of its inception, the Grand Alliance HDTV system was specified to include:
* Flexible picture formats with a [[header (computing)|header]]/[[Visual descriptors|Descriptor]] approach, allowing the inclusion of both 1050 and 787.5 [[raster format]]s.
* [[Progressive scan]]ning and square [[pixel]] capabilities in both raster formats.
* [[Interlaced scanning]] and rectangular pixel formats.
* [[Video compression]] based on [[MPEG-2]], with additional syntax elements that represent contributions from each previously proposed system.
* A packetized, prioritized data format, providing flexibility of services and extensibility.

Audio and transmission systems had not been decided at the time of the GA agreement. Five channel audio was specified, but a decision among the [[Dolby Digital|Dolby AC-3]], multi-channel [[MUSICAM]] audio, and MIT "AC" systems had not yet been made. Candidate transmission approaches included [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]], Spectrally-Shaped QAM, 6 [[Vestigial sideband|VSB]] (with [[Trellis modulation|trellis code]]) and 4/2 VSB. [[COFDM]] had been proposed by third parties, but was rejected as not being mature, and not offering [[TV and FM DX|fringe-area]] coverage equivalent to analog transmission. A thorough analysis of service area, interference characteristics, transmission robustness and system attributes would be performed to determine the "best approach."

In the end, 1080, 720 and 480-line resolutions were implemented at various aspect ratios and frame rates, with progressive and interlaced scanning (the so-called "18 formats"), together with [[8VSB|8-VSB]] modulation and Dolby AC-3 audio.  However, the selection of transmission and audio systems was not without controversy.  The choice of 8-VSB was later criticised by several groups as being inferior to COFDM under conditions of [[multipath interference]]. Improvements in receiver designs would later render this apparently moot. With MUSICAM originally faltering during GA testing, the GA issued a statement finding the MPEG-2 audio system to be "essentially equivalent" to Dolby, but only after the Dolby selection had been made.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a story emerged that MIT had entered into an agreement with Dolby whereupon the university would be awarded a large sum if the [[MUSICAM]] system was rejected.&lt;ref name="dtvdeal"&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V122/N54/54hdtv.54n.html MIT Getting Millions For Digital TV Deal]&lt;/ref&gt; Following a five-year lawsuit for breach of contract, MIT and its GA representative received a total of $30 million from Dolby, after the litigants reached a last-minute out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref name="dtvdeal" /&gt; Dolby also offered an incentive for Zenith to switch their vote (which they did), however it is unknown whether they accepted the offer.&lt;ref name="dtvdeal" /&gt;

{{transport}}
'''Human-powered transport''' is the [[transport]] of person(s) and/or goods using [[human]] [[muscle]] power. Like [[animal-powered transport]], human-powered transport has existed since [[time immemorial]] in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human-power.

Although [[Automobile|motorization]] has increased speed and load capacity, many forms of human-powered transport remain popular for reasons of lower cost, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]] and [[environmentalism]]. Human-powered transport is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

==Available muscle power==
[[File:Cyclist itt cyfac(2).jpg|thumb|right|Road cyclist]]

In the 1989 [[Race Across America]], one team ([[Team Strawberry]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventurecorps.com/when/raam/1989raam.html "The 1989 HPV Race Across America, A Test Of Machine and Man"]&lt;/ref&gt; used an experimental device comprising a rear wheel hub, a sensor, and a handlebar mounted processor, to measure each cyclist's power output.

In lab experiments an average "in-shape" cyclist can produce about 3 watts/kg for more than an hour (e.g., around 200 watts for a {{convert|70|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} rider), with top amateurs producing 5 watts/kg and elite athletes achieving 6 watts/kg for similar lengths of time. Elite track sprint cyclists are able to attain an instantaneous maximum output of around 2,000 watts, or in excess of 25 watts/kg; elite road cyclists may produce 1,600 to 1,700 watts as an instantaneous maximum in their burst to the finish line at the end of a five-hour-long road race.

[[Image:Red DX Surrey.jpg|thumb|right|Surrey style rental [[quadracycle]] built by the [[International Surrey Company]]]]

[[Skateboards]] have the advantage of being so small and light that users can easily carry them when not skating.

The most efficient human-powered land vehicle is the [[bicycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cycling/humanpower1.html Science of Cycling: Human Power: page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the much more common [[upright bicycle]], the  [[recumbent bicycle]] may be faster on level ground or down hills due to better [[aerodynamics]] while having similar [[power transfer]] efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Velomobile]]s are increasingly popular in colder and/or wetter countries{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} due to the protection they offer against the environment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Freight bicycle]]s are used to transport [[cargo]]. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s can be used as [[taxicab]]s.

In 2016, AeroVelo cyclist Todd Reichert achieved the human-powered speed record of {{convert|142.04|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} with a [[velomobile]] at [[Battle Mountain, Nevada|Battle Mountain]], Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://recumbents.com/wisil/whpsc2016/results.htm|title = 2016 WHPSC 200 Meter Racing Results|accessdate = 2016-09-16|publisher = Wisil.recumbents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch cyclist [[Fred Rompelberg]] set a {{convert|268.8|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} speed record at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]] on October 3, 1995 while cycling in the wake of a motor dragster pace-car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredrompelberg.com/en/html/algemeen/fredrompelberg/record.asp |title=The formidable record of Fred Rompelberg and its development |publisher=Fredrompelberg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wake of the pace-car reduced the aerodynamic drag against which Rompelberg pedalled to almost zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canosoarus.com/08LSRbicycle/LSR%20Bike01.htm |title=152 MPH Pedal Bicycle - Intro |publisher=Canosoarus.com |date=1985-07-20 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Kolodziejzyk set two world records recognized by both the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] and Guinness (TM) World Records on July 17, 2006 on a race track in [[Eureka, California]]. The first record is for the most distance traveled in 24 hours by human power {{convert|1041|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and the second for the worlds fastest {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} time trial (23 hours, 2 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/ Greg Kolodziejzyk website]&lt;/ref&gt;
Both records were broken on August 6, 2010 by Christian von Ascheberg who drove {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in 19 hours, 27 minutes and managed to go {{convert|1219|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in 24 hours with his Milan SL [[Velomobile]]. In the same race he also raised the 12-hour record to {{convert|664.97|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, which is an average of {{convert|55.41|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1969, artists in a small [[Northern California]] town began the [[Kinetic sculpture race]] which has grown to a {{convert|42|mi|km|abbr=on}}, three-day all terrain, human-powered sculpture race and county wide event. It is held every year on the last weekend in May.

====Aircraft====
{{main|Human-powered aircraft}}

=====Fixed wing=====
[[Image:Daedalus Project's Light Eagle.jpg|thumb|right|[[MIT Daedalus]] human powered aircraft]]

The ''[[Enea Bossi, Sr.#Pedaliante|Pedaliante]]'' flew short distances fully under human power in 1936, but the distances were not significant enough to win the prize of the Italian competition for which it was built. The flights were deemed to be a result of the pilot's significant strength and endurance, and not attainable by a typical human. Additional attempts were made in 1937 and 1938 using a catapult system, launching the plane to a height of {{convert|9|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. With the catapult launch, the plane successfully traveled the {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance outlined by the competition, but was declined the prize due to the takeoff method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/32-v10n1-1992.pdf Pedaliante]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JA/1970/PVJAPRE44154.pdf Man-Powered Flight - Achievements to Date With a New Suggestion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883606,00.html?iid=chix-sphere | work=Time | title=Transport: Icarus to Bossi | date=8 February 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first officially authenticated regularly feasible take-off and landing of a human-powered aircraft (one capable of powered takeoffs, unlike a [[glider aircraft|glider]]) was made on 9 November 1961 by [[Derek Piggott]] in [[Southampton University]]'s Man Powered Aircraft ([[SUMPAC]]).

Perhaps the best-known human-powered plane is the [[Gossamer Albatross]], which flew across the [[English Channel]] in 1979.

The current distance and duration record recognised by the FAI, a straight distance of {{convert|115.11|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 3 hours and 54 minutes, was achieved on 23 April 1988 from [[Heraklion]] on [[Crete]] to [[Santorini]] in a [[MIT Daedalus]] 88 piloted by Kanellos Kanellopoulos.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The current speed record is held by the Monarch B, built by a team at MIT in 1983, which won a Kremer Prize of £20,000 for sustaining a speed of over {{convert|30|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} over a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} triangular course.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=====Helicopters=====
{{main|Human-powered helicopter}} 
The first officially observed human-powered helicopter to have left the ground was the [[Da Vinci III]] in 1989. It was designed and built by students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in California, USA. It flew for 7.1 seconds and reached a height of {{convert|8|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The second was the Yuri I in 1994, designed and built by students at Nihon University in Japan. It flew for 19.46 seconds and reached an altitude of {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. On 13 June 2013, the [[AeroVelo Atlas]] was the first to complete a flight that lasted 64 seconds and reached an altitude of 3.3 meters, thus winning the [[Sikorsky Prize]].

=====Airships and balloons=====
French inventors have built man-powered [[airship]]s and [[balloons]]. [[Solar balloon]]s and [[solar airships]] are new types of balloons and airships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ballonsolaire/en-index.htm Hot air balloons]&lt;/ref&gt; Because lift is supplied through buoyancy, human power can be devoted to thrust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeppy.org/news.htm Man-powered airship]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papalima.free.fr/motoballon/gazairship/Gazairship.htm Another man-powered airship]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Watercraft====
{{main|Human-powered watercraft}}
[[Image:Punt-pedalo.jpg|thumb|right|A Punt Pedalo]]
[[Image:Vaillancourt.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birch bark|Birchbark]] [[canoe]]]]
Human-powered watercraft include prehistoric, historic and well-known traditional and sporting craft such as canoes, rowing boats and [[galley]]s. The term ''human-powered boat'' is often used for more modern craft using propellers and water wheels for propulsion. These can be more efficient than paddles or oars and especially allow the use of the leg muscles which are generally stronger than arm muscles, even for non-athletes. Competitive rowing boats use sliding seats to engage the legs for propulsion with an oar for this reason, but require considerable skill to use efficiently. In addition, there is little skill required for forward propulsion while looking forwards and craft such as [[pedalo]]s are popular at resorts.

=====Hydrofoils=====
Hydrofoils have less water resistance at the highest speeds attainable by humans and are thus usually faster than displacement boats on short courses. The world speed record on water was set 27 October 1991 by MIT professor Mark Drela who pedalled a [[human-powered hydrofoil]], "[[Decavitator]]", to 18.5 knots (21.3&amp;nbsp;mph)(9.53 meters/second) over a 100-meter course in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, US.

=====Submarines=====
In 1989, the first human-powered International Submarine Race (ISR) was held in Florida with 17 craft. Since then nine more races have been held. The races themselves have been moved from the waters of Florida to the  [[David Taylor Model Basin]] at the [[Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center]] in Bethesda, Maryland, and are held biennially. At the 9th ISR in 2007 (in which 23 submarines participated) several new records were set: A single-person craft, [[Omer5]] achieved a record speed of 8.035 knots breaking the Omer team's previous record of 7.19 knots set by Omer 4 in 2004. Also Omer 6 snatched up a record for non-propeller driven craft with a speed of 4.642 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isrsubrace.org/ |title=International Submarine Races |publisher=Isrsubrace.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* work towards the establishment of new associations, both at national and regional level, and to the strengthening of existing ones, and to
* perform any other activity that will help to develop [[Agricultural Engineering]] and allied sciences.

==Structure==
The structure of CIGR is divided by seven technical Sections and various working groups. Each technical Section is charged with promoting and developing its respective field of science and technology as it relates to agricultural engineering. The CIGR Working Groups are appointed by the Executive Board to carry out studies on specific subjects of international importance and interest.

* CIGR Technical Sections:
**Section I: Land and [[Water]] Engineering
**Section II: [[Farm]] Buildings, Equipment, Structures and Environment
**Section III: Equipment Engineering for [[Plant]] Production

'''Home automation software''' is software that facilitates control of common appliances found in a home, office, or sometimes a commercial setting, such as lights, HVAC equipment, access control, sprinklers, and other devices. Software typically provides for scheduling tasks, such as turning sprinklers on at the appropriate time, event handling, such as turning lights on when motion is detected. Typically the application will support multiple interfaces to the outside world, such as [[XMPP]], email, [[Z-Wave]], and [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]].

The software will typically provide a user interface which is often based on a client-server model, such as a web UI or a smartphone app, or some combination thereof. More advanced applications will often allow users to write scripts in a programming language to handle more complex tasks. {{as of|2016}} there are many competing home automation standards for both hardware and software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1523">Opened in 1977 in [[Marin County]], CA, the '''Marin Computer Center''' was the world's first [[public access computer|public access]] [[microcomputer]] center.  The non-profit company was co-created by [[David Fox (LucasArts game designer)|David Fox]] (later to become one of [[Lucasfilm Games]]' founding members) and [[Annie Fox (author)|Annie Fox]] an author.

MCC (as it was known) initially featured the [[Atari 2600]], an Equinox 100, 9 [[Processor Technology]] Sol 20 computers ([[S-100 bus]] systems), the Radio Shack Model I and the [[Commodore PET]]. In addition to providing computer access to the public it had classes on the [[programming language]] [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]. Later it added [[Apple II]] and [[Atari 800]] computers, for a total of about 40 systems.

The Foxes left MCC in 1981, turning it over to new management, and later to the teens and young adults who helped run it.

[[Image:Coppa decorata con scene di carnevale.JPG|thumb|right|Decorated cup from Murano|alt=Decorated cup]]'''Murano glass''' is made on the [[wikt:Venetian|Venetian]] [[island]] of [[Murano]], which has been a glassmaking center for over 700 years. It is also sometimes referred to as [[Venetian glass]]. Today Murano is known for its [[art glass]], but it has a long history of innovations in glassmaking in addition to its artistic fame—and was Europe's first major glassmaking center. During the 1400s, Murano glassmakers created ''[[cristallo]]''—which was almost transparent and considered the finest glass in the world. Murano glassmakers also developed a white-colored glass ([[milk glass]] called ''lattimo'') that looked like [[porcelain]]. They later became Europe's finest makers of mirrors.

Originally, Venice was controlled by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], but it eventually became an independent [[city state]]. It flourished as a trading center and seaport. Its connections with the [[Middle East]] helped its glassmakers gain additional skills, as glassmaking was more advanced in countries such as [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. Although Venetian glassmaking existed as far back as the 8th Century, it became concentrated in Murano by law beginning 1291. Since glass factories often caught fire, this removed much of the possibility of a major fire disaster for the city. Murano glassmakers developed secret recipes and methods for making glass, and the concentration of Venice's glassmaking on the island of Murano enabled better control of those secrets.

Murano became Europe's elite glassmaking center, peaking in popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. Venice's dominance in trade along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] created a wealthy merchant class that was a strong connoisseur of the arts. This helped establish demand for art glass and more innovations. The spread of glassmaking talent in Europe eventually diminished the importance of Venice and its Murano glassmakers. A defeat by [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte in 1797, and occupation, caused more hardship for Murano's glassmaking industry. Murano glassmaking began a revival in the 1920s. Today, Murano and Venice are tourist attractions, and Murano is home to numerous glass factories and a few individual artists' studios. Its ''[[Museo del Vetro]]'' (Glass Museum) in the [[Palazzo Giustinian]] contains displays on the history of glassmaking as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

==Background==
{{See also|Republic of Venice}}
[[Image:Leguna Veneta.png|thumb|right|Venice and Murano|alt=map of Venice, Murano, and Italy]]The Venetian [[city state]] grew during the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] as people fled [[Sack of Rome (410)|barbarian invasions]] to the safety of islands in a [[lagoon]]. Small communities grew in the lagoon, and Venice became the most prominent. The city of Venice became a highly successful trading port, and by the [[11th century]] dominated trade between [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. It also had a strong [[navy]]. European [[Crusades|Crusaders]] passed through Venice on their way to the [[Holy Land]]. Treasures of many kinds were bought and sold in Venice: spices, [[precious metal]]s, [[gemstone]]s, [[ivory]], [[silk]]s—and [[glass]]. Successful trade bred a wealthy merchant class in addition to the [[Nobility|nobles]], and the wealthy were responsible for Venice's famous art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Zerwick49"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass began being produced in Venice around 450, as glassmakers from [[Aquileia]] fled to the islands to escape barbarian invaders.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[archaeological]] evidence of a glass factory in the area is from the Venetian lagoon island of [[Torcello]], which dates from the 7th to 8th century.&lt;ref name="Toso25"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Venetian glassmakers were joined by glassmakers from Byzantium (a.k.a. [[Constantinople]]) and the Middle East—which enriched their glassmaking knowledge.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586"/&gt; Glass was made in the Middle East long before it was made in Europe.{{#tag:ref|The region between the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates]] rivers is considered the birthplace of glassmaking. Glass was made there before 2000 B.C.&lt;ref name="Shotwell343"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was made in [[History of Syria|Syria]] as far back as 1700 B.C., and around 100 B.C. the Syrians started [[glassblowing]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell546"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] were making small glass vessels as far back as 1470 B.C. Their glassmaking became more sophisticated after the founding of [[Alexandria]] in 322 B.C.&lt;ref name="Shotwell155"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Early products were beads, glass for [[mosaic]]s, jewelry, small mirrors, and window glass.&lt;ref name="Shotwell587"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venetian glassmaking grew in importance to the city's economy. Around 1271, the local glassmakers' guild made rules to help preserve glassmaking secrets. Trade secrets were forbidden to be divulged outside of Venice. If a glassworker left the city without permission, he would be ordered to return.{{#tag:ref|While the Murano glassmakers were typically men, records exist beginning in the 1400s of women working in the manufacture of glass in Murano. A record from 1446 describes the employment of a woman who decorated glass and worked for Salvatore Barovier.&lt;ref name="Toso46"/&gt;|group=Note}} If he failed to return, his family would be imprisoned. If he still did not return, an assassin would be sent to kill him. Additional rules were made regarding ingredients used for making glass and the type of wood used as fuel for the furnaces.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586587"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|pp=586–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Island of Murano===
[[Image:"Le doge de Venise visitant les verreries de Murano".jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] visits Murano|alt=Dignitary visiting a glass factory in Murano]]
A November 8, 1291, law ordered most of Venice's glassmaking industry to be on the "island of [[Murano]]".&lt;ref name="Commerce789"&gt;{{harvnb|United States Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce|1917|p=789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murano is actually a cluster of islands linked by short bridges, and located about {{convert|1|mi}} north of Venice in the Venetian lagoon.&lt;ref name="Commerce789"/&gt; The furnaces used to make molten glass were a fire hazard, especially to cities with wooden structures nearby. The removal of the threat of a disaster from fire was not the only reason for moving the glassmaking industry to Murano. The glassmaking, ''and the glassmakers'', were kept in Murano. The Venetian government did what it believed was necessary to prevent the spread of Venetian glassmaking expertise to potential competitors. Glassmakers could not leave the island without permission from the government. Leaving without permission, or revealing trade secrets, was punishable by death. Another advantage for the Murano location was that imports and exports could easily be monitored.&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murano in the 1200s was a summer resort where the aristocrats of Venice built villas with orchards and gardens. It took about an hour to row a boat from Venice to Murano.&lt;ref name="Zerwick4950"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the glassmakers could not leave the island, the nobles had no constraints. Despite their travel restrictions, the glassmakers lived on a beautiful island, were under the direct rule of Venice's [[Council of Ten]], and had extra privileges.&lt;ref name="Moore31"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not work during the hot summer, as furnace repair and maintenance was conducted at that time.&lt;ref name="Dillon182"&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|1907|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1300s, the annual summer vacation lasted five months.&lt;ref name="Toso37"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1400s, the summer vacation was shortened to three and one half months.&lt;ref name="Toso45"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the Murano glassworkers believed they were not working enough.{{#tag:ref|In the 1540s, the Murano glassworkers were unhappy with the 35-week work year, complaining that they ''did not get enough time to work''—contrary to typical complaints of too much work.&lt;ref name="Moore33"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  Glassmakers also enjoyed heightened status. On December 22, 1376, it was announced that if a glassmaker's daughter married a nobleman, there was no forfeiture of social class—and their children were noble.&lt;ref name="Toso40"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major products and innovations==
[[File:Murano Glass Museum 27022015 Avventurina 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=glass jugs with threads of sparkle|Carafes containing aventurine glass thread]][[File:Millefiori beads, 1920s.JPG|thumb|right|alt=multi-colored glass beads|Millefiori beads]][[File:Venetian Jar CMOG.jpg|thumb|right|alt=white jar with fine stripes|Filigree style jar]][[File:Venezia, bicchiere nuziale in vetro lattimo smaltato, 1490 ca.jpg|thumb|right|alt=white cup with picture of man|Enameled lattimo glass]][[File:Bowl MET DP100217.jpg|thumb|right|alt=multi-colored bowl|Bowl circa 1870s]]
The glassmakers of Murano are known for many innovations and refinements to glassmaking. Among them are [[Murano beads]], ''[[cristallo]]'', [[Milk glass|''lattimo'']], [[chandelier]]s, and mirrors.&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"/&gt; Additional refinements or creations are [[Goldstone (glass)|goldstone]], multicolored glass ([[millefiori]]), and imitation gemstones made of glass.&lt;ref name="Geary202"&gt;{{harvnb|Geary|2008|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to guarding their secret processes and glass recipes, Venetian/Murano glassmakers strived for beauty with their glass.&lt;ref name="HarperJan1882P181183"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ancient and Modern Venetian Glass of Murano |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yktOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=Giuseppe+Briati+chandelier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiugpviidndAhWOr1kKHYyQC6E4ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Giuseppe%20Briati%20chandelier&amp;f=false |magazine= Harper's New Monthly Magazine&lt;!-- Page 181 and 183 --&gt;|location=New York |publisher=Harper and Brothers |date=1882-01-01 |access-date=2018-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aventurine===
Aventurine glass, also known as goldstone glass, is translucent brownish with metallic (copper) specs. It was developed by Venetian glassmakers in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Shotwell24"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first cited in historical documents in 1626.&lt;ref name="Toso97"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name aventurine is used because it was discovered accidentally.&lt;ref name="Toso97"/&gt;

===Beads===
Glass beads (a.k.a. [[Murano beads]]) were made by the Venetians beginning in the 1200s. The beads were used as [[Prayer beads|rosary beads]] and jewelry. They were also popular in [[Africa]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] noted that the people of the [[New World]] (Native Americans) were "delighted" with the beads as gifts, and beads became popular with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]].&lt;ref name="Zerwick5051"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Calcedonio''===
''Calcedonio'' is a marbled glass that looked like the semiprecious stone [[chalcedony]].&lt;ref name="Getty90"&gt;{{harvnb|Hess|Husband|J. Paul Getty Museum|1999|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of glass was created during the 1400s by [[Angelo Barovier]], who is considered Murano's greatest glassmaker.&lt;ref name="Chambers21"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Oldknow|Ft. Wayne Museum of Art|Tampa Museum of Art|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barovier was an expert glassblower, revived enameling, and also worked with colored glass.  His family had been involved with glassmaking since at least 1331, and the family continued in the business after his death.&lt;ref name="McCray"&gt;{{harvnb|McCray|2002|p=chapter 2 of e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1460.{{#tag:ref|At least three authors agree that Angelo Barovier died in 1460.&lt;ref name="Toso46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shotwell30"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of his birth is less certain, but is said to be around 1400.&lt;ref name="Chambers22"/&gt;|group=Note}}

===Chandeliers===
During the 1700s, Giuseppe Briati was famous for his work with ornamented mirrors and chandeliers.&lt;ref name="HarperJan1882P181183"/&gt; Briati's chandelier style was called ''ciocche''—literally bouquet of flowers. Briati's typical chandelier was large with multiple arms decorated with garlands, flowers and leaves. One of the common uses of the huge Murano chandeliers was interior lighting for theatres and important rooms in palaces. Briati was born in Murano in 1686, and his family's business was glassmaking. He was allowed to work in a Bohemian glass factory, where he learned the secrets of working with Bohemian crystal—which was becoming more popular than Murano ''cristallo''. In 1739, the Council of Ten allowed him to move his furnace from Murano to Venice because his work had caused such jealousy that he and his workers feared for their lives. (His father had been stabbed to death in 1701.)&lt;ref name="Toso122124"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briati retired in 1762, and his nephew became manager of the glass works. Briati died in Venice in 1772, and is buried in Murano.&lt;ref name="Toso127"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cristallo''===
''Cristallo'' is a soda glass, created during the 15th century by Murano's Angelo Barovier.{{#tag:ref|Angelo Barovier is generally credited with creating ''cristallo'', and was definitely making it in 1455.&lt;ref name="Moore37"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set of authors believes that ''cristallo'' was an incremental "development that stretched over nearly two centuries."&lt;ref name="Syson186"&gt;{{harvnb|Syson|Thornton|2000|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speculate that Barovier perfected the soda ash purification process used for ''cristallo'', and also discovered the stabilizer.&lt;ref name="Syson186"/&gt;|group=Note}} The oldest reference to ''cristallo'' is dated May 24, 1453.&lt;ref name="Toso46"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ''cristallo'' was considered Europe's clearest glass, and is one of the main reasons Murano became "the most important glass center".&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"/&gt; It looked like [[quartz]], which was said to have magical qualities and often used in religious objects. ''Cristallo'' became very popular.&lt;ref name="Chambers22"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Oldknow|Ft. Wayne Museum of Art|Tampa Museum of Art|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of glass was fragile and difficult to cut, but it could be [[Enamelled glass|enameled]] and [[Glass engraving|engraved]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell110"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glass coloring and color marking#Coloring ions|Manganese]] was a key ingredient in the secret formula used to make ''cristallo''.&lt;ref name="Shotwell587"/&gt; An easy modification to ''cristallo'' made in Murano was to produce a frosted or crackle version.&lt;ref name="Dillon203"&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|1907|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Filigrana''===
The ''filigrana'' (a.k.a. filigree) style was developed in Murano in the 1500s. By embedding glass canes (usually white but not always) in colorless glass, the glassware has a striped appearance. ''Vetro a fili'' has straight white stripes, ''vetro a retortoli'' has twisted or spiral patterns, and ''vetro a reticello'' has two sets of lines twisted in opposite directions. Francesco Zeno has been mentioned as the inventor of ''vetro a retortoli''.&lt;ref name="Page18"&gt;{{harvnb|Page|Doménech|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lattimo''===
''Lattimo'', or milk glass, began being made in Murano during the 15th century, and Angelo Barovier is credited with its re-discovery and development.&lt;ref name="Getty73"&gt;{{harvnb|Hess|Husband|J. Paul Getty Museum|1999|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This glass is opaque white, and was meant to resemble enameled porcelain.&lt;ref name="Shotwell294"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was often decorated with enamel showing sacred scenes or views of Venice.&lt;ref name="Fuga257"&gt;{{harvnb|Fuga|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Millefiori''===
''Millefiori'' glass is a variation of the [[murrine]] technique made from colored [[caneworking|canes]] in clear glass, and is often arranged in flower-like patterns. The Italian word ''millefiori'' means thousand flowers.&lt;ref name="Shotwell24"/&gt; This technique was perfected in Alexandria, Egypt, and began being used in Murano in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Fuga282"&gt;{{harvnb|Fuga|2006|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirrors===
Small mirrors were made in Murano beginning in the 1500s, and mirror makers had their own guild beginning in 1569.&lt;ref name="Shotwell351"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murano mirrors were known for the artwork on the frame that held the mirror in addition to their quality.&lt;ref name="Shotwell351"/&gt; By the 1600s, Murano mirrors were in great demand. However, by the end of the century, English-made mirrors had the best quality. Only one glass house in Murano was still making mirrors by 1772.&lt;ref name="Moore48"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murrine===
Murrine technique begins with the layering of colored liquid glass, heated to {{convert|1900|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, which is then stretched into long rods called canes. When cooled, these canes are then sliced in cross-sections, which reveals the layered pattern. Ercole Barovier, a descendent of Murano's greatest glassmaker Angelo Barovier, won numerous awards during the 1940s and 1950s for his innovations using the murrine technique.&lt;ref name="AC19990219P123"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sommerso''===
''Sommerso'' ("submerged" in Italian), is a form of artistic Murano glass that has layers of contrasting colors (typically two), which are formed by dipping colored glass into another molten glass and then blowing the combination into a desired shape. The outermost layer, or casing, is often clear. ''Sommerso'' was developed in Murano during the late 1930s. [[Flavio Poli]] was known for using this technique, and it was made popular by Seguso Vetri d'Arte and the Mandruzzato family in the 1950s. This process is a popular technique for vases, and is sometimes used for sculptures.&lt;ref name="AC19990219P123"/&gt;

==Golden age, decline, and revival==
{{See also|Fall of the Republic of Venice}}
[[File:Coupe avec cortège allégorique (Louvre, OA 7564).jpg|thumb|right|alt=jar on stand with lid, multiple colors|Barovier enameled glass]]The [[16th century]] was the golden age for glassmaking in Murano. Major trading partners included the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Indies]], Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the German-speaking states.&lt;ref name="Toso61"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 28 glassmaking furnaces were in Murano in 1581.&lt;ref name="Toso62"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous leaders and dignitaries visited Murano during this century, including the queen of France, dukes, princes, generals, cardinals, archbishops, and ambassadors.&lt;ref name="Toso64"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors of Murano glass included [[Henry VIII of England]], [[Pope Clement VII]], [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand of Hungary]], [[Francis I of France]], and [[Phillip II of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Toso66"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the dominance of ''cristallo'' came to an end. In 1673, [[England|English]] glass merchant [[George Ravenscroft]] created a clear glass he called ''crystalline''—but it was not stable. Three years later, he improved this glass by adding lead oxide, and [[lead glass]] (a.k.a. crystal) was created.&lt;ref name="Toso102"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravenscroft, who had lived for many years in Venice, made lead crystal that was less breakable than ''cristallo''.&lt;ref name="Zerwick65"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674, [[Bohemia]]n glassmaker Louis Le Vasseur made crystal that was similar to Ravenscroft's.&lt;ref name="Toso103"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, Johan Friedrich Kunkel von Lowenstein produced a ''cristallo''-like glass in [[Potsdam]].&lt;ref name="Toso105"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian and [[Prussia]]n-style glass was later modified by the addition of lime and chalk. This new glass is attributed to Bohemian glassmaker Michael Müller in 1683.&lt;ref name="Toso105"/&gt; The Bohemian glass was not suitable to the Murano-style artwork on the glass. However, this harder glass was produced as a thicker glass suitable for engraving and grinding. The Bohemian and English glass eventually became more popular than ''cristallo'' made in Murano.&lt;ref name="Toso105"/&gt; By the 1700s, Murano glass was traded mostly with Italian states and the Turkish empire. Small quantities were traded with England, Flanders, the Netherlands and Spain.&lt;ref name="Toso109"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] conquered Venice during May 1797, and the Venetian Republic came to an end.&lt;ref name="Madden17"&gt;{{harvnb|Madden|2012|p=Ch. 17 of e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the Venetian Republic caused hard times for glassmaking in Murano, and some of the Murano methods became lost. Controlled by France and Austria, Venetian glassmaking became unprofitable because of tariffs and taxes—and glassmakers that survived were reduced to making mostly beads.&lt;ref name="CE19980911P15"&gt;{{cite news

==Making glass==
[[File:Making a Glass Horse (7251890544).jpg|thumb|right|alt=tools holding glass horse being shaped|Glassmaking tools in use]]
From its beginning until the fall of the Venetian Republic, Murano glass was mostly a very high quality [[Soda-lime glass|soda lime glass]] (using today's terminology) that had extra attention focused on its appearance. Glass from that time typically contained 65 to 70 percent [[Silicon dioxide|silica]].&lt;ref name="Janssens26"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flux, usually [[Sodium oxide|soda]] (sodium oxide as 10 to 20 percent of the glass composition) was added to enable the silica to melt at a lower temperature. A stabilizer, usually [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (calcium oxide as about 10 percent of the glass) was also added for durability and to prevent solubility in water. Small quantities of other ingredients were added to the glass, mostly to affect appearance.&lt;ref name="Janssens528"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sand is a common source for silica. For certain types of glass, the Murano glassmakers used quartz as their source for silica. Quartz pebbles were crushed into a fine powder. Two sources for sand were [[Crete|Creta]] and [[Sicily]]. Quartz pebbles were selected from the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and [[Adige]] rivers in [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name="Janssens524"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their source for soda was what they called [[Salsola soda|''allume catina'']]—plant ash found in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] countries of the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Janssens26"/&gt; Beginning in the 16th century, ''allume catina'' was also imported from Mediterranean coastal regions of Spain and France.&lt;ref name="Janssens524"/&gt;
 
The mixing and melting of the batch of ingredients was a two-stage process. First, nearly equal amounts of silica and flux were continuously stirred in a special furnace. The furnace was called a ''calchera'' furnace, and the mix was called ''fritta''. In the second stage, the ''fritta'' was mixed with selected recycled waste glass (cullet) and melted in another furnace.&lt;ref name="Janssens523"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type and color of glass, other additives were used. [[Lead]] and [[tin]] were added for white opaque glass (''latimo''). [[Cobalt]] was used for blue glass. [[Copper]] and [[iron]] were used for green and for various shades of green, blue, and yellow.&lt;ref name="Janssens531-532"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|pp=531–532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese was used to remove colors.&lt;ref name="Janssens526"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although natural gas is the furnace fuel of choice for glassmaking today, the fuel mandated in Murano during the 13th century was [[alder]] and [[willow]] wood.&lt;ref name="Toso25"/&gt; During this second stage, the surface of the molten glass was skimmed to remove undesirable chemicals that affected the appearance of the glass.&lt;ref name="Janssens523"/&gt; Additional techniques were used as glassmaking evolved. To improve clarity, molten glass was put in water and then re-melted. Another technique was to purify the flux by boiling and filtering.&lt;ref name="Janssens528"/&gt;

===Tools===
The Venetian glassmakers had a set of tools that changed little for hundreds of years. A ''ferro sbuso'', also called a ''canna da soffio'', is the [[Glassblowing|blowpipe]] essential for extracting molten glass and beginning the shaping process.&lt;ref name="Mentasti188"&gt;{{harvnb|Mentasti|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''borselle'' is a tong-like tool of various sizes used to shape glass that has not hardened. A ''borselle puntata'' is a similar tool, only it has a pattern that an be imprinted on the glass.&lt;ref name="Shotwell48"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''pontello'' is an iron rod that holds the glass while work is done on the edge of the glass.&lt;ref name="Toso45"/&gt;  A ''tagianti'' is a large scissors used to cut glass before it has hardened. A ''scagno'' is the workbench used by the glassmaker.&lt;ref name="Dorigato31"&gt;{{harvnb|Dorigato|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Good tools are nice, but good hands are better," is an old Murano saying that reinforces the idea that the glassmakers of Murano rely on their skills instead of any advantage caused by special tools.&lt;ref name="CMOGtools"&gt;{{cite web

Some of Murano's historical glass factories remain well known [[brand]]s today, including De Biasi, Gabbiani, [[Paolo Venini|Venini]], [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]], [[Barovier &amp; Toso]], [[Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]], [[Berengo Studio]], [[Seguso]], Formia International, Simone Cenedese, Alessandro Mandruzzato, Vetreria Ducale, Estevan Rossetto 1950 and others. The oldest glass factory is Antica Vetreria Fratelli Toso, founded in 1854.&lt;ref name="Gable44"&gt;{{harvnb|Gable|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the industry has been shrinking as demand has waned. Imitation works (recognizable by experts but not by the typical tourist) from Asia and Eastern Europe take an estimated 40 to 45 percent of the market for Murano glass, and public tastes have changed while the designs in Murano have largely stayed the same. To fight the imitation problem, a group of companies and concerned individuals created a trademark in 1994 that certifies that the product was made on Murano. By 2012, about 50 companies were using the Artistic Glass Murano® trademark of origin.&lt;ref name="TheGuardianMuranoWeb"/&gt;

Glassmaking is a difficult and uncomfortable profession, as glassmakers must work with a product heated to extremely high temperatures. Unlike 500 years ago, children of glassmakers do not enjoy any special privileges, extra wealth, or marriage into nobility. Today, it is difficult to recruit young glassmakers.&lt;!--One Murano glassmaker, who had worked in the business for generations, told the author that his son would rather play soccer and had no interest in glass.--&gt; Foreign imitations, and difficulty attracting young workers, caused the number of professional glassmakers in Murano to decrease from about 6,000 in 1990 to fewer than 1,000 by 2012.&lt;ref name="TheGuardianMuranoWeb"&gt;{{cite web

'''Nanoelectronics''' refer to the use of [[nanotechnology]] in [[electronics|electronic]] components.  The term covers a diverse set of devices and materials, with the common characteristic that they are so small that inter-atomic interactions and [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] properties need to be studied extensively.  Some of these candidates include: hybrid molecular/[[semiconductor]] electronics, one-dimensional [[carbon nanotubes|nanotubes]]/[[nanowire]]s (e.g. [[Silicon nanowire]]s or [[Carbon nanotubes]]) or advanced [[molecular electronics]].  Recent [[silicon]] [[CMOS]] technology generations, such as the [[22 nanometer]] node, are already within this regime.  Nanoelectronics are sometimes considered as [[disruptive technology]] because present candidates are significantly different from traditional transistors.

==Fundamental concepts ==
In 1965 [[Gordon Moore]] observed that silicon transistors were undergoing a continual process of scaling downward, an observation which was later codified as [[Moore's law]]. Since his observation transistor minimum feature sizes have decreased from 10 micrometers to the 28-22&amp;nbsp;nm range in 2011. The field of nanoelectronics aims to enable the continued realization of this law by using new methods and materials to build electronic devices with feature sizes on the [[nanoscale]].

===Mechanical issues===
The [[volume]] of an object decreases as the third power of its linear dimensions, but the [[surface area]] only decreases as its second power.  This somewhat subtle and unavoidable principle has huge ramifications.  For example, the [[Power (physics)|power]] of a [[drill]] (or any other machine) is proportional to the volume, while the [[friction]] of the drill's [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] and [[gear]]s is proportional to their surface area.  For a normal-sized drill, the power of the device is enough to handily overcome any friction.  However, scaling its length down by a factor of 1000, for example, decreases its power by 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (a factor of a billion) while reducing the friction by only 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a factor of only a million).  Proportionally it has 1000 times less power per unit friction than the original drill.  If the original friction-to-power ratio was, say, 1%, that implies the smaller drill will have 10 times as much friction as power; the drill is useless.

For this reason, while super-miniature electronic [[integrated circuit]]s are fully functional, the same technology cannot be used to make working mechanical devices beyond the scales where frictional forces start to exceed the available power. So even though you may see microphotographs of delicately etched silicon gears, such devices are currently little more than curiosities with limited real world applications, for example, in moving mirrors and shutters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mems.sandia.gov/tech-info/mems-overview.html| title = MEMS Overview| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surface tension increases in much the same way, thus magnifying the tendency for very small objects to stick together.  This could possibly make any kind of [[Molecular assembler|"micro factory"]] impractical: even if robotic arms and hands could be scaled down, anything they pick up will tend to be impossible to put down. The above being said, molecular evolution has resulted in working [[cilium|cilia]], [[flagellum|flagella]], muscle fibers and rotary motors in aqueous environments, all on the nanoscale.  These machines exploit the increased frictional forces found at the micro or nanoscale.  Unlike a paddle or a propeller which depends on normal frictional forces (the frictional forces perpendicular to the surface) to achieve propulsion, cilia develop motion from the exaggerated drag or laminar forces (frictional forces parallel to the surface) present at micro and nano dimensions.  To build meaningful "machines" at the nanoscale, the relevant forces need to be considered.  We are faced with the development and design of intrinsically pertinent machines rather than the simple reproductions of macroscopic ones.

All scaling issues therefore need to be assessed thoroughly when evaluating nanotechnology for practical applications.

==Approaches to Nanoelectronics ==

===Nanofabrication===
{{main|Nanocircuitry|nanolithography}}
For example, [[ electron transistor]]s, which involve transistor operation based on a single electron.  [[Nanoelectromechanical systems]] also fall under this category.
Nanofabrication can be used to construct ultradense parallel arrays of [[nanowire]]s, as an alternative to synthesizing [[nanowires]] individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=N. |last=Melosh |author2=Boukai, Abram |author3=Diana, Frederic |author4=Gerardot, Brian |author5=Badolato, Antonio |author6=Petroff, Pierre |author7=Heath, James R. |title=Ultrahigh density nanowire lattices and circuits |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=300 |issue=5616 |pages=112–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12637672 |doi=10.1126/science.1081940|bibcode = 2003Sci...300..112M |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/300/5616/112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Das |author2=Gates, A.J. |author3=Abdu, H.A. |author4=Rose, G.S. |author5=Picconatto, C.A. |author6=Ellenbogen, J.C. |title= Designs for Ultra-Tiny, Special-Purpose Nanoelectronic Circuits |journal=IEEE Trans.

Besides being small and allowing more transistors to be packed into a single chip, the uniform and symmetrical structure of [[Silicon nanowire|nanowires]] and/or nanotubes allows a higher [[electron mobility]] (faster electron movement in the material), a higher [[dielectric]] constant (faster frequency), and a symmetrical [[electron]]/[[electron hole|hole]] characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Goicoechea |author2=Zamarreñoa, C.R. |author3=Matiasa, I.R. |author4=Arregui, F.J. |title= Minimizing the photobleaching of self-assembled multilayers for sensor applications |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=41–47 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.snb.2006.10.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, [[nanoparticle]]s can be used as [[quantum dots]].

===Molecular Electronics ===
{{main|Molecular scale electronics}}
Single molecule devices are another possibility.  These schemes would make heavy use of [[molecular self-assembly]], designing the device components to construct a larger structure or even a complete system on their own.  This can be very useful for [[reconfigurable computing]], and may even completely replace present [[field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] technology.

Molecular electronics&lt;ref name="MEBook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Petty |first=M.C. |author2=Bryce, M.R. |author3=Bloor, D. |title=An Introduction to Molecular Electronics |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-19-521156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a new technology which is still in its infancy, but also brings hope for truly atomic scale electronic systems in the future.  One of the more promising applications of molecular electronics was proposed by the IBM researcher Ari Aviram and the theoretical chemist [[Mark Ratner]] in their 1974 and 1988 papers ''Molecules for Memory, Logic and Amplification'', (see [[Unimolecular rectifier]]).&lt;ref name="AviramRatner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aviram |first=A. |author2=Ratner, M. A. |title=Molecular Rectifier |journal=[[Chemical Physics Letters]] |volume=29 |pages=277–283 |year=1974 |doi=10.1016/0009-2614(74)85031-1|bibcode = 1974CPL....29..277A |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AviramJACS"&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Aviram |title=Molecules for memory, logic, and amplification |journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] |volume=110 |issue=17 |pages=5687–5692 |year=1988 |doi=10.1021/ja00225a017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of many possible ways in which a molecular level diode / transistor might be synthesized by organic chemistry.
A model system was proposed with a spiro carbon structure giving a molecular diode about half a nanometre across which could be connected by [[polythiophene]] molecular wires.  Theoretical calculations showed the design to be sound in principle and there is still hope that such a system can be made to work.

===Other Approaches===

[[Nanoionics]] studies the transport of ions rather than electrons in nanoscale systems.

[[Nanophotonics]] studies the behavior of light on the nanoscale, and has the goal of developing devices that take advantage of this behavior.

==Nanoelectronic Devices ==
Current high-technology production processes are based on traditional top down strategies, where nanotechnology has already been introduced silently. The critical length scale of [[integrated circuits]] is already at the nanoscale (50&amp;nbsp;nm and below) regarding the gate length of transistors in [[CPU]]s or [[DRAM]] devices.

===Computers===
[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|right|500px|Simulation result for formation of inversion channel (electron density) and attainment of threshold voltage (IV) in a nanowire MOSFET. Note that the threshold voltage for this device lies around 0.45V.]]

Nanoelectronics holds the promise of making [[computer processor]]s more powerful than are possible with conventional [[semiconductor fabrication]] techniques.  A number of approaches are currently being researched, including new forms of [[nanolithography]], as well as the use of [[nanomaterials]] such as [[nanowire]]s or [[molecular logic gate|small molecules]] in place of traditional [[CMOS]] components.  [[Field effect transistors]] have been made using both semiconducting [[carbon nanotube]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Postma |first=Henk W. Ch. |author2=Teepen, Tijs |author3=Yao, Zhen |author4=Grifoni, Milena |author5=Dekker, Cees |title=Carbon nanotube single-electron transistors at room temperature |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=293 |issue=5527 |year=2001 |pmid=11441175 |pages=76–79 |doi=10.1126/science.1061797|bibcode = 2001Sci...293...76P |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/5527/76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with heterostructured semiconductor [[Silicon nanowire|nanowires]] (SiNWs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xiang |first=Jie |author2=Lu, Wei |author3=Hu, Yongjie |author4=Wu, Yue |author5=Yan Hao |author6=Lieber, Charles M. |title=Ge/Si nanowire heterostructures as highperformance field-effect transistors |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=489–493 |year=2006 |pmid=16724062 |doi=10.1038/nature04796|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..489X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the CMOS transistor developed at the Laboratory for Electronics and Information Technology in Grenoble, France, tested the limits of the principles of the MOSFET transistor with a diameter of 18&amp;nbsp;nm (approximately 70 atoms placed side by side). This was almost one tenth the size of the smallest industrial transistor in 2003 (130&amp;nbsp;nm in 2003, 90&amp;nbsp;nm in 2004, 65&amp;nbsp;nm in 2005 and 45&amp;nbsp;nm in 2007). It enabled the theoretical integration of seven billion junctions on a €1 coin. However, the CMOS transistor, which was created in 1999, was not a simple research experiment to study how CMOS technology functions, but rather a demonstration of how this technology functions now that we ourselves are getting ever closer to working on a molecular scale. Today it would be impossible to master the coordinated assembly of a large number of these transistors on a circuit and it would also be impossible to create this on an industrial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] |place = London |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2  | page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory Storage ===
Electronic memory designs in the past have largely relied on the formation of transistors. However, research into [[crossbar switch]] based electronics have offered an alternative using reconfigurable interconnections between vertical and horizontal wiring arrays to create ultra high density memories. Two leaders in this area are [[Nantero]] which has developed a carbon nanotube based crossbar memory called [[Nano-RAM]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] which has proposed the use of [[memristor]] material as a future replacement of Flash memory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

An example of such novel devices is based on [[spintronics]].The dependence of the resistance of a material (due to the spin of the electrons) on an external field is called [[magnetoresistance]]. This effect can be significantly amplified (GMR - Giant Magneto-Resistance) for nanosized objects, for example when two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a nonmagnetic layer, which is several nanometers thick (e.g. Co-Cu-Co). The GMR effect has led to a strong increase in the data storage density of hard disks and made the gigabyte range possible. The so-called tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) is very similar to GMR and based on the spin dependent tunneling of electrons through adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Both GMR and TMR effects can be used to create a non-volatile main memory for computers, such as the so-called magnetic random access memory or [[MRAM]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Novel Optoelectronic Devices ===
In the modern communication technology traditional analog electrical devices are increasingly replaced by optical or [[optoelectronic]] devices due to their enormous bandwidth and capacity, respectively. Two promising examples are
[[photonic crystals]] and [[quantum dots]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Photonic crystals are materials with a periodic variation in the refractive index with a lattice constant that is half the wavelength of the light used. They offer a selectable band gap for the propagation of a certain wavelength, thus they resemble a semiconductor, but for light or [[photon]]s instead of [[electron]]s. Quantum dots are nanoscaled objects, which can be used, among many other things, for the construction of lasers. The advantage of a quantum dot laser over the traditional semiconductor laser is that their emitted wavelength depends on the diameter of the dot. Quantum dot lasers are cheaper and offer a higher beam quality than conventional laser diodes.

[[File:Fullerene Nanogears - GPN-2000-001535.jpg|thumb|left]]

=== Displays ===
The production of displays with low energy consumption might be accomplished using [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNT) and/or [[Silicon nanowire]]s. Such nanostructures are electrically conductive and due to their small diameter of several nanometers, they can be used as field emitters with extremely high efficiency for [[field emission display]]s (FED). The principle of operation resembles that of the [[cathode ray tube]], but on a much smaller length scale.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Quantum Computers ===
{{main|Quantum computer}}
Entirely new approaches for computing exploit the laws of quantum mechanics for novel quantum computers, which enable the use of fast quantum algorithms.  The Quantum computer has quantum bit memory space termed "Qubit" for several computations at the same time. This facility may improve the performance of the older systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Radios===

[[Nanoradios]] have been developed structured around [[carbon nanotube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jensen, K. |author2=Weldon, J. |author3=Garcia, H. |author4=Zettl A. |title=Nanotube Radio |journal=Nano Lett. |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=3508–3511 |year=2007 |doi=10.1021/nl0721113 |pmid=17973438|bibcode = 2007NanoL...7.3508J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Production ===
Research is ongoing to use nanowires and other nanostructured materials with the hope to create cheaper and more efficient [[solar cell]]s than are possible with conventional planar silicon solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bozhi |last=Tian |author2=Zheng, Xiaolin |author3=Kempa, Thomas J. |author4=Fang, Ying |author5=Yu, Nanfang |author6=Yu, Guihua |author7=Huang, Jinlin |author8=Lieber, Charles M. |title=Coaxial silicon nanowires as solar cells and nanoelectronic power sources |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=449 |issue=7164 |pages=885–889 |year=2007 |pmid=17943126 |doi=10.1038/nature06181|bibcode = 2007Natur.449..885T |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/abs/nature06181.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that the invention of more efficient solar energy would have a great effect on satisfying global energy needs.

There is also research into energy production for devices that would operate ''[[in vivo]]'', called bio-nano generators. A bio-nano generator is a [[nanotechnology|nanoscale]] [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] device, like a [[fuel cell]] or [[galvanic cell]], but drawing power from [[blood glucose]] in a living body, much the same as how the body generates [[energy]] from [[food]]. To achieve the effect, an [[enzyme]] is used that is capable of stripping glucose of its [[electron]]s, freeing them for use in electrical devices. The average person's body could, theoretically, generate 100 [[watt]]s of [[electricity]] (about 2000 food calories per day) using a bio-nano generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Power from blood could lead to 'human batteries' | date=August 4, 2003 | publisher= | url =http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/03/1059849278131.html | work =Sydney Morning Herald | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this estimate is only true if all food was converted to electricity, and the human body needs some energy consistently, so possible power generated is likely much lower. The electricity generated by such a device could power devices embedded in the body (such as [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]]), or sugar-fed [[Nanorobotics|nanorobot]]s. Much of the research done on bio-nano generators is still experimental, with [[Panasonic]]'s Nanotechnology Research Laboratory among those at the forefront.

== Overview ==
The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC) is an alliance of over 116 member groups that work collectively with NSAC's Washington, D.C.-based staff to promote and enhance sustainable food and farm policy at the federal level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainableagriculture.net/|title=National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|last=|first=|date=|website=National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|publisher=|access-date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NSAC aims to promote healthy rural and urban communities, support small-medium family farms, and protect natural resources. NSAC's definition of a sustainable agricultural system is one that produces readily available, affordable, nutritious food; provides farmers and laborers a high standard of living; and promotes the health of the environment and of communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainableagriculture.net/about-us/what-is-sustainable-ag/|title=What is Sustainable Ag?|last=|first=|date=|website=National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|publisher=|access-date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NSAC’s advocacy begins with input from sustainable and organic farmers, ranchers, and member organizations that work closely with producers. With this information in mind, NSAC develops policy priorities through its member-based issue committees. While NSAC staff conduct direct advocacy and education on policy issues to legislators and federal agencies on Capitol Hill, member organizations lead outreach and implementation work on the local, state, and regional levels.
 
NSAC has been involved in the creation of federal programs, including: Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), [[Wetlands Reserve Program|Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP)]], and Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI) as part of the [[National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS)]]; [[Value-Added Producer Grants|Value-Added Producer Grants Program (VAPG)]] as part of [[USDA Rural Development|USDA Office of Rural Development]]; Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP) as part of USDA’s [[National Institute of Food and Agriculture|National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)]]; Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMLFPP) as part of [[Agricultural Marketing Service|USDA Agriculture Marketing Service]]; National Organic Certification Cost Share Program (NOCCSP) as part of the [[National Organic Program (NOP)]]; and [[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program|Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SARE)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== History ==
NSAC was formed in 2009 after the respective governing bodies of Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (SAC) and National Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture (NCSA) voted to merge. SAC was originally a midwest-based organization that formed as a direct result of the mid 1980's farm crisis. In 2003, SAC members voted to form a national coalition in order to expand their representation in Washington, D.C. NCSA formed in 1994 with a mission of bringing together diverse voices to influence federal food policy. Their community ties and more than 100 member organizations brought a grassroots voice to the NCSA - SAC merger. As an equal product of both of these organizations, NSAC aims to equally prioritize supporting, building, developing and engaging the grassroots of sustainable agriculture with researching, developing and advocating federal policies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Organizational structure ==
NSAC’s member organizations represent the interests of almost all 50 states and the District of Columbia and are supported by a core staff in Washington, D.C. NSAC staff work with represented and participating members on issue-based councils and committees, which meet regularly via conference call and at biannual meetings. 

NSAC is overseen by three distinct governing councils: the Organizational Council, Grassroots Council, and Policy Council. The Organizational Council oversees development, membership, planning, and execution of NSAC mission. All potential NSAC members must first be approved by the Organizational Council before joining the coalition. The Grassroots Council coordinates NSAC’s advocacy efforts among member organizations, including media messaging and action alerts pertaining to campaigns. Within the Grassroots Council, the Diversity Committee works to ensure NSAC actively practices its commitment to equity and raising social justice concerns in relation to NSAC’s policy priorities and advocacy strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainableagriculture.net/about-us/mission-goals/nsac-statement-on-racial-equity/|title=NSAC Statement on Racial Equity|last=|first=|date=|website=National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Policy Council sets NSAC's yearly policy priorities after taking into consideration recommendations from each of NSAC’s issue committees.

Unlike the three governing councils, NSAC Issue Committees focus on research and development of specific federal farm and food policies in accordance with the annual priorities set by the Policy Council. Issue Committees meet monthly to discuss policy strategies and coordinate action across states and regions. There are currently five Policy Issue Committees that work on diverse, but often overlapping, topics: 
* Research, Education and Extension (REE) focuses on USDA and other public agricultural research and extension programs as well as the [[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education|Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SARE)]]. 
* Marketing, Food Systems, and Rural Development Committee (MFSRD) explores value-added marketing channels for sustainably-produced farm goods as well as economic strategies that build the vitality and sustainability of rural communities. 
* Conservation, Energy, and Environment (CEE) helps formulate policy options and positions on a broad array of agricultural conservation programs, renewable energy policy, and environmental policy issues. 
* Farming Opportunities and Fair Competition (FOFC) aims to improve market conditions for farmers by advocating for commodity program reform, farm credit, and beginning farmer and rancher provisions, among others. 
* Food System Integrity (FSI) develops and advances policies that ensure a safe food supply and support family farms, healthy food systems, and opportunities for sustainable farmers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Members ===
Potential NSAC member organizations can apply to be either Represented Members or Participating Members. Represented Members receive formal representation by NSAC before government agencies and Congress. These member groups serve on the NSAC Issue Committees as well as the Policy Council and Organizational Council. Participating Members can serve on NSAC Issue Committees and attend NSAC events, but do not receive formal representation by NSAC on the Hill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Norman Houghton''' (born 1948) is a historian and archivist in [[Geelong, Victoria]], who has published over 30 books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.colacherald.com.au/2011/06/otways-railways-buff-launches-a-new-book/| first=Carla| last=Okai| title=Otways railways buff launches a new book| website=Colac Herald| date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; many focusing on [[Tramway (industrial)|timber tramways]] and [[sawmill]]s of the Otway and Wombat Forests of Western Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Houghton, Norm (1948-) |journal=Trove |publication-date=2008 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-463567 |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his works have been [[self-published]], while he has provided numerous articles to the newsletter and journal of the [[Light Railway Research Society of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lrrsa.org.au/LrBiblio.htm| title=LRRSA Victorian timber tramways - select bibliography, Items on Victorian timber tramways published in Light Railways Nos 99 to 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Houghton grew up in Colac (in southern Victoria ) and attended [[Monash University]], graduating in history. His interest in railway and forest history of Victoria's [[Otway Ranges]] was nurtured from an early age and resulted in his documentation and mapping of more than 300 sawmills and 160 kilometres of timber tramlines, which were built in the area from the 1850s to the mid 20th century.&lt;ref name=Borschmann&gt;{{Citation |author1=Houghton, Norm |author2=Borschmann, Gregg (Interviewer) |title=Norman Houghton interviewed by Gregg Borschmann in the People's forest oral history project |publication-date=1993 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32852395 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Borschmann| first=Gregg (Gregg John)| title=The people's forest: a living history of the Australian bush| edition=New| publisher=People's Forest Press| location=Blackheath, NSW, Australia| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houghton worked at [[Sovereign Hill]] Historical Gold Mining Village and the Gold Museum in Ballarat and undertook assessment of the archives of the Queensland Railways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.foresthistory.org.au/afhsnewsletter49.pdf| title=Australian Forest History Society Inc. Newsletter; No. 49| date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; before operationally establishing the Geelong Heritage Centre as its foundation Director in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hepburnadvocate.com.au/story/1580408/wombat-forest-features-in-new-book/| website=The Advocate| title=Wombat Forest features in new book| first=Hannah| last=Knight| date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he held the role of archivist with the [[Geelong Heritage Centre|Geelong Historical Records Centre]] for many decades, and was instrumental in assisting the Geelong Historical Society to collate and compile records which formed the basis of the Heritage Centre archival collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forestry research==

Houghton's primary research on sawmills and timber tramways has been used as the basis for comprehensive assessments of the value of forest heritage sites, for example by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A methodology to assess the heritage value of historic sawmill and tramway sites in the Central Forest Management Area of Victoria| first=Peter| last=Evans| location=Victoria| publisher=Department of Conservation and Natural Resources| year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A report to the Australian Heritage Commission on sawmill and tramway sites in the Central Highland forests of Victoria| first=Peter| last=Evans| publisher=Australian Heritage Commission, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources| year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A study of historic sawmill and tramway sites in the west forest region Victoria| first=Peter| last=Evans| publisher=Environment Australia and Natural Resources and Environment, Victoria, Environment Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; for conservation management of heritage places,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.colacotway.vic.gov.au/files/forest_crowes_mgmt_plan.pdf| title=Colac-Beech Forest-Crowes Railway Conservation Management Plan, report to the Colac Otway Shire| date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to further the investigation of domestic and spatial arrangements of isolated bush settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Peter| last=Davies| title='A little world apart...': Domestic consumption at a Victorian forest sawmill| journal=Australasian Historical Archaeology| issue=20| year=2002| pages=58–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His publications include histories of the sawmills and tramways of the [[Wombat State Forest|Wombat]] and [[Great Otway National Park|Otway]] Forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lrrsa.org.au/Nlr_Pubs.htm| website=Light Railways Research Society| title=Books from other publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been described as "...part of his substantial legacy ... of the lives led by timber-getters, road-makers, railway workers, farmers, and others in the communities that battled with the high rainfall, heavily timbered, and steep landscapes of this unique part of Victoria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.historyvictoria.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RHSV_History_News_Feb2009.pdf| title=History News| publisher=Royal Historical Society of Victoria| issue=279| date=February–March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His research has been acknowledged by the [[Australian Forest History Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foresthistory.org.au/afhsnewsletter20.pdf ''Australian Forest History Society Inc. Newsletter''20, November 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.foresthistory.org.au/afhsnewsletter20.pdf| title=Review of Houghton's ''Sawdust and Steam''| first=Rob| last=Youl| journal=Australian Forest History Society Inc. Newsletter| issue=57| date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gregg Borschmann, in the People's Forest Oral History Project,&lt;ref name=Borschmann/&gt; noted that he had:
 
:''...documented and mapped more than 300 sawmills &amp; 160 kilometres of timber tramlines built in the area since the 1850s of which ...[spending] every Sunday for 4 years in the bush; his conclusions, based on his field work experience, that there had been no real appreciation of the heritage value of forests by bulldozer drivers and current foresters, much of the archaeological remains of our non-Aboriginal forest culture had been destroyed; that the current generation of forest managers at the district level had very little knowledge of the history of their resource.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.foresthistory.org.au/afhsnewsletter51.pdf| journal=Australian Forest History Society Inc. Newsletter| issue=51| date=January 2009| page=4|title=Newsletter No. 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houghton's contribution to forestry history has been recognized in a number of recent surveys of Australian and Victorian forest history, particularly in undertaking the primary field work which has relocated the isolated bush settlements, mill sites and tramway networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Tom| last=Griffiths| title=Secrets of the forest: discovering history in Melbourne's Ash Range| publisher=Historic Places Branch, Department of Conservation and Environment, Victoria and the Monash Public History Group, Allen &amp; Unwin,| location=Leonards, NSW, Australia| year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Heather| last=McRae| title=Forest history in Victoria: a guide to government records, 1836-1994| publisher=Historic Places Section, Dept. of Conservation and Natural Resources, Victoria| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Francis Robert| last=Moulds| title=The dynamic forest: a history of forestry and forest industries in Victoria| location=Richmond, Vic.| publisher=Lynedoch Publications| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the compilation of oral histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Gall, Jennifer | title=Oral history sources for Australian forest history | publication-date=1989 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/38819049 | accessdate=14 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided a large proportion of the entries to the first annotated bibliography of forest history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Kesby| first1=Julie| last2=Frawley| first2=Kevin J.| author3=Australian Defence Force Academy| publisher=Department of Geography and Oceanography, University College, Australian Defence Force Academy| title=The forest record in Australian local and regional history: an annotated bibliography| location=Canberra| year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a co-founder of,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/9516| title=Australia's ever-changing forests: Proceedings of the First National Conference on Australian forest history| publisher=University of New South Wales, University College, Australian Defence Force Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently contributed to most of the national conferences on Australian forest history since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Australia's ever-changing forests III: Proceedings of the Third National Conference on Australian forest history| publisher=ANU Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies (CRES)| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited as a major contributor to the reinvigoration of heritage protection and tourism in forest areas through his publications and promotion of timber tramway trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Lennon, Jane | author2=Victoria.

'''Panaglide''' is a brand of [[camera stabilizer]] mounts for [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]] made by [[Panavision]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panavision.com/sites/default/files/docs/documentLibrary/1982%20Panavision%20Brochure.pdf Panavision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jukolart.us/cinematographic-systems/panavision-panaglide.html Jukolart.us]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2002/67/panavision/pages/diffusion.htm In70mm.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panaglide steadies the camera operator's movement, allowing for a smooth shot.

The Panaglide was used in such films as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', which was the first film to use the Panaglide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/2013/07/watch-test-footage-from-john-carpenters-halloween-using-steadicam-competitor-panaglide-95380/ IndieWire]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panel beater''' or '''panelbeater''' is a term used in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries to describe a person who repairs vehicle bodies back to their factory state after having been damaged (e.g., after being involved in a collision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobguide.thegoodguides.com.au/occupation/view/421311A |title=Panel Beater &amp;#124; Job Guide |publisher=Jobguide.thegoodguides.com.au |date= |accessdate=2009-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409062412/http://www.jobguide.thegoodguides.com.au/occupation/view/421311A |archivedate=2009-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, the same job is done by an '''auto body mechanic'''.

==Description==
Panel beaters repair body work using skills such as [[planishing]] and [[metalworking]] techniques, [[welding]], use of [[putty]] fillers, and other skills. Accident repair may require the panel beater to repair or replace parts of a vehicle. These parts may be made from various metals including [[steel]]s and [[alloy]]s, many different [[plastic]]s, [[fibreglass]] and others.

The common panel beater will work on everyday vehicles, cars, vans, 4WDs for example. Specialised areas include repairs to motorcycles, trucks and even aircraft. Some panel beaters also work exclusively on [[vehicle restoration]]s, and do not repair smash work at all. Others may specialise in body customisation such as is seen on hot rods etc.

Training to become a panel beater is done by completing a [[trade]] apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careers.govt.nz/default.aspx?id0=30103&amp;id1=J48345 |title=Panel Beater &amp;#124; How to get into this job |publisher= careers.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part these apprenticeships are around three 
years long, but can be completed earlier. These usually consist of three years on the job training mixed with schooling at a trade school or [[TAFE]]. The fourth year is usually on the job training alone.

Special equipment examples:

*Various hammers and dollies used for planishing.
*Body files and flippers.
*Assembly tools such as [[Socket wrench|socket]] sets, [[screwdriver]]s and [[Wrench|spanners]].
*Other hand tools like [[pliers]], [[tin snips]], [[vise grips]], [[punch (tool)|punch]]es, [[chisels]], etc.
*Hydraulic pushing/pulling devices.
*Vehicle measuring and aligning devices, or jigs e.g.
*Vehicle lift [[hoist (device)|hoist]]s.
*Personal safety equipment such as [[boots]], [[overalls]], [[safety glasses]], welding helmets, gloves, [[respirators]] and hearing protection.
*Welding equipment - [[Gas metal arc welding|MIG]] or [[Gas tungsten arc welding|TIG]].

Special equipment for restoration, advanced panel repair or panel fabrication from scratch include: 
*[[English wheel]]
*Power hammer
*Pear shaped mallets and Sandbags
*Benders/Folders
*Rollers/Rolls
*Beaders/Swaging machines
*Station bucks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panelbeater.whangarei.biz/?p=26|title=Panel Beater &amp;#124; Panel Beating History|publisher=http://panelbeater.whangarei.biz|date=|accessdate=2010-07-23}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer-to-peer ridesharing''' can be divided along the spectrum from [[Commerce|commercial]], for-fee [[transportation network company|transportation network companies]] (TNC) to for-profit ridesharing services to informal [[nonprofit]] [[peer-to-peer]] [[carpool]]ing arrangements. The term ''transportation network company'' comes from a 2013 [[California Public Utilities Commission]] ruling that decided to make the TNC [[revenue model]] legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Geron|first=Tomio|title= California Becomes First State To Regulate Ridesharing Services Lyft, Sidecar, UberX|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/09/19/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ridesharing-services-lyft-sidecar-uberx/ |publisher= Forbes |accessdate=2016-01-22|date= 9 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Yeung|first=Ken|title= California Becomes First State To Regulate Ridesharing Services Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Wingz and InstantCab|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/09/19/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ride-sharing-services/ |publisher= TheNextWeb |accessdate=2016-01-22|date= 19 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially all modern peer-to-peer ridesharing schemes rely on [[web application]] and [[mobile app]] technology.

==Terminology==
In the early 2010s, several [[transportation network company|transportation network companies]] were introduced. These were advertised as ridesharing, but dispatch drivers in a fashion similar to a [[taxi]] service, where they do not share a destination with passengers.  The first such service to appear on the market was the San Francisco–based company [[Sidecar (company)|Sidecar]] (launched in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Said|first=Carolyn|title=Ride-sharing pioneer Sidecar to shut down ride, delivery service|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Ride-sharing-pioneer-Sidecar-to-shut-down-ride-6726144.php/|work=[[SF Gate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transportation experts have called these services "ridesourcing" to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers; the app simply [[outsource]]s rides to commercial drivers.&lt;ref&gt;Rayle, L., S. Shaheen, N. Chan, D. Dai, and R. Cervero. [http://www.its.dot.gov/itspac/Dec2014/RidesourcingWhitePaper_Nov2014.pdf "App-Based, On-Demand Ride Services: Comparing Taxi and Ridesourcing Trips and User Characteristics in San Francisco"]. University of California Transportation Center, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite multiple efforts to re-name the category, it still is commonly referred to as, "ridesharing."

==Real-time peer-to-peer ridesharing==
'''Real-time ridesharing''' (also known as '''instant ridesharing''', '''dynamic ridesharing''', '''ad-hoc ridesharing''', '''on-demand ridesharing''', and '''dynamic carpooling''') is a service that arranges one-time [[Carpool|shared rides]] on very short notice.&lt;ref name=AmeyEtAl&gt;[http://ridesharechoices.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/papers/AAmey_11.4161_TRB2011_RealTimeRides_Ver1.pdf Amey, A., J. Attanucci, and R. Mishalani. "'Real-Time' Ridesharing – The Opportunities and Challenges of Utilizing Mobile Phone Technology to Improve Rideshare Services." TRB Annual Meeting, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of carpooling generally makes use of three recent technological advances:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ecosummit.net/articles/ecosummit-tv-eco11-young-future-mobility-leaders-panel Ecosummit TV – ECO11 – Young Future Mobility Leaders – Panel - ECOSUMMIT - Smart Green Economy Network and Conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GPS navigation device]]s to determine a driver's route and arrange the shared ride
* [[Smartphones]] for a traveler to request a ride from wherever they happen to be
* [[Social networks]] to establish trust and accountability between drivers and passengers

These elements are coordinated through a network service, which can instantaneously handle the driver payments and match rides using an [[optimization]] algorithm.

Like [[carpooling]], real-time ridesharing is promoted as a way to better utilize the empty seats in most passenger cars, thus lowering fuel usage and transport costs. It can serve areas not covered by a [[public transit]] system and act as a transit feeder service. Ridesharing is also capable of serving one-time trips, not only recurrent commute trips or scheduled trips.&lt;ref name="LevofskyGreenberg"&gt;[http://ridesharechoices.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/papers/GreenburgLevofsky-OrganizedDynamicRidesharing.pdf Levofsky, Amber and Allen Greenberg. "ORGANIZED DYNAMIC RIDE SHARING: THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVANCING THE CONCEPT." Transportation Research Board, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Real-time ridesharing is especially suitable for daily commuting compared to driving alone. Because such trips tend to happen at peak travel times, when traffic jams cause cars to pollute an 80% more,&lt;ref&gt;M. Treiber. [http://www.mtreiber.de/publications/fuelModel.pdf How Much does Traffic Congestion Increase Fuel Consumption and Emissions? Applying a Fuel Consumption Model to the NGSIM Trajectory Data"]. Dresden University.&lt;/ref&gt; additional benefits for the urban environment and climate change mitigation are expected by a reduction in the number of cars riding daily by the cities with a single occupant, and their related [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions.

== Potential market ==
A 2010 survey at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] found 20% of respondents willing to use real-time ridesharing at least once a week; and real-time ridesharing was more popular among current drive-alone commuters (30%) than transit or non-motorized commuters.&lt;ref name="Dynamic Ridesharing"&gt;Elizabeth Deakin, Karen Trapenberg Frick, and Kevin Shively. 2012. "[http://www.uctc.net/access/40/access40_dynamicridesharing.shtml Dynamic Ridesharing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323202207/http://www.uctc.net/access/40/access40_dynamicridesharing.shtml |date=2014-03-23 }}." Access, 40: 23-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The top obstacles to using real-time ridesharing were short trip lengths and the added time of ride logistics.&lt;ref name="Dynamic Ridesharing"/&gt;

== Implementation ==
{{primary sources|date=April 2014}}

Early real-time ridesharing projects began in the 1990s, but they faced obstacles such as the need to develop a user network and a convenient means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dynamicridesharing.org Dynamicridesharing.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually the means of arranging the ride shifted from [[telephone]] to [[internet]], [[email]], and [[smartphone]]; and user networks were developed around major employers and universities.&lt;ref name="ChanShaheen"&gt;[http://emergingridesharingsolutions.wikispaces.com/file/view/TRB11-3038.pdf Chan, Nelson and Susan Shaheen. "Ridesharing in North America: Past, Present, and Future." Transportation Research Board, 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626132446/http://emergingridesharingsolutions.wikispaces.com/file/view/TRB11-3038.pdf |date=2011-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, the goal of taxi-like responsiveness still generally eluded the industry; "next day" responsiveness was considered the state of the art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltelematics.com/pitf/FTA-dynamicRideSharingReview.pdf United States Department of Transportation. "ADVANCED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS: THE STATE OF THE ART UPDATE 2006".]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently taxi-sharing systems that accept taxi passengers’ real-time ride requests via [[smartphones]] have been proposed and studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6847170&amp;queryText%3DReal-Time+City-Scale+Taxi+Ridesharing Ma, S., Zheng, Y., Wolfson, O., "Real-Time City-Scale Taxi Ridesharing", IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, vol. 27, pp. 1782–1795, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of technology companies based in [[San Francisco]] premiered apps for real-time ridesharing (as well as ride-hailing where the driver does not share a destination with passengers) around 2012.  However, in the fall of 2012, the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] issued a [[cease and desist]] letter to rideshare companies Lyft, Uber, Wingz, and Sidecar, and fined each $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Two dynamic ridesharing pilots in [[Norway]] received government funds from [[Transnova]] in 2011. One pilot in [[Bergen]] had 31 passengers in private cars during one day. Thirty-nine users acted as drivers or passengers between June 30 and September 15 with four ridesharing episodes or more. The phone apps that was used was [[Avego]] Driver&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avego.com Avego Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; and HentMEG.no cell client,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hentmeg.no HentMEG.no website]&lt;/ref&gt; a prototype developed for the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration|NPRA]] of Norway. The other pilot is run by the company Sharepool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharepool.no/index.html Sharepool website (Norwegian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some more advanced real-time ridesharing features have been proposed but not implemented.  For example, longer trips might be facilitated using "multihop" matches in which passengers change cars to reach their final destination.

'''Plug compatible''' refers to "hardware that is designed to perform exactly like another vendor's product."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/49393/plug-compatible |title=plug-compatible |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term PCM can refer to
* '''P'''lug-'''C'''ompatible '''M'''anufacturer
* '''P'''lug-'''C'''ompatible '''M'''achine.

The term PCM was originally applied to manufacturers who made replacements for IBM peripherals.&lt;ref&gt;"Making the move into IBM-compatible peripheral products was a natural adjunct to products being developed for OEMs." {{cite newspaper   |newspaper=Computerworld
|date=August 18, 1980   |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpGNJfMmFswC
|title=Moving into IBM-compatible peripheral products}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later this term was used to refer to IBM-compatible computers.&lt;ref&gt;"plug-compatible mainframe (PCM)." {{cite newspaper |newspaper=Computerworld
|date=March 8, 1982  |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbycvi-ugq4C
|title=direct-mail company to replace IBM with PCM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PCM and Peripherals==
Before the rise of the PCM peripheral industry, computing systems were either
* configured with peripherals designed and built by the CPU vendor or
* designed to use rebadged devices selected by such vendors 

Many peripherals were originally designed to be used with a specific central processing unit (CPU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Principles of Antitrust  |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1640200827   |isbn=1640200827
|author=Herbert Hovenkamp  |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term PCM was originally applied to manufacturers who made replacements for [[IBM]] peripherals.

The first example of plug compatible IBM subsystems were tape drives and controls offered by [[Telex Communications|Telex]] beginning 1965.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pugh | title=IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems | page=233 | date=1991 | display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memorex]] in 1968 was first to enter the IBM plug-compatible disk followed shortly thereafter by a number of suppliers such as 
[[Control Data Corporation|CDC]],&lt;ref&gt;"Expected to produce $1 billion in revenues during fiscal 1980, CDC's peripherals business, advancing at 33% annually, is the fastest growing revenue producer within the company's diverse product line." {{cite newspaper  |newspaper=Computerworld  |date=August 18, 1980  |page=7  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpGNJfMmFswC
|title=CDC PCM Peripherals - $1 Billion market}}&lt;/ref&gt; Itel, and [[Storage Technology Corporation]]. This was boosted by the world's largest user of computing equipment&lt;ref&gt;"GSA has initiated a Government-wide program.to replace existing leased peripheral devices
with lower cost plug-to-plug compatible equipment offered by independent suppliers. This program was aimed at permitting competitive offers of peripherals by independent suppliers."  {{cite book 
|title=The Creative Partnership: Government and the Professional Services
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tO9pQR81nooC |date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;"... to allow the use of IBM plug-compatible peripherals on the CDC 6400, 6600 and 7600 systems installed at the LBL Computer Center. This has given the ability to replace unreliable CDC tape drives and controllers and overpriced CDC disk drives and controllers with their IBM plug-compatible counterparts." {{cite web |title=For Reference
|url=https://pubarchive.lbl.gov/islandora/object/ir%253A104692/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately plug-compatible products were offered for most peripherals and system main memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/charlesRiverAssoc/US_vs_IBM_Exhibit_14971_part_2_Jul80.pdf|title=Historical Narrative Statement of Richard B. Mancke, Franklin M. Fisher and James W. McKie, Exhibit 14971, US vs. IBM, Part 2|pages=750-796|date=July 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PCM and Computer systems==
A '''plug-compatible''' machine is one that has been designed to be [[backward compatible]] with a prior machine. In particular, a new [[computer system]] that is plug-compatible has not only the same connectors and protocol interfaces to peripherals, but also [[binary code compatibility]]—it runs the same software as the old system. A '''plug compatible manufacturer''' or '''PCM''' is a company that makes such products.

One recurring theme in plug-compatible systems is the ability to be [[bug compatible]]&lt;ref&gt;"bug-for-bug compatible. Same as bug-compatible, with the additional implication that much tedious effort went into ensuring that each (known) bug was replicated.{{cite web
|title=bug-for-bug compatible |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bug-for-bug-compatible.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well.  That is, if the forerunner system had software or interface problems, then the successor must have (or simulate) the same problems.  Otherwise, the new system may generate unpredictable results, defeating the full compatibility objective.  Thus, it is important for customers to understand the  difference between a "bug" and a "feature", where the latter is defined as an intentional modification to the previous system (e.g. higher speed, lighter weight, smaller package, better operator controls, etc.).

===PCM and IBM mainframes===
The original example of PCM mainframes was the [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl]] [[Amdahl 470|470]] [[mainframe computer]] which was plug-compatible with the [[IBM]] [[System 360]] and [[System 370|370]], costing millions of dollars to develop. An IBM customer could literally remove the 360 or 370 on Friday, install the Amdahl 470, attach the same connectors from the peripherals to the channel interfaces, and have the new mainframe up and running the same software on Sunday night. Unfortunately, system status indicators for operators of the new system were very different, which introduced a learning curve for operators and service technicians.

Similar systems were available from [[Comparex]], [[Fujitsu]]&lt;ref&gt;"LEAD: Beating I.B.M. to the punch by one day, Fujitsu Ltd. announced 
a series of computers today that ..." {{cite web   |website=NYTimes.com |title=Fujitsu Announces Mainframe
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/05/business/fujitsu-announces-mainframe.html
|date=September 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]].  Not all were large systems.&lt;ref&gt;"A 3200 system can include up to 16M bytes, with virtual memory freeing programmers from artificial memory constraints.  It can handle all major programming languages, such as Cobol, Fortran, PL/I, APL, Basic, and Assembler. The [[National CSS|NCSS]] 3200 series will range in price from $200,00 to $600,000."

For example, a plug-compatible cooling fan may need to have not only the same physical size and shape, but also similar capability, run from the same voltage, use similar power, attach with a standard electrical connector, and have similar mounting arrangements. Some non-conforming units may be re-packaged or modified to meet plug-compatible requirements, as where an adapter plate is provided for mounting, or a different tool and instructions are supplied for installation, and these modifications would be reflected in the [[bill of materials]] for such components. Similar issues arise for computer system interfaces when competitors wish to offer an easy upgrade path.

In general, plug-compatible systems are designed where industry or [[de facto standard]]s have rigorously defined the environment, and there is a large installed population of machines that can benefit from third-party enhancements. ''Plug compatible'' does not mean identical replacement. However, nothing prevents a company from developing follow-on products that are backwards compatible with its own early products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1911">A '''presentation folder''' is a kind of folder that holds loose papers or [[document]]s together for organization and protection. Presentation folders usually consist of a sheet of heavy paper stock or other thin, but stiff, material which is folded in half with pockets in order to keep paper documents. Presentation folders function much like that of a [[file folder]] for organizational purposes. They can be either printed or plain and can be used, amongst other things, as a tool for [[business]] presentations to customers to aid in the [[sales process]].

== Uses of presentation folders ==

Presentation folders come in many different styles to suit a variety of purposes. Most all are produced by a company to provide [[marketing]] for a [[product (business)]] and/or service, but they can fulfil other functions. A few examples would be a company producing a new product and wanted to show their customers all the benefits of that product in an organized fashion, or folders used to organise documents for distribution to delegates at a conference.

'''Some types of presentation folders:'''
* Standard 9" x 12" two-pocket
* Tri-fold or Tri-panel
* Capacity (usually with a 1/4"+ spine to hold more)
* [[Tabbed]] (for use in hanging files or [[filing cabinets]])
* Mini or small 
* Green or [[Eco-friendly]]

A '''printed electronic circuit''' ('''PEC''') was an ancestor of the [[hybrid integrated circuit]] (IC). PECs were common in tube (valve) equipment from the 1940s through the 1970s.

==Brands==

Couplate was the Centralab trademark, whilst Sprague called them BulPlates.  Aerovox just used the generic PEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedhtsstore.com/blogs/news/35901185-vintage-components-the-pec-a-k-a-couplate-or-bulplate |title=Vintage Components: The PEC, a.k.a. Couplate or BulPlate |publisher=The DHTS Store |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Allied Radio Catalog 150 (1956) Allied Radio Company, Chicago, pp.123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from hybrid integrated circuits==

PECs contained only resistors and capacitors arranged in circuits to simplify construction of tube equipment.  Also their voltage ratings were suitable for tubes.  Later hybrid ICs contained at least transistors and often monolithic integrated circuits.  Their voltage ratings were suitable for the transistors they contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhtechservices.com/documents/PEC_centralab_schem.pdf |title=Printed circuits |website=www.dhtechservices.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5065">'''QoS Class Identifier''' (QCI) is a mechanism used in [[3GPP]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|Long Term Evolution]] (LTE) networks to ensure bearer traffic is allocated appropriate [[Quality of service|Quality of Service]] (QoS). Different bearer traffic requires different QoS and therefore different QCI values. QCI value 9 is typically used for the default bearer of a UE/PDN for non privileged subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3GPP TS 23.203 Policy and Charging Control Architecture|url=http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23203.htm|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To ensure that bearer traffic in LTE networks is appropriately handled, a mechanism is needed to classify the different types of bearers into different classes, with each class having appropriate QoS parameters for the traffic type. Examples of the QoS parameters include Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) or non-Guaranteed Bit Rate (non-GBR), Priority Handling, Packet Delay Budget and Packet Error Loss rate. This overall mechanism is called QCI.

== Mechanism ==
The QoS concept as used in LTE networks is class-based, where each bearer type is assigned one QoS Class Identifier (QCI) by the network. The QCI is a scalar that is used within the access network (namely the [[eNodeB]]) as a reference to node specific parameters that control packet forwarding treatment, for example scheduling weight, admission thresholds and link-layer protocol configuration.

The QCI is also mapped to transport network layer parameters in the relevant [[System Architecture Evolution|Evolved Packet Core]] (EPC) core network nodes (for example, the [[System Architecture Evolution|PDN Gateway]] (P-GW), [[System Architecture Evolution|Mobility Management Entity]] (MME) and [[Policy and charging rules function|Policy and Charging Rules Function]] (PCRF)), by preconfigured QCI to [[Differentiated Services Code Point]] (DSCP) mapping. 

According to 3GPP TS 23.203, 9 QCI values in Rel-8 (13 QCIs Rel-12, 15 QCIs Rel-14) are standardized and associated with QCI characteristics in terms of packet forwarding treatment that the bearer traffic receives edge-to-edge between the [[User equipment|UE]] and the P-GW. Scheduling priority, resource type, packet delay budget and packet error loss rate are the set of characteristics defined by the 3GPP standard and they should be understood as guidelines for the pre-configuration of node specific parameters to ensure that applications/services mapped to a given QCI receive the same level of QoS in multi-vendor environments as well as in roaming scenarios. The QCI characteristics are not signalled on any interface.

The following table illustrates the standardized characteristics as defined in the 3GPP TS 23.203 standard "Policy and Charging Control Architecture".

|-
| 7 || non-GBR || 7 || 100ms || 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; || Voice, Video (Live Streaming), Interactive Gaming
|-
| 8 || non-GBR || 8 || 300ms || 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; || Video (Buffered Streaming) TCP-Based (for example, www, email, chat, ftp, p2p and the like)
|-
| 9 || non-GBR || 9 || 300ms || 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; || Video (Buffered Streaming) TCP-Based (for example, www, email, chat, ftp, p2p and the like). Typically used as default bearer 
|-
| 69 || non-GBR || 0.5 || 60ms || 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; || Mission Critical delay sensitive signalling (e.g., MC-PTT signalling)
|-
| 70 || non-GBR || 5.5 || 200ms || 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; || Mission Critical Data (e.g. example services are the same as QCI 6/8/9)
|-
| 79 || non-GBR || 6.5 || 50ms || 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; || V2X messages
|}

Every QCI (GBR and Non-GBR) is associated with a Priority level. Priority level 0.5 is the highest Priority level. If congestion is encountered, the lowest Priority level traffic would be the first to be discarded.

QCI-65, QCI-66, QCI-69 and QCI-70 were introduced in 3GPP TS 23.203 Rel-12.

QCI-75 and QCI-79 were introduced in 3GPP TS 23.203 Rel-14.

== History ==
Quantapoint was founded as ''K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;T'', Inc&lt;ref name="K2T"/&gt; (or ''K2T'') in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1991 by Eric Hoffman,&lt;ref name="Management"/&gt; [[Pradeep Khosla]], [[Takeo Kanade]] and other  [[Carnegie Mellon University]] faculty members.  ''K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;T'' focused on creating custom robotics and 3D range-finding imaging systems to help them navigate complex environments.  The most notable are the laser range-finding system created in 1992 for the [[History of robots|DANTE walking robot]] that explored [[Mount Erebus]] in [[Antarctica]] as part of a [[NASA]] sponsored competition &lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;[http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub2/wettergreen_david_1993_2/wettergreen_david_1993_2.pdf Exploring Mount Erebus by Walking Robot]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 360-degree phase-based 3D laser scanner named SceneModeler created in 1997.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantapoint.com/qp/history|title=History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company name was changed to Quantapoint in 1999 to reflect the focus on 3D laser scanning hardware, software and services.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[File:AK-L-W-03-62-16A.jpg|thumb|Radar [[wind profiler]] and RASS at the [[Alaska North Slope]] site in [[Barrow, Alaska]]]]
A '''radio acoustic sounding system''' ('''RASS''') is a system for measuring the atmospheric [[lapse rate]] using [[backscatter]]ing of  [[radio]] waves from an [[Acoustics|acoustic]] wave front to measure the [[speed of sound]] at various heights above the ground. This is possible because the compression and rarefaction of air by an acoustic wave changes the [[dielectric]] properties, producing partial reflection of the transmitted [[radar]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avouris | first = Nicholas | title = Environmental Informatics | publisher = Kluwer Academic | location = City | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-7923-3445-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the speed of sound, the temperature of the air in the [[planetary boundary layer]] can be computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The maximum [[altitude]] range of RASS systems is typically 750 meters, although observations have been reported up to 1.2&amp;nbsp;km in moist air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaimal | first = J. | title = Atmospheric Boundary Layer Flows | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1994 |pages = 245 | isbn = 0-19-506239-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==

The principle of operation behind RASS is as follows: [[Bragg's law|Bragg scattering]] occurs when [[Acoustics|acoustic]] energy (i.e., sound) is transmitted into the vertical beam of a [[radar]] such that the [[wavelength]] of the acoustic signal matches the half-wavelength of the radar. As the frequency of the acoustic signal is varied, strongly enhanced scattering of the radar signal occurs when the Bragg match takes place. 

When this occurs, the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] of the radar signal produced by the Bragg scattering can be determined, as well as the atmospheric vertical velocity. Thus, the speed of sound as a function of altitude can be measured, from which [[virtual temperature]] (TV) profiles can be calculated with appropriate corrections for vertical air motion. The virtual temperature of an air parcel is the temperature that dry air would have if its pressure and density were equal to
those of a sample of moist air. As a rule of thumb, an atmospheric vertical velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s can alter a TV observation by 1.6°C.

== Configurations ==

RASS can be added to a radar [[wind profiler]] or to a [[sodar]] system. In the former case, the necessary acoustic subsystems must be added to the radar wind profiler to generate the sound signals and to perform signal processing. When RASS is added to a radar profiler, three or four vertically pointing acoustic sources (equivalent to high quality stereo loud speakers) are placed around the radar wind profiler's antenna, and electronic subsystems are added that include the acoustic power amplifier and the signal generating circuit boards. The acoustic sources are used only to transmit sound into the vertical beam of the radar, and are usually encased in noise suppression enclosures to minimize nuisance effects that may bother nearby neighbors or others in the vicinity of the instrument.

When RASS is added to a sodar, the necessary radar subsystems are added to transmit and receive the radar signals and to process the radar reflectivity information. Since the wind data are obtained by the sodar, the radar only needs to sample along the vertical axis. The sodar transducers are used to transmit the acoustic signals that produce the Bragg scattering of the radar signals, which allows the speed of sound to be measured by the radar.

== Resolution ==

The vertical resolution of RASS data is determined by the pulse length(s) used by the radar. RASS sampling is usually performed with a 60 to 100 meter pulse length. Because of atmospheric attenuation of the acoustic signals at the RASS frequencies used by boundary layer radar wind profilers, the altitude range that can be sampled is usually 0.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;km, depending on atmospheric conditions (e.g., high wind velocities tend to limit RASS altitude coverage to a few hundred meters because the acoustic signals are blown out of the radar beam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Bailey

'''Roger &amp; Gallet''' (also '''Roger et Gallet''') is a [[France|French]] [[perfume]] [[company]] founded by merchant [[Charles Armand Roger]] and banker [[Charles Martial Gallet]] in 1862. They purchased a [[Paris|Parisian]] perfumery business founded in 1806 by Jean Marie Joseph Farina, grand-grand-nephew of [[Johann Maria Farina|Giovanni Maria Farina]], the creator of [[Eau de Cologne]]. Roger &amp; Gallet then won a legal dispute over the right to use the Farina family name, and the company now owns the rights to ''Eau de Cologne extra vieille'', in contrast to the ''Original Eau de Cologne'' from [[Cologne]]. 

Roger &amp; Gallet specialized in [[Soap|toilet soap]] which was produced in a large factory near Paris. The company made a name for itself with its luxurious bath soaps, which in 1879 first appeared in their signature round shape, with the crinkled silk paper and seal, still in use today. Later, they proved successful with the newly synthesized fragrance of [[Viola odorata|violet]], for which they held the French rights, producing perfumes such as ''[[Vera Violetta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Beauty Imagined|year=2010|author=Geoffrey Jones|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-160961-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Roger &amp; Gallet was acquired by the [[Sanofi|Sanofi Group]], who in turn sold the brand to [[Gucci]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-11-16/business/9911150732_1_yves-saint-networking-products-gucci|title=Gucci Will Buy Sanofi, Yves Saint Laurent Owner|last=|first=|date=|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=2018-05-27|publication-date=November 16, 1999|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oreal acquired Roger &amp; Gallet from Gucci, a subsidiary at that time of [[Pinault Printemps Redoute|PPR]], in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/ppr-l-oreal-complete-ysl-deal-1022296/|title=PPR, L’Oreal Complete YSL Deal|last=Staff|first=WWD|date=2008-05-01|work=WWD|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Segway PT''' (originally '''Segway HT''') is a [[Dicycle (vehicle)|two-wheeled]], self-balancing [[personal transporter]] by [[Segway Inc.]] Invented by [[Dean Kamen]] and brought to market in 2001. ''HT'' is an initialism for 'human transporter' and ''PT'' for 'personal transporter'.

==History==
===Independent company===
The Segway PT (referred to at the time as the Segway HT) was developed from the self-balancing [[iBOT]] wheelchair which was initially developed at [[University of Plymouth]], in conjunction with [[BAE Systems]] and [[Sumitomo Precision Products]].&lt;ref name=Ginger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemper|first1=Steve|title=Code name Ginger : the story behind segway and Dean Kamen's quest to invent a new world|date=2003|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9781578516735|page=27|accessdate=23 June 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BG7YLR8aWcC&amp;q=iBot#v=snippet&amp;q=fred%20upstairs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segway's first patent was filed in 1994 and granted in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|5701965|US patent 5,701,965 Human transporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segway.com/patents.pdf|title=Segway Patent Information|publisher=Segway Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including one submitted in June 1999 and granted in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|6302230|US Patent 6,302,230 Personal mobility vehicles and methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention, development, and financing of the Segway was the subject of a book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing the Wheel: A Story of Genius, Innovation, and Grand Ambition|isbn=1578516730|year=2003|first=Steve | last=Kemper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a leak of information prior to publication of the book and the launch of the product led to excited speculation about the device and its importance. [[John Doerr]] speculated that it would be more important than the Internet.&lt;ref name="time2001"/&gt; ''[[South Park]]'' devoted an [[The Entity (South Park)|episode]] to making fun of the hype before the product was released. [[Steve Jobs]] was quoted as saying that it was "as big a deal as the PC",&lt;ref name="time2001"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,186660-1,00.html |title=Reinventing the Wheel |work=TIME |date=2 December 2001 |accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but later retracted that saying that it "sucked", presumably referring to "the design" but commenting about the [[boutique price]], asking, "You're ''sure'' your market is upscale consumers for transportation?")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3533.html | title=Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos meet "Ginger" | first=Steve | last=Kemper | publisher=Harvard Business School Working Knowledge | date=16 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was unveiled 3 December 2001, following months of public speculation,&lt;ref name="speculation"&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.cc.com/events/month-of-zen/live.html |title=January 26, 2000 |series=[[The Daily Show]] |date=26 July 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702125349/http://www.cc.com/events/month-of-zen/live.html |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bryant Park]], [[New York City]], on the ABC News morning program ''[[Good Morning America]]''&lt;ref name=Machrone&gt;{{cite web|last=Machrone |first=Bill |url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,97229,00.asp |title=Ginger Unveiled-It's a Scooter! |publisher=Extremetech.com |date=3 December 2001 |accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled |title=Wired.com retrospective |accessdate=2009-04-12 | first=Dylan |last=Tweney}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first units delivered to customers in early 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segway.com/about-segway/segway-milestones.php |title=About Segway - Who We Are - Segway Milestones |publisher=Segway |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318154531/http://www.segway.com/about-segway/segway-milestones.php |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Segway models were activated for three different speed settings:  {{convert|6|mph|km/h}}, {{convert|8|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with faster turning and {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Segway, Official Site"/&gt; Steering of early versions was controlled using a [[twist grip]] that varied the speeds of the two motors. The range of the  p-Series was {{convert|6|-|10|mi|abbr=on}} on a fully charged nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery with a recharge time of 4–6&amp;nbsp;hours. In September 2003, the Segway PT was recalled, because if users ignored repeated low battery warnings on the PTs, it could ultimately lead them to fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml03/03553.html |title=Segway LLC Recall to Upgrade Software on Segway Human Transporters |publisher=Cpsc.gov |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922233555/https://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml03/03553.html |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a software patch to version 12.0, the PT would automatically slow down and stop in response to detecting low battery power.

In August 2006 Segway discontinued all previous models and introduced the i2 and x2 products which were steered by leaning the handlebars to the right or left,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segway.com/personal-transporter/model_i2.html |title=Segway i2 |publisher=Segway.com |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107194400/http://segway.com/personal-transporter/model_i2.html |archivedate=7 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; had a maximum speed of {{convert|12.5|mph|abbr=on}} from a pair of {{convert|2|hp}} [[Brushless DC electric motor]] with [[regenerative braking]] and a range of up to {{convert|15|-|25|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on terrain, riding style and state of the batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segway.com/segway/lithium_ion.html |title=Enhanced range, courtesy of lithium-ion|accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017090302/http://www.segway.com/segway/lithium_ion.html |archivedate=17 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recharging took 8–10&amp;nbsp;hours. The i2 and x2 also introduced the wireless InfoKey which could show mileage and a trip odometer, as well as put the Segway into Security mode, which locked the wheels and set off an alarm if it was moved, and could also be used to turn on the PT from up to {{convert|15|ft|m}} away.&lt;ref name="Segway, Official Site"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segway.com/business/products-solutions/i2.php |title=Segway, Official Site |publisher=Segway.com |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027235058/http://www.segway.com/business/products-solutions/i2.php |archivedate=27 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The dynamics of the Segway PT are similar to a classic control problem, the [[inverted pendulum]]. It  uses [[brushless DC electric motor]]s in each wheel powered by [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] with balance achieved using [[tilt sensor]]s, and [[gyroscopic sensor]]s developed by [[BAE Systems]]' [[Marconi Research Centre|Advanced Technology Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segway-madrid.com/aboutus/press_releases/pr_072202.html|title=Segway - About Us - Press Releases - BAE SYSTEMS and Segway LLC Announce Partnership to Market Segway Human Transporter in the UK - 22 Jul 2002|work=segway-madrid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheels are driven forward or backward as needed to return its pitch to upright.

'''Smart traffic lights''' or '''Intelligent traffic lights''' are a [[vehicle]] [[traffic]] [[traffic control|control]] system that combines traditional [[traffic lights]] with an array of sensors and [[artificial intelligence]] to intelligently route vehicle and [[pedestrian]] traffic.&lt;ref name="pittsburgh"/&gt;

== Research  ==
A technology for smart traffic signals has been developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and is being used in a pilot project in Pittsburgh in an effort to reduce vehicle emissions in the city. Unlike other dynamic control signals that adjust the timing and phasing of lights according to limits that are set in controller programming, this system combines existing technology with artificial intelligence.

The signals communicate with each other and adapt to changing traffic conditions to reduce the amount of time that cars spend idling. Using fiber optic video receivers similar to those already employed in dynamic control systems, the new technology monitors vehicle numbers and makes changes in real time to avoid congestion wherever possible. Initial results from the pilot study are encouraging: the amount of time that motorists spent idling at lights was reduced by 40% and travel times across the city were reduced by 25% &lt;ref name="SchIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiomax.com/team/xie/schic/ |title=Smart and Scalable Urban Signal Networks |accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Possible Benefits ==
Companies involved in developing smart traffic management systems include [[BMW]] and [[Siemens]],&lt;ref name="trafficmanagement"/&gt; who unveiled their system of networked lights in 2010. This system works with the anti-idling technology that many cars are equipped with, to warn them of impending light changes. This should help cars that feature anti-idling systems to use them more intelligently, and the information that networks receive from the cars should help them to adjust light cycling times to make them more efficient.

A new patent appearing March 1st, 2016 by John F. Hart Jr. is for a "Smart" traffic control system that "sees" traffic approaching the intersections and reacts according to what is needed to keep the flow of vehicles at the most efficient rate.  By anticipating the needs of the approaching vehicles, as opposed to reacting to them after they arrive and stop, this system has the potential to save motorist time while cutting down harmful emissions.

Romanian and US research teams believe that the time spent by motorists waiting for lights to change could be reduced by over 28% with the introduction of smart traffic lights and that [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions could be cut by as much as 6.5%.&lt;ref name="co2emissions"/&gt;

A major use of Smart traffic lights could be as part of public transport systems.  The signals can be set up to sense the approach of buses or trams and change the signals in their favour, thus improving the speed and efficiency of [[sustainable transport]] modes.

== Obstacles to widespread introduction ==
The main stumbling block to the widespread introduction of such systems is the fact that most vehicles on the road are unable to communicate with the computer systems that town and city authorities use to control traffic lights. However, the trial in Harris County, Texas, referred to above, uses a simple system based on signals received from drivers' cell phones and it has found that even if only a few drivers have their phone switched on, the system is still able to produce reliable data on traffic density. 
Results from simulations, where an algorithm was applied to control traffic lights from driver mobile phone positions, showed that a 30% of drivers having the system would be enough to benefit also drivers that are not using the system (reduced travel times).&lt;ref name="cooperativetrafficlights"/&gt;
This means that the adoption of smart traffic lights around the world could be started as soon as a reasonable minority of vehicles were fitted with the technology to communicate with the computers that control the signals rather than having to wait until the majority of cars had such technology.

== Simpler systems ==
Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, lights that change to red when sensing that an approaching motorist is traveling too fast are being trialled in Swindon&lt;ref name="swindon"/&gt; to see if they are more effective at reducing the number of accidents on the road than the speed cameras that preceded them and which were removed following a council decision in 2008.&lt;ref name="council"/&gt; These lights are more focused on encouraging motorists to obey the law but if they prove to be a success then they could pave the way for more sophisticated systems to be introduced in the UK.

== Previous research ==
In addition to the findings of the Romanian and US researchers mentioned above, scientists in Dresden, Germany came to the conclusion that smart traffic lights could handle their task more efficiently without human interface.&lt;ref name="humaninterference"/&gt;

Many people have started to use '''suspended athletic courts''' to cover old athletic courts like [[tennis court]]s and [[basketball court]]s. The surfaces have been approved for play by the USTA ([[United States Tennis Association]]). Most outdoor athletic courts in the U.S.A. are made of [[asphalt]], [[blacktop]] or [[concrete]] where the stress to the player’s body is maximized because of the surface's hardness.

When a suspended court surface is installed over a hard surface, such as concrete, it can reduce the stress as well as hide cracks and reduce the impact of birdbaths or puddles on the court.  Orthopedic specialists agree that these suspended courts are the healthiest and safest outdoors court sports surfaces for tennis and basketball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://s3.amazonaws.com/leulymedia/sportcourt/635304220527490976/safetypowergamesportcourt.pdf / TOSH–The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the tile products are injection molded [[Injection molding]] of polypropylene plastic and measure between 25&amp;nbsp;cm and 12" square, with thickness heights ranging from 1/2" to 3/4".

These suspended athletic court are available in many colors and can be configured to fit any size space.  They have become particularly popular with homeowners wanting small or full size backyard multi-sport [[Game court|gamecourts]]. The most popular court sports played are tennis, basketball, volleyball and [[Futsal]].

Many municipalities are also recognizing the benefits of resurfacing tennis and basketball courts with modular sports tile because it needs little to no maintenance and typically lasts 25 years or more.

==Manufacturers==
While there are many companies that manufacture suspended courts, some of the better known brands include:

'''Sustainable Harvest International''' (SHI) is a [[non-profit]] organization, based in the [[United States]], that addresses the [[tropical deforestation]] crisis in [[Central America]] and provides farmers with sustainable alternatives to [[slash-and-burn agriculture]]. SHI is dedicated to working with farming communities in [[Honduras]], [[Belize]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]] to overcome [[poverty]] and restore [[tropical forest]]s in these nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Lorenz |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080222/LIFE/802220307/-1/life |title=UNH's Peace Corps rank on the rise |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Dave |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-03-29-volunteer-tourism_N.htm |title='Voluntourism' vacations taking off |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/volunteer-vacations-become-popular-20081113-62gv.html |title=Volunteer vacations become popular |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i39aca7c440d50caaf87ff247eb267cdd |title=C.H.

SHI was founded in 1997 by Florence Reed, who discovered first-hand the consequences of tropical deforestation while serving as a [[Peace Corps]] volunteer in Panamá in the early 1990s.

Following completion of her Peace Corps service, Reed sought to bring about significant and permanent change throughout Central America. She met with a group of villages in Honduras that desired to implement [[Sustainable development|sustainable techniques]]. Reed then promoted the project to an interested group of people that included university professors, small business owners, and non-profit executives. In May 1997, this group formed a Board of Directors and Sustainable Harvest International was incorporated as a nonprofit, [[501(c)(3)]] organization.

Since its inception, SHI has expanded its reach beyond a single program in Honduras, and now includes programs in Panamá, Belize and Nicaragua. SHI has also established La Fundacion Cosecha Sostenible Honduras (the Sustainable Harvest Honduras Foundation) as an independent affiliate which, following a transition period, has become responsible for its own management and funding.

A primary objective of SHI is to facilitate implementation of a program that allows poor farmers to take responsibility for reversing [[environmental degradation]] and achieving economic viability within their own neighborhoods and countries.

==Smaller World Program==
SHI launched the Smaller World Program with the aim of increasing cultural understanding and empowering the global community to create a more equitable and sustainable world. The program creates direct connections between groups and individuals who support SHI's work and the communities it serves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''TREX''' is a search engine in the [[NetWeaver|SAP NetWeaver]] integrated technology platform produced by [[SAP SE]] using [[columnar storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/abadi-column-stores.pdf|doi=10.1561/1900000024|title=The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems|author1=Daniel Abadi|author2=Peter Boncz|author3=Stavros Harizopoulos|author4=Stratos Idreos|author5=Samuel Madden|journal=Foundations and Trends in Databases|volume=5|issue=3|year=2012|pages=197–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TREX engine is a standalone component that can be used in a range of system environments but is used primarily as an integral part of SAP products such as Enterprise Portal, Knowledge Warehouse, and '''Business Intelligence (BI, formerly [[SAP Business Information Warehouse]]).''' In SAP NetWeaver BI, the TREX engine powers the BI Accelerator, which is a plug-in appliance for enhancing the performance of [[online analytical processing]]. The name "TREX" stands for '''Text Retrieval and information EXtraction''', but it is not a registered trademark of SAP and is not used in marketing collateral.

==Search functions==

TREX supports various kinds of text search, including exact search, boolean search, wildcard search, linguistic search (grammatical variants are normalized for the index search) and fuzzy search (input strings that differ by a few letters from an index term are normalized for the index search). Result sets are ranked using term frequency-inverse document frequency ([[tf-idf]]) weighting, and results can include snippets with the search terms highlighted.

TREX supports text mining and classification using a [[vector space model]]. Groups of documents can be classified using query based classification, example based classification, or a combination of these plus keyword management.

TREX supports structured data search not only for document metadata but also for mass business data and data in SAP [[Business Objects]]. Indexes for structured data are implemented compactly using [[data compression]] and the data can be aggregated in linear time, to enable large volumes of data to be processed entirely in memory.

Recent developments include:
* A join engine to join structured data from different fields in business objects
* A fast update capability to write a delta index beside a main index and to merge them offline while a second delta index takes updates
* A [[data mining]] feature pack for advanced mathematical analysis

==History==

The first code for the engine was written in 1998 and TREX became an SAP component in 2000. The SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator was first rolled out in 2005. As of Q1 2013, the current release of TREX is SAP NW 7.1.

== Security ==
A security vulnerability in TREX was first identified and fixed in 2015 (see SAP Security Note [https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2234226 2234226])[https://www.scmagazineuk.com/bugs-in-sap-hana-allowed-remote-code-execution/article/530856/]. The vulnerability occurred due to lack of authentication in TREXnet, an internal communication protocol. The aforementioned patch fixed the problem by removing some critical functionality.

Later on, ERPScan head of threat intelligence Mathieu Geli continued to look into the vulnerability and found that the vulnerability was still exploitable [https://erpscan.com/press-center/press-release/critical-vulnerability-affects-sap-hana-dozen-sap-applications/]. Moreover, in case of successful attack, the vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to get full control over the server without authorization [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/13/sap_trex_patch/]. The vulnerability has been finally patched via SAP Security Note 2419592.

'''Thai ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Thai art]]. The tradition of Thai ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=61|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Thai pottery and ceramics in the later centuries was influenced by [[Chinese ceramics]], but has always remained distinct by mixing indigenous styles with preferences for unique shapes, colors and decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt;  Thai pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Thai and its neighbors during feudalistic times, throughout many dynasties.

Thai ceramics show a continuous development through different clay types and methods of manufacturing since the prehistoric period and are one of the most common Thai art forms. The first type of Thai ceramics ever recorded was the Ban Chiang, dating back to about 3600 BCE. [[Sukhothai style|Sukhothai]] ware, the most famous style of Thai ceramics, is exported to many countries around the world today.

Medieval Thai wares were especially influenced by Chinese [[celadon]]s, and later by [[blue and white porcelain]].  

==History==
[[File:Museum für Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 056.jpg|thumb|Painted ceramic bowl with base, Lopburi 2300 BCE. Bang Chiang culture.]]

The earliest trace of Thai ceramics ever recorded is the [[Ban Chiang (archaeological site)|Ban Chiang]], said to date back to about 3600 BCE and found in what is the present day [[Udon Thani Province]], [[Thailand]]. The ceramics were [[earthenware]]. Common forms of excavated artifacts were cylinders and round vases. The early pots were undecorated while the later ones were carved with geometric patterns and swirling designs. Each of the pieces was also found to have axial perforations which showed that people at that time had knowledge of using tools.  

The second important prehistoric Thai ceramics is the Ban Kao which was in Kanchanburi Province. Unlike Ban Chiang, Ban Kao's wares were thinner and had a glossy surface finish. What is interesting is that there are a wide range of forms and shapes, some of which are similar to bronze wares of Han China.  After the prehistoric period the kingdom that emerged at about 1st century CE was the [[Mons]].  They made considerable ceramics uses in relation to religious symbols in the form of figurines. Ceramics were also used as a building decorations. 

Following the Mons were the [[Khmers]] who appeared in about the 9th century CE Little is known about Khmer ceramics because archaeological research has focused on their great achievements in stone and bronze sculpture. The ceramics of Khmer era are quite interesting. Many of the designs include parts from animal and have a dark brown glaze finish.   

The best known of all traditional Thai ceramics are those from [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and [[Sawankhalok]]. Sukhothai wares were generally treated with a creamy white slip and decorated in black with an opaque or greenish glaze. The most famous Sukhothai kiln is the Si Satchanalai. Examples of the wares can be found in many leading museums of the world. Sawankhalok products tend to be more finely made than the Sukhothai ones. These products are incised and often include animal shapes. Some of the original examples can be found in many private collections and museums today. Ceramics based on these styles are still made at present and widely exported, particularly to the Philippines and Indonesia.

===Si Satchanalai===
[[File:British Museum Asia 1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Box with a lid. Si Satchanalai, 13th-14th century]]
One of the most famous examples of Thai pottery are from the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] period from the kilns of S(r)i Satchanalai, which is around Sawankalok in north-central Thailand. This period started in the 13th century CE and continued until the 16th century. The art reached its apex in the 14th century. Examples of Si Satchanalai can be found in many leading museums of the world.

Sukothai traded with these precious ceramics with its neighbours. The transport was often by ship across the oceans. A number of Si Satchanalai ceramics in excellent condition have been excavated in [[ship wreck]]s in the [[Gulf of Thailand]], the [[Andaman Sea]] and other waters.

==18th century to present day==
[[Bangkok]], the capital of Thailand, was founded in 1782 and is represented by the Bencharong and Lai Nam Thong wares. It would seem that Bencharong ceramics first made their appearance during the final phases of the Ayutthaya period in the 18th century, while the Lai Nam Thong wares developed during the 19th century. Bencharong, meaning five colours in Thai, is a hand painted enamel over glazed ceramic. Bencharong was originally made in China and exclusively designed by Thai artists for Thai royals during the 18th – 19th centuries. Lai Nam Thong is an exclusive version of the Bencharong using gold embellishment instead of gold enamel. Both of these wares can be found in private collections of well-to-do citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?sec=10&amp;id=17630 "History in five colors : asianewsnet"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708201604/http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?sec=10&amp;id=17630 |date=July 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum]] was opened in 2005 in Bangkok.

'''William Samuel Henson''' (3 May 1812 &amp;ndash; 22 March 1888) was a pre-[[Wright brothers]] aviation engineer and inventor.

==Biography==
Henson was born in [[Nottingham]], England on 3 May 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Henson's personal journal, from Henson &amp; Stringfellow, Aeronautical Pioneers, published 1943(?)  Original preserved at the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences in the US&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freereg.rootsweb.com/cgi/SearchResults.pl?RecordType=Baptisms&amp;RecordID=5243522 FreeReg, transcription of baptism record] Some sources incorrectly say 1805&lt;/ref&gt; Henson was involved in [[lace-making]] in [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Samuel Henson|url=http://aerosocietyheritage.com/biographies/william-samuel-henson|publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he obtained a patent on improved lace-making machines in 1835.  Henson is best known as an early pioneer in aviation, but patented many other inventions, some of which are in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waits|first1=Robert K.|title=A Safety Razor Compendium: The Book|date=2014|publisher=Lulu|isbn=9781312293533|page=143|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4oX3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=William+Samuel+Henson+patent+inventions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dPYl93Bpez&amp;sig=bE__mHd2uO0jQf8YWIQXbTTkyQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwjWk5iY8eLIAhVCWD4KHR0-Dkw#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Samuel%20Henson%20patent%20inventions&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1849 William Henson and his wife, Sarah, left England and moved to the United States, joining his father and settling in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Henson never did any further aviation research while in the United States and worked as a [[machinist]], civil engineer and inventor.&lt;ref&gt;US Census records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aeronautics, Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society, issue circa 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  He had 7 children, only 4 of whom lived to adulthood.

Henson died on 22 March 1888 in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He and most of his family were buried in [[Rosedale Cemetery]] in [[Orange, New Jersey]].

==Aeronautical inventions==
Starting c. 1838, Henson became interested in aviation.  In April 1841 he patented an improved lightweight [[steam engine]], and with fellow lacemaking-engineer [[John Stringfellow]] in c. 1842 he designed a large passenger-carrying steam-powered [[monoplane]], with a [[wing span]] of 150 feet, which he named the "Henson [[Aerial Steam Carriage]]". He received a patent on it in 1843 along with Stringfellow.
[[File:1843 engraving of the Aerial Steam Carriage.jpg|thumb|1843 engraving of the Aerial Steam Carriage]]
Henson, Stringfellow, Frederick Marriott, and D.E. Colombine, incorporated as the '''Aerial Transit Company''' in 1843 in England, with the intention of raising money to construct the flying machine. Henson built a scale model of his design, which made one tentative steam-powered "hop" as it lifted, or bounced, off its guide wire. Attempts were made to fly the small model, and a larger model with a 20-foot wing span, between 1844 and 1847, without success.

Henson grew discouraged, married and [[emigrated]] in 1849 to the United States, while Stringfellow continued to experiment with aviation.

Henson appeared as a character in a [[The Balloon-Hoax|fictional newspaper story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], which recounted a supposed [[Transatlantic flight|trans-Atlantic]] balloon trip, in which Henson was one of the passengers on the [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Allan Poe]], [http://www.poestories.com/text.php?file=balloonhoax Balloon Hoax], New York Sun, 1844&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson and Stringfellow are frequently mentioned in books on the history of aviation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22william+samuel+henson%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google book search for William Samuel Henson]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] holds annual "Henson-Stringfellow" lectures; as of 2008 they have held 52.   A [[glacier]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after him due to his work in aviation ([[Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles/Antarctica/H3|Henson Glacier]]: 64'06'S, 60'11'W&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=109277 Henson Glacier)]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Henson and Stringfellow were referred to in the 1965 film ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]''.

===Aerial Design===
The Aerial's wings were rectangular, and were formed by wooden spars covered with fabric, and braced, internally and externally, with wires. The Aerial Steam Carriage was to be powered by two [[contra-rotating]] six-bladed [[propellers]] mounted in the rear in a push-type system. The design follows earlier "birdlike" [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]]s, and the ideas of [[George Cayley]], and Henson corresponded with Cayley in an attempt to obtain funding after the efforts to obtain the support of [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and sell [[stock]] failed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/b/OL21252813M/Henson_and_Stringfellow "Henson and StringFellow"], M. J. B. Davy, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; The Aerial Transit Company never built the largest version of the Aerial Steam Carriage because of the failed attempts with the medium-sized model. Henson, Stringfellow, Marriott and Colombine [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]] the company around 1848.

===Advertising===
The Aerial Transit Company's publicist, [[Frederick Marriott]], commissioned prints in 1843 depicting the Aerial Steam Carriage over the [[pyramids of Egypt]], in [[India]], and over London, England, and other places, which drew considerable interest from the public.  The prints have appeared on several stamps of various countries.  Marriott later became an aviation pioneer in [[California]].

==Other inventions and innovations==
Henson obtained a number of patents in widely varying areas.  Major patents include:
* Lace-making decoration, 1835
* Lightweight steam engines, 1841
* Flying machine, 1843
* T-handled [[safety razor]], 1847

Henson invented the modern form of the razor, the 'T' shaped safety razor, and patented it in 1847: "the cutting blade of which is at right angles with the handle, and resembles somewhat the form of a common hoe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.razorandbrush.com/perkam.html Origins of the Safety Razor]&lt;/ref&gt;  While a major improvement on the previous form of safety razor, an additional improvement was needed to make safety razors common.  In 1901, [[King Camp Gillette|Gillette]] combined Henson's T-shaped safety razor with disposable blades, and produced the modern razor.&lt;ref&gt;The Origins of Everyday Things (book)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson published a pamphlet on [[astronomy]] in 1871 suggesting that the [[solar system]] formed from cold dust and [[gas]], and discussed how it could condense into [[meteor]]s and [[comet]]s, and further condense into [[planet]]s, [[moon]]s and the [[sun]], in the process heating up.  He also discusses how this would lead to the planets orbiting in the [[ecliptic]] and rotating in the same general plane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wUCAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;ots=Q9frUujKhz&amp;dq=%22the%20great%20facts%20of%20modern%20astronomy%22&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20great%20facts%20of%20modern%20astronomy%22&amp;f=false The Medical Eclectic], 1874 issue, book review of "THE GREAT FACTS OF MODERN ASTRONOMY"&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson created inventions in other areas as well. Among them were [[ice-making machine]]s (1870), fabric [[waterproofing]], and [[cistern]]-cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flysouth.co.za/prime/history/flights_of_fancy.shtml Fly South Aviation History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118014446/http://www.flysouth.co.za/prime/history/flights_of_fancy.shtml |date=2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He patented and submitted a proposal for an improved low-[[recoil]] [[Breechloader|breech-loading]] [[cannon]] design to the [[US Navy]] in 1861; it was rejected as impractical.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;Henson family documents in the Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum archives and the [[Library of Congress]] AIAA collection&lt;/ref&gt;
