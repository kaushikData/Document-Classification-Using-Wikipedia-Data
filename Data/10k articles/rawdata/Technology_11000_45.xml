'''Artisan Sound Recorders''' was one of Southern California's premier disk [[Audio mastering|mastering]] facilities. It was founded by Robert M. MacLeod Jr. in the 1960s and acquired by Kent Duncan in 1979 when MacLeod retired. In the early 1990s it was sold to Jon Lowry and the mainly mastering operation ceased operation. Hit records by [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony|Bone Thugs]] in Harmony, Eminem, John B continues after 1993.

More than 500 Gold &amp; Platinum recordings were mastered at Artisan. Its engineering staff was known for meticulous attention to detail in the tape to disk transfer. Later was known for recording and mixing many Hits and great records.
Artisan's engineering staff included Bob MacLeod, [[John Golden]], Kevin Gray, Jo Hansch, Jon Lowry, and Aaron Connor.

[[File:2008-07-01 Elko ASOS viewed from the south cropped.jpg|thumb|An ASOS data collection platform]]

'''Automated airport weather stations''' are automated [[sensor]] suites which are designed to serve [[aviation]] and [[meteorology|meteorological]] observing needs for safe and efficient aviation operations, [[weather forecasting]] and [[climatology]]. [[Automatic weather station|Automated]] [[airport]] [[weather station]]s have become part of the backbone of [[weather]] observing in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and are becoming increasingly more prevalent worldwide due to their efficiency and cost-savings.

==System types within the United States==
In the United States, there are several varieties of automated weather stations that have somewhat subtle but important differences. These include the '''Automated Weather Observing System''' ('''AWOS''') and the '''Automated Surface Observing System''' ('''ASOS''').

===Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS)===
[[File:2008-07-09 Eureka Airport AWOS viewed from the south cropped.jpg|thumb|A commercial AWOS]]

The '''Automated Weather Observing System''' (AWOS) units are mostly operated, maintained and controlled by state or local governments and other non-Federal entities and are certified under the FAA Non-Federal AWOS Program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/150_5220-16&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA completed an upgrade of the 230 FAA owned AWOS and former Automated Weather Sensor Systems (AWSS) systems to the AWOS-C configuration in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/weather/asos/&lt;/ref&gt;. The AWOS-C is the most up-to-date FAA owned AWOS facility and can generate METAR/SPECI formatted Aviation Weather Reports. The AWOS-C is functionally equivalent to the ASOS &lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Notice/N7210.733.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. FAA owned AWOS-C units in Alaska are typically classified as AWOS-C IIIP units while all other AWOS-C units are typically classified as AWOS III P/T units. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/weather/asos/?state=AK&lt;/ref&gt;

AWOS systems disseminate weather data in a variety of ways:
* A [[Speech synthesis|computer-generated voice]] message which is broadcast via [[radio frequency]] to [[Aviator|pilots]] in the vicinity of an airport. The message is updated at least once per minute, and this is the only mandatory form of weather reporting for an AWOS.
* Optionally, a computer-generated voice message, available over a telephone dial-up [[modem]] service. The message is updated at least once per minute.
* Optionally (but frequently done), AWOS messages may be transmitted to the FAA for national [[dissemination]] via computer. These messages are currently in [[METAR]] format, and typical reporting frequencies are once every 20 minutes. This option is only available for AWOS III or IV systems (see below).

The following AWOS configurations are defined below in terms of what [[parameter]]s they measure:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1031566&lt;/ref&gt;
* AWOS A: [[barometric pressure]] and [[altimeter]] setting (in inches of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]).
* AWOS I: [[wind]] [[speed]] and wind gusts (in [[knot (unit)|knots]]), wind [[Direction (geometry)|direction]] (from which the wind is blowing) and variable wind direction (in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] of the [[compass]]), [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] (in degrees [[Celsius]]), [[altimeter setting]] and [[density altitude]].
* AWOS II: all AWOS I parameters, plus [[visibility]] and variable visibility (in [[mile]]s).
* AWOS III: all AWOS II parameters, plus [[Cloud cover|sky condition]] (in [[okta]]s), [[Ceiling (cloud)|cloud ceiling]] height (in [[Foot (unit)|feet]]), and liquid [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] accumulation (in [[inch]]es).
* AWOS III P: all AWOS III parameters, plus precipitation type ([[rain]], [[snow]] and sometimes [[drizzle]]) identification.
* AWOS III T: all AWOS III parameters, plus [[thunderstorm]] detection (via a cloud-to-ground [[lightning]] detector).
* AWOS III P/T: all AWOS III parameters, plus precipitation type identification and thunderstorm detection.
* AWOS IV Z: all AWOS III P/T parameters, plus [[freezing rain]] detection via a freezing rain sensor (Note: this configuration used to be called AWOS III PTZ).
* AWOS IV R: all AWOS III P/T parameters, plus [[runway]] surface condition.
* AWOS IV Z/R: all AWOS III P/T parameters, plus freezing rain detection and runway surface condition.

Also, custom configurations such as AWOS AV (AWOS A parameters plus visibility) are possible. Non-certified sensors may be attached to AWOS systems, but weather data derived from those sensors must be clearly identified as "advisory" in any voice messages and may not be included in any METAR observations.

As of January 31, 2015, the following manufacturers provide FAA-certified, non-Federal AWOS systems:

===Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)===
&lt;!--Several pages link to this section.  If you update the header above, update the links as well!--&gt;
The '''Automated Surface Observing System''' (ASOS) units are operated and controlled cooperatively in the United States by the NWS, FAA, and DOD. After many years of research and development, the deployment of ASOS units began in 1991 and was completed in 2004.

These systems generally report at hourly intervals, but also report special observations if weather conditions change rapidly and cross aviation operation thresholds. They generally report all the parameters of the AWOS-III, while also having the additional capabilities of reporting temperature and dew point in degrees Fahrenheit, present [[weather]], [[atmospheric icing|icing]], [[lightning]], [[Mean sea level pressure|sea level pressure]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] accumulation.

Besides serving aviation needs, ASOS serves as a primary [[climate|climatological]] observing network in the United States, making up the '''first-order''' network of climate stations. Because of this, not every ASOS is located at an airport; for example, one of these units is located at [[Belvedere Castle]] in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]]; another is located at the [[Blue Hill Observatory]] near [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

===Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS)===
The FAA has converted all '''Automated Weather Sensor System''' (AWSS) units to AWOS IIIP/T units. There are no AWSS systems remaining in the National Airspace System (NAS). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/weather/asos/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observing equipment==
Automated airport weather stations use a variety of sophisticated equipment to observe the weather.

[[File:Ely Airport ASOS Ice Free Wind Sensor.jpg|thumb|ASOS Ice-free wind sensor]]

===Wind speed and direction===
A majority of older automated airport weather stations are equipped with a mechanical [[weather vane|wind vane]] and [[Anemometer#Cup anemometers|cup system]] to measure wind speed and direction.  This system is simple in design: the wind spins three horizontally turned cups around the base of the wind vane, providing an estimation of the wind's speed, while the vane on top turns so that the face of the vane offers the least resistance to the wind, causing it to point in the direction the wind is coming from and thus providing the wind direction.

The new generation of sensors use sound waves to measure wind speed and direction. The measurement is based on the time it takes for an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] pulse to travel from one [[transducer]] to another, which varies depending on - among other factors - the wind speed. The transit time is measured in both directions for several (usually two or three) pairs of the transducer heads. Based on those results, the sensor computes wind speed and direction. Compared to mechanical sensors, the [[Sonic anemometers|ultrasonic sensors]] offer several advantages such as no moving parts, advanced self-diagnostic capabilities and reduced maintenance requirements.

NWS and FAA ASOS stations and most of new AWOS installations are currently equipped with ultrasonic wind sensors.

Unlike all other measurements, which are made near between 3 and 9 feet (1 and 3 meters) above the ground, wind speed and direction are measured at 30 feet (10 meters).

[[File:2008-07-09 Ely Airport ASOS Visibility Sensor in Ely, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|ASOS Visibility sensor]]

===Visibility===
To determine visibility, automated airport weather stations use one of two sensor types:
* forward scatter sensors
* [[transmissometer]]s

The forward scatter sensor uses a beam of infrared light which is sent from one end of the sensor toward the receiver, but offset from a direct line to the receiver by a certain angle.  The amount of light scattered by [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particles in the air]] and received by the receiver determines the extinction coefficient. This is then converted to visibility using either Allard's or Koschmieder's law.

In a transmissometer, a beam of visible light is transmitted from its transmitter to receiver head. The extinction coefficient is derived from the amount of light lost in the air.

There also are sensors that, to a certain degree combine a transmissometer with a forward scatter sensor.

Forward scatter sensors are more popular due to their lower price, smaller size and lower maintenance requirements. However, transmissometers are still used at some airports as they are more accurate at low visibilities and are fail-safe, i.e. in case of failure report visibility lower than actual.

Current sensors are capable of reporting visibility in a wide range. For aviation purposes, the reported values are rounded down to the nearest step in one of the following scales:
* M1/4 (less than 1/4 mile), 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 1-1/4, 1-1/2, 2, 2-1/2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 10+ (greater than 10 miles)
* In steps of 50 m when the visibility is less than 800 m; in steps of 100 m when it is 800 m or more, but less than 5&amp;nbsp;km; in kilometer steps when the visibility is 5&amp;nbsp;km or more but less than 10&amp;nbsp;km; and 10&amp;nbsp;km when visibility is 10&amp;nbsp;km or more.

[[File:2008-07-09 Ely Airport ASOS Present Weather Sensor in Ely, Nevada.jpg|thumb|ASOS Present weather sensor]]

===Present weather (falling precipitation)===
Automated airport weather stations use a '''[[Light Emitting Diode]] Weather Identifier (LEDWI)''' to determine if and what type of precipitation is falling.  The LEDWI sensor measures the [[wiktionary:scintillation|scintillation]] pattern of the precipitation falling through the sensor's [[infrared]] beam (approximately 50 millimeters in diameter) and determines from a pattern analysis of the particle size and fall velocity whether the precipitation is [[rain]] or [[snow]].  If precipitation is determined to be falling, but the pattern is not conclusively identified as either rain or snow, unknown precipitation is reported.  Automated airport weather stations are not yet able to report [[hail]], [[ice pellets]], and various other intermediate forms of precipitation.

===Obscurations to vision===
Automated airport weather stations do not have a separate sensor for detecting specific obscurations to vision. Instead, when visibility is reduced below 7 [[statute mile]]s, the system uses the reported temperature and dew point to determine an obscuration to vision. If relative humidity is low (i.e., there is a large difference between the temperature and dew point), [[haze]] is reported. If [[relative humidity]] is high (i.e., there is a small difference between the temperature and the dew point), [[mist]] or [[fog]] is reported, depending on the exact visibility. Fog is reported when visibility is 1/2 mile or less; mist is reported for visibilities greater than {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} but less than {{convert|7|mi|km}}. If the temperature is below [[freezing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/freezing-fog-definition-causes-and-dangers.html |title=Freezing Fog: Definition, Causes, and Dangers|website=buzzle.com|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gultepe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ismail Gultepe|title=Fog and Boundary Layer Clouds: Fog Visibility and Forecasting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwzHZ-wV-BAC&amp;pg=PA1127 |accessdate=5 August 2016|date=2 January 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7643-8419-7|page=1127}}&lt;/ref&gt; humidity is high and visibility is 1/2 mile or less, [[freezing fog]] is reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteocentre.com/doc/metar.html |title=MMmetar|website=meteocentre.com|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-07-09 Ely Airport ASOS Ceilometer in Ely, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|ASOS CT12K ceilometer]]

===Cloud coverage and ceiling===
Automated airport weather stations use an upward-pointing '''[[laser]] beam [[ceilometer]]''' to detect the amount and height of clouds.  The laser is pointed upward, and the time required for reflected light to return to the station allows for the calculation of the height of the cloud base.  Because of the limited coverage area (the laser can only detect clouds directly overhead), the system computer calculates a time-averaged cloud cover and [[ceiling (cloud)|ceiling]], which is reported to external users.  To compensate for the danger of rapidly changing sky cover, the averaging is weighted toward the first 10 minutes of the 30-minute averaging period. The range of the ceilometer is up to {{convert|25000|ft|m}} depending on the model.&lt;ref name="Ceilometer"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Vaisala|title= Vaisala CT25K Laser Ceilometer |url= http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/psd3/cruises/CT25K.pdf|accessdate= 30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouds above that height are not detectable by automated stations at present.

[[File:2013-09-19_09_28_07_ASOS_HO-1088_thermometer_at_Eureka_Airport,_Nevada.JPG|thumb|ASOS HO-1088 thermometer]]

===Temperature and dew point===
Automated airport weather stations use a temperature/dew point sensor (hygrothermometer) designed for continuous operation which normally remains on at all times, except during maintenance.

The measurement of temperature is simple compared to the dew point. Operating under the principle that electrical resistance varies with temperature, a [[resistance thermometer|platinum wire resistive temperature device]] measures the ambient air temperature.  The current ASOS thermometer is designated the HO-1088, though some older systems still utilize the HO-83.

[[File:2013-09-19_09_27_41_ASOS_DTS-1_dewpoint_sensor_at_Eureka_Airport,_Nevada.JPG|left|thumb|ASOS DTS-1 Dew point sensor]]

In contrast, the dew point measurement is considerably more complex. The original dew point sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled to the point where a fine film of condensation forms on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror at this condition is equal to the dew point temperature. The hygrometer measures the dew point by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode to the surface of the mirror at an angle of 45 degrees. Two [[photo transistor]]s are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when the mirror is clear (direct) and scattered light when the mirror is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on the mirror, the degree of cloudiness of the mirror surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these photo transistors controls the mirror cooling module which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, the mirror is clear. As the mirror surface temperature is cooled to the dew point temperature, condensations forms on the mirror. The electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain the mirror temperature at the dew point. If the dew point of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the dew point and maintaining continuous operation.

Due to problems with the chilled mirror sensor, NWS ASOS sites now use Vaisala's DTS1 sensor, which measures humidity only via [[capacitance]]. The sensor is based on a solid state capacitive relative humidity element that incorporates a small heater so that the sensing element is always above the ambient temperature, eliminating the formation of dew or frost. The sensor reports directly in dew point through a calculation based on measured relative humidity and the measured temperature of the heated capacitive element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/53362.pdf |title=A NEW LOW MAINTENANCE DEW POINT SENSOR FOR THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS) AUTOMATED SURFACE OBSERVING SYSTEM (ASOS)|website=confex.com|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older AWOS systems used a lithium chloride dew point sensor. Current AWOS systems use capacitive relative humidity sensors, from which dew point is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ops2/Surface/documents/DewPoint0816.pdf |title=Corel Office Document|website=noaa.gov|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-07-09 Ely Airport ASOS ACU in Ely, Nevada.jpg|thumb|ASOS Acquisition Control Unit, including the three pressure transducers towards the bottom]]

===Barometric pressure and altimeter setting===
Data from a barometric pressure sensor are used to calculate [[QNH]] [[altimeter setting]]. Pilots [[Aneroid altimeter|rely on this value to determine their altitude]]. To ensure safe separation from terrain and other obstructions, high degree of accuracy and reliability is required from a pressure sensor.

Most aviation weather stations use two (required for an AWOS) or three independent pressure transducers. The transducers may or may not share their associated tubing and external ports (designed to minimize effect of wind/wind gusts). Should the reported pressures differ by more than a preset maximum, the pressure values are discarded and altimeter setting is not reported or is reported as "missing."

Altimeter setting is calculated based on barometric pressure, site elevation, sensor elevation and - optionally - air temperature.

Altimeter setting is reported in [[inches of mercury]] (in steps of 0.01 inHg) or whole hectopascals, rounded down.

[[File:2011-12-14 Tonopah Airport ASOS automatic heated tipping bucket precipitation gauge.JPG|thumb|left|ASOS Heated tipping bucket precipitation gauge]]

===Precipitation accumulation===
The original precipitation accumulation measuring device used for automated airport weather stations was the '''heated [[Tipping bucket rain gauge|tipping bucket]]'''. The upper portion of this device consists of a {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter collector with an open top. The collector, which is heated to melt any frozen precipitation such as snow or [[hail]], funnels [[water]] into a two-chamber, pivoting container called a [[bucket]]. Precipitation flows through the [[funnel]] into one compartment of the bucket until {{convert|0.01|in|mm|adj=on}} of water (18.5 grams) is accumulated. That amount of weight causes the bucket to tip on its [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|pivots]], dumping the collected water and moving the other chamber under the funnel. The tipping motion activates a [[switch]] (either a [[reed switch]] or a [[mercury switch]]), which sends one [[electricity|electrical]] pulse for each {{convert|0.01|in|mm|adj=on}} of precipitation collected.

[[File:2013-09-19_09_27_07_ASOS_AWPAG_precipitation_gauge_at_Eureka_Airport,_Nevada.JPG|thumb|ASOS All-Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG)]]

Because of problems the heated tipping bucket has with properly measuring frozen precipitation (particularly snow), the '''All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG)''' was developed. This sensor is essentially a [[Weighing rain gage|weighing gauge]] where precipitation continuously accumulates within the collector, and as the weight increases, precipitation is recorded.  Only select NWS ASOS units have been equipped with the AWPAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AUTOMATED SURFACE OBSERVING SYSTEM (ASOS) RELEASE NOTE SOFTWARE VERSION - 2.7B All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG)|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ops2/Surface/documents/awpag27B6relnotes.pdf |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ely Airport ASOS Freezing Rain Sensor.jpg|thumb|left|ASOS Freezing rain sensor]]

===Icing (freezing rain)===
Automated airport weather stations report [[freezing rain]] via the [[resonance|resonant frequency]] of a vibrating rod. The resonant frequency decreases with increasing accretion (additional mass) of [[ice]], [[frost|hoarfrost]], freezing fog, freezing [[drizzle]], [[hard rime|rime]], or wet snow.

To report freezing rain, the system combines the sensor output from the freezing rain sensor with data from the LEDWI. The LEDWI must provide a positive indication of unknown precipitation or rain before the system can transmit a report of freezing rain.  If the LEDWI reports either no precipitation or snow, the system will ignore the input from the freezing rain sensor. The sensor is designed to detect and report icing from all weather conditions.

[[File:2008-07-09 Ely Airport ASOS Thunderstorm Sensor in Ely, Nevada.jpg|thumb|ASOS Thunderstorm sensor]]

===Lightning (thunderstorms)===
Many automated airport weather stations within the United States use the '''National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN)''' to detect lightning via the '''Automatic Lightning Detection and Reporting System (ALDARS)'''. The NLDN uses 106 [[Lightning detector|sensors]] nationwide to [[triangulation|triangulate]] lightning strikes. Data from the detection grid is fed into ALDARS, which in turn sends messages to each automated airport station informing it of the proximity of any lightning strikes. Lightning strikes within {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the station result in a report of a [[thunderstorm]] ''at'' the station (TS). Lightning strikes more than {{convert|5|mi|km}} but less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the station result in a report of a thunderstorm ''in the vicinity of'' the station (VCTS). Lightning more than {{convert|10|mi|km}} but less than {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the station results only in a remark of ''distant lightning'' (LTG DSNT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/topics/attach/html/ssd00-10.htm Automated Lightning Detection and Ranging System] - [[National Weather Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some stations now have their own lightning sensor to actually measure lightning strikes at the site rather than requiring an external service. This thunderstorm sensor works by detecting both the flash of light and momentary change in the electric field produced by lightning. When both of these are detected within a few milliseconds of each other, the station registers a possible lightning strike. When a second possible lightning strike is detected within 15 minutes of the first, the station records a thunderstorm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/97TAs/TA9733/TA97-33.html ASOS LIGHTNING ASSESSMENT - National Weather Service], Archived at: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706154746/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/97TAs/TA9733/TA97-33.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data dissemination==
Data dissemination is usually via an [[automate]]d [[VHF]] [[airband]] [[radio frequency]] (108-137&amp;nbsp;MHz) at each [[airport]], [[broadcasting]] the automated weather observation. This is often via the [[Automatic Terminal Information Service]] (ATIS). Most automated weather stations also have discrete phone numbers to retrieve real-time observations over the phone or through a modem.

In the United States, the AWOS/ASOS Data Acquisition System (ADAS), a computer system run by the FAA, polls the systems remotely, accessing the observations and disseminating them worldwide electronically in [[METAR]] format.

==Limitations requiring human augmentation==
At present, automated airport weather stations are unable to report a variety of meteorological conditions.  These include:
* shallow or patchy fog
* blowing [[dust]]
* [[smoke]]
* falling ash
* [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]]
* [[tornado]]es
* precipitation that is not in the form of rain or snow, such as hail, ice pellets and snow grains
* multiple forms of precipitation falling at the same time
* depth of new snowfall
* total snow depth
* in-cloud and cloud-to-cloud lightning
* clouds that are not directly above the station
* clouds that are more than twelve thousand feet above ground level
* cloud type

Because many of these can pose dangers to aircraft and all of these are of interest to the meteorological community, most of the busier airports also have part-time or full-time human observers who '''augment''', or provide additional information to, the automated airport weather station's observations. Research is on-going to allow the automated stations to detect many of these phenomena.

Automated stations can also suffer from mechanical breakdown, requiring repair or replacement. This can be either due to physical damage (either natural or human caused), mechanical wear, or severe icing during winter weather.  During system outages, human observers are often required to supplement missing or non-representative observations from the automated station. Research is also ongoing to produce more robust systems which are less vulnerable to natural damage, mechanical wear and icing.

'''Beatrice (Tilly) Shilling''' [[OBE]] [[PhD]] [[MSc]] [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|CEng]] (8 March 1909&amp;nbsp;– 18 November 1990)&lt;ref name="haines"&gt;{{cite book | title=International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950 | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Haines, Catharine M. C. | year=2001 | pages=288 | isbn=1576070905}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[aeronautical engineer]] and motor racer. During the [[Second World War]], she invented "[[Miss Shilling's orifice]]", a small metal disc similar to a metal washer that restricted fuel flow to a carburetor. This helped prevent engine stall in the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines of the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters, which could lose power or even completely cut out during certain manoeuvres and pose a significant disadvantage in active service.

Shilling raced motorbikes in the 1930s, and raced cars after World War II.

==Early life==
Shilling was born at [[Waterlooville]], [[Hampshire]], the daughter of a butcher. At age 14, she bought herself a motorbike, which she tinkered with; she was already determined to become an engineer.&lt;ref name="hants"&gt;Hampshire Biographies: [http://www3.hants.gov.uk/biographies/shilling.htm Beatrice Shilling 1909 – 1990: Aeronautical engineer and motorcycle racer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519074235/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/biographies/shilling.htm |date=19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing secondary school, she worked for an electrical engineering company for three years, installing wiring and generators.&lt;ref name="whitfield" /&gt; Her employer, Margaret Partridge, encouraged her to study [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Manchester]]; she received a bachelor's degree in 1932 and stayed on for a year to get a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name="whitfield" /&gt; Jobs were hard to find in the [[Great Depression|Depression]]; she worked as a research assistant for Professor G. F. Mucklow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="whitfield"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thrustvector.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/beatrice-shilling/ |title=Beatrice Shilling  |author=Jakob Whitfield, |date= |work=Thrust Vector |publisher= |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 she was recruited as a scientific officer by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), the research and development agency of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], Hampshire. She worked at Royal Aircraft Establishment until her retirement in 1969.

==Second World War==
Shilling worked on many projects for RAE during World War II.

===The orifice===
{{main|Miss Shilling's orifice}}

During the [[Battle of France]] and [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940, RAF pilots discovered a serious problem in fighter planes with [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engines, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]. When the plane went nose-down to begin a dive, the resulting [[g-force|negative g-force]] would flood the engine's [[carburettor]], causing the engine to stall.

German fighters used [[fuel injection]] engines and did not have this problem. So in action, a German fighter could evade a pursuing RAF fighter by flying a negative g manoeuvre which the RAF plane could not follow.

Shilling devised the [[Miss Shilling's orifice|R.A.E. restrictor]] to solve this problem. It was a brass thimble with a hole in the middle (later further refined to a flat washer), which could be fitted into the engine's carburettor without taking the aircraft out of service. The restrictor limited maximum fuel flow and prevented flooding. By March 1941, she had led a small team on a tour of RAF fighter stations, installing the devices in their Merlin engines. The restrictor was immensely popular with pilots, who affectionately named it 'Miss Shilling's orifice' or simply the 'Tilly orifice.' It continued in use as a stop-gap until the introduction of the [[pressure carburetor]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsden 2003, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After the war, Shilling worked on a variety of projects including the [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak missile]]&lt;ref name="whitfield" /&gt; and the effect of a wet runway upon braking.&lt;ref name="haines" /&gt; Shilling was once described by a fellow scientist as "a flaming pathfinder of Women's Lib"; she always rejected any suggestion that as a woman she might be inferior to a man in technical and scientific fields. However, her brusque manner and contempt for bureaucracy led to an uneasy relationship with management. Shilling worked for the RAE until 1969, rising to a senior post in the Mechanical Engineering Department.&lt;ref name="whitfield" /&gt;

She held an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Surrey]], and was a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|CEng]] and member of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] and the [[Women's Engineering Society]].

==Motor sports==

In the 1930s, Shilling raced motorbikes. She beat professional riders, such as [[Noel Pope]], and was awarded the Gold Star for lapping the [[Brooklands]] circuit at {{convert|106|mph|km/h}} on her [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton M30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapidhare.blogspot.com/2009/05/beatrice-shilling.html |title=Beatrice Shilling  |author=John de Kruif |date=24 March 2010 |work=Vintage Norton Motorcycles |publisher= |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Beatrice and husband George turned to racing cars, which were tuned and modified extensively in their home workshop. Starting off their exploits with a much-lightened [[Lagonda Rapier]], between 1959 and 1962 they raced an [[Austin-Healey]] [[Sebring Sprite]], most frequently at Goodwood Members' Meetings, scoring a number of third places and even one race win. George's driving career became more serious with the 1961 acquisition of an Elva 200 [[Formula Junior]] single-seater, but there were accidents for both of them, and the Elva was converted into a Mk VI sports car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elva.com/history/aug06-jottings02.html |title="ELVA Jottings #2" (August 2006)  |author=Roger Dunbar |date=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Elva.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Beatrice Shilling was brought in to help [[Dan Gurney]] solve over-heating problems with his [[Eagle Mk1]] [[Formula 1]] [[racing car]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Freudenberg, [http://speedreaders.info/11055-negative-gravitya-life-beatrice-shilling/ "Negative Gravity: A Life of Beatrice Shilling"], ''Negative Gravity: A Life of Beatrice Shilling''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shilling married George Naylor in September 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=m9XH96afMqj6WF8qOBj3lA&amp;scan=1 |title=Index entry |accessdate=20 October 2012 |work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked at the RAE. According to anecdote, she refused to marry him until he also had been awarded the Brooklands Gold Star for lapping the circuit at over 100&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="whitfield" /&gt; During the Second World War he was a bomber pilot with [[No. 625 Squadron RAF]] and reached the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]]. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC). He volunteered for an extra tour of bombing missions, over and above what was expected of him. He suffered tinnitus and other health problems in later life as a result of his wartime activities.

==Legacy==
In  2011, the [[Wetherspoons]] chain of [[public house]]s opened a pub in Farnborough named the ''Tilly Shilling'' in her honour, though the nickname 'Tilly' was never used to her face and was probably an unflattering reference to her appearance being overly utilitarian: the wartime 'tillies' were low-powered pick-ups produced by British car manufacturers for use by the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/hampshire/the-tilly-shilling-farnborough |title=The Tilly Shilling |date=7 September 2010 |publisher=J D Wetherspoon |accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tillyregister.com/ |title=The Tilly Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a collection of her racing badges and trophies was bought by the [[Brooklands Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antique-collecting.co.uk/2015/08/06/beatrices-brooklands-badges-sold |title=Beatrice's Brooklands Badges sold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bâtiment des Forces motrices (BFM)''', French for "Power plant building", is the power house of a former [[Hydroelectricity|hydro power plant]] and [[Water supply|waterworks]] in [[Geneva]] called '''Usine des Forces Motrices''', later '''Usine des Forces Motrices de la Coulouvrenière'''.

The structure is positioned near the point where the [[Rhône|River Rhône]] flows out of [[Lake Geneva]] towards [[Lyon]].&lt;ref name="BFMArf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfm.ch/index.php?cID=166#content|title=The factory became a theater|publisher=BFM Arfluvial SA, Genève|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created between 1883 and 1892 (and subjected to subsequent improvements) to exploit the flow of the river to provide water pressure to feed the city's [[water supply]] and a [[hydraulic power network]]. Furthermore, the [[weir]] of the structure was designed to regulate the level of the lake. The structure lost its original function as a power source in 1963,&lt;ref name=syndinitGE/&gt; but it nevertheless continued to house pumping equipment to service Geneva's drinking water supply till 1988.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The weir of the power plant was used some more years till it was taken over by the [[:fr:Barrage du Seujet|Barrage du Seujet (Seujet barrage)]] in 1995, which is located approximately fifty meters downstream from the BFM. Towards the end of the twentieth century the BFM was converted into an entertainment venue, reopening in 1997 as an opera house / concert hall&lt;ref name=syndinitGE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/fr/bureau-des-congres/organisez-votre-evenement/lieux-evenementiels/venue/feed/batiment-des-forces-motrices/|title=Bâtiment des Forces Motrices:   Ancienne usine hydraulique reconvertie en théâtre, Lieu événementiel classé monument historique depuis 1988.|publisher=Genève Tourisme|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by the architect Bernard Picenni in association with the acoustician [[Peutz]] and the scenographer [[Ducks scéno|dUCKS scéno]].

At the time when the project was defined as a "power plant" there was no automatic correlation between a "power plant" and a public electricity supply. The idea in 1882 was to feed power in the form of pressurized water to local manufacturing businesses, who could use it to operate their own powered machinery, which might indeed include generators. Another objective involved using the pumped water to feed the reservoirs of the public drinking water supply. However, in 1887 electricity generation started in a building nearby the BFM, where generators were driven by pressurized water supplied from the BFM. The hydraulic power network needed a pressure valve to avoid the damage from excessive pressure within the network which was located beside the BFM and which was the precursor to Geneva's [[Jet d'Eau|Jet d'Eau (fountain)]].&lt;ref name=BFM&amp;JetdeauseonSiG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sig-ge.ch/nous-connaitre/support-et-communications/Documents/Documentation/Institutionnel/patrimoineSites.pdf|title=Patrimoine et sites SIG|publisher=Communication SiG, Genève|accessdate=18 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003035747/http://www.sig-ge.ch/nous-connaitre/support-et-communications/Documents/Documentation/Institutionnel/patrimoineSites.pdf|archivedate=3 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==
By 1880 it had become clear that the existing hydraulic structure, sited at the city's [[:fr:Pont de la Machine|Pont de la Machine (''"Machine Bridge"'')]], was no longer sufficient for Geneva's growing needs, despite a succession of upgrades since the installation of the first structure back in 1709.   The [[Canton of Geneva|cantonal authorities]] therefore granted to the city a concession for exploitation of the "motor power" (in French ''"forces motrice"'') of the Rhône on 30 December 1882.   The city committed to construct a new "hydraulic factory" (in French ''"usine hydraulique"'') which would provide drinking water to the city and energy in the form of pressurized water for the operation of machinery. At the same time they embarked on the work necessary to regulate the level of [[Lake Geneva]], notably by construction of a curtain weir across the river.

The project as originally envisaged involved building the Bâtiment des Forces motrices on land administered by the then separate municipality of [[Plainpalais]] (later subsumed into Geneva) which was in financial difficulties. The [[:fr:Conseil administratif de Genève|Geneva city administration]] therefore entered into negotiations to move the district frontiers in order to bring the proposed site within the Geneva city boundary. Plainpalais rejected the idea, however. It was therefore decided to reposition the site for the new building to an artificial island positioned in the middle of the [[Rhône|river]], after it had been agreed in 1882 that the river bed itself was part of Geneva. The river was divided into two parallel channels, called respectively the "Canal d'alimentation" (''"Supply [of public drinking and fountain water] channel"'') on the left side and the "Canal de régulation" (''"Regulation [of the water level] channel"'') on the right side. On the initiative of [[Jean-Daniel Colladon]], the civil engineer [[Théodore Turrettini]] now embarked on a parallel career as a local politician, when he was elected to the [[:fr:Conseil administratif de Genève|Geneva city council]]. He went on to head up the construction project with energy and imagination.

==Construction==
Before 1882 the level of the lake surface varied with the seasons, rising to it highest level at the end of the winter when the snows melted and the lake was filled by streams and torrents from the surrounding mountains. Work on the structure began in November 1893, when the level of the lake and the flow of water through it was expected to remain relatively low for the next five to six months. Along the part of the river where the powerhouse was built the river was separated into two parallel channels and these were drained successively in order to permit the construction of the building, the hydraulic structures and of a curtain weir attached to the [[:fr:Pont de la Machine|Pont de la Machine (''"Machine Bridge"'')]] located a few hundred meters upstream.

Five Jonval turbines were installed in the small wing of the powerhouse crossing the river and commissioned in May 1886, producing a combined power of 900&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author = Pierre-Louis Viollet|title = Histoire de l'énergie hydraulique: moulins, pompes, roues et turbines de l'Antiquité au XXe siècle|publisher = Presses des Ponts|date= 1 January 2005|isbn = 9782859784140|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YzdHxL4OjhoC&amp;redir_esc=y | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the turbines supplied water pressure to what is today the city's old town, and the other three supplied surrounding districts, some of them as far as {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} away. The pressurized water network served, primarily, small businesses including, notably, clock and watchmakers.

In 1892 the larger main turbine hall was ready, with space for a further 15 turbines which were installed progressively over the next few years except the last two. The last of them was installed in 1897,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|author = André Ducluzaux|title = Transporter l'énergie hydraulique à distance, avant l'électricité (1830–1890)|work = La Houille Blanche|volume = 4-5|date = 1 January 2002|DOI = 10.1051/lhb/2002054|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which time the full complement of 18 turbines was providing 3.3 MW of power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Technical details ===

==== Curtain Weir ====
The curtain weir was attached to the [[superstructure]] of the Pont de la Machine bridging the right arm of the river Rhône. The old superstructure was replaced during the construction of the power plant by a new superstructure for pedestrian use made from [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]]. The chosen building material was strong enough to support the additional lateral forces introduced by the curtain weir into the structure. The curtain weir consisted of 39 single roller blinds made from [[larch]] wood. It was able to dam the Rhône to a height of maximal 3.3 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Les vannes du Pont de la Machine 1980|url = http://www.notrehistoire.ch/photo/view/24667/|website = www.notrehistoire.ch|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Powerhouse ====
The [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] powerhouse sat on an L-shaped [[floor plan]], with the main hall aligned along the length of the river and a shorter hall connecting the main hall with the river bank at the western end of the building. The natural stone cladded [[concrete]] structure has large round arched glazed windows. The roof was supported by an iron [[truss]] structure without roof support pillars or dividing walls inside the building in a way that a vast open unencumbered space for the machinery inside the powerhouse was provided. The interior of the turbine hall was decorated in the flamboyant [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style fashionable at the time. Only the upper facade on the eastern end, facing the lake, reflected the extrovert decorated style of the interior, supplemented at the time by statues representing [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].
[[File:Jet_d'eau_1886.jpg|alt=Black and white photography of an approximately 30 m high fountain on an island in the middle of the river Rhone. The water is partly blown away by the wind.|left|thumb|The Jet d’eau in its original location ca. 1886]]
In order to avoid excessive pressure build-up in the hydraulic power network, a release valve was fitted beside the main hall of the powerhouse. A tall water fountain, the [[Jet d'Eau]], was ejected by the device whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories switched off the machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was hard to control and the supply of pressurized water was difficult to adapt to the real demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.bfm.ch/en/bfm/history/|website = BFM|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tall fountain was visible from a long distance and became the landmark of the city. In 1891 it was moved to the current location in the lake where it is operated for the sole purpose of a tourist attraction without any other function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sig-ge.ch/nous-connaitre/support-et-communications/Documents/Documentation/Institutionnel/patrimoineSites.pdf|title = Patrimoine et sites SIG|date = |access-date = 2016-01-20|website = |publisher = Services industriels de Genève|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003035747/http://www.sig-ge.ch/nous-connaitre/support-et-communications/Documents/Documentation/Institutionnel/patrimoineSites.pdf|archivedate = 2015-10-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Turbines ====
[[File:Schiffbau_jonval2.jpg|alt=Blue disc-shaped turbine wheel with three blade rings.|thumb|[[Jonval turbine]] wheel originating from the Usine des Forces Motrices shown in front of a former [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.]] factory building in [[Zürich|Zurich]].]]
[[File:Geneve_Force_Motrice_Interieur.jpg|thumb|Interior of the powerhouse with the pumps.]]
[[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.]] of Zurich delivered the [[Jonval turbine]]s designed for submerged operation. They were capable to process a total runoff of 600–800&amp;nbsp;m³/s at a drop height of 2 to 4 m. Each had a maximal power of 210&amp;nbsp;hp. The three concentric arranged blade rings allowed to adjust the power of the turbine to the available drop height and the actual demand. The control was done by partially covering the guide vanes of the turbine.

Each turbine powered two [[Double-acting cylinder|double-acting]] [[piston pump]]s in a lying V-configuration located in the hall of the powerhouse. The two pumps shared a vertical arranged common [[hydraulic accumulator]].

In the 1960s the Jonval turbines were one by one replaced by Kaplan turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transporter l'énergie hydraulique à distance, avant l'électricité(1830-1890)|url = http://www.shf-lhb.org/10.1051/lhb/2002054|journal = La Houille Blanche|pages = 28–33|issue = 4-5|doi = 10.1051/lhb/2002054|first = André|last = Ducluzaux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distribution network ====
The distribution network used three different pressure levels. The lowest pressure level served for the drinking water supply, the intermediate and the high pressure level served as hydraulic power network. The intermediate pressure level had an operating pressure of 6.5 bar and was reached 1896 a length of 82&amp;nbsp;km. It was used for powering 130 [[water engine]]s type Schmid with a gross power of 230&amp;nbsp;hp. The high pressure network had an operating pressure of 14 bar and reached an extension of 93&amp;nbsp;km. It was used to power 207 turbines and motors, as well as elevator drives. The gross power was 3000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Many turbines were used for driving generators for electric lighting. In 1887 an electricity generation plant was built next to the powerhouse, which generated 110 V DC with a maximal power of 800&amp;nbsp;hp and an AC network with a maximal power of 600&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The generators were driven by a water turbine supplied from the hydraulic power network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhs/pdf/expo_2009_moulin_dp.pdf|title = Genève à la force de l'eau – une histoire de l'exploitation hyrdaulique (exhibition guide)|date = |access-date = 2016-01-21|website = |publisher = Musée d'histoire des sciences|last = |first = |year = 2009|lang=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydraulic power network was not in competition with the electric power supply, but was more considered a supplement to the electric power supply. Only during the economic crisis of the 1930s, the demand of pressurized water as energy supply declined. The last water engine was decommissioned in 1958.

==Conversion==
The Le Bâtiment des Forces motrices lost its principal original functions during the 1960s, as manufacturing industry moved out to the edge of the city.   It was classified as a historic monument in 1988, and then as a [[Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance|cultural asset of national importance]].&lt;ref name=biensculturels&gt;{{cite web|page=177|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/fr/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventara-objekte.parsys.000102.DownloadFile.tmp/ge.pdf|title=Inventaire suisse des biens culturels d’importance nationale - Genève| publisher=Das Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz BABS|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Meanwhile, various avenues were explored to find a new use for the building.   After various meetings with the responsible city department, and thanks to the generosity of a locally based benefactor, the decision was taken to adapt the main building as a 1,000 seat auditorium suitable for theatrical uses.   The buildings should be able to host productions from the city's [[Grand Théâtre de Genève|Grand Theatre]] for a year, during that buildings major renovation of 1997/98, following which the Bâtiment des Forces motrices should continue to be available for theatrical events and other entertainment spectacles.   Regarding the BFM's original functions, just two small pumps would be left in the side wing.

The conversion was based on plans drawn up by the Geneva-based architect Bernard Picenni&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lescaze et Tahani S. Khalil, Un opéra sur l'eau, ou la révélation d'un lieu : L'usine des Forces Motrices de la coulouvrenière à Genève, Éditions Suzanne Hurter, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;   The side wing linking to the left (south) bank of the [[Rhône]] was converted into a reception area, while the main turbine hall became the main theatre.   The theatre, opened in September 1997, was constructed entirely of wood.   It provided 801 seats in the main area and a further 144 on the balcony/gallery.

In December 1997 a pedestrian walkway was set up against the northern and western faces of the building, establishing a connection between the Promenade des Lavandières (the unbuilt strip of land to the east of the BFM and between the two channels of the Rhône) and the Place des Volontaires (''"le Place des Volontaires"'' - on the bank of the river at the southern end of the side wing that connects the main turbine hall with the shore).   At the Place des Volontaires is a small cultural centre associated with the BFM.   Construction of the walkway used the piles and supports originally created for the inspection walkway along the outside of the turbine hall, below the windows on its side.

[[File:This Is Cinerama 03.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Scene from "This is Cinerama"]]
[[File:Bel. Cinerama scherm wit gemaakt 1.jpg|thumb|250px|A Cinerama screen in the Bellevue, Amsterdam]]

'''Cinerama''' is a [[widescreen]] process that originally projected images simultaneously from three synchronized 35&amp;nbsp;mm projectors onto a huge, deeply curved screen, subtending 146° of arc.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} The trademarked process was marketed by the Cinerama corporation. It was the first of a number of novel processes introduced during the 1950s, when the movie industry was reacting to competition from television. Cinerama was presented to the public as a theatrical event, with reserved seating and printed programs, and audience members often dressed in their best attire for the evening.

The Cinerama projection screen, rather than being a continuous surface like most screens, is made of hundreds of individual vertical strips of standard perforated screen material, each about {{frac|7|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch (~22&amp;nbsp;mm) wide, with each strip angled to face the audience, so as to prevent light scattered from one end of the deeply curved screen from reflecting across the screen and washing out the image on the opposite end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr2.htm |title=Cinerama |publisher=www.widescreenmuseum.com |accessdate=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The display is accompanied by a high-quality, seven-track discrete, directional, surround-sound system.

The original system involved shooting with three synchronized cameras sharing a single shutter. This process was later abandoned in favor of a system using a single camera and 70mm prints. The latter system lost the 146° field of view of the original three-strip system, and its resolution was markedly lower.  Three-strip Cinerama did not use [[anamorphic lens]]es, although two of the systems used to produce the 70mm prints ([[Ultra Panavision 70]] and Super [[Technirama]] 70) ''did'' employ anamorphics. Later, 35mm anamorphic reduction prints were produced for exhibition in theatres with anamorphic [[CinemaScope]]-compatible projection lenses.

==History==

===Process and production===
Cinerama was invented by [[Fred Waller]] (1886–1954) and languished in the laboratory for several years before Waller, joined by Hazard "Buzz " Reeves, brought it to the attention of [[Lowell Thomas]] who, first with [[Mike Todd]] and later [[Merian C. Cooper]], produced a commercially viable demonstration of Cinerama which opened on Broadway on September 30, 1952. The film, titled ''This is Cinerama,'' was received with enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=mbhcinerama&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Martin B.|title=Cinerama|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr1.htm|publisher=The American WideScreen Museum|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pm852&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dempewolff|first=Richard F.|title=Movies on a Curved Screen Wrap You in Action|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=Aug 1952|volume=98|issue=2|pages=120–124+|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=6 October 2012|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the outgrowth of many years of development. A forerunner was the [[Polyvision|triple-screen final sequence]] in the silent ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'' (1927) directed by [[Abel Gance]]; Gance's classic was considered lost in the 1950s, however, known of only by hearsay, and Waller could not have actually seen it. Waller had earlier developed an 11-projector system called "Vitarama" at the Petroleum Industry exhibit in the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. A five-camera version, the Waller Gunnery Trainer, was used during the Second World War.

The word "Cinerama" combines ''[[film|cinema]]'' with ''[[panorama]]'', the origin of all the "-orama" [[neologism]]s  (the word "panorama" comes from the Greek words "pan", meaning ''all'', and "orama", which translates into ''that which is seen'', a ''sight'', or a ''spectacle''). It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;Cinerama Adventure, documentary film made in 2002 – see external links&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Cinerama'' could have been an intentional anagram of the word ''American;'' but an online posting by Dick Babish, describing the meeting at which it was named, says that this is "purely accidental, however delightful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterforum.com/htf/movies-theatrical/194688-how-cinerama-got-its-name-true-story.html|title=How Cinerama Got It's Name - The True Story! - Home Theater Forum|date=18 November 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118092927/http://www.hometheaterforum.com/htf/movies-theatrical/194688-how-cinerama-got-its-name-true-story.html|archivedate=18 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:How Cinerama is projected.gif|thumb|250px|How Cinerama is projected using three projectors]]
The photographic system used three interlocked 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras equipped with 27&amp;nbsp;mm lenses, approximately the focal length of the human eye. Each camera photographed one third of the picture shooting in a crisscross pattern, the right camera shooting the left part of the image, the left camera shooting the right part of the image and the center camera shooting straight ahead. The three cameras were mounted as one unit, set at 48 degrees to each other. A single rotating shutter in front of the three lenses assured simultaneous exposure on each of the films. The three angled cameras photographed an image that was not only three times as wide as a standard film but covered 146 degrees of arc, close to the human field of vision, including peripheral vision. The image was photographed six sprocket holes high, rather than the usual four used in conventional 35&amp;nbsp;mm processes. The picture was photographed and projected at 26 frames per second rather than the usual 24.&lt;ref name="mbhcinerama"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pm852/&gt;

According to film historian Martin Hart, in the original Cinerama system "the camera aspect ratio [was] 2.59:1" with an "optimum screen image, with no architectural constraints, [of] about 2.65:1, with the extreme top and bottom cropped slightly to hide anomalies". He further comments on the unreliability of "numerous websites and other resources that will tell you that Cinerama had an aspect ratio of up to 3:1."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/cinerama_specs.htm Martin Hart, The American Widescreen Museum website].&lt;/ref&gt;

In theaters, Cinerama film was projected from three projection booths arranged in the same crisscross pattern as the cameras. They projected onto a deeply curved screen, the outer thirds of which were made of over 1100 strips of material mounted on "louvers" like a vertical venetian blind, to prevent light projected to each end of the screen from reflecting to the opposite end and washing out the image. This was a big-ticket, reserved-seats spectacle, and the Cinerama projectors were adjusted carefully and operated skillfully. To prevent adjacent images from creating an overilluminated vertical band where they overlapped on the screen, vibrating combs in the projectors, called "jiggolos," alternately blocked the image from one projector and then the other; the overlapping area thus received no more total illumination than the rest of the screen, and the rapidly alternating images within the overlap smoothed out the visual transition between adjacent image "panels."  Great care was taken to match color and brightness when producing the prints. Nevertheless, the seams between panels were usually noticeable. Optical limitations with the design of the camera itself meant that if distant scenes joined perfectly, closer objects did not ([[parallax]] error). A nearby object might split into two as it crossed the seams. To avoid calling attention to the seams, scenes were often composed with unimportant objects such as trees or posts at the seams, and action was blocked so as to center actors within panels. This gave a distinctly "[[triptych]]-like" appearance to the composition even when the seams themselves were not obvious. It was often necessary to have actors in different sections "cheat" where they looked in order to appear to be looking at each other in the final projected picture. Enthusiasts say the seams were not obtrusive; detractors disagree.  [[Lowell Thomas]], an investor in the company with [[Mike Todd]], was still raving about the process in his memoirs thirty years later.

====Sound System====
In addition to the visual impact of the image, Cinerama was one of the first processes to use multitrack magnetic sound. The system, developed by [[Hazard E. Reeves]], one of the Cinerama investors, played back from a full coated 35&amp;nbsp;mm magnetic film with seven tracks of sound targeting a speaker layout similar to the more modern [[SDDS]]. There  were five speakers behind the screen, two on the side and back of the auditorium with a sound engineer directing the sound between the surround speakers according to a script. The projectors and sound system were synchronized by a system using [[selsyn]] motors.

===Drawbacks===
[[File:Radiocentro CMQ Building. Havana, Cuba.jpg|left|thumb|[[Radiocentro CMQ Building]]. Havana, Cuba.]]
The Cinerama system had some obvious drawbacks. If one of the films should break, it had to be repaired with a black slug exactly equal to the missing footage. Otherwise, the corresponding frames would have had to be cut from the other three films (the other two picture films plus the soundtrack film) in order to preserve synchronization. The use of [[zoom lens]]es was impossible since the three images would no longer match. Perhaps the greatest limitation of the process is that the picture looks natural only from within a rather limited "sweet spot."  Viewed from outside the sweet spot, the picture can look distorted.

The system also required a bit of improvisation on the part of the film producers.  It was not possible to film any scene where any part of the scene was close to the camera, as the fields of view no longer met exactly.  Further, any close-up material had a noticeable bend in it at the joins.  It was also difficult to film actors talking to each other where both were in shot, because when they looked at each other when filmed, the resultant image showed the actors appearing to look past each other, particularly if they appeared on different films.  Early directors sidestepped this latter problem by only shooting one actor at a time and cutting between them.  Later directors worked out where to have the actors looking to create a natural shot.  Each actor was required not to look at his fellow actor, but at a cue placed where he needed to look.

Finally, the three individual films would jitter and weave slightly as the films moved through the projectors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Film preservation#Obstacles in restoration]]&lt;/ref&gt; This normal frame-to-frame movement is typically imperceptible to cinema audiences where only a single projector is in use. However, in Cinerama, this resulted in the center picture constantly moving slightly relative to each of the side pictures. The shifting displacements were perceivable at the two points where the center picture met the side pictures, resulting in what appeared to many viewers to be jittering vertical lines at one-third and two-thirds of the way across the screen as the two touching images constantly moved around relative to each other. Cinerama projectors used a device to slightly blur the join lines to make the jitter less noticeable. Future systems such as [[Circle-Vision 360°]] would correct for this by having masked areas between the screens. The jitters continued, but viewers were less aware of them with the adjoining pictures no longer so close together.

The impact these films had on the big screen cannot be assessed from television or video, or even from 'scope prints, which marry the three images together with the seams clearly visible. Because they were designed to be seen on a curved screen, the geometry looks distorted on television; someone walking from left to right appears to approach the camera at an angle, move away at an angle, and then repeat the process on the other side of the screen.

===Premiere===
[[File:Arclight.JPG|thumb|250px|the Cinerama dome in [[Los Angeles]]]]
The first Cinerama film, ''[[This Is Cinerama]]'', premiered on September 30, 1952, at the [[The Broadway Theatre|Broadway Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' judged it to be front-page news. Notables attending included: New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]; violinist [[Fritz Kreisler]]; [[James A. Farley]]; [[Metropolitan Opera]] manager [[Rudolf Bing]]; NBC chairman [[David Sarnoff]]; CBS chairman [[William S. Paley]]; Broadway composer [[Richard Rodgers]]; and Hollywood mogul [[Louis B. Mayer]].

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' a few days after the system premiered, film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE6DF1E3CE23BBC4953DFB6678389649EDE|title=Movie Review - New Movie Projection Shown Here; Giant Wide Angle Screen Utilized; NOVEL TECHNIQUE IN FILMS UNVEILED - NYTimes.com|website=movies.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Somewhat the same sensations that the audience in [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] must have felt on that night, years ago, when motion pictures were first publicly flashed on a large screen were probably felt by the people who witnessed the first public showing of Cinerama the other night... the shrill screams of the ladies and the pop-eyed amazement of the men when the huge screen was opened to its full size and a thrillingly realistic ride on a roller-coaster was pictured upon it, attested to the shock of the surprise. People sat back in spellbound wonder as the scenic program flowed across the screen. It was really as though most of them were seeing motion pictures for the first time.... the effect of Cinerama in this its initial display is frankly and exclusively "sensational," in the literal sense of that word.

While observing that the system "may be hailed as providing a new and valid entertainment thrill," Crowther expressed some skeptical reserve, saying "the very size and sweep of the Cinerama screen would seem to render it impractical for the story-telling techniques now employed in film.... It is hard to see how Cinerama can be employed for intimacy. But artists found ways to use the movie. They may well give us something brand-new here."

A technical review by [[Waldemar Kaempffert]] published in ''The New York Times'' on the same day hailed the system. He praised the stereophonic sound system and noted that "the fidelity of the sounds was irreproachable. Applause in [[La Scala]] sounded like the clapping of hands and not like pieces of wood slapped together". He noted, however that "There is nothing new about these stereophonic sound effects. The [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] and Prof. Harold Burris-Meyer of [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] demonstrated the underlying principles years ago." Kaempfert also noted:

:There is no question that Waller has made a notable advance in cinematography. But it must be said that at the sides of his gigantic screen there is some distortion more noticeable in some parts of the house than in others. The three projections were admirably blended, yet there were visible bands of demarcation on the screen.

===Venues===

Although existing theatres were adapted to show Cinerama films, in 1961 and 1962 the non-profit [[Cooper Foundation]] of [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], designed and built three near-identical circular "super-Cinerama" theaters in [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]] (a [[Minneapolis]] suburb); and [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. They were considered the finest venues to view Cinerama films. The theaters were designed by architect [[Richard L. Crowther]] of Denver, a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Institute of Architects]].

The first such theater, the Cooper Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/824/|title=Cooper Theatre in Denver, CO - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; built in Denver, featured a 146-degree louvered screen (measuring 105 feet by 35 feet), 814 seats, courtesy lounges on the sides of the theatre for relaxation during intermission (including concessions and smoking facilities), and a ceiling which routed air and heating through small vent slots in order to inhibit noise from the building's ventilation equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinerama.topcities.com/ctcooper.htm |title=cooper |publisher=Cinerama.topcities.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104231658/http://cinerama.topcities.com/ctcooper.htm |archivedate=2013-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1994 to make way for a [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] bookstore.

The second, also called the Cooper Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/930/|title=Cooper Theatre in St. Louis Park, MN - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in St. Louis Park at 5755 Wayzata Blvd. The last film presented there was ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' in January, 1991, and at that time the Cooper was considered the "flagship" in the [[Plitt Theatres|Plitt theatre chain]]. Efforts were made to preserve the theatre, but at the time it did not qualify for national or state historical landmark status (as it was not more than fifty years old) nor were there local preservation laws.  It was torn down in 1992. An office complex with a [[TGI Friday's]] on the west end of the property is there today.

The third super-Cinerama, the [[Indian Hills Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/264/|title=Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, NE - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The Indian Hills theater closed on September 28, 2000 as a result of the bankruptcy of [[Carmike Cinemas]], and the final film presented was the rap music-drama ''Turn It Up.'' The theater was demolished on August 20, 2001.

A fourth, the Kachina Cinerama Theater, was built in Scottsdale, Arizona by Harry L. Nace Theatres on Scottsdale Road and opened on November 10, 1960. It seated 600 people. It later became a Harkins theater, then closed in 1989 to make way for the Scottsdale Galleria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottsdale Remembers - Recollections of Our Past |url= http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/ref/collection/splrem/id/72|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venues outside the USA included the [[Regent Theatre, Melbourne|Regent Plaza]] cinema in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehat.com.au/Melbourne/Theatres/Regent.asp |title=Regent Theatre Melbourne |publisher=Whitehat.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129161236/http://www.whitehat.com.au/melbourne/theatres/Regent.asp |archivedate=2013-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was adapted for Cinerama in 1960 to show ''This is Cinerama'' and ''Seven Wonders of the World''. The Imperial Theatre in Montreal and the Glendale in Toronto were the Canadian homes for Cinerama.
''[[This is Cinerama]]'' received its London premiere on 30 September 1954 at the [[Prince Edward Theatre|Casino Cinerama Theatre]], Old Compton Street, formerly a live theatre. The film ran for 16 months and was followed by the other three strip travelogues. ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' had its World Premiere at the Casino on 1 November 1962 and ran until April 1965 after which the Casino switched to 70mm single lens Cinerama. London had two other three strip venues, making it the only city in the world with three Cinerama theatres. These were the [[London Coliseum|Coliseum Cinerama]], from July 1963 and the [[Peacock Theatre|Royalty Cinerama]] from November 1963, like the Casino both converted live venues. The Coliseum played only one film in three strip (''[[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]]'') before switching to 70mm single lens from December 1963, and the Royalty had two runs of Brothers Grimm separated by a run of ''The Best of Cinerama'' before also switching to 70mm single lens in mid 1964. These London venues were directly operated by Cinerama themselves, elsewhere in the UK three strip Cinerama venues were operated by the two main UK circuits, ABC at ABC Bristol Road, Birmingham and Coliseum, Glasgow, Rank at Gaumont, Birmingham and Queens, Newcastle and by independents at the Park Hall, Cardiff, Theatre Royal, Manchester and Abbey, Liverpool. Most of these conversions of existing cinemas came just as Cinerama was switching to single lens and thus had short lives as three strip venues before switching to 70mm.

Roman Cinerama Theater (now [[Isetann Cinerama Recto]]) at [[Quezon Boulevard]] in Recto, [[Manila]] and Nation Cinerama Theater in [[Araneta Center]], [[Quezon City]] were the only Cinerama theaters built in the [[Philippines]] in the 1960s. Both theaters are now defunct as Roman Super Cinerama burned down in the late 1970s and became Isetann Cinerama Recto in 1988 while Nation Cinerama closed down in the early 1970s it is now Manhattan Parkview Residences built by Megaworld Corporation.

The last Cinerama theater built was the Southcenter Theatre in 1970, opening near the [[Southcenter Mall]] of [[Tukwila, Washington]]. It closed in 2001.

Cinerama also purchased RKO-Stanley Warner (consisting of theaters formerly owned by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[RKO Pictures]]) in 1970.

==Single-film "Cinerama"==
Rising costs of making three-camera widescreen films caused Cinerama to stop making such films in their original form shortly after the first release of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]''. The use of [[Ultra Panavision 70]] for certain scenes (such as the river raft sequence) later printed onto the three Cinerama panels, proved that a more or less satisfactory wide screen image could be photographed without the three cameras. Consequently, Cinerama discontinued the three film process, with the exception of a single theater (McVickers' Cinerama Theatre in Chicago) showing ''Cinerama's Russian Adventure'', an American-Soviet co-production culled from footage of several Soviet films shot in the rival Soviet three-film format known as [[Kinopanorama]] in 1966.

Cinerama continued through the rest of the 1960s as a brand name used initially with the Ultra Panavision 70 widescreen process (which yielded a similar 2.76 aspect ratio to the original Cinerama, although it did not simulate the 146 degree field of view.)  Optically "rectified" prints and special lenses were used to project the 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints onto the curved screen. The films shot in Ultra Panavision for single lens Cinerama presentation were ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965), ''[[The Hallelujah Trail]]'' (1965) and ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'' (1966).

The less wide but still spectacular [[Super Panavision 70]] was used to film the Cinerama presentations ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966);  ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), which also featured scenes shot in [[Todd-AO]] and MCS-70); ''[[Ice Station Zebra (film)|Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968); and ''[[Krakatoa, East of Java]]'' (1969), which also featured scenes shot in Todd-AO.

The other 70mm systems used for single film Cinerama (Sovscope 70 and MCS-70) were similar to [[Super Panavision 70]]. Some films were shot in the somewhat lower resolution Super [[Technirama]] 70 process for Cinerama release, including ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]'' (1964) and ''[[Custer of the West]]'' (1967).

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Cinerama name was used as a film distribution company, ironically reissuing single strip 70&amp;nbsp;mm and 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[Cinemascope]] reduction prints{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} of ''[[This Is Cinerama]]'' (1972).

==Legacy==
The Cinerama company exists today as an entity of the [[Pacific Theatres]] chain. In recent years, surviving and new Cinerama prints have been screened at the following venues:
* the [[Pictureville Cinema]] at the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in Bradford, England beginning in June 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinerama in the UK: The history of 3-strip cinema in Pictureville Cinema|url=https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/cinerama-in-the-uk-the-history-of-3-strip-cinema-in-pictureville-cinema/|website=National Science and Media Museum blog|publisher=National Science and Media Museum|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the New Neon Cinema in [[Dayton, Ohio]], from 1996 to 1999
* the refurbished [[Seattle Cinerama]] in Seattle beginning in 1999
* Pacific Theatres’ [[Cinerama Dome]] in Hollywood beginning in 2002
In 1998, Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]] purchased Seattle's Martin Cinerama, which then underwent a major restoration/upgrade to become the [[Seattle Cinerama]].

As of 2015, the Pictureville Cinema, Seattle Cinerama, and Cinerama Dome continue to hold periodic screenings of three-projector Cinerama movies. The Cinerama Dome was designed for the three-projector system but never actually had it installed until recent years as it opened with the first of the single film 70&amp;nbsp;mm Cinerama films, ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963).

The documentary, ''Cinerama Adventure'' (2003) looked at the history of the Cinerama process, as well as digitally recreating the Cinerama experience via clips of true Cinerama films (using transfers from original Cinerama prints). And [[Turner Entertainment]] (via Warner Bros.) has struck new Cinerama prints of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) for exhibition in true Cinerama theatres around the world.

Cinerama successors, [[Todd-AO]], [[CinemaScope]], and the various 70&amp;nbsp;mm formats, all attempted to equal or surpass its grandeur while avoiding its problems to greater or lesser degrees of success. In movie theaters today the large format [[IMAX]] system continues the tradition, although the screen is taller and often less wide.

In 2008, a [[Blu-ray]] disc of ''How The West Was Won'' was released, offering a recreation of Cinerama for home viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Imagine Seeing John Wayne in IMAX; That's sort of what watching How the West Was Won is like |author=Keith Phipps |date=November 11, 2008 |work=Slate Magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2204189/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Cinerama images were digitally stitched together so that the resulting image does not have the visible seams of older copies. Furthermore, as a second viewing option, 3D mapping technology was used to produce an image that approximates the curved screen, called "SmileBox".

On January 14, 2012, an original Cinerama camera was used to film a sequence at the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]], the original home to [[Famous Players-Lasky]], later to be renamed [[Paramount Pictures]]. This was the first film photographed in the Cinerama process in almost 50 years. This sequence is part of a new 12-minute production filmed entirely in the three panel process. The new film, ''In the Picture'', was presented at a Cinerama festival at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, California on September 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2012/picture/credits/index.htm|title="In the Picture" in 3-strip Cinerama - Cast &amp; Credits|website=www.in70mm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
All but two of the feature-length films produced using the original three-strip Cinerama process were travelogues or episodic documentaries such as ''[[This Is Cinerama]]'' (1952), the first film shot in Cinerama. Other travelogues presented in Cinerama were ''[[Cinerama Holiday]]'' (1955), ''Seven Wonders of the World'' (1955), ''Search for Paradise'' (1957) and ''South Seas Adventure'' (1958). There was also one commercial short, ''Renault Dauphine'' (1960).

Even as the Cinerama travelogues were beginning to lose audiences in the late 50s, the spectacular travelogue ''Windjammer'' (1958) was released in a competing process called [[Cinemiracle]] which claimed to have less noticeable dividing lines on the screen thanks to the reflection of the side images off of mirrors (this also allowed all three projectors to be in the same booth). Due to the small number of Cinemiracle theatres, specially converted prints of ''Windjammer'' were shown in Cinerama theaters in cities which did not have Cinemiracle theaters, and ultimately Cinerama bought up the process.

Only two films with traditional story lines were made, ''[[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]]'' and ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]''. In order to make these films compatible with single film systems for later standard releases, they were shot at 24 frames/s, not the 26 frames/s of traditional Cinerama.

The following feature films have been advertised as being presented "in Cinerama":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr6.htm |title=Cinerama Wing 6 |publisher=Widescreen Museum |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Cinerama" video stretching mode==
RCA uses the word "Cinerama" to refer to a display mode which fills a 16:9 video screen with 4:3 video with, in the words of the manufacturer, "little distortion." Manuals for products offering this mode give no detailed explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkroot.com/tech/index.php/t-59754_Horizon_video_(aspect_ratio)_mode_Zenith_R40W46.html]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One online posting says it consists of "a slight cropping at the top &amp; bottom combined with a slight stretch at only the sides," and praises it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The posting suggests that other vendors provide a similar function under different names. Mitsubishi calls it "stretch" mode. The RCA Scenium TV also has a "stretch mode" as well it is a 4:3 picture stretched straight across.

There is no obvious connection between this video mode and any of the Cinerama motion picture processes. It is not clear why the name is used, unless the nonlinear stretch is vaguely evocative of a curved screen. (Ironically, some widescreen cinema processes&amp;mdash;not Cinerama&amp;mdash;displayed a fault known as "anamorphic mumps,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingup1.htm |title=The Ultra Panavision Wing |publisher=Widescreen Museum |date=1953-04-27 |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of a lateral stretch of objects closer to the camera).

In the U.S., RCA does not appear to have registered the word "Cinerama" as a trademark; conversely, a number of trademarks on "Cinerama," e.g. SN 74270575, are still "live" and held by Cinerama, Inc.

{{About|the direction finding instrument used in navigation}}
[[File:Kompas Sofia.JPG|thumb|A simple dry magnetic portable compass]]
[[File:Smartphone Compass.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[smartphone]] that can be used as a compass because of the [[magnetometer]] inside.]]

A '''compass''' is an instrument used for [[navigation]] and orientation that shows direction relative to the geographic [[cardinal direction]]s (or points). Usually, a diagram called a [[compass rose]] shows the directions [[north]], [[south]], [[east]], and [[west]] on the compass face as abbreviated initials. When the compass is used, the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographic directions; for example, the "N" mark on the rose points northward. Compasses often display markings for angles in degrees in addition to (or sometimes instead of) the rose. North corresponds to 0°, and the angles increase [[clockwise]], so east is 90° degrees, south is 180°, and west is 270°. These numbers allow the compass to show [[azimuth]]s or [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]], which are commonly stated in this notation.

Among the [[Four Great Inventions]], the magnetic compass was first invented as a device for [[divination]] as early as the [[history of science and technology in China|Chinese]] [[Han Dynasty]] (since c. 206 BC),&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua, p. 176"&gt;Li Shu-hua, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge1" /&gt; and later adopted for navigation by the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 367"&gt;Kreutz, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 252"&gt;Needham, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li Shu-hua, p. 182f"&gt;Li Shu-hua, p. 182f.&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage of a compass recorded in [[Western Europe]] and the [[Islamic world]] occurred around 1190.&lt;ref name="Barbara M. Kreutz 370"&gt;Kreutz, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEPST&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0199812578| editor= Ibrahim Kalin | last = Schmidl | first = Petra G. | title = Compass | encyclopedia = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam| date = 2014-05-08| pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Military Compass of J. Lindsay Brough.jpg|thumb|upright|A military compass that was used during [[World War I]]]]
The magnetic compass is the most familiar compass type. It functions as a pointer to "[[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]]", the local magnetic meridian, because the [[magnetize]]d needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The [[magnetic field]] exerts a [[torque]] on the needle, pulling the North end or ''pole'' of the needle approximately toward the Earth's [[North magnetic pole]], and pulling the other toward the Earth's [[South magnetic pole]].&lt;ref&gt;The magnetic lines of force in the Earth's field do not accurately follow great circles around the planet, passing exactly over the magnetic poles. Therefore the needle of a compass only approximately points to the magnetic poles.&lt;/ref&gt;  The needle is mounted on a low-friction pivot point, in better compasses a [[jewel bearing]], so it can turn easily.  When the compass is held level, the needle turns until, after a few seconds to allow oscillations to die out, it settles into its equilibrium orientation.

In navigation, directions on maps are usually expressed with reference to geographical or [[true north]], the direction toward the [[Geographical North Pole]], the rotation axis of the Earth. Depending on where the compass is located on the surface of the Earth the angle between [[true north]] and [[magnetic north]], called [[magnetic declination]] can vary widely with geographic location. The local magnetic declination is given on most maps, to allow the map to be oriented with a compass parallel to true north. The location of the Earth's magnetic poles slowly change with time, which is referred to as [[geomagnetic secular variation]].  The effect of this means a map with the latest declination information should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/compass-declination.html |title=Declination Adjustment on a Compass  |website=Rei.com |access-date=2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some magnetic compasses include means to manually compensate for the magnetic declination, so that the compass shows true directions.

== Non-magnetic compasses ==
There are other ways to find north than the use of magnetism, and from a navigational point of view a total of seven possible ways exist&lt;ref name=”JournalOfNavigation2016” /&gt; (where magnetism is one of the seven). Two sensors that utilize two of the remaining six principles are often also called compasses, i.e. gyrocompass and GPS-compass.

=== Gyrocompass ===
{{Main|Gyrocompass}}
A ''gyrocompass'' is similar to a [[gyroscope]]. It is a non-magnetic compass that finds [[true north]] by using an (electrically powered) fast-spinning wheel and friction forces in order to exploit the rotation of the Earth. Gyrocompasses are widely used on [[ship]]s. They have two main advantages over magnetic compasses:
* they find ''true north'', i.e., the direction of [[Earth]]'s rotational axis, as opposed to [[Magnetic North Pole#Magnetic north and magnetic declination|magnetic north]],
* they are not affected by [[ferromagnetic]] metal (including iron, steel, cobalt, nickel, and various alloys) in a ship's hull. (No compass is affected by nonferromagnetic metal, although a magnetic compass will be affected by any kind of wires with [[electric current]] passing through them.)

Large ships typically rely on a gyrocompass, using the magnetic compass only as a backup. Increasingly, electronic [[fluxgate compass]]es are used on smaller vessels. However, magnetic compasses are still widely in use as they can be small, use simple reliable technology, are comparatively cheap, are often easier to use than [[GPS]], require no energy supply, and unlike GPS, are not affected by objects, e.g. trees, that can block the reception of electronic signals.

=== GPS receivers used as compasses ===
[[GPS receiver]]s using two or more antennae mounted separately and blending the data with an inertial motion unit (IMU) can now achieve 0.02° in heading accuracy and have startup times in seconds rather than hours for gyrocompass systems. The devices accurately determine the positions (latitudes, longitudes and altitude) of the antennae on the Earth, from which the cardinal directions can be calculated. Manufactured primarily for maritime and aviation applications, they can also detect pitch and roll of ships. Small, portable GPS receivers with only a single antenna can also determine directions if they are being moved, even if only at walking pace. By accurately determining its position on the Earth at times a few seconds apart, the device can calculate its speed and the true bearing (relative to ''[[true north]]'') of its direction of motion. Frequently, it is preferable to measure the direction in which a vehicle is actually moving, rather than its heading, i.e. the direction in which its nose is pointing. These directions may be different if there is a crosswind or tidal current.

GPS compasses share the main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North&lt;ref name=”JournalOfNavigation2016”&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gade |first= Kenneth |year= 2016 |title= The Seven Ways to Find Heading |journal= The Journal of Navigation |volume= 69 |issue= 5 |pages=955–970 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/The_Seven_Ways_to_Find_Heading.pdf | format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463316000096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, as opposed to magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone to be affected by mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.

== History ==
{{Main|History of the compass}}
The first compasses in ancient [[Han dynasty]] China were made of [[lodestone]], a naturally magnetized ore of iron.&lt;ref name="cambridge1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowrie|first=William|title=Fundamentals of Geophysics|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0521675963|pages=281|quote=Early in the Han Dynasty, between 300–200 BC, the Chinese fashioned a rudimentary compass out of lodestone&amp;nbsp;... the compass may have been used in the search for gems and the selection of sites for houses&amp;nbsp;... their directive power led to the use of compasses for navigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=Once Upon a Time, the Compass|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=2|pages=60–63|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2316044|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compass was later used for navigation during the [[Song Dynasty]] of the 11th century.&lt;ref name=merrill&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill|first=Ronald T.|title=The Earth's magnetic field: Its history, origin and planetary perspective|year=1983|publisher=Academic press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0124912427|page=1|edition=2nd printing|author2=McElhinny, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone. Dry compasses began to appear around 1300 in [[Medieval Europe]] and the [[Islamic world]].&lt;ref name="Lane, p. 615"&gt;Lane, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEPST /&gt; This was supplanted in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="W. H. Creak 238-239"&gt;W.H. Creak: "The History of the Liquid Compass", ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 56, No. 3 (1920), pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern compasses ==
[[File:walkers compass arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A liquid-filled protractor or orienteering compass with lanyard]]

=== Magnetic compass ===
Modern compasses usually use a magnetized needle or dial inside a capsule completely filled with a liquid (lamp oil, mineral oil, white spirits, purified kerosene, or ethyl alcohol are common). While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result.&lt;ref&gt;''Gear Review: Kasper &amp; Richter Alpin Compass'', OceanMountainSky.Com&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp the movement of the needle, reducing oscillation time and increasing stability.  Key points on the compass, including the north end of the needle are often marked with [[phosphorescent paint|phosphorescent]], [[photoluminescent]], or self-luminous materials&lt;ref&gt;Nemoto &amp; Co. Ltd., [http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/luminova.html Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205120711/http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/luminova.html |date=2008-12-05 }}: In addition to ordinary phosphorescent luminous paint ([[zinc sulfide]]), brighter photoluminescent coatings which include radioactive [[isotope]]s such as [[Strontium-90]], usually in the form of [[strontium aluminate]], or [[tritium]], which is a radioactive isotope of [[hydrogen]] are now being used on modern compasses. Tritium has the advantage that its radiation has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a compass housing.&lt;/ref&gt; to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light.  As the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure, many ordinary liquid-filled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths.

Many modern compasses incorporate a baseplate and [[protractor]] tool, and are referred to variously as "[[orienteering]]", "baseplate", "map compass" or "protractor" designs.  This type of compass uses a separate magnetized needle inside a rotating capsule, an orienting "box" or gate for aligning the needle with magnetic north, a transparent base containing map orienting lines, and a bezel (outer dial) marked in degrees or other units of angular measurement.&lt;ref name=des110&gt;{{cite book | author = Johnson, G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The capsule is mounted in a transparent baseplate containing a ''direction-of-travel'' (DOT) indicator for use in taking bearings directly from a map.&lt;ref name=des110 /&gt;

[[File:Cammenga-lensatic-compass-model-27.jpg|thumb|left|Cammenga air filled lensatic compass]]
Other features found on modern orienteering compasses are map and [[romer]] scales for measuring distances and plotting positions on maps, luminous markings on the face or bezels, various [[sighting compass|sighting mechanisms]] (mirror, prism, etc.) for taking bearings of distant objects with greater precision, gimbal-mounted, "global" needles for use in differing hemispheres, special rare-earth magnets to stabilize compass needles,  adjustable declination for obtaining instant true bearings without resorting to arithmetic, and devices such as [[inclinometer]]s for measuring gradients.&lt;ref name=des110111&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | pages = 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sport of orienteering has also resulted in the development of models with extremely fast-settling and stable needles utilizing rare-earth magnets for optimal use with a topographic map, a land navigation technique known as ''terrain association''.&lt;ref&gt;Kjernsmo, Kjetil, ''[www.learn-orienteering.org/old/buying.html How to use a Compass]'', retrieved 8 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The military forces of a few nations, notably the United States Army, continue to issue field compasses with magnetized compass dials or cards instead of needles.  A magnetic card compass is usually equipped with an optical, lensatic, or prismatic sight, which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the compass card while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective (see photo).  Magnetic card compass designs normally require a separate protractor tool in order to take bearings directly from a map.&lt;ref name=des112&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21-26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 11, pp. 1-3: Any 'floating card' type compass with a straightedge or centerline axis can be used to read a map bearing by orienting the map to magnetic north using a drawn magnetic azimuth, but the process is far simpler with a protractor compass.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. M-1950 military lensatic compass does not use a liquid-filled capsule as a [[damping]] mechanism, but rather [[electromagnetic induction]] to control oscillation of its magnetized card. A "deep-well" design is used to allow the compass to be used globally with a card tilt of up to 8 degrees without impairing accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://landnavigation.org/Documents/Compass%20Mil%20Specs.pdf Article MIL-PRF-10436N]'', rev. 31 October 2003, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense&lt;/ref&gt;  As induction forces provide less damping than fluid-filled designs, a needle lock is fitted to the compass to reduce wear, operated by the folding action of the rear sight/lens holder. The use of air-filled induction compasses has declined over the years, as they may become inoperative or inaccurate in freezing temperatures or extremely humid environments due to condensation or water ingress.&lt;ref&gt;Kearny, Cresson H., ''Jungle Snafus&amp;nbsp;... And Remedies'', Oregon Institute Press (1996), {{ISBN|1884067107}}, pp. 164–170: In 1989, one U.S. Army jungle infantry instructor reported that about 20% of the issue lensatic compasses in his company used in a single jungle exercise in [[Panama]] were ruined within three weeks by rain and humidity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some military compasses, like the U.S. M-1950 ([[Cammenga]] 3H) military lensatic compass, the [[Silva compass|Silva 4b ''Militaire'']], and the [[Suunto]] M-5N(T) contain the radioactive material [[tritium]] ({{nuclide|hydrogen|3}}) and a combination of phosphors.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Defence, ''Manual of Map Reading and Land Navigation'', HMSO Army Code 70947 (1988), {{ISBN|0117726117|978-0117726116}}, ch. 8, sec. 26, pp. 6–7; ch. 12, sec. 39, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. M-1950 equipped with self-luminous lighting contains 120 mCi (millicuries) of tritium. The purpose of the tritium and phosphors is to provide [[Illumination (lighting)|illumination]] for the compass, via [[radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] [[tritium illumination]], which does not require the compass to be "recharged" by sunlight or artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/radioluminescent/armycompass.htm |title=Military Compass |publisher=Orau.org |access-date=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tritium has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years,&lt;ref&gt;[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. p. B247&lt;/ref&gt; so a compass that contains 120&amp;nbsp;mCi of tritium when new will contain only 60 when it is 12 years old, 30 when it is 24 years old, and so on. Consequently, the illumination of the display will fade.

Mariners' compasses can have two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A ''lubber line'', which can be a marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as ''rhumbs''), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended [[gimbal]] within a [[binnacle]]. This preserves the horizontal position.

==== Thumb compass ====
{{Main|Thumb compass}}
[[File:Compasses orienteering.jpg|thumb|Thumb compass on left]]
A '''thumb compass''' is a type of compass commonly used in [[orienteering]], a sport in which map reading and terrain association are paramount.  Consequently, most thumb compasses have minimal or no degree markings at all, and are normally used only to orient the map to magnetic north. An oversized  rectangular needle or north indicator aids visibility. Thumb compasses are also often [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] so that an orienteer can hold a [[Orienteering map|map]] in the hand with the compass and see the map through the compass. The best models use rare-earth magnets to reduce needle settling time to 1 second or less.

=== Solid state compasses ===
{{Main|Magnetometer}}
[[File:Motorola Xoom - AKM Semiconductor AKM8975-1693.jpg|thumb|3-axis electronic magnetometer AKM8975 by [[AKM Semiconductor, Inc.|AKM Semiconductor]]]]
Small compasses found in clocks, [[mobile phone]]s, and other electronic devices are [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) compasses, usually built out of two or three [[magnetic field sensors]] that provide data for a microprocessor. Often, the device is a discrete component which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation. This signal is interpreted by a [[microcontroller|controller]] or [[microprocessor]] and either used internally, or sent to a display unit. The sensor uses highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the Earth's magnetic field.

=== Specialty compasses ===
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard Brunton Geo, used commonly by geologists]]
Apart from navigational compasses, other specialty compasses have also been designed to accommodate specific uses. These include:
* [[Qibla compass]], which is used by Muslims to show the direction to Mecca for prayers.
* Optical or [[Prism (optics)|prismatic]] [[hand bearing compass|hand-bearing compass]], most often used by surveyors, but also by cave explorers, foresters, and geologists. These compasses generally use a liquid-damped capsule&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Melvin G., U.S. Patent No. 4175333, ''Magnetic Compass'', Riverton, Wyoming: The Brunton Company, pub. 27 November 1979: The ''Brunton Pocket Transit'', which uses magnetic induction damping, is an exception.&lt;/ref&gt; and magnetized floating compass dial with an integral optical sight, often fitted with built-in photoluminescent or battery-powered illumination.&lt;ref name=des113114&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | pages = 113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the optical sight, such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object, often to fractions of a degree. Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with high-quality needles and jeweled bearings, and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.&lt;ref name=des113114 /&gt;
* [[Trough compasses]], mounted in a rectangular box whose length was often several times its width, date back several centuries.  They were used for land surveying, particularly with plane tables.

=== Limitations of the magnetic compass ===
[[File:מצפן.jpg|alt=A close up photo of a geological compass|thumb|A close up photo of a geological compass]]
The magnetic compass is very reliable at moderate latitudes, but in geographic regions near the Earth's magnetic poles it becomes unusable.  As the compass is moved closer to one of the magnetic poles, the magnetic declination, the difference between the direction to geographical north and magnetic north, becomes greater and greater. At some point close to the magnetic pole the compass will not indicate any particular direction but will begin to drift. Also, the needle starts to point up or down when getting closer to the poles, because of the so-called [[magnetic inclination]]. Cheap compasses with bad [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] may get stuck because of this and therefore indicate a wrong direction.

Magnetic compasses are influenced by any fields other than Earth's. Local environments may contain magnetic mineral deposits and artificial sources such as [[MRI]]s, large iron or steel bodies, electrical engines or strong permanent magnets. Any electrically conductive body produces its own magnetic field when it is carrying an electric current. Magnetic compasses are prone to errors in the neighborhood of such bodies. Some compasses include magnets which can be adjusted to compensate for external magnetic fields, making the compass more reliable and accurate.

A compass is also subject to errors when the compass is accelerated or decelerated in an airplane or automobile. Depending on which of the Earth's hemispheres the compass is located and if the force is acceleration or deceleration the compass will increase or decrease the indicated heading. Compasses that include compensating magnets are especially prone to these errors, since accelerations tilt the needle, bringing it closer or further from the magnets.

Another error of the mechanical compass is turning error. When one turns from a heading of east or west the compass will lag behind the turn or lead ahead of the turn.  Magnetometers, and substitutes such as gyrocompasses, are more stable in such situations.

== Construction of a magnetic compass ==

=== Magnetic needle ===
A magnetic rod is required when constructing a compass. This can be created by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic [[lodestone]]. This magnetised rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a low friction surface to allow it to freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.

=== Needle-and-bowl device ===
If a needle is rubbed on a [[lodestone]] or other magnet, the needle becomes magnetized. When it is inserted in a cork or piece of wood, and placed in a bowl of water it becomes a compass. Such devices were universally used as compass until the invention of the box-like compass with a 'dry' pivoting needle sometime around 1300.

=== Points of the compass ===

Originally, many compasses were marked only as to the direction of magnetic north, or to the four cardinal points (north, south, east, west). Later, these were divided, in China into 24, and in Europe into 32 equally spaced points around the compass card. For a table of the thirty-two points, see [[points of the compass|compass points]].

In the modern era, the 360-degree system took hold. This system is still in use today for civilian navigators. The degree system spaces 360 equidistant points located clockwise around the compass dial. In the 19th century some European nations adopted the "[[grad (angle)|grad]]" (also called grade or gon) system instead, where a right angle is 100 grads to give a circle of 400 grads.  Dividing grads into tenths to give a circle of 4000 [[decigrade]]s has also been used in armies.

Most military forces have adopted the French "[[millieme (angle)|millieme]]" system.  This is an approximation of a milli-radian (6283 per circle), in which the compass dial is spaced into 6400 units or "mils" for additional precision when measuring angles, laying artillery, etc. The value to the military is that one [[angular mil]] subtends approximately one metre at a distance of one kilometer. Imperial Russia used a system derived by dividing the circumference of a circle into chords of the same length as the radius. Each of these was divided into 100 spaces, giving a circle of 600. The [[Soviet Union]] divided these into tenths to give a circle of 6000 units, usually translated as "mils".  This system was adopted by the former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (e.g. [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]]), often counterclockwise (see picture of wrist compass). This is still in use in Russia.

=== Compass balancing (magnetic dip) ===
Because the Earth's magnetic field's inclination and intensity vary at different latitudes, compasses are often balanced during manufacture so that the dial or needle will be level, eliminating needle drag which can give inaccurate readings.  Most manufacturers balance their compass needles for one of five zones, ranging from zone 1, covering most of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], to zone 5 covering [[Australia]] and the southern oceans. This individual zone balancing prevents excessive dipping of one end of the needle which can cause the compass card to stick and give false readings.&lt;ref name=globalcompass&gt;[http://www.mapworld.co.nz/global.html Global compasses], MapWorld.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some compasses feature a special needle balancing system that will accurately indicate magnetic north regardless of the particular magnetic zone.  Other magnetic compasses have a small sliding counterweight installed on the needle itself. This sliding counterweight, called a 'rider', can be used for counterbalancing the needle against the dip caused by inclination if the compass is taken to a zone with a higher or lower dip.&lt;ref name=globalcompass /&gt;

=== Compass correction ===
{{Main|Magnetic deviation}}
[[File:MuseeMarine-compas-p1000468.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[binnacle]] containing a ship's standard compass, with the two iron balls which correct the effects of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials.  This unit is on display in a museum.]]

Like any magnetic device, compasses are affected by nearby ferrous materials, as well as by strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel [[piton]]s, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy.&lt;ref name=des122&gt;{{cite book | author = Johnson, G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | page = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.

At sea, a ship's compass must also be corrected for errors, called [[Magnetic deviation|deviation]], caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment. The ship is ''swung'', that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the [[lubber line]] can be adjusted so that it is aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials in the compass's environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted on either side of the compass binnacle. The coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; representing the error in the lubber line, while &lt;math&gt;a_1,b_1&lt;/math&gt; the ferromagnetic effects and &lt;math&gt;a_2,b_2&lt;/math&gt; the non-ferromagnetic component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft, with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel. Fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically, and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading.

== Using a magnetic compass ==

[[File:CompassUseTargetMarked.jpg|thumb|When the needle is aligned with and superimposed over the outlined orienting arrow on the bottom of the capsule, the degree figure on the compass ring at the direction-of-travel (DOT) indicator gives the magnetic bearing to the target (mountain).]]

A magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 miles from the true geographic North Pole. A magnetic compass's user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation. [[Magnetic declination|Variation]] is defined as the angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Monte, Most Probable Position, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, 1972, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnetic deviation|Deviation]] refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing. They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.

Mariners are concerned about very accurate measurements; however, casual users need not be concerned with differences between magnetic and true North. Except in areas of extreme magnetic declination variance (20 degrees or more), this is enough to protect from walking in a substantially different direction than expected over short distances, provided the terrain is fairly flat and visibility is not impaired. By carefully recording distances (time or paces) and magnetic bearings traveled, one can plot a course and return to one's starting point using the compass alone.&lt;ref name=des149&gt;{{cite book | author = Johnson, G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | page = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Measuring azimuth with a compass.png|thumb|left|Soldier using a prismatic compass to get an azimuth]]

Compass navigation in conjunction with a map (''terrain association'') requires a different method. To take a map bearing or ''true bearing'' (a bearing taken in reference to true, not magnetic north) to a destination with a [[protractor compass]], the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination (some sources recommend physically drawing a line). The orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude (or the vertical margin of the map), ignoring the compass needle entirely.&lt;ref name=des134135&gt;{{cite book | author = Johnson, G. Mark | date = 2003-03-26 | title = The Ultimate Desert Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 978-0071393034 | pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting ''true bearing'' or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or direction-of-travel (DOT) line, which may be followed as an ''[[azimuth]]'' (course) to the destination. If a ''magnetic'' north bearing or ''compass bearing'' is desired, the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement.&lt;ref name=des134135 /&gt;  In the given example, the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map. Some compasses allow the scale to be adjusted to compensate for the local magnetic declination; if adjusted correctly, the compass will give the true bearing instead of the magnetic bearing.

The modern hand-held [[protractor compass]] always has an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator inscribed on the baseplate. To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or to ensure that the object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using "true" or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract [[magnetic declination]] to convert the ''magnetic bearing'' into a ''true bearing''. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If the hiker has been following the correct path, the compass' corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.

A compass should be laid down on a level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt, the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely, hence not pointing to the magnetic north accurately, giving a faulty reading. To see if the needle is well leveled, look closely at the needle, and tilt it slightly to see if the needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass. If the needle tilts to one direction, tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the compass needle is horizontal, lengthwise. Items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics. Magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle, preventing it from aligning with the Earth's magnetic fields, causing inaccurate readings. The Earth's natural magnetic forces are considerably weak, measuring at 0.5 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it, overpowering the compass needle. Exposure to strong magnets, or magnetic interference can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the compass needle to differ or even reverse. Avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass, for example, certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals, like [[Magnetite]]. This is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster, not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication.  To see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass, get out of the area, and see if the needle on the compass moves. If it does, it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided.

'''Cybernetics''' is a [[transdisciplinary]]&lt;ref name="transdisciplinary"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Müller |first = Albert |title = A Brief History of the BCL |journal = Österreichische Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaften |year = 2000 |volume = 11 |issue = 1 |pages = 9–30 |url = http://bcl.ece.illinois.edu/mueller/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; approach for exploring regulatory [[systems]]—their [[structure]]s, constraints, and possibilities. [[Norbert Wiener]] defined cybernetics in 1948 as "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine."&lt;ref name="W1948"&gt;{{cite book |last = Wiener |first = Norbert |author-link = Norbert Wiener |title = [[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]] |year = 1948 |publisher = [[MIT Press]] |location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the term is often used in a rather loose way to imply "control of any system using technology." In other words, it is the scientific study of how humans, animals and machines control and communicate with each other.

Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop—originally referred to as a "circular causal" relationship—that is, where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner ([[feedback]]) that triggers a system change. Cybernetics is relevant to, for example, mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and [[social systems]]. The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular, [[causality|causal chains]] that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal, and again to action. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite book |last = Kelly |first = Kevin |title = Out of control: The new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages= |isbn = 0-201-48340-8 |oclc = 221860672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cybernetics includes the study of [[feedback]], [[black box]]es and derived concepts such as [[communication]] and [[control theory|control]] in [[life|living organisms]], [[machine]]s and [[organization]]s including [[self-organization]].

Concepts studied by [[cyberneticist]]s include, but are not limited to: [[learning]], [[cognition]], [[adaptation]], [[social control]], [[emergence]], [[Technological convergence|convergence]], [[communication]], [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]], [[efficacy]], and [[Interconnectivity|connectivity]]. In cybernetics these concepts (otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as [[biology]] and [[engineering]]) are abstracted from the context of the specific [[organism]] or [[machine|device]].

The word ''cybernetics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κυβερνητική (''kybernētikḗ''), meaning "governance", i.e., all that are pertinent to κυβερνάω (''kybernáō''), the latter meaning "to steer, navigate or govern", hence κυβέρνησις (''kybérnēsis''), meaning "government", is the government while κυβερνήτης (''kybernḗtēs'') is the governor or "helmperson" of the "ship". Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of [[control systems]], [[circuit theory|electrical network theory]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[logic modeling]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]] in the 1940s, often attributed to the [[Macy Conferences]]. During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved in ways that distinguish first-order cybernetics (about observed systems) from [[second-order cybernetics]] (about observing systems).&lt;ref name="HvF1981"&gt;Heinz von Foerster (1981), 'Observing Systems", Intersystems Publications, Seaside, CA.  {{OCLC|263576422}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there is talk about a third-order cybernetics (doing in ways that embraces first and second-order).&lt;ref name="3rd--order cybernetics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kenny|first=Vincent |title=There's Nothing Like the Real Thing". Revisiting the Need for a Third-Order Cybernetics |journal=Constructivist Foundations|date=15 March 2009|volume=4|issue=2|pages=100–111 |url = http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/journal/4/2/100.kenny |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cybernetics provide a means for examining the design and function of any system, including social systems such as business management and organizational learning, including for the purpose of making them more [[efficiency|efficient]] and [[effective]]. Fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include [[game theory]], [[system theory]] (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics), [[perceptual control theory]], [[sociology]], psychology (especially [[neuropsychology]], [[behavioral psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]]), [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], and [[organizational theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tange, Kenzo (1966) "Function, Structure and Symbol".&lt;/ref&gt; [[System dynamics]], originated with applications of [[electrical engineering]] [[control theory]] to other kinds of [[Simulation modeling|simulation model]]s (especially business systems) by [[Jay Forrester]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the 1950s, is a related field.

== Definitions ==
Cybernetics has been defined in a variety of ways, by a variety of people, from a variety of disciplines. 
Cybernetician [[Stuart Umpleby]] reports some notable definitions:&lt;ref name="LRReader"&gt;{{cite book |first = Stuart |last = Umpleby |authorlink=Stuart Umpleby |title = The Larry Richards Reader 1997–2007 |year=2008 |pages=9–11 |url = http://polyproject.wikispaces.com/file/view/Larry+Richards+Reader+6+08.pdf |chapter=Definitions of Cybernetics |quote = I developed this list of definitions/descriptions in 1987-88 and have been distributing it at ASC (American Society for Cybernetics) conferences since 1988. I added a few items to the list over the next two years, and it has remained essentially unchanged since then. My intent was twofold: (1) to demonstrate that one of the distinguishing features of cybernetics might be that it could legitimately have multiple definitions without contradicting itself, and (2) to stimulate dialogue on what the motivations (intentions, desires, etc.) of those who have proposed different definitions might be.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ideal feedback model.svg|thumb|Simple feedback model. AB &lt; 0 for [[negative feedback]].]]

The term ''cybernetics'' stems from [[w:el:Κυβερνήτης|κυβερνήτης]] (''cybernḗtēs'') "steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder".  As with the ancient Greek pilot, independence of thought is important in cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Timothy. "The Cyberpunk: the individual as reality pilot" in Storming the Reality Studio.  Duke University Press:  1991.&lt;/ref&gt; French physicist and mathematician [[André-Marie Ampère]] first coined the word "cybernetique" in his 1834 essay ''Essai sur la philosophie des sciences'' to describe the science of civil government.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.S. Tsien]]. ''[[Engineering Cybernetics]]'', Preface vii. McGraw Hill, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was borrowed by [[Norbert Wiener]], in his book ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|Cybernetics]]'', to define the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.&lt;ref name="W1948" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Roots of cybernetic theory ===
The word ''cybernetics'' was first used in the context of "the study of self-governance" by [[Plato]] in [[First Alcibiades|''The Alcibiades'']] to signify the [[governance]] of people.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jurlandia.org/cybsoc.htm |last = Johnson |first = Barnabas |title = The Cybernetics of Society |accessdate = 8 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word 'cybernétique' was also used in 1834 by the physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836) to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge.

The first artificial automatic regulatory system was a [[water clock]], invented by the mechanician [[Ktesibios]]; based on a tank which poured water into a reservoir before using it to run the mechanism, it used a cone-shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir. This was the first artificial truly automatic self-regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism. Although they considered this part of engineering (the use of the term ''cybernetics'' is much posterior), [[Ktesibios]] and others such as [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]] and [[Su Song]] are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles.

The study of ''[[Teleology|teleological]] mechanisms'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] τέλος or ''télos'' for ''end'', ''goal'', or ''purpose'') in machines with ''corrective feedback'' dates from as far back as the late 18th century when [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]]'s steam engine was equipped with a [[governor (device)|governor]] (1775–1800), a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] identified this as the principle of [[evolution]] in his famous 1858 paper.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S043.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices. [[Jakob von Uexküll]] applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle (''Funktionskreis'') in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general.

===Early 20th century===
Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of [[control systems]], [[Circuit theory|electrical network theory]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[logic modeling]], [[evolutionary biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in the 1940s; the ideas are also related to the biological work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] in General Systems Theory.  Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] engineer [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black]] on using [[negative feedback]] to control amplifiers.

Early applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during [[World War II]].  The founder of [[System Dynamics]], [[Jay Wright Forrester|Jay Forrester]], worked with [[Gordon S. Brown]] during WWII as a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT to develop electronic control systems for the U.S. Navy. Forrester later applied these ideas to social organizations, such as corporations and cities and became an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].

[[W. Edwards Deming]], the [[Total Quality Management]] guru for whom Japan named its top post-WWII industrial [[Deming Prize|prize]], was an intern at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Labs]] in 1927 and may have been influenced by [[network theory]]; Deming made "Understanding Systems" one of the four pillars of what he described as "Profound Knowledge" in his book ''The New Economics''.

Numerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field. In 1935 Russian physiologist [[Pyotr Anokhin|P. K. Anokhin]] published a book in which the concept of feedback ("back afferentation") was studied. The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943: "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology" by [[Arturo Rosenblueth]], [[Norbert Wiener]], and [[Julian Bigelow]]; and the paper "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" by [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]].

In 1936, [[Ștefan Odobleja]] published "Phonoscopy and the clinical semiotics". In 1937, he participated in the IX International Congress of Military Medicine with "Demonstration de phonoscopie"; in the paper he disseminated a prospectus announcing his future work, "Psychologie consonantiste", the most important of his writings, where he lays the theoretical foundations of generalized cybernetics. The book, published in Paris by ''Librairie Maloine'' (vol. I in 1938 and vol. II in 1939), contains almost 900 pages and includes 300 figures in the text. The author wrote at the time that "this book is ... a table of contents, an index or a dictionary of psychology, [for] a ... great Treatise of Psychology that should contain 20–30 volumes". Due to the beginning of World War II, the publication went unnoticed (the first Romanian edition of this work did not appear until 1982).

Cybernetics as a discipline was firmly established by [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|McCulloch]], [[Arturo Rosenblueth]] and others, such as [[W. Ross Ashby]], mathematician [[Alan Turing]], and [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]] (one of the first to build autonomous robots as an aid to the study of animal behaviour).  In the spring of 1947, Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis, held in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] ([[France]] was an important geographical locus of early cybernetics together with the [[United States|US]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]]); the event was organized by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], a French scientific society, and mathematician [[Szolem Mandelbrojt]] (1899–1983), uncle of the world-famous mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]]. During this stay in France, Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics, which is found in the study of [[Brownian motion]] and in telecommunication engineering. The following summer, back in the United States, Wiener decided to introduce the neologism ''cybernetics'', coined to denote the study of "teleological mechanisms", into his scientific theory: it was popularized through his book ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]'' (MIT Press/John Wiley and Sons, NY, 1948)&lt;ref name="W1948" /&gt;. In the UK this became the focus for the [[Ratio Club]].

[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|upright|John von Neumann]]

In the early 1940s [[John von Neumann]], although better known for his work in mathematics and computer science, did contribute a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics: [[von Neumann cellular automata]], and their logical follow up, the [[von Neumann Universal Constructor]].  The result of these deceptively simple thought-experiments was the concept of [[self replication]], which cybernetics adopted as a core concept.  The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social [[memes]], living cells, and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study.

In 1950, Wiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics, drawing analogies between automatic systems (such as a regulated steam engine) and human institutions in his best-selling ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]: Cybernetics and Society'' (Houghton-Mifflin).

In the [[Soviet Union]] "bourgeois" cybernetics was initially considered a "pseudoscience" and "ideological weapon" of "imperialist reactionaries" (Soviet Philosophical Dictionary, 1954) and later criticised as a narrow form of cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;''Философский словарь'' (Philosophical dictionary), 1954; "Cybernetics", ''The Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid to late 1950s [[Viktor Glushkov]] and others salvaged the reputation of the field. Soviet cybernetics incorporated much of what became known as computer science in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glushkov |first=Viktor |date=1966 |title=Introduction to Cybernetics |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |ISBN = 0122868501 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics, the Biological Computer Lab at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], under the direction of [[Heinz von Foerster]], was a major center of cybernetic research for almost 20 years, beginning in 1958.

===Split from artificial intelligence===
[[Artificial intelligence]] (AI) was founded as a distinct discipline at the [[Dartmouth workshop]]. After some uneasy coexistence, AI gained funding and prominence. Consequently, cybernetic sciences such as the study of [[artificial neural network]]s were downplayed; the discipline shifted into the world of social sciences and therapy.&lt;ref name="Cariani2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cariani |first=Peter |title=On the importance of being emergent |journal=Constructivist Foundations |date=15 March 2010 |volume=5 |issue=2 |url = http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/journal/5/2/086.cariani |accessdate=13 August 2012 |page=89 |quote = artificial intelligence was born at a conference at Dartmouth in 1956 that was organized by McCarthy, Minsky, rochester, and shannon, three years after the Macy conferences on cybernetics had ended (Boden 2006; McCorduck 1972). The two movements coexisted for roughly a de- cade, but by the mid-1960s, the proponents of symbolic ai gained control of national funding conduits and ruthlessly defunded cybernetics research. This effectively liquidated the subfields of self-organizing systems, neural networks and adaptive machines, evolutionary programming, biological computation, and bionics for several decades, leaving the workers in management, therapy and the social sciences to carry the torch. i think some of the polemical pushing-and-shoving between first-order control theorists and second-order crowds that i witnessed in subsequent decades was the cumulative result of a shift of funding, membership, and research from the "hard" natural sciences to "soft" socio-psychological interventions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent cyberneticians during this period include [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Axel Berg (cybernetician)|Aksel Berg]].

=== New cybernetics ===
In the 1970s, [[new cybernetics|new cyberneticians]] emerged in multiple fields, but especially in [[biology]]. The ideas of [[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela|Varela]] and [[Henri Atlan|Atlan]], according to Jean-Pierre Dupuy (1986) "realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organizations which mankind discovers in nature - organizations he has not himself invented".&lt;ref name="JPD86"&gt;Jean-Pierre Dupuy, "The autonomy of social reality: on the contribution of systems theory to the theory of society" in: Elias L. Khalil &amp; [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] eds., ''Evolution, Order and Complexity'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1980s the question of whether the features of this new cybernetics could be applied to social forms of organization remained open to debate.&lt;ref name="JPD86" /&gt;

In [[political science]], [[Project Cybersyn]] attempted to introduce a cybernetically controlled economy during the early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loeber|first=Katharina|last2=Loeber|first2=Katharina|date=2018-04-13|title=Big Data, Algorithmic Regulation, and the History of the Cybersyn Project in Chile, 1971–1973|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/7/4/65|journal=Social Sciences|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=65|doi=10.3390/socsci7040065}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 1980s, according to Harries-Jones (1988) "unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political [[actor]]s and subgroups, and the practical and reflexive consciousness of the subjects who produce and reproduce the structure of a political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regards to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves".&lt;ref name="PHJ 88"&gt;Peter Harries-Jones (1988), "The Self-Organizing Polity: An Epistemological Analysis of Political Life by Laurent Dobuzinskis" in: ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' (Revue canadienne de science politique), Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1988), pp. 431-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of the emerging new cybernetics considered in that time by [[Felix Geyer]] and [[Hans van der Zouwen]], according to Bailey (1994),&lt;ref name="KB 94"&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]] (1994), ''Sociology and the New Systems Theory: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis'', p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; was "that it views information as constructed and reconstructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides an [[epistemology|epistemological]] foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the ''micro-macro gap''. That is, it links the individual with the society".&lt;ref name="KB 94" /&gt; Another characteristic noted was the "transition from classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics [that] involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. These shifts in thinking involve, among others, (a) a change from emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factor which guides the steering decisions; and (b) new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other".&lt;ref name="KB 94" /&gt;

Recent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics, systems of control and emergent behavior, by such related fields as [[game theory]] (the analysis of group interaction), [[evolutionarily stable strategy|systems of feedback in evolution]], and [[metamaterials]] (the study of materials with properties beyond the Newtonian properties of their constituent atoms), have led to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

===Cybernetics and economic systems===
{{Economic systems sidebar | Coordination }}

The design of self-regulating control systems for a real-time planned economy was explored by [[Viktor Glushkov]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible [[economic planning]] based on computers, the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Feinstein |first = C.H. |title = Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth: Essays Presented to Maurice Dobb |publisher = Cambridge University Press |date = September 1969 |ISBN = 978-0521049870 |page = 175 |quote = At some future date it may appear as a joke of history that socialist countries learned at long last to overcome their prejudices and to dismantle clumsy planning mechanisms in favour of more effective market elements just at a time when the rise of computers and of cybernetics laid the foundation for greater opportunities in comprehensive planning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually collapsed.

More recent proposals for socialism involve "New Socialism", outlined by the computer scientists [[Paul Cockshott]] and [[Allin Cottrell]], where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially-owned enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Allin Cottrell &amp; W.Paul Cockshott, [http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/index.html ''Towards a new socialism''] (Nottingham, England: Spokesman, 1993). Retrieved: 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Neoliberalism|neoliberals]] such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] also mention cybernetics as a discipline that could help economists understand the "self-organizing or self-generating systems" called [[Market (economics)|markets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty: Volume 1: Rules and Order|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Being a "complex phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the best way to examine the market functioning is by using the feedback mechanism, explained by cybernetic theorists. That way, economists could make "pattern predictions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|date=Fall 2002|title=Competition as a discovery procedure|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics|volume=5|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Therefore, the market for Hayek is a "communication system", an "efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New studies in philosophy, politics, economics and the history of ideas|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|isbn=|location=London|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The economist and a cyberneticist are like garderners who are "providing the appropriate environment"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

Finally, Hayek also considers that [[Adam Smith]]'s idea of the [[invisible hand]] is as anticipation of the operation of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty: Volume 3: Political Order of a Free People|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same book, [[Law, Legislation and Liberty]], Hayek mentions, along with cybernetics, that economists should rely on the scientific findings of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] [[Systems theory|general systems theory]], along with information and [[communication theory]] and [[semiotics]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Subdivisions of the field==
Cybernetics is sometimes used as a generic term, which serves as an umbrella for many systems-related scientific fields.

=== In sociology ===
By examining group behavior through the lens of cybernetics, sociologists can seek the reasons for such spontaneous events as [[smart mob]]s and [[riots]], as well as how communities develop rules such as etiquette by consensus without formal discussion{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. [[Affect Control Theory]] explains [[role]] behavior, [[emotion]]s, and [[labeling theory]] in terms of homeostatic maintenance of sentiments associated with cultural categories. The most comprehensive attempt ever made in the social sciences to increase cybernetics in a generalized theory of society was made by [[Talcott Parsons]]. In this way, cybernetics establishes the basic hierarchy in Parsons' [[AGIL paradigm]], which is the ordering system-dimension of his [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]]. These and other cybernetic models in sociology are reviewed in a book edited by McClelland and Fararo.&lt;ref name="McClelland"&gt;McClelland, Kent A., and Thomas J. Fararo (Eds.). 2006.

===In education===
A model of cybernetics in Education was introduced by Gihan Sami Soliman; an educational consultant, as a project idea to be implemented with the help of two team members in Sinai. The Sinai Sustainability Cybernetics Center announced as a semi-finalist project by MIT annual competition 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSCC (Sinai Sustainability Cybernetics Center)|url=http://www.mitefarab.org/2013/04/sscc-sinai-sustainability-cybernetics-center-the-46th-team-to-qualify-for-this-years-semi-finalist-round/|publisher=MIT Enterprise Forum, Pan Arab Region}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/80769 "SSCC (Sinai Sustainability Cybernetics Center)" the 46th team to qualify for this year's MIT semi-finalist round — Naharnet].

The project idea proposed relating education to sustainable development through an IMS project that applies a multiple educational program related to the original natural self-healing system of life on earth. Education, sustainable development, social justice disciplines interact in a causal circular relationship that education would contribute to the development of the local community in Sinai village, on both sustainability and  social responsibility levels while the community itself provides a unique  learning environment that will contribute to the development of the educational program in a closed signaling loop.

===In art===
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The prominent and influential [[Cybernetic Serendipity]] exhibition was held at the ICA in 1968 curated by [[Jasia Reichardt]], including Schöffer's ''CYSP I'' and Gordon Pask's ''Colloquy of Mobiles'' installation. Pask's reflections on ''Colloquy'' connected it to his earlier ''Musicolour'' installation and to he what he termed "aesthetically potent environments", a concept that connected this artistic work to his concerns with teaching and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Pask, G.

The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (''Cybernetica'', Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (''Leonardo'' Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature |year=2002 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, CA |pages=255–277 |editors=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A.

===In Earth system science===
Geocybernetics aims to study and control the complex co-evolution of [[Earth's spheres|ecosphere]] and [[anthroposphere]],&lt;ref name="Schellnhuber (1998)"&gt;Schellnhuber, H.-J., Discourse: Earth system analysis - The scope of the challenge, pp. 3-195. In: Schellnhuber, H.-J. and Wenzel, V. (Eds.). 1998. Earth system analysis: Integrating science for sustainability. Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, for dealing with planetary problems such as anthropogenic [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Schellnhuber (1999)"&gt;Schellnhuber, H.-J., Earth system analysis and the second Copernican revolution. ''Nature'', 402, C19-C23. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Geocybernetics applies a [[dynamical systems]] perspective to [[Earth system analysis]]. It provides a theoretical framework for studying the implications of following different [[sustainability]] paradigms on co-evolutionary trajectories of the planetary [[socio-ecological system]] to reveal [[attractor]]s in this system, their stability, resilience and reachability. Concepts such as [[wikt:tipping point|tipping point]]s in the [[climate system]], [[planetary boundaries]], the [[safe operating space]] for humanity and proposals for manipulating Earth system dynamics on a global scale such as [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] have been framed in the language of geocybernetic Earth system analysis.

=== In sport ===
A model  of cybernetics in Sport was introduced by Yuri Verkhoshansky and Mel C. Siff in 1999 in their book ''Supertraining''.

=== In law ===
As a form of regulation, cybernetics has been always close to [[law]], specially in [[regulation]] and [[legal science]]s, through the next topics:
* [[Organization]]s and [[superorganism]]s
* [[Ontology]], [[logic]] and [[artificial intelligence]]
* [[Complex adaptive systems]]
* [[Smart contract]]s 
* [[Control system (disambiguation)|Control systems]]   
* [[Self-organization in cybernetics]]
* [[Cyberethics]]
* [[Regulation]]
* [[Consensus]]  systems
* [[Metagovernment]]

==Related fields==

=== Complexity science ===
Complexity science attempts to understand the nature of complex systems.
* [[Complex adaptive system]]
* [[Complex systems]]
* [[Computational complexity theory|Complexity theory]]

=== Biomechatronics ===
[[Biomechatronics]] relates to linking [[mechatronics]] to biological organisms, leading to systems that conform to A. N. Kolmogorov's definition of Cybernetics: "Science concerned with the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving, storing and processing information so as to use it for control".{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} From this perspective mechatronics are considered [[technical cybernetics]] or [[engineering cybernetics]].

'''Design research''' was originally constituted as primarily research into the process of design, developing from work in [[design methods]], but the concept has been expanded to include research embedded within the process of design, including work concerned with the context of designing and research-based design practice. The concept retains a sense of generality, aimed at understanding and improving design processes and practices quite broadly, rather than developing domain-specific knowledge within any professional field of design.

== Origins ==

Design Research emerged as a recognisable field of study in the 1960s, initially marked by a conference on [[Design methods]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J C and D G Thornley (eds) (1963) Conference on Design Methods, Oxford, UK: Pergamon Press&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Imperial College London]], in 1962. It led to the founding of the [[Design Research Society]] (DRS) in 1966. [[John Christopher Jones]] (one of the initiators of the 1962 conference) founded a postgraduate Design Research Laboratory at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]], and [[L. Bruce Archer]] supported by [[Misha Black]] founded the postgraduate Department of Design Research at the [[Royal College of Art]], London, becoming the first Professor of Design Research.&lt;ref&gt;DRS2016 Online Exhibition http://www.drs2016.org/exhibition/#ddr1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design Research Society has always stated its aim as: ‘to promote the study of and research into the process of [[design]]ing in all its many fields’. Its purpose therefore is to act as a form of [[Learned|learned society]], taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing.

Some of the origins of design methods and design research lay in the emergence after the 2nd World War of [[Operations research|operational research]] methods and management decision-making techniques, the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s, and the beginnings of computer programs for problem solving in the 1960s.

Simon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early work==

Early work was mainly within the domains of [[architecture]] and [[industrial design]], but research in engineering design developed strongly in the 1980s; for example, through ICED&amp;mdash;the series of International Conferences on Engineering Design, now run by [[The Design Society]]. These developments were especially strong in Germany and Japan. In the USA there were also some important developments in design theory and methodology, including the publications of the Design Methods Group and the series of conferences of the [[Environmental Design Research Association]]. The [[National Science Foundation]] initiative on design theory and methods led to substantial growth in engineering design research in the late-1980s. A particularly significant development was the emergence of the first journals of design research. DRS initiated [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/destud ''Design Studies''] in 1979, ''[[Design Issues]]'' appeared in 1984, and ''Research in Engineering Design'' in 1989.

== Development ==

The development of design research has led to the establishment of design as a coherent discipline of study in its own right, based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them. Bruce Archer again encapsulated the view in stating his new belief that ‘there exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating, and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of enquiry when applied to its own kinds of problems’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This view was developed further in a series of papers by [[Nigel Cross]], collected as a book on 'Designerly Ways of Knowing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Design research ‘came of age’ in the 1980s, and has continued to expand. This was helped by the development of a research base, including doctoral programmes, within many of the design schools located within new institutions that were previously art colleges, and the emergence of new areas such as interaction design. More new journals have appeared, such as ''The Design Journal'', the'' Journal of Design Research'', ''CoDesign'' and more recently ''Design Science''. There has also been a major growth in conferences, with not only a continuing series by DRS, but also series such as Design Thinking, Doctoral Education in Design, Design Computing and Cognition, Design and Emotion, the European Academy, the Asian Design Conferences, etc. Design research now operates on an international scale, acknowledged in the cooperation of DRS with the Asian design research societies in the founding in 2005 of the International Association of Societies of Design Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1619">A '''disc mill''' is a type of [[crusher]] that can be used to grind, cut, shear, shred, fiberize, pulverize, granulate, crack, rub, curl, fluff, twist, hull, blend, or refine.  It works in a similar manner to the ancient [[grinder (milling)#Buhrstone mill|Buhrstone mill]] in that the feedstock is fed between opposing discs or plates. The discs may be grooved, serrated, or spiked.

== Applications ==

Typical applications for a single-disc mill are all three stages of the wet milling of field [[maize|corn]], manufacture of [[peanut butter]], processing [[nut shells]], [[ammonium nitrate]], [[urea]], producing chemical slurries and recycled paper slurries, and grinding [[chromium]] metal.

Double-disc mills are typically used for alloy powders, [[aluminum]] chips, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], barley, [[borax]], brake lining scrap, [[brass]] chips, [[sodium hydroxide]], chemical salts, [[coconut]] shells, [[copper]] powder, [[cork (material)|cork]], [[cottonseed]] hulls, pharmaceuticals, [[feathers]], [[hops]], [[leather]], [[oilseed cakes]], [[phosphates]], rice, [[rosin]], [[sawdust]], and [[seeds]]. 

Disc mills are relatively expensive to run and maintain and they consume much more power than other shredding machines, and are not used where [[ball mill]]s or [[hammermill]]s produce the desired results at a lower cost.

== Mechanism ==
Substances are crushed between the edge of a thick, spinning disk and something else. Some mills cover the edge of the disk in blades to chop up incoming matter rather than crush it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22511">'''Environmental stress screening''' ('''ESS''') refers to the process of exposing a newly manufactured or repaired product or component (typically electronic) to stresses such as thermal cycling and [[oscillation|vibration]] in order to force latent defects to manifest themselves by permanent or catastrophic failure during the screening process. The surviving population, upon completion of screening, can be assumed to have a higher reliability than a similar unscreened population.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental Stress Screening: Its Quantification, Optimization and Management|author1=Kececioglu, D.|author2=Sun, F.B.|date=2003|publisher=DEStech publications|isbn=9781932078046|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eeXxg0ZZ38C|accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Developed to help electronics manufacturers detect product defects and production flaws, ESS is widely used in military and aerospace applications, less so for commercial products. The tests need not be elaborate, for example, switching an electronic or electrical system on and off a few times may be enough to catch some simple defects that would otherwise be encountered by the end user very soon after the product was first used. Tests typically include the following:

* Temperature variations
* Vibration tests
* Pressure
* Flexibility tests

ESS can be performed as part of the manufacturing process or it can be used in new product qualification testing.

An ESS system usually consists of a [[environmental chamber|test chamber]], controller, fixturing, interconnect and wiring, and a functional tester. These systems can be purchased from a variety of companies in the environmental test industry.

The stress screening from this process will help find infant mortality in the product. Finding these failures before the product reaches the customer yields better quality and lower warranty expenses. Associated military terminology includes an operational requirements document ('''ORD''') and on-going reliability testing ('''ORT''').&lt;ref name="accoladeeng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accoladeeng.com/ess_tutorial.pdf|date=9 March 2004|title=Environmental Stress Screening Tutorial|author=Bruce Peterson|publisher=Accolade Engineering Solutions|accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tutorialsweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tutorialsweb.com/reliability/reliability5.1.htm|title=Environmental Stress Screening|publisher=tutorialsweb.com|accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardized Definitions and Methods==
''''''The following is extracted from a paper on ESS testing prepared by the U.S. Air Force to provide standardized definitions and methods. The paper is available for unrestricted distribution by writing to OO-ALC/ENR, Hill AFB, Ut. 84056. Ask for OO-ALC Technical Note 01-2002, Environmental Stress Screening of Replacement and Repaired Components, Standardized Definitions and Process, by David Franz.''''''

==Introduction==
The purpose of this paper is to provide standardized definitions and a roadmap of test processes for the Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) of replacement and repaired components used on Air Force systems. The term “component” is used interchangeably with the term “unit” and includes [[Line-replaceable unit]] (LRU) and sub-units (SRU). A component selected for testing is a Unit Under Test (UUT). Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) policy and instructions require consistency in the disciplined engineering process used to ensure that activities such as maintenance repairs and part substitutions do not degrade system or end-item baselined characteristics over their operational life. Baselined characteristics are highly dependent on reliability, which is verified and maintained by ESS testing. OSS&amp;E policy and instructions also require consistent engineering processes to ensure manufacturing and repair entities are accountable for delivering quality products, and to provide selection and qualification criteria for new sources of supply. Determinations of product quality and source capabilities usually require ESS testing. While considerable information concerning ESS methods and procedures is available including [[United States Military Standard]]s, handbooks, guides, and the original equipment manufacturer’s test plans, often these publications use differing and confusing definitions for the testing phases where ESS is applied. Lengthy explanations were needed to clarify contract clauses citing these publications. This paper ensures testing requirements are uniformly applied and clearly understood in writing source qualification requirements and contracts.

==Visual Inspection==

===Purpose===
To ensure that good workmanship has been employed and that the UUT is free of obvious physical defects.

===Method===
Visually inspect UUT before and after each manufacturing, repair, and test operation.
*Verify proper labeling, weight, and dimensions.
*With the unaided eye, inspect all accessible areas of the UUT.
*Under 10X minimum magnification, inspect all critical surfaces and interfaces of the UUT.

===Pass/Fail Criteria===
Workmanship shall meet the applicable standards including T.O. 00-25-234 and shall be free of obvious physical defects. A unit that exhibits any sign that a part is stressed beyond its design limit (cracked circuit boards, loose connectors and/or screws, bent clamps and/or screws, worn parts, etc.) is considered to have failed even if the UUT passes the Functional Testing.

==Functional Testing==

===Purpose===
Done before, during, and after ESS testing to verify that the UUT is functioning within design tolerances.

===Method===
Applying an input signal or stimulus and measuring the output.

===Pass/Fail Criteria===
Output responses/signals must be within technical data specifications, and the UUT must operate satisfactorily in the next higher assembly.

==Environmental Stress Screening (ESS)==

===Purpose===
Testing at the physical environmental conditions (shock, vibration, temperature, altitude, humidity, etc.) that simulate those encountered over the operational life of the component. Random vibration and temperature cycling have proven to be the most successful forms of ESS in terms of effective flaw precipitation.

===Method===
A stress profile is developed and applied to the UUT. The profile simulates the environmental conditions encountered during transportation, storage, handling, and operational use phases. The UUT is configured to match the phase, e.g. transportation shocks are applied with the UUT in the shipping container, operational use temperature cycles are applied with the UUT operating.

===Pass/Fail Criteria===
The UUT(Unit Under Test) must pass Functional Testing and Visual Inspection before, during, and after ESS.

==Qualification ESS==
The testing of a production-representative unit to demonstrate that the design, manufacturing, assembly, and repair processes have resulted in hardware that conforms to the specification. Satisfactory completion of Qualification Testing denotes readiness for further stages of testing. Limited flight testing may be acceptable before completion of all phases of Qualification Testing.

===Production Unit Qualification Testing===
*Purpose:  Done for qualification of a new manufacturer, design, process, or facility to ensure the adequacy and suitability of the design to reliably operate during and after exposure to environmental stresses that exceed operational environment predictions by a prescribed margin.
*Method:  Per [[Mil-Std-810]]G for LRUs and SRUs, per Mil-Std-202G for electronic piece parts, per Mil-Std-1540 for space systems, and per [[Mil-Std-883]]H for microelectronic devices. EMI/RFI Testing is usually included in ESS Qualification Testing and requires application of [[MIL-STD 461]]E. These Military Standards require tailoring. Mil-HDBKs-340, 343, 344 and 2164 provide detailed guidance. Sequence of First Production Article testing:  Visual Inspection and Functional – Preconditioning – Acceptance ESS – Acceptance Reliability – Visual Inspection &amp; Functional – Qualification ESS – Visual Inspection &amp; Functional –Qualification Reliability – Visual Inspection &amp; Functional.
*Note:  Qualification Testing usually includes ‘aggravated’ ESS testing, i.e. test to actual environmental levels and duration plus a margin (typically 10&amp;nbsp;°C, 6&amp;nbsp;dB). Adding margin is  required due to the statistically small sample size and uncertainties in actual environmental levels. Since this is a [[destructive test]], the UUT shall never be fielded in operational systems.
*Note:  Must do Acceptance Testing including Pre-Conditioning first. This is because these tests are done on all production units and so become parts of the environmental stress profile.
*Note:  Another manufacturer (second-source) building the same unit or a replacement unit that is intended as a form-fit-and-function replacement for the original unit or unit sub-assembly must be qualified to specifications equivalent to those used for the original source.

===Repaired Unit Qualification Testing===
*Purpose:  Performed on First Repaired Article or Pre-Qualification Repaired Article units to qualify a new repair source or repair method. It is also performed to evaluate substitute piece parts.
*Method:  If the repair parts and processes are equivalent to the original manufacturing parts and processes, then use the Repaired Unit Acceptance Test performed by the contractor, followed by Government inspection and operation in the next higher assembly. If the parts and processes are not known to be equivalent, then use applicable areas of the Production Unit Qualification Testing. Sequence of PreQual Repaired Article / First Repaired Article testing:  Visual Inspection &amp; Functional – Preconditioning – Acceptance ESS – Visual Inspection &amp; Functional – Gov't Inspection &amp; Functional.
*Note:  Due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), substitutions of piece parts are often necessary. Substitute parts that appear under ambient test bench conditions to function like the original parts can exhibit unsatisfactory performance in the operational environment.
*Qualification by Similarity. Qualification of a replacement or repaired unit by similarity to the original unit requires that the units are essentially identical. In addition, the replacement unit must have previously been qualified by testing to environmental and operational performance requirements meeting or exceeding the environmental and operational requirements of the original unit.

==Acceptance ESS==
Formal tests conducted to demonstrate acceptability of the individual unit for delivery. They demonstrate performance to purchase specification requirements and act as quality control screens to detect deficiencies of workmanship and materials. The successful completion of such tests denotes acceptance of the unit by the procurement agency.

===Production Unit Acceptance Testing===
*Purpose:  Done on 100% of new units to detect workmanship and process errors. Inspection of some microelectronic devices is destructive so lot sampling is used for acceptance testing (see paragraph 8.3.2).
* Method:  Tailored down from applicable Production Qualification Test but done to workmanship levels, no more severe than actual environmental levels and of shortened duration. Usually these tests are structured to include the Pre-Conditioning and Reliability Acceptance Testing requirements. Sequence for Components testing:  Visual Inspection &amp; Functional – Preconditioning – Acceptance ESS – Acceptance Reliability – Visual Inspection &amp; Functional.
*Note:  Production Unit Acceptance Testing performance data is also used to evaluate "in-family" performance. While a UUT may meet all other Acceptance Test pass/fail criteria, results which deviate significantly from other units within the production lot shall require rejection of that unit.

==Repaired Unit Acceptance Testing==
*Purpose:  Performed on 100% of repaired units to detect workmanship and process errors.
*Method:  Tailored down from applicable Production Acceptance Tests. To maintain the specified reliability criteria, Pre-Conditioning Testing should be included if the repair parts are not pre-conditioned or the repair workmanship can be expected to induce failures. Sequence for Components testing:  Visual Inspection &amp; Functional – Preconditioning – Acceptance ESS – Visual Inspection &amp; Functional.
*Note:  Test levels are low and not destructive so testing may be repeated for test failures and subsequent repairs without significantly aging the UUT.
*Note:  Types and levels of testing may have to be increased if infant mortality failures are occurring in operational use. Conversely, if a statistically significant sampling demonstrates that infant mortality failures are not occurring, ESS tests may be reduced or eliminated. Functional Testing is still required.
*Note:  Testing must strike a balance between the probability that the repairs have 	  induced a defect, and the probability that the testing can detect that defect. For example, a reduced number of temperature cycles has a lower probability of detecting a defect, but may be appropriate if the repair is minor and has little risk of inducing a defect.
*Note:  Repaired Unit Acceptance Testing performance data is also used to evaluate "in-family" performance. While a UUT may meet all other Acceptance Test pass/fail criteria, results which deviate significantly from other repaired units or from the original Production Unit Acceptance Test data shall require rejection of the UUT.

==Reliability ESS==
This should be part of the Qualification and Acceptance ESS when verification of reliability is required.

===Reliability Qualification Testing===
*Purpose:  Done on the production qualification UUT to demonstrate life-cycle compliance with the reliability specifications per Mil-Std-781, and the original manufacturer’s development specifications.
*Method:  Use Mil-Hdbk-781A. The UUT is usually tested to actual environmental levels, but margin is added if accelerated aging is required.
*Note:  Must do Acceptance Testing including Pre-Conditioning first. This is because these tests are done on all production units and so become parts of the environmental stress profile.
*Note:  The presence of redundancy in the design is not reason to eliminate reliability tests. Redundancy is used to compensate for any unknown and untested failure modes, and for damage tolerance. Redundancy only increases reliability by a small amount.

===Reliability Acceptance Testing===
*Purpose:  Done on all production units to find any unit with reliability degradation due to daily variations in the production process and workmanship.
*Method:  Vibration (typically 0.04 G2/Hz for 5 minutes/axis) and temperature for 3+ cycles, last one failure-free.
*Note:  Usually only done on high reliability (3-sigma) and safety of flight items.

===Pre-Conditioning Testing. Also called Burn-In Testing===
*Purpose:  Done on all active unit LRUs, SRUs, and piece parts (production, spare, and  repair) to find [[bathtub curve|‘infant mortality’]] of parts and workmanship.
*Method:  per Mil-Std-750D, [[Mil-Std-883]]E, and Mil-Std-202G.
*Note:  Most mil-spec piece parts have not been pre-conditioned by the part manufacturer.

==UUT Categories==

===Passive Unit===
*Examples:  chassis, antenna coupler, optics without moving parts, wiring harness.
*Note:  Requires Qualification ESS of the design and processes, usually in the next higher assembly. Acceptance Testing is limited to Visual Inspection and Operational Testing in the next higher assembly.

===Active Unit===
*Examples:  PC board with solid state devices, electric motor, cathode ray tube, pressure vessel.
*Note:  Usually requires Qualification ESS and Acceptance ESS.

===One-Shot and Limited Use Devices===
*Examples:  explosive, rocket propellant, gas generator, squib, battery.
*Method:  Qualification ESS is by exposure to qualification environmental levels, then operated to demonstrate capacity plus a margin. Acceptance ESS is typically done on 10% of the production lot (but not less than 10 units) by exposure to qualification environmental levels, then operated to demonstrate capacity plus a margin. Failure of one UUT requires rejection of the production lot. For explosive devices, test requirements and methods are tailored from MIL-HDBK-1512 and NATO AOP-7. For batteries, guidance on test requirements is in RCC-Doc-319-99.
*Note:  Surveillance Testing is a periodic repeat of the Acceptance Testing using trending or accelerated aging to authorize shelf life extensions. Trending involves frequent sampling and comparison to previous results to predict degradation. Accelerated aging involves stimulating known failure modes to detect degradation.

===First Production Article===
This is the UUT for Qualification ESS (typically three UUT are required). The UUT must be representative of the design, production line processes, materials, and workmanship.

===First Repaired Article===
Also called First Article. This is the UUT (typically two are required) that demonstrates that the repair source has the capability and processes to perform a satisfactory repair.

===Pre-Qualification Article===
*Pre-Qualification Production Article. Also called Pre-production Article. This is the UUT used for program risk reduction and to qualify key processes, technologies, etc.
*Pre-Qualification Repaired Article. Also called Qual Article. This is the UUT (typically two are required) repaired by a potential repair contractor to meet, in part, the criteria to be on a Qualified Bidders List.

==Tailoring==
Tailoring is the formal engineering task of using existing technical data (requirements, standards, specifications, test plans, etc.) and selecting or modifying applicable areas to meet the requirements unique to the type of unit undergoing test. Non-applicable requirements are deleted. Other requirements may be added due to changes in Federal standards, identification of new hazards, modifications to the item, or changes in the mission/ESS profile. All areas of non-compliance with the technical data shall be identified by the contractor and a Requirements Tailoring Request (RTR) shall be submitted to the Government for each area. The RTR shall include thorough justification. Only the Government Engineering Authority for the component can accept an RTR.

===Specifications and Standards Tailoring===
Tailoring generally is to select the applicable areas, best test methods, or for use of an equivalent requirement.

===Test Plan Tailoring===
Tailoring generally is to change the test levels and durations, sequence of tests, or reporting requirements. Tailoring shall also identify any test requirements that are to be accomplished through analysis, similarity, or inspection.

===MIC, Waiver, and Deviation===
Each RTR shall be classified as a MIC, Waiver, or Deviation.
*MIC. An RTR that still meets the intent of the specified technical data is classified as a Meets Intent Compliance (MIC).
*Waiver. If an RTR potentially increases the safety hazards, it is classified as a Waiver and must also be accepted by the cognizant Government and contractor safety offices. The intent of a Waiver is to grant temporary approval to proceed while the hazard is being corrected. A series of unlikely, unrelated simultaneous failures is not considered a hazard.
*Deviation. An RTR that does not increase safety hazards and is not a MIC is classified as a Deviation.

Initially two FRUs were established in the Pacific, one at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]], called [[Station HYPO]] or FRUPAC (Fleet Radio Unit, Pacific), and the other, called [[Station CAST]] or Belconnen, at [[U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point|Cavite Naval Yard]], then [[Corregidor]], Philippines. With the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|fall of the Philippines]] to [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces in April and May 1942, CAST personnel were evacuated to a newly established FRU at [[Melbourne, Australia]], called [[FRUMEL]] (Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne).

HYPO and FRUMEL supervised detached field units scattered at various locations and aboard ships throughout the south, central, and north Pacific areas until the end of World War II. A third center, NEGAT, was based at [[OP-20-G]] headquarters in [[Washington DC]]. The entire cryptanalysis effort conducted by the units was called ''[[Operation Magic]]''. Liaison between the units and with the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB;  the British signals intelligence center at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]] in 1942) was titled ''[[Copek]]''.

[[File:Camera obscura2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Camera obscura]], from a manuscript of military designs.  Seventeenth century, possibly Italian.]]
The '''history of the camera''' can be traced much further back than the introduction of [[photography]].   Cameras evolved from the [[camera obscura]], and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including [[daguerreotype]]s, [[calotype]]s, [[dry plate]]s, [[photographic film|film]], and to the modern day with [[digital camera]]s.

==Camera obscura==
[[File:Camera Obscura box18thCentury.jpg|thumb|right|An artist using an 18th-century camera obscura to trace an image]]
The forerunner to the photographic camera was the ''[[camera obscura]]''. Camera obscura ([[Latin]] for "dark room") is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] philosopher [[Mozi]] (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because [[light]] travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen)'s wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.

The use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid.
{{further|Camera obscura}}

Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Niépce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.

==Early fixed images==

The first partially successful [[photograph]] of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by [[Nicéphore Niépce]],&lt;ref name=newhall13&gt;{{cite book

using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with [[silver chloride]], which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with [[Bitumen of Judea]].&lt;ref name="Davenport1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Alma|title=The history of photography: an overview|year=1999|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque, NM|isbn=0-8263-2076-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. [[View from the Window at Le Gras|One of those photographs]] has survived.

==Daguerreotypes and calotypes==
After Niépce's death in 1833, his partner [[Louis Daguerre]] continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the [[daguerreotype]] and publicly unveiled in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Kosinski Dorothy, The Artist and the Camera, Degas to Picasso. New Haven: Yale University Press,1999. p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with [[iodine|iodine vapor]] to give it a coating of light-sensitive [[silver iodide]]. After exposure in the camera, the image was [[photographic processing|developed]] by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). [[Henry Fox Talbot]] perfected a different process, the [[calotype]], in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality [[achromatic lens]]es were standard.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite book | last=Wade | first=John | title=A Short History of the Camera | year=1979 | publisher=Fountain Press | location=Watford | isbn=0-85242-640-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Studijskifotoaparat.JPG|thumb|left|Late 19th century studio camera]]

==Dry plates==
[[Collodion process|Collodion dry plates]] had been available since 1857, thanks to the work of [[Désiré van Monckhoven]], but it was not until the invention of the [[gelatin]] dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. With daylight and a fast plate or film, a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture. The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and informal "candid" portraits became popular. There was a proliferation of camera designs, from single- and twin-lens reflexes to large and bulky field cameras, simple [[box camera]]s, and even "detective cameras" disguised as pocket watches, hats, or other objects.

The short exposure times that made candid photography possible also necessitated another innovation, the mechanical [[shutter (photography)|shutter]]. The very first shutters were separate accessories, though built-in shutters were common by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=wade/&gt;{{clear left}}

==Kodak and the birth of film==

[[File:Brownie2 overview3.jpg|thumb|right|Kodak No. 2 Brownie box camera, circa 1910]]

The use of [[photographic film]] was pioneered by [[George Eastman]], who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to [[celluloid]] in 1888-1889. His first camera, which he called the "[[Kodak]]," was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple [[box camera]] with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras.

In 1900, Eastman took mass-market photography one step further with the [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], a simple and very inexpensive box camera that introduced the concept of the [[snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]. The Brownie was extremely popular and various models remained on sale until the 1960s.

Film also allowed the [[movie camera]] to develop from an expensive toy to a practical commercial tool.

Despite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered a larger number of exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm cameras to use plates.

Except for a few special types such as [[Schmidt camera]]s, most professional [[astrograph]]s continued to use plates until the end of the 20th century when electronic photography replaced them.

==35 mm==

[[File:Leica-I-1.jpg|thumb|right|Leica I, 1925]]

[[File:Argus C3.jpg|thumb|right|Argus C3, 1939]]

{{See also|135 film#History|l1=History of 135 film}}

A number of manufacturers started to use 35mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first 35mm cameras available to the public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Oskar Barnack]], who was in charge of research and development at &lt;!-- DO NOT DISAMBIGUATE, [[Leica Camera]] DID NOT EXIST UNTIL 1986; DEVELOP THE [[Ernst Leitz GmbH]] ARTICLE INSTEAD! --&gt;[[Ernst Leitz GmbH|Leitz]], decided to investigate using [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm cine film]] for still cameras while attempting to build a [[compact camera]] capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35&amp;nbsp;mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the [[Leica Camera|Leica I]] (for '''Lei'''tz '''ca'''mera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the [[Contax]] (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of [[35 mm]] as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras.

Kodak got into the market with the [[Kodak Retina|Retina I]] in 1934, which introduced the [[135 film|135]] cartridge used in all modern 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras were still out of reach for most people and rollfilm remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 with the arrival of the immensely popular [[Argus C3]]. Although the cheapest cameras still used rollfilm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966.

The fledgling Japanese camera industry began to take off in 1936 with the [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] 35&amp;nbsp;mm rangefinder, an improved version of the 1933 Kwanon prototype. Japanese cameras would begin to become popular in the West after Korean War veterans and soldiers stationed in Japan brought them back to the United States and elsewhere.

==TLRs and SLRs==

{{See also|History of the single-lens reflex camera}}

[[File:Contax-s.jpg|thumb|left|A historic camera:  the [[Contax]] S of 1949 — the first [[pentaprism]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]]]]

[[File:Asahiflex IIb Model I.jpg|thumb|right|Asahiflex IIb, 1954]]

[[File:Nikonf.jpg|thumb|[[Nikon F]] of 1959 — the first Japanese [[system camera]]]]

The first practical reflex camera was the [[Rollei|Franke &amp; Heidecke]] [[Rolleiflex]] [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[Twin-lens reflex camera|TLR]] of 1928. Though both single- and twin-lens reflex cameras had been available for decades, they were too bulky to achieve much popularity. The Rolleiflex, however, was sufficiently compact to achieve widespread popularity and the medium-format TLR design became popular for both high- and low-end cameras.

A similar revolution in [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] design began in 1933 with the introduction of the [[Ihagee]] [[Exakta]], a compact SLR which used [[127 film|127]] rollfilm. This was followed three years later by the first Western SLR to use [[135 film]], the Kine Exakta (World's first true [[35mm format|35mm]] SLR was [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Sport (camera)|"Sport" camera]], marketed several months before Kine Exakta, though "Sport" used its own film cartridge). The [[35mm format|35mm]] SLR design gained immediate popularity and there was an explosion of new models and innovative features after World War II. There were also a few 35mm TLRs, the best-known of which was the [[Contaflex]] of 1935, but for the most part these met with little success.

The first major post-war SLR innovation was the eye-level viewfinder, which first appeared on the Hungarian [[Duflex]] in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the [[Contax]] S, the first camera to use a [[pentaprism]]. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex was also the first SLR with an instant-return mirror, which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after  each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the [[Hasselblad|Hasselblad 1600F]], which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades.

In 1952 the [[Pentax|Asahi Optical Company]] (which later became well known for its Pentax cameras) introduced the first Japanese SLR using [[135 film]], the [[Asahiflex]]. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, [[Yashica]], and [[Nikon]]. Nikon's entry, the [[Nikon F]], had a full line of interchangeable components and accessories and is generally regarded as the first Japanese [[system camera]]. It was the F, along with the earlier [[Nikon S|S]] series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.

==Instant cameras==

[[File:Polaroid Land Camera Model J66.jpg|thumb|right|Polaroid Model J66, 1961]]

While conventional cameras were becoming more refined and sophisticated, an entirely new type of camera appeared on the market in 1948. This was the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Model 95, the world's first viable [[instant camera|instant-picture camera]]. Known as a [[Land Camera]] after its inventor, [[Edwin Land]], the Model 95 used a patented chemical process to produce finished positive prints from the exposed negatives in under a minute. The Land Camera caught on despite its relatively high price and the Polaroid lineup had expanded to dozens of models by the 1960s. The first Polaroid camera aimed at the popular market, the [[Polaroid Swinger|Model 20 Swinger]] of 1965, was a huge success and remains one of the top-selling cameras of all time.

==Automation==

The first camera to feature automatic [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] was the [[selenium]] [[light meter]]-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 (${{Inflation|US|225|1938}} in present terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}) kept it from achieving any degree of success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and automatic exposure systems became increasingly widespread.

The next technological advance came in 1960, when the German [[Mec 16 SB]] [[subminiature camera|subminiature]] became the first camera to place the light meter behind the [[photographic lens|lens]] for more accurate metering. However, [[through-the-lens]] metering ultimately became a feature more commonly found on SLRs than other types of camera; the first SLR equipped with a TTL system was the [[Topcon|Topcon RE Super]] of 1962.

==Digital cameras==
{{See also|DSLR#History}}
[[Digital camera]]s differ from their analog predecessors primarily in that they do not use film, but capture and save photographs on digital memory cards or internal storage instead.  Their low operating costs have relegated chemical cameras to [[niche market]]s. Digital cameras now include wireless communication capabilities (for example [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Bluetooth]]) to transfer, print or share photos, and are commonly found on [[Camera phone|mobile phones]].

===Early development===

The concept of digitizing images on scanners, and the concept of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of discrete sensor elements.  Early [[spy satellites]] used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters.  Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground.  The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film.  The first electronic imaging satellite was the [[KH-11]] launched by the [[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]] in late 1976.  It had a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) array with a resolution of {{nowrap|800 x 800 pixels}} (0.64 megapixels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-11.htm globalsecurity.org – KH-11 KENNAN], 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At Philips Labs in New York, [[Edward Stupp]], [[Pieter Cath]] and [[Zsolt Szilagyi (scientist)|Zsolt Szilagyi]] filed for a patent on "All Solid State Radiation Imagers" on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3540011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas Instruments engineer [[Willis Adcock]] designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built.&lt;ref name="digicamhistory_1970s"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4057830}} and {{Cite patent|US|4163256}} were filed in 1972 but were only later awarded in 1976 and 1977. {{cite web|url=http://www.digicamhistory.com/1970s.html|title=1970s|accessdate=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cromemco CYCLOPS]] introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975&lt;ref name="PE"&gt;{{Cite journal

The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production.

===Analog electronic cameras===

{{main|Still video camera}}

Handheld electronic cameras, in the sense of a device meant to be carried and used like a handheld film camera, appeared in 1981 with the demonstration of the [[Sony Mavica]] (Magnetic Video Camera). This is not to be confused with the later cameras by Sony that also bore the Mavica name. This was an analog camera, in that it recorded pixel signals continuously, as videotape machines did, without converting them to discrete levels; it recorded television-like signals to a 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;inch "[[video floppy]]".&lt;ref&gt;

In essence it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disk in field mode and 25 per disk in frame mode. The image quality was considered equal to that of then-current televisions.

[[File:Canon RC-701 img 0829.jpg|thumb|Canon RC-701, 1986]]

Analog electronic cameras do not appear to have reached the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701. Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], printing the images in the ''[[Yomiuri Shinbun]]'', a Japanese newspaper. In the United States, the first publication to use these cameras for real reportage was [[USA Today]], in its coverage of World Series baseball. Several factors held back the widespread adoption of analog cameras; the cost (upwards of [[United States Dollar|$]]20,000), poor image quality compared to film, and the lack of quality affordable printers. Capturing and printing an image originally required access to equipment such as a frame grabber, which was beyond the reach of the average consumer. The "video floppy" disks later had several reader devices available for viewing on a screen, but were never standardized as a computer drive.

The early adopters tended to be in the news media, where the cost was negated by the utility and the ability to transmit images by telephone lines. The poor image quality was offset by the low resolution of newspaper graphics. This capability to transmit images without a satellite link was useful during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991.

US government agencies also took a strong interest in the still video concept, notably the US Navy for use as a real time air-to-sea surveillance system.

The first analog electronic camera marketed to consumers may have been the Casio VS-101 in 1987. A notable analog camera produced the same year was the [http://imaging.nikon.com/history/chronicle/cousins16-e/ Nikon QV-1000C], designed as a press camera and not offered for sale to general users, which sold only a few hundred units. It recorded images in [[greyscale]], and the quality in newspaper print was equal to film cameras. In appearance it closely resembled a modern digital [[single-lens reflex camera]]. Images were stored on video floppy disks.

Silicon Film, a proposed digital sensor cartridge for film cameras that would allow 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, with a 1.3 [[megapixel]] sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera.  The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/0109/01091702siliconfilmvaporizes.asp| title=Silicon Film – vaporized-ware| first=Phil| last=Askey| year=2001| accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of true digital cameras===
[[File:Minolta RD-175 Digital SLR.JPG|thumb|The first portable digital SLR camera, introduced by Minolta in 1995.]]
[[File:Capas-d1.jpg|thumb|Nikon D1, 1999]]

By the late 1980s, the technology required to produce truly commercial digital cameras existed. The first true portable digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 2&amp;nbsp;MB SRAM memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed to the public.

The first digital camera of any kind ever sold commercially was possibly the MegaVision Tessera in 1987 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mega-vision.com/why_Measured_Photography.html MegaVision Professional Camera Backs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though there is not extensive documentation of its sale known. The first ''portable'' digital camera that was actually marketed commercially was sold in December 1989 in Japan, the DS-X by

It used a CCD [[image sensor]], stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1990 | work = digicammuseum.com | url = http://www.digicammuseum.com/en/history | accessdate = 17 September 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dycam Model 1: The world's first consumer digital still camera | work = DigiBarn computer museum | url = http://www.digibarn.com/collections/cameras/dycam-model1/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Said, "DYCAM Model 1: The first portable Digital Still Camera", ''MacWeek'', vol. 4, No. 35, 16 Oct. 1990, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kodak brought to market the [[Kodak DCS]] (Kodak Digital Camera System), the beginning of a long line of professional [[Kodak DCS]] SLR cameras that were based in part on film bodies, often Nikons. It used a 1.3&amp;nbsp;megapixel sensor, had a bulky external digital storage system and was priced at $13,000. At the arrival of the [[Kodak DCS-200]], the [[Kodak DCS]] was dubbed [[Kodak DCS-100]].

The move to digital formats was helped by the formation of the first [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display on the back was the [[Casio]] [[QV-10]] developed by a team led by [[Hiroyuki Suetaka]] in 1995. The first camera to use [[CompactFlash]] was the [[Kodak DC-25]] in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. The first camera that offered the ability to record [[video]] clips may have been the [[Ricoh RDC-1]] in 1995.

In 1995 Minolta introduced the [[Minolta RD-175|RD-175]], which was based on the Minolta 500si SLR with a splitter and three independent CCDs. This combination delivered 1.75M pixels. The benefit of using an SLR base was the ability to use any existing Minolta AF mount lens. 1999 saw the introduction of the [[Nikon D1]], a 2.74&amp;nbsp;megapixel camera that was the first [[digital SLR]] developed entirely from the ground up by a major manufacturer, and at a cost of under $6,000 at introduction was affordable by professional photographers and high-end consumers. This camera also used Nikon F-mount lenses, which meant film photographers could use many of the same lenses they already owned.

Digital camera sales continued to flourish, driven by technology advances. The digital market segmented into different categories, Compact Digital Still Cameras, Bridge Cameras, Mirrorless Compacts and Digital SLRs. One of the major technology advances was the development of [[CMOS]] sensors, which helped drive sensor costs low enough to enable the widespread adoption of camera phones.

Since 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/1039455/digitalfilm.html Digital outsells film, but film still king to some | Macworld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kodak]] announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the [[developed world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/20/kodak_to_drop_35mm_cameras/ | title=Kodak to drop 35mm cameras in Europe, US | first=Tony | last=Smith | date=2004-01-20 | publisher=The Register | accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - and 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/eastman-kodak-files-for-bankruptcy/ | work=The New York Times | title=Eastman Kodak Files for Bankruptcy | date=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smartphone]]s now routinely include high resolution digital cameras.

An '''hourglass''' (or '''sandglass''', '''sand timer''', or '''sand clock''') is a device used to measure the passage of [[time]]. It comprises two [[glass]] bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated trickle of material (historically [[sand]]) from the upper bulb to the lower one. Factors affecting the time interval measured include sand quantity, sand coarseness, bulb size, and neck width. Hourglasses may be reused indefinitely by inverting the bulbs once the upper bulb is empty. Depictions of hourglasses in art survive in large numbers from antiquity to the present day, as a symbol for the passage of time. These were especially common sculpted as [[epitaph]]s on tombstones or other monuments, also in the form of the winged hourglass, a literal depiction of the well-known Latin epitaph ''[[tempus fugit]]'' ("time flies").

==History==

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Peleus-Thetis-350.jpg|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] dated c. 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (observe the magnification with the object held by Morpheus in his hands)]]

The origin of the hourglass is unclear. Its predecessor the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], or [[water clock]], is known to have existed in [[Babylon]] and [[Egypt]] as early as the 16th century BCE. According to the ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'' the so-called clepsammia were in use before the time of St. Jerome (335 CE), and the first potential representation of an hourglass is in a sarcophagus dated c. 350 CE,&lt;ref name="Association1873"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Archaeological Association|title=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJRYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|year=1873|publisher=Brit.

Ass.|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], discovered in Rome in the 18th century, and studied by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] in the 19th century, who remarked on the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands&lt;ref name="Museum1810"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Museum|title=A Description of the Collection of Ancient Terracottas in the British Museum ; with Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4NV9XLg_yUC&amp;pg=PT88|year=1810|publisher=K. Bulmer|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is disputed whether the object in question is a clepsammia or a similarly-shaped clepsydra; no other hourglass clearly appears in the historical record for another thousand years.

=== Reappearance in the Early Middle Ages ===
[[File:Ambrogio Lorenzetti 002-detail-Temperance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] bearing an hourglass; detail  Lorenzetti's ''Allegory of Good Government'', 1338]]

There are no records of the hourglass existing in Europe prior to the [[Early Middle Ages]], such as invention by the Ancient Greeks; the first supported evidences appears from the 8th century CE, crafted by a [[Franks|Frankish]] monk named Liutprand who served at the cathedral in [[Chartres, France]].&lt;ref name="Britten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OYZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%2522liutprand%2522+%2522hourglass%2522&amp;dq=%2522liutprand%2522+%2522hourglass%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid3dKYh73PAhXJaD4KHfmvDp0Q6AEIJTAC|title=Fragments of history: rethinking the Ruthwell and Bewcastle monuments|last=Orton|first=Fred|last2=Wood|first2=Ian|last3=Lees|first3=Clare A.|date=2008-02-01|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719072574|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;  But it was not until the 14th century that the hourglass  was seen commonly, the earliest firm evidence being a depiction in the 1338 fresco ''Allegory of Good Government'' by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Use of the marine sandglass has been recorded since the 14th century. The written records about it were mostly from logbooks of European ships.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; In the same period it appears in other records and lists of ships stores. The earliest recorded reference that can be said with certainty to refer to a marine sandglass dates from c. 1345, in a receipt of Thomas de Stetesham, clerk of the King's ship ''La George'', in the reign of [[Edward III]] of England; translated from the Latin, the receipt says: in 1345:&lt;ref name="Turner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony John Turner|title=Of Time and Measurement: Studies in the History of Horology and Fine Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNDbAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-86078-378-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stetesham"/&gt;

[[Marine sandglass]]es were very popular on board ships, as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea. Unlike the clepsydra, the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass. The fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements, as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes.&lt;ref name="Balmer"&gt;Balmer, R.T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632 Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seamen found that the hourglass was able to help them determine [[longitude]], distance east or west from a certain point, with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name="Balmer" /&gt;

The hourglass also found popularity on land. As the use of mechanical clocks to indicate the times of events like church services became more common, creating a "need to keep track of time", the demand for time-measuring devices increased. Hourglasses were essentially inexpensive, as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by, and as the manufacturing of these instruments became more common, their uses became more practical.&lt;ref name="Balmer" /&gt;

Hourglasses were commonly seen in use in churches, homes, and work places to measure sermons, cooking time, and time spent on breaks from labor.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; Because they were being used for more everyday tasks, the model of the hourglass began to shrink. The smaller models were more practical and very popular as they made timing more discreet.

After 1500, the hourglass was not as widespread as it had been. This was due to the development of the mechanical clock, which became more accurate, smaller and cheaper, and made keeping time easier.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The hourglass, however, did not disappear entirely. Although they became relatively less useful as clock technology advanced, hourglasses remained desirable in their design. The oldest known surviving hourglass resides in the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;

Not until the 18th century did [[John Harrison]] come up with a [[marine chronometer]] that significantly improved on the stability of the hourglass at sea. Taking elements from the design logic behind the hourglass, he made a marine chronometer in 1761 that was able to accurately measure the journey from England to Jamaica accurate within five seconds.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Design==
Little written evidence exists to explain why its external form is the shape that it is. The glass bulbs used, however, have changed in style and design over time. While the main designs have always been [[ampoule]] in shape, the bulbs were not always connected. The first hourglasses were two separate bulbs with a cord wrapped at their union that was then coated in wax to hold the piece together and let sand flow in between.&lt;ref name="Hourglass"&gt;http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Hourglass.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1760 that both bulbs were blown together to keep moisture out of the bulbs and regulate the pressure within the bulb that varied the flow.&lt;ref name="Balmer" /&gt;

==Material==
While some early hourglasses actually did use sand as the granular mixture to measure time, many did not use sand at all. The material used in most bulbs was a combination of "powdered marble, tin/lead oxides, and pulverized, burnt eggshell".&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; Over time, different textures of granule matter were tested to see which gave the most constant flow within the bulbs. It was later discovered that for the perfect flow to be achieved the ratio of granule bead to the width of the bulb neck needed to be 1/12 or more but not greater than 1/2 the neck of the bulb.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Ivars. "Trickling sand: how an hourglass ticks". Science News, Vol. 144, No. 11 (September 11, 1993). p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==
[[File:Egg timer.jpg|thumb|80px|3-minute egg timer]]
Hourglasses were an early dependable and accurate measure of time. The rate of flow of the sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument will not freeze in cold weather.&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were being used in a range of applications at sea, in the church, in industry, and in cookery.
 
During the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] around the globe, 18 hourglasses from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip had been authorized by King [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Hakluyt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pigafetta|title=The First Voyage Around the World, 1519-1522|url=http://www.histo.cat/1/Encomienda-Barna-19-4-1519.jpg|year=1874|publisher=Hakluyt Society Press|isbn=|pages=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the job of a ship's page to turn the hourglasses and thus provide the times for the ship's log. Noon was the reference time for navigation, which did not depend on the glass, as the sun would be at its [[zenith]].&lt;ref name="Bergreen"&gt;{{cite book | title=Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe| last=Bergreen| first=Laurence| year=2003| publisher=William Morrow| isbn=0-06-621173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sandglasses could be fixed in a common frame, each with a different operating time, e.g. as in a four-way Italian sandglass likely from the 17th century, in the collections of the Science Museum, in South Kensington, London, which could measure intervals of quarter, half, three-quarters, and one hour (and which were also used in churches, for priests and ministers to measure lengths of sermons).&lt;ref name=SciMuseum4way&gt;{{cite web|title=Four-way sand glass, Italian, 17th century, image no. 10325648|website=The Science Museum|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/i059/10325648.aspx|accessdate= 1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they are no longer widely used for keeping time, some institutions do maintain them.

The sandglass is still widely used as the kitchen [[egg timer]]; for cooking eggs, a three-minute timer is typical,&lt;ref name="Herbst"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The New Food Lover's Companion]]| last=Herbst| first=Sharon Tyler| authorlink=Sharon Tyler Herbst| year=2001| publisher=Barron's Educational Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name "egg timer" for three-minute hourglasses. Egg timers are sold widely as souvenirs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
Sand timers are also sometimes used in games such as [[Pictionary]] and [[Boggle]] to implement a time constraint on rounds of play.

Unlike most other methods of measuring time, the hourglass concretely represents the present as being between the [[past]] and the [[future]], and this has made it an enduring symbol of time itself.

The hourglass, sometimes with the addition of metaphorical wings, is often depicted as a symbol that human existence is fleeting, and that the "[[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]]" will run out for every human life.&lt;ref name="Brewer"&gt;{{cite book | title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable| url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/17/messages/288.html| last=Room| first=Adrian| year=1999| publisher=HarperCollinsPublishers| location=New York}} "Time is getting short; there will be little opportunity to do what you have to do unless you take the chance now. The phrase is often used with reference to one who has not much longer to live. The allusion is to the hourglass."&lt;/ref&gt; It was used thus on [[pirate]] flags, to strike fear into the hearts of the pirates' victims. In England, hourglasses were sometimes placed in coffins,&lt;ref name="Ewbank"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Descriptive and Historical Account of Hydraulic and Other Machines for Raising Water, Ancient and Modern With Observations on Various Subjects Connected with the Mechanic Arts, Including the Progressive Development of the Steam Engine.

See [[The Gentleman's Magazine|Gent. Mag.]] vol xvi, 646, and xvii, 264."&lt;/ref&gt; and they have graced gravestones for centuries.  The hourglass was also used in [[alchemy]] as a symbol for [[hour]].

The former [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich]] in [[London]] used an hourglass on its coat of arms, symbolising Greenwich's role as the origin of [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]. The district's successor, the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]], uses two hourglasses on its [[Coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich|coat of arms]].

===Modern symbolic uses===
[[File:Cursor-design1-hourglass.svg|right|Hourglass cursor]]
Recognition of the hourglass as a symbol of time has survived its obsolescence as a timekeeper. For example, the American television soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', since its first broadcast in 1965, has displayed an hourglass in its opening credits, with the narration, "Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives," spoken by [[Macdonald Carey]].

Various computer [[graphical user interface]]s may change the [[pointer (computing WIMP)|pointer]] to an [[Windows wait cursor|hourglass]] during a period when the program is in the middle of a task, and may not accept user input. During that period other programs, for example in different windows, may work normally. When such an hourglass does not disappear, it suggests a program is in an [[infinite loop]] and needs to be terminated, or is waiting for some external event (such as the user inserting a CD). [[Unicode]] has an &lt;small&gt;HOURGLASS&lt;/small&gt; symbol at &lt;code&gt;U+231B&lt;/code&gt; (⌛).

Because of its symmetry, graphic signs resembling an hourglass are seen in the art of cultures which never encountered such objects. Vertical pairs of triangles joined at the apex are common in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art; both in North America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splendidheritage.com/nindex.html Splendid Heritage: treasures of native american art] (search on "hourglass")&lt;/ref&gt; where it can represent, for example, the body of the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]] or (in more elongated form) an enemy scalp,&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, David J.

It is the replacement for the older [[Spanning Tree Protocol|spanning tree protocol]]s: [[IEEE 802.1D]], [[IEEE 802.1w]], [[IEEE 802.1s]]. These blocked any redundant paths that could result in a [[Switching loop|layer&amp;nbsp;2 loop]], whereas SPB allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths, provides much larger layer&amp;nbsp;2 topologies,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to virtually eliminate human error during configuration and preserves the plug-and-play nature that established Ethernet as the de facto protocol at layer&amp;nbsp;2.

The technology provides logical [[Ethernet]] networks on native Ethernet infrastructures using a [[link state]] protocol to advertise both [[Network topology|topology]] and logical network membership. [[Network packet|Packets]] are encapsulated at the edge either in media access control-in-media access control ([[mac-in-mac|MAC-in-MAC]]) ''[[802.1ah]]'' or tagged ''[[IEEE 802.1Q|802.1Q]]/[[IEEE 802.1ad|802.1ad]]'' [[Frame (networking)|frames]] and transported only to other members of the logical network. [[Unicast]], [[multicast]], and broadcast are supported and all routing is on symmetric shortest paths.

The control plane is based on the [[IS-IS|Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)]], leveraging a small number of extensions defined in RFC 6329.&lt;ref&gt;

==Benefits==
&lt;!-- overly promotional in tone? --&gt;
Shortest Path Bridging - VID (SPBV) and Shortest Path Bridging - MAC (SPBM) are two operating modes of 802.1aq, and are described in more detail below.  Both inherit key benefits of link state routing:
* the ability to use all available physical connectivity, because loop avoidance uses a Control Plane with a global view of network topology
* fast restoration of connectivity after failure, again because of Link State routing's global view of network topology
* under failure, the property that only directly affected traffic is impacted during restoration; all unaffected traffic just continues
* rapid restoration of broadcast and multicast connectivity, because IS-IS floods all of the required information in the SPB extensions to IS-IS, thereby allowing unicast and multicast connectivity to be installed in parallel, with no need for a second phase signaling process to run over the converged unicast topology to compute and install multicast trees

Virtualisation is becoming an increasingly important aspect of a number of key applications, in both carrier and enterprise space, and SPBM, with its MAC-in-MAC datapath providing complete separation between client and server layers, is uniquely suitable for these.

"Data Centre virtualisation" articulates the desire to flexibly and efficiently harness available compute resources in a way that may rapidly be modified to respond to varying application demands, without the need to dedicate physical resources to a specific application. One aspect of this is server virtualisation. The other is connectivity virtualisation, because a physically distributed set of server resources must be attached to a single IP subnet, and modifiable in an operationally simple and robust way. SPBM delivers this; because of its client-server model, it offers a perfect emulation of a transparent Ethernet LAN segment, which is the IP subnet seen at layer&amp;nbsp;3. A key component of how it does this is implementing VLANs with scoped multicast trees, which means no egress discard of broadcast/unknown traffic, a feature common to approaches that use a small number of shared trees, hence the network does not simply degrade with size as the percentage of frames discarded goes up. It also supports "single touch" provisioning, so that configuration is simple and robust; the port of a virtual server must simply be bound locally to the SPBM I-SID identifying the LAN segment, after which IS-IS for SPB floods this binding, and all nodes that need to install forwarding state to implement the LAN segment do so automatically.

The carrier-space equivalent of this application is the delivery of Ethernet VPN services to Enterprises over common carrier infrastructure. The required attributes are fundamentally the same; complete transparency for customer Ethernet services (both point-to-point and LAN), and complete isolation between one customer's traffic and that of all other customers.   The multiple virtual LAN segment model provides this, and the single-touch provisioning model eases carrier operations. Furthermore, the MAC-in-MAC datapath allows the carrier to deploy the "best in class" Ethernet OAM suit (IEEE 802.1ag, etc.), entirely transparently and independently from any OAM which a customer may choose to run.

A further consequence of SPBM's transparency in both dataplane and control plane is that it provides a perfect, "no compromise" delivery of the complete MEF 6.1 service set. This includes not only E-LINE and E-LAN constructs, by also E-TREE (hub-and-spoke) connectivity. This latter is clearly very relevant to enterprise customers of carrier VPN/MPLS services which have this network structure internally. It also provides the carrier with the toolkit to support geo-redundant broadband backhaul; in this applications, many DSLAMs or other access equipments must be backhauled to multiple [[Broadband remote access server|Broadband Remote Access Server]] (BRAS) sites, with application-determined binding of sessions to a BRAS. However, DSLAMs must not be allowed to communicate with each other, because carriers then lose the ability to control peer-to-peer connectivity. MEF E-TREE does just this, and further provides an efficient multicast fabric for the distribution of IP&amp;nbsp;TV.

SPBM offers both the ideal multicast replication model, where packets are replicated only at fork points in the shortest path tree that connects members, and also the less state intensive head end replication model where in essence serial unicast packets are sent to all other members along the same shortest path first tree. These two models are selected by specifying properties of the service at the edge which affect the transit node decisions on multicast state installation. This allows for a trade-off to be made between optimum transit replication points (with their larger state costs) v.s. reduced core state (but much more traffic) of the head end replication model. These selections can be different for different members of the same Individual Service ID (I-SID) allowing different trade-offs to be made for different members.

[[#Animations|Figure 5 below]] is a quick way to understand what SPBM is doing on the scale of the entire network. Figure 5 shows how a 7-member E-LAN is created from the edge membership information and the deterministic distributed calculation of per source, per service trees with transit replication. Head end replication is not shown as it is trivial and simply uses the existing unicast FIBs to forward copies serially to the known other receivers.

==Operations and management==
802.1aq builds on all existing Ethernet [[Operations, administration and management|Operations, administration and management (OA&amp;M)]]. Since 802.1aq ensures that its [[unicast]] and [[multicast]] packets for a given [[VLAN|virtual lan (VLAN)]] follow the same forward and reverse path and use completely standard 802 encapsulations, all of the methods of 802.1ag and Y.1731 operate unchanged on an 802.1aq network.

'''802.1aq''' is the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) sanctioned [[link state]] [[Ethernet]] control plane for all IEEE [[VLAN]]s covered in IEEE [[802.1Q]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortest Path Bridging virtual local area network identifier (VLAN ID) or Shortest Path Bridging VID (SPBV) provides capability that is backwards compatible with [[spanning tree]] technologies. Shortest Path Bridging Media Access Control (MAC) or (SPBM), (previously known as [[Provider Backbone Bridge|Provider Backbone Bridge PBB)]] provides additional values which capitalize on [[Provider Backbone Bridge]] (PBB) capabilities. SPB (the generic term for both) combines an [[Ethernet]] data path (either [[IEEE 802.1Q]] in the case of SPBV, or [[Provider Backbone Bridges]] (PBBs) [[IEEE 802.1ah]] in the case of SPBM) with an [[IS-IS]] link state control protocol running between Shortest Path bridges ([[Network-to-network interface|network-to-network interface (NNI)]] links). The link state protocol is used to discover and advertise the network topology and compute shortest path trees (SPT) from all bridges in the SPT Region.

In SPBM, the Backbone MAC (B-MAC) addresses of the participating nodes and also the service membership information for interfaces to non-participating devices ([[User-Network Interface|user network interface (UNI)]] ports) is distributed. Topology data is then input to a calculation engine which computes symmetric shortest path trees based on minimum cost from each participating node to all other participating nodes. In SPBV these trees provide a shortest path tree where individual MAC address can be learned and Group Address membership can be distributed. In SPBM the shortest path trees are then used to populate forwarding tables for each participating node's individual B-MAC addresses and for Group addresses; Group [[multicast]] trees are sub trees of the default shortest path tree formed by (Source, Group) pairing. Depending on the topology several different equal cost multi path trees are possible and SPB supports multiple algorithms per IS-IS instance.

In SPB as with other link state based protocols, the computations are done in a distributed fashion. Each node computes the Ethernet compliant forwarding behavior independently based on a normally synchronized common view of the network (at scales of about 1000 nodes or less) and the service attachment points ([[User-Network Interface|user network interface (UNI)]] ports). Ethernet filtering Database (or forwarding) tables are populated locally to independently and deterministically implement its portion of the network forwarding behavior.

The two different flavors of data path give rise to two slightly different versions of this protocol. One (SPBM) is intended where complete isolation of many separate instances of client LANs and their associated device MAC addresses is desired, and it therefore uses a full encapsulation (MAC-in-MAC a.k.a. [[IEEE 802.1ah]]). The other (SPBV) is intended where such isolation of client device MAC addresses is not necessary, and it reuses only the existing VLAN tag a.k.a. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] on participating [[Network-to-network interface|network-to-network interface (NNI)]] links.

Chronologically SPBV came first, with the project originally being conceived to address scalability and convergence of [[Spanning tree protocol#Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol|MSTP]].

At the time the specification of Provider Backbone bridging was progressing and it became apparent that leveraging both the PBB data plane and a link state control plane would significantly extend Ethernet's capabilities and applications. [[Provider Link State Bridging]] (PLSB) was a strawman proposal brought to the IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Working Group, in order to provide a concrete example of such a system. As IEEE 802.1aq standardization has progressed, some of the detailed mechanisms proposed by [[PLSB]] have been replaced by functional equivalents, but all of the key concepts embodied in [[PLSB]] are being carried forward into the standard.

The two flavors (SPBV and SPBM) will be described separately although the differences are almost entirely in the data plane.

===Shortest Path Bridging-VID===
Shortest Path bridging enables shortest path trees for VLAN Bridges all IEEE 802.1 data planes and SPB is the term used in general. Recently there has been a lot of focus on SPBM as explained due to its ability to control the new PBB data plane and leverage certain capabilities such as removing the need to do B-MAC learning and automatically creating individual (unicast) and group ([[multicast]]) Trees. SPBV was actually the original project that endeavored to enable Ethernet VLANs to better utilize mesh networks.

A primary feature of Shortest Path bridging is the ability to use Link State IS-IS to learn network topology. In SPBV the mechanism used to identify the tree is to use a different Shortest Path VLAN ID (VID) for each source bridge. The IS-IS topology is leveraged both to allocate unique SPVIDs and to enable shortest path forwarding for individual and group addresses. Originally targeted for small low configuration networks SPB grew into a larger project encompassing the latest provider control plane for SPBV and harmonizing the concepts of Ethernet data plane. Proponents of SPB believe that Ethernet can leverage link state and maintain the attributes that have made Ethernet one of the most encompassing data plane transport technologies. When we refer to Ethernet it is the layer&amp;nbsp;2 frame format defined by IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.1. Ethernet VLAN bridging IEEE 802.1Q is the frame forwarding paradigm that fully supports higher level protocols such as IP.

SPB defines a shortest path Region which is the boundary of the shortest path topology and the rest of the VLAN topology (which may be any number of legacy bridges.) SPB operates by learning the SPB capable bridges and growing the Region to include the SPB capable bridges that have the same Base VID and MSTID configuration digest (Allocation of VIDs for SPB purposes).

SPBV builds shortest path trees that support Loop Prevention and optionally support loop mitigation on the SPVID. SPBV still allows learning of Ethernet MAC addresses but it can distribute multicast address that can be used to prune the shortest path trees according to the multicast membership either through [[Multiple MAC Registration Protocol|Multiple MAC Registration Protocol (MMRP)]] or directly using IS-IS distribution of multicast membership.

SPBV builds shortest path trees but also interworks with legacy bridges running Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol and Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol. SPBV uses techniques from [[Spanning tree protocol#Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol|MSTP]] Regions to interwork with non-SPT regions behaving logically as a large distributed bridge as viewed from outside the region.

SPBV supports shortest path trees but SPBV also builds a spanning tree which is computed from the link state database and uses the Base VID. This means that SPBV can use this traditional spanning tree for computation of the Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CIST). The CIST is the default tree used to interwork with other legacy bridges. It also serves as a fall back spanning tree if there are configuration problems with SPBV.

SPBV has been designed to manage a moderate number of bridges. SPBV differs from SPBM in that MAC addresses are learned on all bridges that lie on the shortest path and a shared VLAN learning is used since destination MACs may be associated with multiple SPVIDs. SPBV learns all MACs it forwards even outside the SPBV region.

===Shortest Path Bridging-MAC===
SPBM reuses the PBB data plane which does not require that the Backbone Core Bridges (BCB) learn encapsulated client addresses. At the edge of the network the C-MAC (client) addresses are learned. SPBM is very similar to PLSB (Provider Link State Bridging) using the same data and control planes but the format and contents of the control messages in PLSB are not compatible.

Individual MAC frames ([[unicast]] traffic) from an Ethernet attached device that are received at the SPBM edge are encapsulated in a PBB (mac-in-mac) [[IEEE 802.1ah]] header and then traverse the IEEE 802.1aq network unchanged until they are stripped of the encapsulation as they egress back to the non participating attached network at the far side of the participating network.

[[Ethernet]] destination addresses (from UNI port attached devices) perform learning over the logical LAN and are forwarded to the appropriate participating B-MAC address to reach the far end Ethernet destination. In this manner Ethernet MAC addresses are never looked up in the core of an IEEE 802.1aq network. When comparing SPBM to PBB, the behavior is almost identical to a PBB [[IEEE 802.1ah]] network. PBB does not specify how B-MAC addresses are learned and PBB may use a spanning tree to control the B-VLAN. In SPBM the main difference is that B-MAC address are distributed or computed in the control plane, eliminating the B-MAC learning in PBB. Also SPBM ensures that the route followed is shortest path tree.

The forward and reverse paths used for unicast and [[multicast]] traffic in an IEEE 802.1aq network are [[symmetric]]. This symmetry permits the normal Ethernet Continuity Fault Messages (CFM) [[IEEE 802.1ag]] to operate unchanged for SPBV and SPBM and has desirable properties with respect to time distribution protocols such as [[Precision Time Protocol]] ([[IEEE 1588|PTP Version 2]]). Also existing Ethernet loop prevention is augmented by loop mitigation to provide fast data plane convergence.

Group address and unknown destination individual frames are optimally transmitted to only members of the same Ethernet service. IEEE 802.1aq supports the creation of thousands of logical Ethernet services in the form of E-LINE, E-LAN or E-TREE constructs which are formed between non participating logical ports of the IEEE 802.1aq network. These group address packets are encapsulated with a PBB header which indicates the source participating address in the SA while the DA indicates the locally significant group address this frame should be forwarded on and which source bridge originated the frame. The IEEE 802.1aq multicast forwarding tables are created based on computations such that every bridge which is on the shortest path between a pair of bridges which are members of the same service group will create proper forwarding database (FDB) state to forward or replicate frames it receives to that members of that service group. Since the group address computation produce shortest path trees, there is only ever one copy of a multicast packet on any given link. Since only bridges on a shortest path between participating logical ports create forwarding database (FDB) state the multicast makes the efficient use of network resources.

The actual group address forwarding operation operates more or less identically to classical Ethernet, the backbone destination address (B-DA)+ backbone VLAN identifier (B-VID) combination are looked up to find the egress set of next hops. The only difference compared with classical Ethernet is that reverse learning is disabled for participating bridge backbone media access control (B-MAC) addresses and is replaced with an ingress check and discard (when the frame arrives on an incoming interface from an unexpected source). Learning is however implemented at the edges of the SPBM multicast tree to learn the B-MAC to MAC address relationship for correct individual frame encapsulation in the reverse direction (as packets arrive over the Interface).

Properly implemented an IEEE 802.1aq network can support up to 1000 participating bridges and provide tens of thousands of layer&amp;nbsp;2 E-LAN services to Ethernet devices. This can be done by simply configuring the ports facing the Ethernet devices to indicate they are members of a given service. As new members come and go, the IS-IS protocol will advertise the I-SID membership changes and the computations will grow or shrink the trees in the participating node network as necessary to maintain the efficient multicast property for that service.

IEEE 802.1aq has the property that only the point of attachment of a service needs configuration when a new attachment point comes or goes. The trees produced by the computations will automatically be extended or pruned as necessary to maintain connectivity. In some existing implementations this property is used to automatically (as opposed to through configuration) add or remove attachment points for dual-homed technologies such as rings to maintain optimum packet flow between a nonparticipating ring protocol and the IEEE 802.1aq network by activating a secondary attachment point and deactivating a primary attachment point.

===Failure recovery===
Failure recovery is as per normal [[IS-IS]] with the link failure being advertised and new computations being performed, resulting in new FDB tables. Since no Ethernet addresses are advertised or known by this protocol, there is no re-learning required by the SPBM core and its learned encapsulations are unaffected by a transit node or link failure.

Fast link failure detection may be performed using [[IEEE 802.1ag]] Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) which test link status and report a failure to the IS-IS protocol. This allows much faster failure detection than is possible using the IS-IS hello message loss mechanisms.

Both SPBV and SPBM inherit the rapid convergence of a link state control plane. A special attribute of SPBM is its ability to rebuild multicast trees in a similar time to unicast convergence, because it substitutes computation for signaling. When an SPBM bridge has performed the computations on a topology database, it knows whether it is on the shortest path between a root and one or more leaves of the SPT and can install state accordingly. Convergence is not gated by incremental discovery of a bridge’s place on a multicast tree by the use of separate signaling transactions. However, SPBM on a node does not operate completely independently of its peers, and enforces agreement on the current network topology with its peers. This very efficient mechanism uses exchange of a single digest of link state covering the entire network view, and does not need agreement on each path to each root individually. The result is that the volume of messaging exchanged to converge the network is in proportion to the incremental change in topology and not the number of multicast trees in the network. A simple link event that may change many trees is communicated by signaling the link event only; the consequent tree construction is performed by local computation at each node. The addition of a single service access point to a service instance involves only the announcement of the I-SID, regardless of the number of trees. Similarly the removal of a bridge, which might involve the rebuilding of hundreds to thousands of trees, is signaled only with a few link state updates.

Commercial offerings will likely offer SPB over multi-chassis lag. In this environment multiple switch chassis appear as a single switch to the SPB control plane, and multiple links between pairs of chassis appear as an aggregate link. In this context a single link or node failure is not seen by the control plane and is handled locally resulting in sub 50ms recovery times.

===Animations===
Following are three animated GIFs which help to show the behavior of 802.1aq.

The first of these gifs, shown in Figure 5, demonstrates the routing in a 66 node network where we have created a 7-member E-LAN using ISID 100. In this example we show the ECT tree created from each member to reach all of the other members. We cycle through each member to show the full set of trees created for this service. We pause at one point to show the symmetry of routing between two of the nodes and emphasize it with a red line. In each case the source of the tree is highlighted with a small purple V.

The second of these animated gifs, shown in Figure 6, demonstrates 8 ECT paths in the same 66 node network as Figure 4. In each subsequent animated frame the same source is used (in purple) but a different destination is shown (in yellow). For each frame, all of the shortest paths are shown superimposed between the source and destination. When two shortest paths traverse the same hop, the thickness of the lines being drawn is increased. In addition to the 66 node network, a small multi level Data Center style network is also shown with sources and destinations both within the servers (at the bottom) and from servers to the router layer at the top. This animation helps to show the diversity of the ECT being produced.

The last of these animated gifs, shown in Figure 7, demonstrates source destination ECT paths using all 16 of the standard algorithms currently defined.

==Details==

===Equal Cost Multi Tree===
Sixteen equal cost multi tree (ECMT) paths are initially defined, however there are many more possible. ECMT in an IEEE 802.1aq network is more predictable than with [[Internet Protocol|internet protocol (IP)]] or [[Multiprotocol Label Switching|multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)]] because of symmetry between the forward and reverse paths. The choice as to which ECMT path will be used is therefore an operator assigned head end decision while it is a local / hashing decision with IP/MPLS.

IEEE 802.1aq, when faced with a choice between two equal link cost paths, uses the following logic for its first ECMT tie breaking algorithm: first, if one path is shorter than the other in terms of hops, the shorter path is chosen, otherwise, the path with the minimum Bridge Identifier { BridgePriority concatenated with (IS-IS SysID) } is chosen. Other ECMT algorithms are created by simply using known permutations of the BridgePriority||SysIds. For example, the second defined ECMT algorithm uses the path with the minimum of the inverse of the BridgeIdentifier and can be thought of as taking the path with the maximum node identifier. For SPBM, each permutation is instantiated as a distinct B-VID. The upper limit of multipath permitations is gated by the number of B-VIDs delegated to 802.1aq operation, a maximum of 4094, although the number of useful path permutations would only require a fraction of the available B-VID space. Fourteen additional ECMT algorithms are defined with different bit masks applied to the BridgeIdentifiers. Since the BridgeIdentfier includes a priority field, it is possible to adjust the ECMT behavior by changing the BridgePriority up or down.

A service is assigned to a given ECMT B-VID at the edge of the network by configuration. As a result, non participating packets associated with that service are encapsulated with the VID associated with the desired ECMT end to end path. All individual and group address traffic associated with this service will therefore use the proper ECMT B-VID and be carried symmetrically end to end on the proper equal cost multi path. Essentially the operator decides which services go in which ECMT paths, unlike a hashing solution used in other systems such as IP/MPLS. Trees can support [[link aggregation]] (LAG) groups within a tree "branch" segment where some form of hashing occurs.

This symmetric and end to end ECMT behavior gives IEEE 802.1aq a highly predictable behavior and off line engineering tools can accurately model exact data flows. The behavior is also advantageous to networks where one way delay measurements are important. This is because the one way delay can be accurately computed as 1/2 the round trip delay. Such computations are used by time distribution protocols such as [[IEEE 1588]] for frequency and time of day synchronization as required between precision clock sources and wireless base stations.

Shown below are three figures [5,6,7] which show 8 and 16 equal cost tree (ECT) behavior in different network topologies. These are composites of screen captures of an 802.1aq network emulator and show the source in purple, the destination in yellow, and then all the computed and available shortest paths in pink. The thicker the line, the more shortest paths use that link. The animations shows three different networks and a variety of source and destination pairs which continually change to help visualize what is happening.

The equal cost tree (ECT) algorithms can be almost extended through the use of OPAQUE data which allows extensions beyond the base 16 algorithms more or less infinitely. It is expected that other standards groups or vendors will produce variations on the currently defined algorithms with behaviors suited for different networks styles. It is expected that numerous shared tree models will also be defined, as will hop by hop hash based [[Equal-cost multi-path routing|equal-cost multi-path]] (ECMP) style behaviors .. all defined by a VID and an algorithm that every node agrees to run.

===Traffic placement/engineering===
802.1aq does not spread traffic on a hop by hop basis. Instead, 802.1aq allows assignment of a Service ID (ISID) to a Vlan ID (VID) at the edge of the network. A VID will correspond to exactly one of the possible sets of shortest paths in the network and will never stray from that routing. If there are 10 or so shortest paths between different nodes, it is possible to assign different services to different paths and to know that the traffic for a given service will follow exactly the given path. In this manner traffic can easily be assigned to the desired shortest path. In the event that one of the paths becomes overloaded it is possible to move some services off those shortest paths by reassigning the services ISID to a different, less loaded, VID at the edges of the network.

The deterministic nature of the routing makes offline prediction/computation/experimentation of the network loading much simpler since actual routes are not dependent on the contents of the packet headers with the exception of the VLAN identifier.

[[Image:802d1aq Wiki Example 4.png|thumb|upright=1.1 |Figure 4 - Equal Cost Shortest Path: assignment to services]]

Figure 4 shows four different equal cost paths between nodes 7 and 5. An operator can achieve relatively good balance of traffic across the cut between nodes [0 and 2] and [1 and 3] by assigning the services at nodes 7 and 5 to one of the four desired VIDs. Using more than 4 equal cost tree (ECT) paths in the network will likely allow all 4 of these paths to be used. Balance can also be achieved between nodes 6 and 4 in a similar manner.

In the event that an operator does not wish to manually assign services to shortest paths it is a simple matter for a switch vendor to allow a simple hash of the ISID to one of the available VIDS to give a degree of non-engineered spreading. For example, the ISID modulo the number of ECT-VIDs could be used to decide on the actual relative VID to use.

In the event that the ECT paths are not sufficiently diverse the operator has the option of adjusting the inputs to the distributed ECT algorithms to apply attraction or repulsion from a given node by adjusting that node's Bridge Priority. This can be experimented with via offline tools until the desired routes are achieved at which point the bias can be applied to the real network and then ISIDs can be moved to the resulting routes.

Looking at the animations in Figure 6 shows the diversity available for traffic engineering in a 66 node network. In this animation there are 8 ECT paths available from each highlighted source to destination and therefore services could be assigned to 8 different pools based on the VID. One such initial assignment in Figure 6 could therefore be (ISID modulo 8) with subsequent fine tuning as required.

===Example===
[[Image:802d1aq Wiki Example.gif|thumb|upright=1.1 |Figure 1 - example nodes, links and interface indexes]]

We will work through SPBM behavior on a small example, with emphasis on the shortest path trees for unicast and multicast.

The network shown in Figure 1 consists of 8 participating nodes numbered 0 through 7. These would be switches or routers running the IEEE 802.1aq protocol. Each of the 8 participating nodes has a number of adjacencies numbered 1..5. These would likely correspond to interface indexes, or possibly port numbers. Since 802.1aq does not support parallel interfaces each interface corresponds to an adjacency. The port / interface index numbers are of course local and are shown because the output of the computations produce an interface index (in the case of unicast) or a set of interface indexes (in the case of multicast) which are part of the forwarding information base (FIB) together with a destination MAC address and backbone VID.

The network has a fully meshed inner core of four nodes (0..3) and then four outer nodes (4,5,6 and 7), each [[dual-homed]] onto a pair of inner core nodes.

Normally when nodes come from the factory they have a MAC address assigned which becomes a node identifier but for the purpose of this example we will assume that the nodes have MAC addresses of the form 00:00:00:00:N:00 where N is the node id (0..7) from Figure 1. Therefore, node 2 has a MAC address of 00:00:00:00:02:00. Node 2 is connected to node 7 (00:00:00:00:07:00) via node 2's interface/5.

The [[IS-IS]] protocol runs on all the links shown since they are between participating nodes. The IS-IS hello protocol has a few additions for 802.1aq including information about backbone VIDs to be used by the protocol. We will assume that the operator has chosen to use backbone VIDs 101 and 102 for this instance of 802.1aq on this network.

The node will use their MAC addresses as the IS-IS SysId and join a single IS-IS level and exchange link state packets (LSPs in IS-IS terminology). The LSPs will contain node information and link information such that every node will learn the full topology of the network. Since we have not specified any link weights in this example, the IS-IS protocol will pick a default link metric for all links, therefore all routing will be minimum hop count.

After topology discovery the next step is distributed calculation of the unicast routes for both ECMP VIDs and population of the unicast forwarding tables (FIBs).
[[Image:802d1aq Wiki Example3.png|thumb|upright=1.1 |Figure 2 - two ECMP paths between nodes 7 and 5]]

Consider the route from Node 7 to Node 5: there are a number of equal cost paths. 802.1aq specifies how to choose two of them: the first is referred to as the Low PATH ID path. This is the path which has the minimum node id on it. In this case the Low PATH ID path is the 7-&gt;0-&gt;1-&gt;5 path (as shown in red in Figure 2). Therefore, each node on that path will create a forwarding entry toward the MAC address of node five using the first ECMP VID 101. Conversely, 802.1aq specifies a second ECMP tie breaking algorithm called High PATH ID. This is the path with the maximum node identifier on it and in the example is the 7-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;5 path (shown in blue in Figure 2).

Node 7 will therefore have a FIB that among other things indicates:

* MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/1.
* MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/2.

Node 5 will have exactly the inverse in its FIB:

* MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/1.
* MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/2.

The intermediate nodes will also produce consistent results so for example node 1 will have the following entries.

* MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/5.
* MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/4.
* MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/2.
* MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/2.

And Node 2 will have entries as follows:

* MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/2.
* MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/3.
* MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/5.
* MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/5.

If we had an attached non participating device at Node 7 talking to a non participating device at Node 5 (for example Device A talks to Device C in Figure 3), they would communicate over one of these shortest paths with a MAC-in-MAC encapsulated frame. The MAC header on any of the NNI links would show an outer source address of 00:00:00:70:00, an outer destination address of 00:00:00:50:00 and a BVID of either 101 or 102 depending on which has been chosen for this set of non participating ports/vids. The header once inserted at node 7 when received from node A, would not change on any of the links until it egressed back to non participating Device C at Node 5. All participating devices would do a simple DA+VID lookup to determine the outgoing interface, and would also check that incoming interface is the proper next hop for the packet's SA+VID. The addresses of the participating nodes 00:00:00:00:00:00 ... 00:00:00:07:00 are never learned but are advertised by IS-IS as the node's SysId.

Unicast forwarding to a non-participating client (e.g. A, B, C, D from Figure 3) address is of course only possible when the first hop participating node (e.g. 7) is able to know which last hop participating node (e.g. 5) is attached to the desired non participating node (e.g. C). Since this information is not advertised by IEEE 802.1aq it has to be learned. The mechanism for learning is identical to [[IEEE 802.1ah]], in short, the corresponding outer MAC unicast DA, if not known is replaced by a multicast DA and when a response is received, the SA of that response now tells us the DA to use to reach the non participating node that sourced the response. e.g. node 7 learns that C is reached by node 5.
[[Image:802d1aq Wiki Example2.gif|thumb|upright=1.1 |Figure 3 - per source, per service multicast for E-LAN]]

Since we wish to group/scope sets of non participating ports into services and prevent them from multicasting to each other, IEEE 802.1aq provides mechanism for per source, per service multicast forwarding and defines a special multicast destination address format to provide this.
Since the multicast address must uniquely identify the tree, and because there is a tree per source per unique service, the multicast address contains two components, a service component in the low order 24 bits and a network wide unique identifier in the upper 22 bits. Since this is a multicast address the multicast bit is set, and since we are not using the standard OUI space for these manufactured addresses, the Local 'L' bit is set to disambiguate these addresses. In Figure 3 above, this is represented with the DA=[7,O] where the 7 represents packets originating from node 7 and the colored O represents the E-LAN service we are scoped within.

Prior to creating multicast forwarding for a service, nodes with ports that face that service must be told they are members. For example, nodes 7,4,5 and 6 are told they are members of the given service, for example service 200, and further that they should be using bvid 101. This is advertised by ISIS and all nodes then do the SPBM computation to determine if they are participating either as a head end or tail end, or a tandem point between other head and tail ends in the service. Since node 0 is a tandem between nodes 7 and 5 it creates a forwarding entry for packets from node 7 on this service, to node 5. Likewise, since it is a tandem between nodes 7 and 4 it creates forwarding state from node 7 for packets in this service to node 4 this results in a true multicast entry where the DA/VID have outputs on two interfaces 1 and 2. Node 2 on the other hand is only on one shortest path in this service and only creates a single forwarding entry from node 7 to node 6 for packets in this service.

Figure 3 only shows a single E-LAN service and only the tree from one of the members, however very large numbers of E-LAN services with membership from 2 to every node in the network can be supported by advertising the membership, computing the tandem behaviors, manufacturing the known multicast addresses and populating the FIBs. The only real limiting factors are the FIB table sizes and computational power of the individual devices both of which are growing yearly in leaps and bounds.

==Implementation notes==
802.1aq takes IS-IS topology information augmented with service attachment (I-SID) information, does a series of computations and produces a forwarding table (filtering table) for unicast and multicast entries.

The IS-IS extensions that carry the information required by 802.1aq are given in the '''isis-layer2''' IETF document listed below.

An implementation of 802.1aq will first modify the IS-IS hellos to include an NLPID (network layer protocol identifier) of 0xC01 in their Protocols-Supported [[Type-length-value]] (TLV) (type 129) which has been reserved for 802.1aq. The hellos also must include an MSTID (which gives the purpose of each VID) and finally each ECMT behavior must be assigned to a VID and exchanged in the hellos. The hellos would normally run untagged. Note that NLPID of IP is not required to form an adjacency for 802.1aq but also will not prevent an adjacency when present.

The links are assigned 802.1aq specific metrics which travel in their own TLV (Type Length Value) which is more or less identical to the IP link metrics. The calculations will always use the maximum of the two unidirectional link metrics to enforce symmetric route weights.

The node is assigned a mac address to identify it globally and this is used to form the IS-IS SYSID. A box mac would normally serve this purpose. The Area-Id is not directly used by 802.1aq but should, of course, be the same for nodes in the same 802.1aq network. Multiple areas/levels are not yet supported.

The node is further assigned an SPSourceID which is a 20 bit network wide unique identifier. This can often be the low 20 bits of the SYSID (if unique) or can be dynamically negotiated or manually configured.

The SPSourceID and the ECMT assignments to B-VIDs are then advertised into the IS-IS network in their own 802.1aq TLV.

The 802.1aq computations are restricted to links between nodes that have an 802.1aq link weight and which support the NLPID 0xC01. As previously discussed the link weights are forced to be symmetric for the purpose of computation by taking the min of two dissimilar values.

When a service is configured in the form of an I-SID assignment to an ECMT behavior that I-SID is then advertised along with the desired ECMT behavior and an indication of its transmit, receive properties (a new [[Type-length-value]] is used for this purpose of course).

When an 802.1aq node receives an IS-IS update it will compute the unique shortest path to all other IS-IS nodes that support 802.1aq. There will be one unique (symmetric) shortest path per ECMT behavior. The tie breaking used to enforce this uniqueness and ECMT is described below.

The unicast FDB/FIB will be populated based on this first shortest path computation. There will be one entry per ECMT behavior/B-VID produced.

The transit multicast computation (which only applies when transit replication is desired and not applicable to services that have chosen head end replication) can be implemented in many ways, care must be taken to keep this efficient, but in general a series of shortest path computations must be done. The basic requirement is to decide 'am I on the shortest path between two nodes one of which transmits an I-SID and the other receives that I-SID.'

Rather poor performing pseudo-code for this computation looks something like this:

  for each NODE in network which originates at least one transmit ISID do {
      SPF = compute the shortest path trees from NODE for all ECMT B-VIDs.
      for each ECMT behavior {
          for each NEIGHBOR of NODE {
              if NEIGHBOR is on the SPF towards NODE for this ECMT {
                 T = NODE's transmit ISIDs unioned with all receive
                     ISIDs below us on SPF
                 for each ISID in T {
                     create/modify multicast entry where [MAC-DA   = NODE.SpsourceID:20||ISID:24||LocalBit:1||MulticastBit:1
                       B-VID    = VID associated with this ECMT
                       out port = interface to NEIGHBOR
                       in port  = port towards NODE on the SPF for this ECMT]
                 }
              }
          }
       }
  }

The above pseudo code computes many more SPF's than strictly necessary in most cases and better algorithms are known to decide if a node is on a shortest path between two other nodes. A reference to a paper presented at the IEEE which gives a much faster algorithm that drastically reduces the number of outer iterations required is given below.

In general though even the exhaustive algorithm above is more than able to handle several hundred node networks in a few 10's of milliseconds on the 1&amp;nbsp;GHz or greater common CPUs when carefully crafted.

For ISIDs that have chosen head end replication the computation is trivial and involves simply finding the other attachment points that receive that ISID and creating a serial unicast table to replicate to them one by one.

===Tie-breaking===
802.1aq must produce deterministic symmetric downstream congruent shortest paths. This means that not only must a given node compute the same path forward and reverse but all the other nodes downstream (and upstream) on that path must also produce the same result. This downstream congruence is a consequence of the hop by hop forwarding nature of Ethernet since only the destination address and VID are used to decide the next hop. It is important to keep this in mind when trying to design other ECMT algorithms for 802.1aq as this is an easy trap to fall into.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
It begins by taking the unidirectional link metrics that are advertised by ISIS for 802.1aq and ensuring that they are symmetric. This is done by simply taking the MIN of the two values at both ends prior to doing any computations. This alone does not guarantee symmetry however.

[[Image:802d1aq Wiki Example 4.png|thumb|upright=1.1 |Figure 7 - Tie Breaking and path identifiers]]

The 802.1aq standard describes a mechanism called a PATHID which is a network-wide unique identifier for a path. This is a useful logical way to understand how to deterministically break ties but is not how one would implement such a tie-breaker in practice.
The PATHID is defined as just the sequence of SYSIDs that make up the path (not including the end points).. sorted.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} Every path in the network therefore has a unique PATHID independent of where in the network the path is discovered.

802.1aq simply always picks the lowest PATHID path when a choice presents itself in the shortest path computations. This ensures that every node will make the same decision.

For example, in Figure 7 above, there are four equal-cost paths between node 7 and node 5 as shown by the colors blue, green, pink and brown. The PATHID for these paths are as follows:

* PATHID['''brown'''] = {0,1}
* PATHID['''pink''']  = {0,3}
* PATHID['''green'''] = {1,2}
* PATHID['''blue''']  = {2,3}

The lowest PATHID is therefore the brown path {0,1}.

This low PATHID algorithm has very desirable properties. The first is that it can be done progressively by simply looking for the lowest SYSID along a path and secondly because an efficient implementation that operates stepwise is possible by simply back-tracking two competing paths and looking for the minimum of the two paths minimum SYSIDs.

The low PATHID algorithm is the basis of all 802.1aq tie breaking. ECMT is also based on the low PATHID algorithm by simply feeding it different SYSID permutations – one per ECMT algorithm. The most obvious permutation to pass is a complete inversion of the SYSID by XOR-ing it with 0xfff... prior to looking for the min of two minimums. This algorithm is referred to as high PATHID because it logically chooses the largest PATHID path when presented with two equal-cost choices.

In the example in figure 7, the path with the highest PATHID is therefore the blue path whose PATHID is {2,3}. Simply inverting all the SYSIDs and running the low PATHID algorithm will yield same result.

The other 14 defined ECMT algorithms use different permutations of the SYSID by XOR-ing it with different bit masks which are designed to create relatively good distribution of bits. It should be clear{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} that different permutations will result in the purple and green paths being lowest in turn.

The 17 individual 64-bit masks used by the ECT algorithm are made up of the same byte value repeated eight times to fill each 64-bit mask. These 17 byte values are as follows:

 ECT-MASK[17] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x88,
                  0x77, 0x44, 0x33, 0xCC,
                  0xBB, 0x22, 0x11, 0x66,
                  0x55, 0xAA, 0x99, 0xDD,
                  0xEE };

ECT-MASK[0] is reserved for a common spanning tree algorithm, while ECT-MASK[1] creates the Low PATHID set of shortest path first trees, ECT-MASK[2] creates the High PATHID set of shortest path trees and the other indexes create other relatively diverse permutations of shortest path first trees.

In addition the ECMT tie-breaking algorithms also permit some degree of human override or tweaking. This is accomplished by including a BridgePriority field together with the SYSID such that the combination, called a BridgeIdentfier, becomes the input to the ECT algorithm. By adjusting the BridgePriority up or down a path's PATHID can be raised or lowered relative to others and a substantial degree of tunability is afforded.

The above description gives an easy to understand way to view the tie breaking; an actual implementation simply backtracks from the fork point to the join point in two competing equal-cost paths (usually during the [[Dijkstra's algorithm|Dijkstra shortest path]] computation) and picks the path traversing the lowest (after masking) BridgePriority|SysId.

==Interoperability==

The first public interoperability tests of IEEE 802.1aq were held in Ottawa in October 2010. Two vendors provided SPBM implementations and a total of 5 physical switches and 32 emulated switches were tested for control/data and OA&amp;M.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==

'''May, 1991''' — Olexiy Sihov and Andriy Anisimov founded the company to develop computer-based monitoring systems for fire stations in Kiev, [[Moscow]], and other cities of the [[former USSR]].

'''Joliet Army Ammunition Plant '''('''JOAAP''', formerly known as the '''Joliet Arsenal''') was a [[United States Army]] [[arsenal]] located in [[Will County, Illinois]], near [[Elwood, Illinois]], south of [[Joliet, Illinois]]. Opened in 1940 during [[World War II]], the facility consisted of the Elwood Ordnance Plant (EOP) and the Kankakee Ordnance Works (KNK). In 1945, the two were deactivated and combined forming the Joliet Arsenal. The plant was reactivated for the [[Korean War]] and renamed Joliet Army Ammunition Plant during the [[Vietnam War]]. Production of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] ended in 1976, and the major plant operations closed shortly after in the late 1970s. The facility briefly revived an automated load-assemble-pack (LAP) artillery shell operation that was managed by the [[Honeywell Corporation]] during the Reagan administration in the 1980s before it was finally closed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Portions of the site have been redeveloped forming the [[CenterPoint Intermodal Center]], [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] and [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]].

==Pre-World War II==
Before the Second World War, the land in [[Jackson Township, Will County, Illinois]], where the Joliet Arsenal was built consisted mostly of small family farms some of which were owned and managed by descendents of pioneer Illinois settlers. The federal government acquired some of the land in Jackson Township to build the Joliet Arsenal through eminent domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Terry |title=Disarming The Prairie |location=Baltimore |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |date=1998 |isbn=0-8018-5936-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the plant's construction, there were 450 farms that had to be vacated by March 1, 1941. Initially there was some resistance from local farmers relating to prices and moving problems, but 90% of the land was paid for through negotiated settlements. The entire land acquisition cost the government $5 million for the {{convert|40000|acre|km2|sing=on}} project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Illinois Erects Defense Center - 40,000 Acre Tract Being Converted Into Arms Workshop |newspaper=The Ogden Standard-Examiner |location=Ogden, Utah |date=February 8, 1941 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten preexisting farmhouses were moved from their original locations and used as staff housing. Six cemeteries were also on the property and they were maintained in place by the operating contractor.&lt;ref name="HAER"/&gt;

==World War II==
{{location map|Illinois|caption=Location in Illinois|lat_deg=41.374444|lon_deg=-88.125556}}
The United States had very little capacity for manufacturing military [[munition]]s in 1939 when World War II broke out. Since the manufacture of munitions required specialized equipment and techniques there were no existing plants that could be converted. The solution to the lack of capacity was to create a large network of interlocking [[ammunition]] plants. They would be government-owned, but contractor-operated (GOCO). More than 60 plants would be constructed between June 1940 and December 1942.&lt;ref name="HAER"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Rathbun |first=Peter |title=Joliet Army Ammunition Plant |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/il/il0400/il0463/data/il0463data.pdf |work=Historic American Engineering Record |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elwood Ordnance Plant, named for [[Elwood, Illinois]], and the Kankakee Ordnance Works, named for the [[Kankakee River]], were two of the first five to be constructed. In September 1940, [[Stone &amp; Webster|Stone and Webster Engineering]] of New York was awarded the contract to construct the Kankakee Ordnance Works. Another New York firm, [[Sanderson and Porter]], received the contract for the Elwood Ordnance Plant soon after. Construction on both plants began November 1940, with Elwood beginning production July 12, 1941, followed by Kankakee in September. The plants were separate since they had different purposes, Kankakee manufactured various types of explosives for use at other plants and Elwood loaded artillery shells, bombs, mines and other munitions.&lt;ref name="HAER"/&gt;

[[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], an experienced explosives manufacturer, was selected to operate the Kankakee plant while Sanderson and Porter would operate the Elwood facility. In April 1944, [[United States Rubber Company]] would replace DuPont as contractor at the Kankakee facility. TNT production at the Kankakee works occurred until August 1945 with a peak output of {{Convert|5.5|e6ST|e6MT}} per week. In November 1945, Elwood and Kankakee were combined to form the Joliet Arsenal. Following the war the site was not completely inactive, DuPont leased space to manufacture [[ammonium nitrate]] for fertilizer.&lt;ref name="HAER"/&gt; Over 10,425 people were employed at the two plants during the peak production of World War II. Elwood loaded more than 926 million bombs, shells, mines, detonators, fuzes, and boosters, and Kankakee produced over {{Convert|1|e9lb|MT}} of TNT.&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;GlobalSecurity.org. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/aap-joliet.htm Joliet Army Ammunition Plant].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant explosion==
Though both plants were designed with safety as a primary concern,&lt;ref name="HAER"/&gt; at 2:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 5, 1942, a large explosion on the assembly line at the Elwood facility resulted in 48 dead or missing and was felt as far as [[Waukegan, Illinois]], over {{convert|60|mi|km}} north.&lt;ref&gt;Joliet Library. [http://www.joliet.lib.il.us/Digitization%20Projects/The%201940s/6-5-42.htm The 1940s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721063207/http://www.joliet.lib.il.us/Digitization%20Projects/The%201940s/6-5-42.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assembly Lines were located in separate buildings which were separated by substantial distances limiting major damage to the facility as a whole.

From a [[United Press International|United Press]] newspaper article written at the time, "Explosion shattered buildings of one of the units of the $30,000,000 Elwood Ordnance plant gave up the bodies of 21 workers Friday. Army officials said 36 more were missing from the blast that could be felt for a radius of 100 miles. Another 41 were injured, five of them critically, from the explosion that leveled a building.... Not one of the 68 men inside the shipping unit when the blast occurred escaped death or injury."

"The explosion put one of the 12 production units out of action temporarily, but operations continued in the others."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Explosion Fails To Jar Morale", ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, Sunday 7 June 1942, Volume 60, Number 24, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean War==
Production resumed in 1952 after rehabilitation of the facility by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. The Kankakee portion was used to manufacture TNT under the control of contractor United States Rubber Company while Elwood operated under U.S. government control. Following the Korean war, Elwood would continue production in a limited capacity until deactivated in 1965.&lt;ref name="HAER"/&gt; Kankakee production would end in 1957.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt;

==Vietnam War==
The Elwood unit was reopened in 1966 and would produce artillery rounds, supplementary charge assemblies and [[cluster bomb]] units. The Kankakee unit was reopened in 1965 and would manufacture TNT until 1976.&lt;ref name="HAER"/&gt; During the Vietnam War the Joliet Arsenal was renamed Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. The majority of operations at the facility were terminated by the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt;

==Redevelopment==
In 1993, {{Convert|23,500|acre|km2|0}} of land was declared to be excess.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt; Remediation of the site occurred prior to the redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.containment.fsu.edu/cd/content/pdf/069.pdf Remdiation of Explosives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sevenson.com/index.php/project-summaries/joliet-army-ammunition-plant-bioremediation/ Joliet Army Ammunition Plant Bioremediation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r0599041.pdf EPA Superfund]&lt;/ref&gt; Redevelopment plans included around {{Convert|3,000|acre|km2|0}} for two industrial parks, {{Convert|455|acre|km2|1}} for the Will County Landfill, {{Convert|982|acre|km2|1}} for the [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]], and {{Convert|19,000|acre|km2|0}} for the [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]]. The government retained a portion as the Joliet Army Training Area.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt; The industrial parks are composed of the largest inland intermodal center in the country, [[CenterPoint Intermodal Center]] which is served by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and the [[BNSF Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune.

August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; along with several other prominent U.S. companies distribution warehouses.

==Environmental issues==
The EPA maintains portions of the property on the [[Superfund]] [[National Priorities List]]. Cleanup includes composting by the Army Corps of Engineers. The cemetery and industrial parks were on the buffer portion of the facility, and there was little or no cleanup required. However, portions of the site that became [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]] were heavily contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;EPA District 5 Superfund list. [https://archive.is/20120729064232/http://www.epa.gov/docs/R5Super/fed_fac/npl_sites/ff_npl_jaap_lap.html Joliet Army Ammunition Plant].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the clean-up included disposing of live explosive cartridges and shells using controlled explosions. The explosives to be cleaned up were buried by the army in unknown years. The residents of surrounding small towns could hear the controlled explosions being used in the disposal activity from 2-3 miles away.

In early 2008, site cleanup was finished three years ahead of schedule, while groundwater monitoring remains ongoing. Part of the prairie restoration at Midewin includes introducing American bison to graze on an experimental basis on approximately 1,200 acres of fenced pasture located within the Prairie’s 19,000 total acres. In October 2015, the U.S. Forest Service announced the arrival of 27 American bison to the prairie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-success-stories-epa-region-5|title=Superfund Success Stories: EPA Region 5|last=|first=|date=|website=www.epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18147">'''[[Mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs) in the [[United Kingdom]]''' lease wireless telephone and data spectrum from the four major carriers [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]], [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[Hutchison 3G|Three]], and [[Vodafone UK|Vodafone]] for resale.

SIM cards provided by MVNOs that are using Three's network will only work with 3G/4G devices, as Three do not operate 2G infrastructure in the UK.

During the 1980s and 1990s a relatively large number of companies appeared selling primarily 2D [[graphics card]]s and later [[3D graphics card|3D]]. Most of those companies have subsequently disappeared, as the increasing complexity of [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s substantially increased research and development costs. Many of these companies subsequently went bankrupt or were bought out. [[Intel]] and [[VIA Technologies]] remain as producers of primarily integrated solutions, while [[Matrox]] targets niche markets. Amongst the notable discrete graphics card vendors, [[ATI Technologies]] &amp;mdash; acquired by [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] in 2006 and since renamed to [[AMD]] &amp;mdash; and [[NVIDIA]] are the only ones that have lasted.

==Defunct graphics chip makers==
These companies designed graphics chips and cards.

*[[3Dfx]] - assets were acquired by [[NVIDIA]] during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2285">The '''Looj''' was a [[rain gutter]] (eavestrough) cleaning [[domestic robot]] made and sold by [[iRobot]].

The Looj was not an [[autonomous robot]], but rather a remote-controlled robot patterned after a toy tank with a power drill mounted on the front.

==Description==
The Looj was a {{convert|2.25|in|cm}} tall and {{convert|3.25|in|cm}} wide robot that fit inside most gutters to clean out debris stuck inside them, such as leaves and pine needles. It had long treads on its side which allowed it to move inside the gutter, and an auger attached to its front. The auger, spinning flexible flaps at 500 RPM, dislodged and removed debris inside the gutter by flinging it sideways into the air. The device also had a detachable handle/remote, that was used to carry and operate the robot.

The first Looj models were powered by an internal 7.2 V [[NiCad|NiCad rechargeable battery]], which must be removed for charging. Later models use a [[Lithium-ion|Li-ion rechargeable battery]] instead.

The Looj was discontinued in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hey |first1=Jeff Vande |title=Is iRobot's Dominance Coming to an End? |url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/24/is-irobots-dominance-coming-to-an-end.aspx |website=The Motley Fool |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

[[File:Meat processing-01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|]]
A '''meat cutter''' prepares [[primal cut]]s into a variety of smaller cuts intended for sale in a [[retail]] environment. The duties of a meat cutter largely overlap those of the [[butcher]], but butchers tend to specialize in pre-sale processing (reducing carcasses to primal cuts), whereas meat cutters further cut and process the primal cuts per individual customer request. 

The job title of "butcher" has been mostly replaced in corporate storefronts in the last two decades after customer trends showed that modern (particularly urban) customers increasingly associated the term with animal slaughter and unsanitary conditions (regardless of the condition of the store). With the advent of off-premises pre-packaged supermarket meat, many supermarkets now avoid mention of either cutting or butchering and simply call their meat cutters "Meat Department Associates" or similar. In the UK the term butcher is still used to describe a person, who offers for retail sale, meat ready for cooking by the customer.  They will also prepare cuts, joints etc, for the customer.  Most corporate retailers still use the term butcher for their meat department operatives

==Overview==
A meat cutter is responsible to prepare standard cuts of meat (including [[poultry]] and [[fish]]) to be sold in either a self-serve or specialty counter. In the UK the term used for retail meat cutter, is still butcher. Retail meat cutters are found in a customer-oriented, retail environment. This can be anything from a small family-owned meat shop to a large international [[supermarket chain]]. Meat cutters are a registered trade.  Industrial meat cutters are found in production-oriented facilities, and generally perform fewer tasks, but repeatedly.

The term "meat cutters" typically deal with "primal" cuts - segments of the carcass broken down into smaller (but still unfinished) pieces to make them easier to handle.

==Working conditions==
Retail meat cutters traditionally work [[indoors]], in large, refrigerated rooms, with temperatures ranging between 2 and –4 degrees [[Celsius]]. These environments are kept [[sanitary]], and are washed every day with powerful antibacterial cleaners. In larger retail outlets or plant-facilities, working environments are generally equipped with power tools such as [[band saw]]s and circular slicers. Meat cutters are also generally required to be in good physical shape; the duties of a meat cutter include standing for long periods of time, regularly lifting over 50&amp;nbsp;lbs, and working in cold conditions. Retail meat cutters also often have to deal with [[customer]]s.

==Duties==
The duties of a retail meat cutter often include the trimming of [[primal cut]]s, making [[ground meat]] out of trimmings from the primal cuts, ensuring meat cuts are displayed in an eye-catching manner and are of sufficient quality, and serving customized orders to customers. Retail meat cutters are also responsible to keep their working areas clean, and ensure that proper sanitization procedures are followed.

The term {{Nihongo|'''mecha'''|メカ|meka}} may refer to both [[Science|scientific]] ideas and [[science fiction]] [[genre]]s that center on giant robots or machines controlled by people. Mechas are typically depicted as humanoid [[mobile robot]]s.

These machines vary greatly in size and shape, but are distinguished from [[vehicle]]s by their [[humanoid]] or [[Biorobotics|biomorphic]] appearance and size—bigger than a human. Different [[Genre#Subgenre|subgenres]] exist, with varying connotations of realism. The concept of [[Super Robot]] and [[Real Robot]] are two such examples found in Japanese [[anime]]. The term may also refer to real world piloted humanoid or non-humanoid [[Robot locomotion|robotic platforms]], either currently in existence or still on the drawing board (i.e. at the planning or design stage). Alternatively, in the original Japanese context of the word, "mecha" may refer to mobile machinery/vehicles (including aircraft) in general, manned or [[Mobile robot|otherwise]].

==Characteristics==

The word {{nihongo|"mecha"|メカ|meka}} is an abbreviation, first used in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]], of the word "[[wikt:Mechanical|mechanical]]". In Japanese, mecha encompasses all mechanical objects, including [[automobile|cars]], [[firearm|guns]], [[computers]], and other devices, and the term {{nihongo|"robot"|ロボット|robotto}} or "giant robot" is used to distinguish limbed vehicles from other mechanical devices.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Outside of this usage, it has become associated with large humanoid machines with limbs or other biological characteristics. Mechs differ from robots in that they are piloted from a [[cockpit]], typically located in the chest or head of the mech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/mech/3055-21/|title=Mech (Object) - Giant Bomb|website=Giant Bomb|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

While the distinction is often hazy, mecha typically does not refer to form-fitting [[Powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] such as [[Iron Man]]'s suit. They are usually much larger than the wearer, like Iron Man's enemy the [[Iron Monger]], or the mobile suits depicted in the [[Gundam]] series.

In most cases, mecha are depicted as fighting machines, whose appeal comes from the combination of potent weaponry with a more stylish combat technique than a mere vehicle. Often, they are the primary means of combat, with conflicts sometimes being decided through [[gladiator|gladiatorial matches]]. Other works represent mecha as one component of an integrated [[military]] force, supported by and fighting alongside [[tank]]s, [[fighter aircraft]], and [[infantry]], functioning as a mechanical cavalry. The applications often highlight the theoretical usefulness of such a device, combining a tank's resilience and firepower with infantry's ability to cross unstable terrain and a high degree of customization. In some continuities, special scenarios are constructed to make mecha more viable than current-day status. For example, in Gundam the fictional Minovsky particle inhibits the use of radar, making long-range ballistic strikes impractical, thus favouring relatively close range warfare of Mobile Suits.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

However, some stories, such as the [[manga]]/[[anime]] series ''[[Patlabor]]'' and the American wargame [[BattleTech]] [[Fictional universe|universe]], also encompass mecha used for civilian purposes such as heavy construction work, [[police]] functions or [[firefighting]]. Mecha also see roles as transporters, recreation, advanced [[hazmat suit]]s and other [[R and D]] applications.

Mecha have been used in [[fantasy]] settings, for example in the anime series ''[[Aura Battler Dunbine]]'', ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]'', ''[[Panzer World Galient]]'' and ''[[Maze (anime)|Maze]]''. In those cases, the mecha designs are usually based on some alternative or "lost" science-fiction technology from ancient times. In case of anime series ''[[Zoids]]'', the machines resemble dinosaurs and animals, and have been shown to [[Evolution|evolve]] from native metallic organisms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Early history==
The 1868 [[Edward S. Ellis]] novel ''[[The Steam Man of the Prairies]]'' featured a steam-powered, back piloted, mechanical man.
The 1880 [[Jules Verne]] novel ''[[The Steam House|La Maison à vapeur (The Steam House)]]'' featured a steam-powered, piloted, mechanical elephant. One of the first appearances of such machines in modern [[literature]] was the ''[[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]]'' of [[H. G. Wells]]' famous ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1897).  The novel does not contain a fully detailed description of the tripods' (or "fighting-machine", as they are known in the novel) mode of [[motion (physics)|locomotion]], however it is hinted at: "Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand."

''[[Ōgon Bat]]'', a [[kamishibai]] that debuted in 1931 (later adapted into an [[anime]] in 1967), featured the first piloted humanoid giant robot, {{Nihongo|Dai Ningen Tanku|大人間タンク}}&lt;ref name=Ningen_Tanku&gt;{{Nihongo|Dai Ningen Tanku|大人間タンク}} means Giant {{Nihongo|Ningen Tanku|人間タンク}} , {{Nihongo|Ningen Tanku|人間タンク}} is the Japanese title of [[The Master Mystery]](1919), and the Japanese name of the [[Powered exoskeleton]] appearing in the film.{{Cite web |url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/907163?itemId=info%3Andljp%2Fpid%2F907163&amp;__lang=en |title=人間タンク : 奇蹟の人 |work=
NDL Digital Collections}}It was a general Japanese phrase meaning "humanoid tank" too.{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=AKjJwuvi7mYC&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=日本ロボット戦争記 1939~1945 |accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but as an enemy rather than a protagonist. The first humanoid giant robot piloted by the protagonist appeared in the [[manga]] {{Nihongo|''Nuclear Power Android''|原子力人造人間|Gensiryokuzinzōningen}} in 1948.&lt;ref name=ndl&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1637344?itemId=info%3Andljp%2Fpid%2F1637344&amp;__lang=en |title=原子力人造人間 |work=NDL Digital Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manga and anime ''[[Tetsujin 28-Go]]'', introduced in 1956, featured a robot, Tetsujin, that was controlled externally by an operator via remote control. The manga and anime ''[[Astro Boy]]'', introduced in 1952, with its humanoid robot protagonist, was a key influence on the development of the giant robot genre in Japan. The first anime featuring a giant mecha being piloted by the protagonist from within a cockpit was the [[Super Robot]] show ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', written by [[Go Nagai]] and introduced in 1972.&lt;ref name="Gilson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilson|first1=Mark|title=A Brief History of Japanese Robophilia|journal=Leonardo|date=1998|volume=31|issue=5|pages=367–369|doi=10.2307/1576597|jstor=1576597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early uses of mech-like machines in the United States include Kimball Kinnison's battle suit in [[E. E. Smith|E. E. "Doc" Smith's]] ''[[Lensman series|Lensman]]'' novel ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'' (1950), the [[Mobile Infantry (Starship Troopers)|Mobile Infantry]] battle suits in [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein's]] ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' (1958), and the film ''The King and the Mockingbird'' (1952).

===In manga and anime===
{{Further|Mecha anime and manga}}

In Japan, "robot anime" (known as "mecha anime" outside Japan) is one of the oldest genres in anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dra-mata.com/manga/nagai/gn-mazingerz01.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040529091606/http://www.dra-mata.com/manga/nagai/gn-mazingerz01.jpg |archivedate=2004-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robot anime is often tied in with toy manufacturers. Large franchises such as [[Zoids]] and [[Gundam]] have hundreds of different model kits&lt;!--Zoids has over 200, source original research--&gt;.

The size of mecha can vary according to the story and concepts involved. Some of them may not be considerably taller than a tank (''[[Armored Trooper Votoms]]'', ''[[Megazone 23]]'', ''[[Code Geass]]''), some may be a few stories tall (''[[Gundam]]'',  ''[[Escaflowne]]'', ''[[Bismark (anime)|Bismark]]'', ''[[Gurren Lagann]]''), others can be as tall as a [[skyscraper]] (''[[Space Runaway Ideon]]'', ''[[Genesis of Aquarion]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''), some are big enough to contain an entire city (''[[Macross]]''), some the size of a planet (''[[Diebuster]]''), galaxies (''[[Getter Robo]]'', ''[[Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]''), or even as large as universes (''[[Gurren Lagann#Anime films|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Lagann-hen]]'', ''[[Demonbane]]'').

The first giant robot seen was Mitsuteru Yokoyama's 1956 [[manga]] ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''. However, it wasn't until the advent of [[Go Nagai]]'s ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' that the genre was established. ''Mazinger Z'' innovated by adding the inclusion of futuristic weapons, and the concept of being able to pilot from a cockpit&lt;ref name="Gilson"/&gt; (rather than via remote control, in the case of Tetsujin). &lt;!--These traits have since been replicated more often that the ones seen in Tetsujin source: number of shows with pilots/super robots--&gt;  According to Go Nagai:

{{Quote|''I wanted to create something different, and I thought it would be interesting to have a robot that you could drive, like a car.''&lt;ref name="Gilson"/&gt;}}

''Mazinger Z'' featured giant robots which were "piloted by means of a small flying car and command center that docked inside the head."&lt;ref name="Gilson"/&gt; It was also a pioneer in [[Die-cast toy|die-cast metal toys]] such as the [[Chogokin]] series in Japan and the [[Shogun Warriors (toys)|Shogun Warriors]] in the U.S., that were (and still are) very popular with children and collectors.

Robot/mecha anime and manga differ vastly in storytelling and animation quality from title to title, and content ranges all the way from children's shows to ones intended for an older teen or adult audience.

Some robot mecha are capable of transformation (''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam|Zeta Gundam]]'') or combining to form even bigger ones (''[[Beast King GoLion]]'' and ''[[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]''). [[Go Nagai]] is also often credited with inventing this in 1974 with the television series ''[[Getter Robo]]''.

Not all mecha need be completely mechanical. Some have biological components with which to interface with their pilots, and some are partially biological themselves, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Eureka Seven]]'', and ''[[Zoids]]''.

Mecha based on anime have seen extreme cultural reception across the world. The personification of this popularity can be seen as 1:1 size ''Mazinger Z'', Tetsujin, and Gundam statues built across the world.

Mecha are often featured in computer and console [[video game]]s. Because of their size and fictional power, mecha are quite popular subjects for games, both tabletop and electronic. They have been featured in video games since the 1980s, particularly in [[vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]] and [[shooter game]]s, including Sesame Japan's [[side-scrolling shooter]] game ''[[Vastar]]'' in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|10299|Vastar}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[List of Gundam video games|''Gundam'' games]] such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Last Shooting]]'' in 1984 and ''[[Kidō Senshi Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble|Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble]]'' in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savorelli|first1=Carlos|title=Kidō Senshi Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble|url=http://hg101.kontek.net/zgundam/zgundam.htm|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=November 15, 2017|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] shooters ''[[Shoot 'em up#Golden age and refinement|Hover Attack]]'' in 1984 and ''[[Thexder]]'' in 1985, and [[Arsys Software]]'s [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[role-playing shooters]] ''[[Wibarm|WiBArm]]'' in 1986 and ''[[Star Cruiser]]'' in 1988.

==Real mecha==
There are a few real prototypes of mecha-like vehicles. Currently almost all of these are highly specialized or just for concept purpose, and as such may not see [[mass production]].

* [[Land Walker]]: A machine developed by Sakakibara Kikai with the intention of giving the impression of a bipedal mecha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sakakibara-Kikai website|url=http://www.sakakibara-kikai.co.jp/|website=Sakakibara-Kikai|publisher=Sakakibara Machinery Co., Ltd.|accessdate=November 19, 2017|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=kiyomasa|title=LAND WALKER -Japanese Robot suit-|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVwbUljGs3g|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=November 19, 2017|date=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[T-52 Enryu]]: Translated name "Rescue Dragon", it is a 3.5 meter-tall hydraulically-operated robotic vehicle developed by Tmsuk. The vehicle has two hands, which copy the controller's movements. Its intended application is to open a path in the debris for the rescue team.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
*In 2018, Japanese engineer Masaaki Nagumo from Sakakibara Kikai completed construction of a functional bipedal mecha inspired by the ''[[Gundam]]'' franchise. The device, standing 8.5 meters tall and weighing about 7 tonnes, possesses fully functional arm and leg servos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese engineer builds giant robot to realise 'Gundam' dream|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japanese-engineer-builds-giant-robot-to-realise-gundam-dream|website=[[Straits Times]]|accessdate=April 14, 2018|date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western world, there are few examples of mecha, however, several machines have been constructed by both companies and private figures. [[Timberjack]], a subsidiary of [[John Deere]], built a practical [[Hexapod (robotics)|hexapod]] walking harvester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=beej69|title=Timberjack Walking Machine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2V8GFqk_Y|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=November 15, 2017|date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8980">A '''Mountain Locator Unit''' or '''MLU''' was a [[radio transmitter]] for use by [[mountaineering|mountain climbers]] as an emergency [[radio beacon|locator beacon]] when the wearer needs rescue.

The MLUs were simple radio beacons, and thus required [[search and rescue]]rs to use traditional [[radio direction finding]] (RDF or DF) equipment to obtain a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]], but not a precise location, to the beacon.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Inn, open 24 hours a day.  The units were available from the late 1980s until 2017, but advances in technology now provide superior locating information by devices such as a PLB, InReach or Spot.

Groups scaling Mount Hood are recommended to carry an emergency signaling device and all climbers must register before climbing and sign out upon return.

The MLU was designed after a school group with two adults and seven children perished on Mount Hood in 1986.  (See [[Mount Hood climbing accidents]].) The bodies of some of the group were found in a snow cave a day after the searchers had passed within fifteen feet of their shelter without noticing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Steve Rollins of [[Portland Mountain Rescue]], the units could be worn on a sash across the chest and were relatively light.&lt;ref name="The Oregonian"/&gt; Renting MLU's was less expensive than either purchasing or renting a [[personal locator beacon]], which typically cost several hundred dollars to buy, or rent from various sources for around $50 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Mount Hood MLU system was controlled and maintained by the U.S. Forest Service and Clackamas County Sheriff. Transmitters broadcast at 168.54 [[VHF|MHz]] and provided good signals even when buried in snow.  They could be received at up to {{convert|20|mi|km}}, though the signal travels in line of sight, so they could not be received from behind a ridge or deep in a canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A Mountain Locator Unit only transmitted a signal and did not initiate a rescue (when you activated an MLU beacon, there was no one monitoring for signals, the device only assisted rescuers in locating lost climbers once a rescue has been requested by other means and rescuers know to listen and search for the beacon's signal. They were also not designed to be used for avalanche safety (avalanche beacons are entirely different than what MLU's were designed for.)

The use of MLU Beacon technology was overtaken by availability of Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) and other technologies such as "SPOT Satellite GPS Messengers". These newer technologies not only allow rescuers to determine your location, but they also have the ability to initiate a rescue by alerting authorities that you are in need of help.

In fact, most modern cell phones have built in GPS receivers. If a climber calls 911, the cell phone may automatically provide emergency services with the climber's GPS coordinates. Cell phones also allow the lost or injured climber to provide important information to rescuers, such as the nature of any injuries; however, cell phone coverage on Mount Hood can be spotty and they are therefore not necessarily a replacement for other technologies such as PLBs which leverage satellites overhead for communication.

Oregon State Representative [[John Lim]] (R) introduced [https://web.archive.org/web/20070211052745/http://www.leg.state.or.us/07reg/measures/hb2500.dir/hb2509.intro.html House Bill 2509], which would require climbers to use an electronic signaling device when climbing above 10,000 feet between November and March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Important Notes==

* MLUs can assist rescuers in locating a lost climber if the climber activates the beacon and rescuers are aware the climber is equipped with the device. An MLU does not initiate a rescue by being activated; rescuers need to know to look for one.
* It is critical to know the abilities and limitations of the technology you carry, and not to be fooled into taking increased risks simply because you are carrying a beacon that may summon rescuers.
* MLU beacons are not designed to be used as avalanche safety equipment, they do not provide the ability to locate other beacons as avalanche beacons do.
* MLUs only work on Mount Hood where rescue crews have specialized equipment to locate them. Rescue agencies on other mountains do not have the ability to locate MLUs.
* MLUs are based on aging technology and are being replaced by Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) and other devices such as "SPOT GPS Satellite Messengers". Even modern cell phones often have GPS chips built in; dialing 911 may provide emergency services with the cell phone's GPS coordinates which can be more useful than having only an MLU.
* Rescuers recommend that climbers carry a signaling device for use in emergencies. Signaling devices can include an MLU, Personal Locator Beacon (PLB), SPOT GPS Satellite Messenger, or 2-way radio (such as a HAM-radio), or cell phone. 
* Rescue organizations oppose requiring climbers to carry beacons, primarily because mandating beacons increases the chance that climbers will take more risks than they would without a beacon (a phenomenon known as "Risk Homeostasis".)

'''NHT Loudspeakers''' (Now Hear This), often colloquially referred to as '''NHT Audio'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4080684|title=NHT Audio, LLC: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is an American loudspeaker and audio component company based in [[California|Benicia, California]]. The company was founded by Chris Byrne and [[Ken Kantor]] in December 1986. 

NHT [[home cinema|home theater]] products have historically included [[loudspeaker]]s, A/V processors, and [[amplifiers]]. NHT professional processors and speakers are used in recording and production studios. The current NHT lineup consists solely of [[acoustic suspension]] loudspeakers and in-wall/in-ceiling speakers.

== History ==
Byrne primarily handled sales and marketing, while Kantor (introduced to Byrne by Michael Riggs, then at ''High Fidelity'' magazine) was responsible for design and engineering. 

In 1987, NHT shipped its first product, the Model 1 loudspeaker.

In 2004, NHT unveiled its XdS line of speakers and supporting processors. XdS speakers are [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] corrected [[active speakers]] with [[PWM amplifier|digital amplifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stereophile.com/standloudspeakers/1105nht/index.html|title=NHT Xd active loudspeaker system|date=2005-11-19|work=Stereophile.com|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XdS line has since been discontinued.

In 2007, NHT introduced the Classic Three Bookshelf Speaker, which received critical acclaim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/nht-classic-three-loudspeaker/?page=3|title=NHT Classic Three Loudspeaker|work=The Absolute Sound|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/NHT-Classic-Three-Bookshelf-Speaker-Review.shtml|title=NHT Classic Three Bookshelf Speaker Review|work=BigPictureBigSound|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stereophile.com/standloudspeakers/1106nht/index.html|title=NHT Classic Three loudspeaker|date=2006-11-19|work=Stereophile.com|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Theo Nicolakis of Audioholics wrote that "what the Classic Threes do have is a total sonic package that’s nothing short of amazing".

In 2016, NHT released its C Series line of speakers to replace the Classic Series. Secrets of Home Theater Hi-Fi praised the C 3 Bookshelf, saying the speakers "look great, sound great, and measure superbly. And in true NHT tradition, they accomplish all that at a very reasonable price."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hometheaterhifi.com/reviews/speaker/bookshelf/nht-c3-bookshelf-speaker-review/|title=NHT C3 Bookshelf Speaker Review - HomeTheaterHifi.com|date=2018-02-20|work=HomeTheaterHifi.com|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9860">'''[[Nanocar]] Race''' is an international scientific competition with the aim of testing the performance of molecular machines and the scientific instruments used to control them. The race of the molecules is taking place on a 100 nanometer track and was held for the first time in [[Toulouse]] on 28 and 29 April 2017.

== History ==
The idea for the race was formulated in January 2013 in the ACS Nano magazine by the Toulouse organizers of CEMES-[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], this way a call for applications was launched to give the participating teams time to prepare appropriate nanocars. The race is officially announced by the National Centre for Scientific Research in November 2015 in Toulouse during Futurapolis1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/11/30/2227726-nanocar-race-la-course-de-petites-voitures-pour-grands-savants.html| title=NanoCar Race : la course de petites voitures pour grands savants|trans-title=NanoCar Race: the race of small cars for great scientists|language=French|date=November 30, 2017|newspaper=[[La Dépêche du Midi]]|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, five teams presented their prototype projects on November 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.cnrs.fr/presse/communique/4317.htm | title=NanoCar Race, la première course internationale de molécules-voitures|trans-title=NanoCar Race, the first international race of molecules-cars|date=November 24, 2015|publisher=[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toulouse organizers also agreed on the competition of two more vehicles, which will then be remotely controlled via Internet from the CEMES-CNRS race room on the microscope of their own laboratory. These relates to the vehicles from [[Ohio]] and Graz-Rice.

The Nanocar race II, the second edition of this competition will take place in 2021 and is currently in the preparation stages with the support of the European project [[H2020]]: MEMO (2017-2021).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.memo-project.eu/flatCMS/index.php/Nanocar-Race-II|title=Nanocar Race II|year=2018|website=memo-project.eu|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition ==

=== The track ===
The track of the first competition is a [[gold]] surface, equipped with grooves to define race lanes in order to avoid losing vehicles. It is about 100 nanometres long, and includes two bends.&lt;ref name=lepoint2017 /&gt; It is located in a small enclosure cooled to -269°C under a primary vacuum of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; mbar and is observed simultaneously by four [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s (STM)&lt;ref name=lepoint2017 /&gt; miniaturized for this event and operating on the same surface. Each microscope is responsible for driving a single vehicle (a single nanocar).

During this competition, the nanocars should move as far as possible on the gold track during the 36 hours race. Speeds of 5 nanometers per hour were expected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/fondamental/nanocar-race-top-depart-a-10h45-pour-la-course-de-molecules_112019 | title=Nanocar Race : Top départ à 10h45 pour la course de molecules|trans-title=Nanocar Race: Top start at 10:45 for the race of molecules|language=French|author=Erwan Lecomte|date=April 6, 2017|website=sciencesetavenir.fr|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nanocars ===
Nanocars are a new class of molecular machines that can roll across solid surfaces with structurally defined direction.&lt;ref&gt;J. AM. CHEM. SOC. 9, 128,14, 2006, 4857&lt;/ref&gt; They are molecules essentially composed of a few tens or hundreds of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] [[atoms]] and are measuring one to three [[nanometers]].

The nanocar is propelled step by step by electrical impulses and [[electron transfer]] from the tip of the STM. The resulting tunnel current flows through the nanocar between the tip of the microscope and the common metal track. There is no direct mechanical contact with the tip. The nanocar is therefore neither pushed nor deformed by the tip of the microscope during the race. Some of the electrons that pass through the nanocar release energy as small intramolecular vibrations that activate the nanocar's motor.

=== Teams ===

* [[Switzerland]]: Swiss Nano Dragster, [[University of Basel]]
* [[France]]: Toulouse nanomobile club, [[Paul Sabatier University]]
* [[Austria]]/[[United States]]: NanoPrix Team [[Graz University of Technology]] / [[Rice University]]
* [[Germany]]: Nano-windmill Company [[Technical University of Dresden]] ([[TU Dresden]])

* [[United States]]: Ohio Bobcat Nano-Wagon, [[Ohio University]]

=== Results ===
The race on the [[gold]] surface was won by the Swiss team that crossed the finish line first after covering a distance of 133 nanometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.numerama.com/sciences/253881-nanocar-race-la-suisse-remporte-la-premiere-course-de-voitures-moleculaires.html | title=NanoCar-Race : La Suisse remporte la première course de voitures moléculaires | trans-title=NanoCar-Race: Switzerland wins the first molecular car race|language=French|date=May 1, 2017|author=Julien Lausson|website=[[Numerama]]|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[silver]] track, the vehicle of the Austrian-American team from the Universities of Rice and Graz set the first speed record with a peak speed of 95 nanometers per hour,&lt;ref name=avenir2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/fondamental/nanocar-race-de-toulouse-un-bolide-moleculaire-laisse-ses-concurrents-sur-place_112587 | title=Nanocar Race: Un bolide moléculaire laisse ses concurrents sur place|trans-title=Nanocar Race: a molecular racing car leaves its competitors on the spot|language=French|author=Erwan Lecomte|date=May 2, 2017|website=sciencesetavenir.fr|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked equally with the Swiss team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nanocar-race.cnrs.fr/classement.php | title=Classement officiel|trans-title=Official classification|language=French|year=2018|website=nanocar-race.cnrs.fr|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle was remotely controlled from the Toulouse race hall on the University of Graz microscope.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The American team from Ohio University turned back for no apparent reason after 20 nanometers, the German team broke 2 vehicles without being able to restart, and the Japanese team ended up giving up.&lt;ref name=avenir2 /&gt; The French team lost sight of its vehicle on its surface area, and was also obliged to abandon, comforting itself with the symbolic prize of "the most elegant car in the competition ".&lt;ref name=avenir2 /&gt;

To make this kind of race possible, a considerable number of problems had to be solved beforehand, such as the choice of the track and its preparation, the improvement of monitoring and control devices, in particular the sensitivity of current measurements, the evaporation of a large number of very different molecules on the same surface and microscope validation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.numerama.com/sciences/241732-nanocar-race-tout-savoir-sur-la-course-de-machines-moleculaires.html | title=NanoCar-Race: Tout savoir sur la course de machines moléculaires | trans-title=NanoCar-Race: all about the race of molecular machines|language=French|author=Julien Lausson|date=April 28, 2017|website=[[Numerama]]|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the benefits, the CNRS cites the development molecular motors and Tech-Atoms, that will make possible in the future the preparation of quantum electronic circuits on the surface of an isolator, atom by atom, whose calculating parts will measure less than 1&amp;nbsp;nm.

The construction of molecule machines can also be mentioned, these would be capable of cleaning up industrial waste and household waste as described in science fiction novels of the 1960s under the term "digesters".

A new [[surface science]], called [[membrane]] science is also conceivable, where molecular machines controlled one by one (or in random exploration) would inspect transmembrane channels and eliminate [[virus]] intrusion attempts as they approach the membrane surface.

The '''National Academy of Science and Technology''' (''abbreviated as '''''NAST''') is the highest recognition and scientific advisory body of the [[Philippines]] under the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]. It was created through Presidential Decree 1003-A issued by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] in 1976 to honor and recognize Filipino scientists who made worthy contributions in the advancement of science and technology in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science and Technology 1: General Science|last = Rabago|first = Lilia|publisher = Vibal Publishing House, Inc.|year = 1989|isbn = 971-07-0860-0|location = Quezon City|pages = 15|last2 = Intong|first2 = Mona Lisa|last3 = Ferrer|first3 = Diana|last4 = Joaquin|first4 = Cresencia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also recommends individuals to be conferred the Order of [[National Scientist of the Philippines|National Scientist]] upon approval of the [[President of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=Who are the 4 new National Scientists of PH?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/628386/aquino-confers-awards-on-four-new-national-scientists|website=Inquirer.net|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The establishment of the National Academy of Science and Technology was a proposal of several professors from the [[University of the Philippines]]. It was endorsed by the National Science Development Board (now [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]) to the [[President of the Philippines]]. NAST was created through Presidential Decree 1003-A issued by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] in October 6, 1976.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2013|title=NAST 2013 35th Scientific Meeting Conference Proceedings|url=http://www.nast.ph/images/pdf%20files/Publications/ASM/NAST%202013%2035th%20Annual%20Scientific%20Meeting.pdf|format=PDF|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, President Marcos named the first ten members of the academy from members of the scientific community with three of them proclaimed as ''National Scientist'', namely: Juan S. Salcedo, Jr., Alfredo C. Santos and Gregorio Y. Zara. Through Executive Order 818 in 1982, the academy was tasked to give recommendations to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic of the Philippines]] and the Cabinet on policies concerning science and technology in the country.

== Mandates ==
The National Academy of Science and Technology is mandated:
# To recognize outstanding achievements in science and technology as well as provide meaningful incentives to those engaged in scientific and technological researches
# To advise the President and the Cabinet on matters related to science and technology
# To engage in projects and programs designed to recognize outstanding achievements in science and to promote scientific productivity
# To embark on programs traditionally and internationally expected of an academy of science
# To manage, operate and maintain the Philippine Science Heritage Center

== Functions ==
The Academy's function is divided into three components namely, advisory, recognition and scientific Linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nast.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10|title = Functions of the National Academy of Science and Technology|date = |accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = |publisher = National Academy of Science and Technology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recognition: As a highest government recognition body, it recognizes and supports works of different Filipino scientist that promotes advancement of science and encourages the youth to pursue science related careers. 
* Advisory: As an advisory body, it brings science closer to the people through awareness, promotes  public participation on science issues and advises the government and non-government entities on science-related policies
*Scientific Linkages: NAST communicates with other scientist inside and outside the country to promote collaboration and exchange of works, knowledge and participation.

== Organization and Membership ==
Members of the National Academy of Science and Technology are nominated by members of the scientific community. Current NAST members deliberate on the membership of an individual following strict rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once admitted to the organization, members are called ''Academicians ''(''abbreviated as ''Acd.)''. ''The academy is divided into several divisions to which an academician is a member depending on his area of expertise. The following divisions are:
# Agricultural Sciences
# Biological Sciences
# Engineering Sciences and Technology
# Health Sciences
# Mathematical and Physical Sciences
# Social Sciences
From each division of the academy, a chair is elected to form the Executive Council. A president, vice-president and secretary is elected from the Executive Council. The secretariat of NAST is headed by an executive director which implements the decisions of the Executive Council, and attends to the day-to-day affairs of the Academy. 
Since 2012,  the NAST Executive Council is composed of:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Acd. William G. Padolina, ''President''
*  Acd. Fabian M. Dayrit, ''Vice-President and Chair, Mathematical and Physical Sciences''
* Acd. Jaime C. Montoya, ''Secretary and Chair, Health Sciences''
* Acd. Rhodora V. Azanza, ''Chair, Biological Sciences''
* Acd. Reynaldo B. Vea, ''Chair, Engineering Sciences and Technology''
* Acd. Eufemio T. Rasco, ''Chair, Agricultural Sciences''
* Mrs. Luningning E. Samarita, ''Executive Director IV''

==History==
{{Main|History of Nokia}} &lt;!-- Please place a relevant epitome of history here, the previous history section included too many products that aren't a part of Nokia anymore in too much detail, this page should only contain a simple summation of its history --&gt;

===1865–1967=== &lt;!-- Here will be a small epitome of its history prior to 2014 and the original creation of the company --&gt;
[[File:Nokia Toilet paper.JPG|thumb| Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, Museum Centre Vapriikki, Tampere]]

Nokia's history dates back to 1865, when [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swede]] [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]] [[Fredrik Idestam]] established a [[pulp mill]] near the town of [[Tampere]], Finland (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]], offering better [[hydropower]] resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend [[Leo Mechelin]], formed a shared company from it and called it ''Nokia [[Aktiebolag|Ab]]'' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Nokia Company'' being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.

Idestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman. Mechelin expanded into [[electricity generation]] by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 [[Suomen Gummitehdas]] (''Finnish Rubber Works''), a [[rubber]] business founded by Eduard Polón, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.

In 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and [[Kaapelitehdas]] (''the Cable Factory''), all now jointly under the leadership of Polón. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.

Nokia at the time also made [[respirator]]s for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasmasklexikon.com/Page/Start01.htm|title=Start01|publisher=www.gasmasklexikon.com|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–1990===
[[File:Patteriston komentopaikka Hämeenlinna 4.JPG|thumb|LV 317M military radio in Hämeenlinna artillery museum. Nokia license built PRC-77 (-1177?) with signal amplifier.]]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created a new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finland's defence forces]] (''Puolustusvoimat''), such as the [[Sanomalaite M/90]] communicator in 1983, and the [[M61 gas mask]] first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making [[professional mobile radio]]s, [[telephone switch]]es, [[capacitors]] and [[chemicals]].

After Finland's trade agreement with the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic [[telephone exchange]]s to [[robotics]] among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The [[United States|U.S.]] government became increasingly suspicious of that technologic co-operation after the end of the [[Cold War]] [[détente]] in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, [[Richard Perle]], Nokia had a secret co-operation with [[The Pentagon]] that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/us_threatened_to_block_finnish_arms_deal_over_high-tech_exports_in_1980s/5710542|title=U.S. Threatened to Block Finnish Arms Deal Over High-Tech Exports in 1980's}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.

In 1977, [[Kari Kairamo]] became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker [[Salora (Finnish company)|Salora]], followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker [[Luxor AB]] in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind [[Philips]] and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]] (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate [[International Telephone &amp; Telegraph]] (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE), the predecessor of [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of [[Ericsson]]'s Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/business/company-news-nokia-oy-buys-stake-in-ericsson.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nokia Oy Buys Stake in Ericsson|last=Reuters|date=21 January 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 August 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer [[Saab Group|Saab]] called [[Datasaab]]. Ericsson Information Systems made [[Alfaskop]] terminals, [[typewriter]]s, [[minicomputer]]s and Ericsson [[IBM compatible PC]]s. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division—which already had a line of personal computers called [[MikroMikko]] since 1981—resulted in the name Nokia Data.

Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international [[roaming]]. In 1982, Mobira launched the [[Mobira Senator]] car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]'s gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.

In 1987, [[Kaapelitehdas]] discontinued production of cables at its [[Helsinki]] factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

===1990–2010===
[[File:Jorma Ollila 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorma Ollila]], who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006]]

Following [[Simo Vuorilehto]]'s appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. [[Nokian Tyres]] (''Nokian Renkaat''), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to [[UK]]-based [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL), the precursor of [[Fujitsu Siemens]]. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sank as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|worst recession in living memory]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.

Vuorilehto quit in January 1992 and was replaced by [[Jorma Ollila]], who had been the head of the mobile phone business from 1990 and advised against selling that division. Ollila decided to turn Nokia into a '[[Telecommunication|telecom]]-oriented' company, and he eventually got rid of divisions like the power business. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years. Nokia's operating profit went from negative in 1991 to $1 billion in 1995 and almost $4 billion by 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/05/01/278948/index.htm|title=Nokia's Secret Code Perhaps the least hierarchical big company in the world, Nokia has been winning big in wireless. But its Finnish recipe for innovation is about to be put to the test. - May 1, 2000|website=archive.fortune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the [[Mobira Cityman 900]] in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the [[GSM]] mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with [[Siemens]], the predecessor to [[Nokia Siemens Network]]. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister [[Harri Holkeri]] on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by [[Radiolinja]]. In November 1992, the [[Nokia 1011]] launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1997/10/17/nokias-pioneering-gsm-research-and-development-to-be-awarded-by-eduard-rhein-foundation|title=Nokia´s Pioneering GSM Research and Development to be Awarded by Eduard Rhein Foundation |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy. The brand continued to be used for televisions until 1995.

On 12 June 1996, Nokia announced the sale of its [[television]] business to Canada/Hong Kong-based [[Semi-Tech Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1996/06/12/nokia-announces-heads-of-agreement-to-sell-its-remaining-television-business|title=Nokia Announces Heads of Agreement to Sell Its Remaining Television Business  |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included a factory in [[Turku]], and the rights to use the Nokia, [[Finlux]], [[Luxor AB|Luxor]], [[Salora Oy|Salora]], [[Schaub-Lorenz]] and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1996/07/17/nokia-announces-final-sale-of-its-television-manufacturing-business|title=Nokia Announces Final Sale of its Television Manufacturing Business |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these brands were later sold to other companies.

Nokia was the first to launch [[digital satellite]] receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1997/03/13/nokia-first-to-launch-digital-satellite-receiver-in-the-uk|title=Nokia First to Launch Digital Satellite Receiver in The UK |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with [[Common Interface]] (CI) support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1997/08/29/nokia-launches-the-worlds-first-digital-ird-with-common-interface|title=Nokia launches the World's first Digital IRD With 'Common Interface' |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first [[digital terrestrial television]] set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as [[ONdigital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1998/03/08/nokia-is-chosen-supplier-to-british-digital-broadcasting|title=Nokia is chosen supplier to British Digital Broadcasting |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digital-tv-box från Nokia.jpg|thumb|A Nokia Mediamaster set-top box]]
In October 1998, Nokia overtook [[Motorola]] to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1998/12/21/nokia-to-invest-about-fim-1-billion-in-mobile-phone-production-in-bochum-germany|title=Nokia to invest about FIM 1 billion in mobile phone production in Bochum, Germany |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1998/12/03/nokia-manufactures-its-100-millionth-mobile-phone|title=Nokia manufactures its 100 millionth mobile phone |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major reason why Nokia grew against its main competitors Motorola and [[Ericsson]] was that it managed to cater to the consumer youth market and fashion-oriented consumers, most significantly with the [[Nokia 5110]] and [[Nokia 3210|3210]] handsets which featured a large range of colourful and replacable back-covers called Xpress-on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_next_20/2016/09/the_development_of_the_nokia_3210_the_cellphone_that_started_the_mobile.html?via=gdpr-consent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mobilephonehistory.co.uk/history/mobile_phone_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest fashion phones in 1992, from Swiss watchmaker [[Swatch]], was based on Nokia's [[Nokia 101 (1992)|101]] handset.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mobilephonehistory.co.uk/nokia/nokia_fashion_phones.php&lt;/ref&gt; The company would also form the [[Vertu]] division, creating luxury mobile handsets.

Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with [[stereo]] speakers and a [[sub-woofer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1996/04/22/nokia-builds-on-media-ready-monitor-series-with-new-21-line|title=Nokia Builds on "Media-Ready" Monitor Series with New 21" Line |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first [[wireless LAN]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1999/05/11/nokia-to-move-wireless-lan-products-toward-mass-market|title=Nokia to move wireless LAN products toward mass market |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2000 [[ViewSonic]] acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making [[Electronic visual display|display]]s for personal computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2000/01/17/viewsonic-corporation-acquires-nokia-display-products-branded-business|title=ViewSonic Corporation Acquires Nokia Display Products' Branded Business |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with [[Telefonica]] to supply [[DSL]] modems and routers in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2001/04/26/nokia-to-supply-telefonica-with-adsl-modems-in-spain|title=Nokia to supply Telefónica with ADSL modems in Spain |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Nokia co-founded [[Symbian Ltd.]] led by [[Psion (company)|Psion]] to create a new operating system for [[PDA]]s and smart mobile phones as a successor of [[EPOC32]]. They released the [[Nokia 9210 Communicator]] running [[Symbian OS]] in 2001 and later that year created the Symbian [[S60 (software platform)|Series 60]] platform, later introducing it with their first [[camera phone]], the [[Nokia 7650]]. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest [[smartphone]] hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 Nokia became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2004/02/09/nokia-to-acquire-psion-plcs-shares-in-symbian|title=Nokia to acquire Psion plc's shares in Symbian |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the [[Symbian Foundation]] as its successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2008/06/24/nokia-to-acquire-symbian-limited-to-enable-evolution-of-the-leading-open-mobile-platform|title=Nokia to acquire Symbian Limited to enable evolution of the leading open mobile platform |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2000/03/02/nokia-supplies-wap-technology-to-thus-in-uk|title=Nokia supplies WAP technology to Thus in UK |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a market share of 30% in the mobile phone market, almost twice as large as its nearest competitor, [[Motorola]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1055805.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The company was operating in 140 countries as of 1999. It was reported at the time that some people believed Nokia to be a [[Japan]]ese company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/1999/09/nokia/&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1996 and 2001, Nokia's [[Revenue|turnover]] increased fivefold, from €6.5 billion to €31 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/03/nokia-rise-fall-mobile-phone-giant&lt;/ref&gt;

The company would then be known as a successful and innovative maker of [[camera phone]]s. The [[Nokia 3650|Nokia 3600/3650]] was the first camera phone on sale in North America in 2003. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker [[Carl Zeiss AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2005/04/27/nokia-and-carl-zeiss-join-forces-to-offer-enhanced-imaging-for-camera-phone-users|title=Nokia and Carl Zeiss join forces to offer enhanced imaging for camera phone users |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month Nokia introduced the [[Nseries]], which would become its flagship line of smart phones for the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2005/04/27/nokia-launches-nokia-nseries-branded-multimedia-device-range|title=Nokia launches Nokia Nseries branded multimedia device range |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nokia N95]] introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2007/04/24/nokia-n95-wins-prestigious-tipa-award-2007|title=Nokia N95 Wins Prestigious TIPA Award 2007 |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor the [[Nokia N82|N82]] featured a [[xenon]] flash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2007/11/14/its-what-cameras-have-become-the-new-nokia-n82|title=It's what cameras have become - the new Nokia N82 |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2008/04/23/nokia-n82-wins-renowned-tipa-best-mobile-imaging-device-in-europe-award-2008|title=Nokia N82 wins renowned TIPA "Best Mobile Imaging Device in Europe" Award 2008 |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nokia N93|N93]] in 2006 was known for its specialized [[camcorder]] and the twistable design that switches between [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] and a camcorder-like position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2006/04/25/nokia-introduces-the-next-story-in-video-with-the-nokia-n93|title=Nokia Introduces the Next Story in Video with the Nokia N93 |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also well known for the [[Nokia N8|N8]] with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the [[Nokia 808 PureView|808 PureView]] in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the [[Nokia Lumia 920|Lumia 920]] flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced [[PureView]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2012/09/05/new-nokia-lumia-range-delivers-latest-pureview-camera-innovation-new-navigation-experiences-and-wireless-charging-on-windows-phone-8|title=New Nokia Lumia Range Delivers Latest PureView Camera Innovation, New Navigation Experiences and Wireless Charging on Windows Phone 8 |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia was one of the pioneers of [[mobile gaming]] due to the popularity of ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]'', which came pre-loaded on many products. In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the [[handheld gaming]] market with the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2003/02/05/nokia-n-gage-tm-mobile-game-deck-the-revolutionary-gaming-experience|title=Nokia N-Gage (TM) mobile game deck - the revolutionary gaming experience |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "[[Game Boy]] is for 10-year-olds",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nokias-ilkka-slams-game-boy-advance/|title=Nokia’s Ilkka slams Game Boy Advance|date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader [[Nintendo]]. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2007/08/29/get-out-and-play-with-n-gage-games-in-your-nokia-device|title=Get out and play - with N-Gage games in your Nokia device |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Q1 2004, Nokia's mobile phone handset market share steeply dropped to 28.9%, down from 34.6% a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/apr/17/mobilephones&lt;/ref&gt; However by 2006 the company was steadily gaining again&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/nov/27/nokiaincreasesmarketsharei&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/technology/22iht-mobile.3632626.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in Q4 2007 reached its all-time high figure of 40.4%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/24/sa_q4_phone_figures/&lt;/ref&gt; Its smartphone market share in that quarter was 51%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/report-nokia-s-smartphone-market-share-dropping&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia was the largest vendor at the time in all regions bar [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;https://gigaom.com/2009/03/11/winners-and-losers-in-the-smartphone-market-q408/&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia launched [[mobile TV]] trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster [[Yle]]. The services are based on the [[DVB-H]] standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen [[Nokia 7710]] smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2005/08/05/live-mobile-tv-broadcasts-for-the-first-time-at-an-international-sporting-event|title=Live Mobile TV broadcasts for the first time at an international sporting event |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia partnered with [[Arqiva]] and [[O2 (UK)|O2]] to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2005/09/22/mobile-tv-trial-goes-live-in-uk|title=Mobile TV trial goes live in UK |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Nokia developed a [[Linux]]-based operating system called [[Maemo]], which shipped that year on the [[Nokia 770 Internet Tablet]].

On 1 June 2006, [[Jorma Ollila]] became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, replaced by [[Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2005/08/01/nokia-moves-forward-with-management-succession-plan|title=Nokia moves forward with management succession plan |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nokia Sao Paulo Flagship.jpg|thumb|left|A flagship Nokia store in [[Sao Paulo]], Brazil in 2009]]

In August 2007, Nokia introduced [[Ovi (Nokia)|Ovi]], an umbrella name for the company's new Internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the [[Nokia Music Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2007/08/29/meet-ovi-the-door-to-nokias-internet-services|title=Meet Ovi, the door to Nokia's Internet services |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] when it was introduced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/10/29/84-percent-of-nokia-ovi-store-app-developers-say-apples-store-is-better/|title=84 percent of Nokia Ovi store app developers say Apple's store is better |publisher=VentureBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 Nokia announced the [[Nokia 5800 XpressMusic]], the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. In November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in [[Japan]] because of low market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7752279.stm|title=Nokia to end phone sales in Japan|date=27 November 2008|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia's global mobile phone market share peaked in 2008 at 38.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=David |last2=West |first2=Joel |date=11 June 2013 |title=Evolving an Open Ecosystem: The Rise and Fall of the Symbian Platform |publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing]] |page=35 |isbn=978-1-78190-826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Nokia announced the acquisition of Trolltech and its [[Qt (software)|Qt]] software development.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/31/qt_software_tech_preview_qt_creator/&lt;/ref&gt; Qt was a central part of Nokia's strategy until 2011, and it was eventually sold in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/09/nokia-sells-qt-software-business&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia briefly returned to the computer market with the [[Nokia Booklet 3G|Booklet 3G]] netbook in August 2009.

===2010–2014===
[[File:As Time Goes By (Nokia 9000 Communicator &amp; E7).jpg|thumb|A Nokia 9000 Communicator (1996) next to a Nokia E7 Communicator (2011)]]

In late 2009 and in 2010, the music-focused [[Nokia Xseries|Xseries]] and consumer-focused [[Nokia Cseries|Cseries]] were introduced respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/02/nokia_numbered/&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the [[Nokia N8]], which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2010/04/27/nokia-n8-connect-create-entertain|title=Nokia N8. Connect. Create. Entertain. |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-n8/nokia-delays-flagship-n8-again-shares-hit-idUSTRE68J4VZ20100921|title=Nokia delays flagship N8 again|date=21 September 2010|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after the failure of its previous flagship [[Nokia N97|N97]] and tougher competition from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and the rising [[Google]]. On 10 September 2010, [[Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo]] was fired as CEO and it was announced that [[Stephen Elop]] from [[Microsoft]] would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/10/nokia-replaces-kallasvuo-microsoft-stephen-elop|title=Nokia replaces Kallasvuo with Microsoft's Elop|first=Graeme|last=Wearden|date=10 September 2010|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It as claimed that investors pressed Nokia's board to recruit an outsider to shake up management and break from the traditional "Nokia way".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/debd3dce-be8a-11df-a755-00144feab49a&lt;/ref&gt; Ollila had also announced that he would step down as Nokia chairman by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.slashgear.com/nokia-board-chair-jorma-ollila-reveals-plans-to-step-down-in-2012-13101857/&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer", on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geekwire.com/2011/nokia-pays-big-bucks-elop | title=Nokia pays big bucks for Elop: Former Microsoft executive receives $6M signing bonus | publisher=GeekWire | date=11 March 2011 | accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nokia &amp; Microsoft Lumia devices.png|thumb|[[Nokia Lumia|Nokia and Microsoft Lumia]] devices.]]
The old Symbian OS became completely [[open source software|open source]] in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/188521/Symbian_OS_Now_Fully_Open_Source.html|title=Symbian OS Now Fully Open Source|publisher=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2010 it was announced that the [[Symbian Foundation]] was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2010/11/08/nokia-reaffirms-commitment-to-symbian-platform|title=Nokia reaffirms commitment to Symbian platform |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier [[NTT DoCoMo]] in Japan, after both [[Samsung]] and [[Sony Ericsson]] moved to [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Meanwhile, in 2010 for Nokia's [[Linux]] ambitions, Nokia collaborated with [[Intel]] to form the [[MeeGo]] project, after the merger of Nokia's own [[Maemo]] and Intel's [[Moblin]].

Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of [[iOS]] and Android. To counter this, Nokia planned to make their MeeGo Linux operating system, under development, the company's flagship on smartphones. Shortly after Elop's CEO tenure began, the Nokia board green-lit him the ability to change the company's mobile phones strategy, including changing operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2010/09/23/nokia-windows-stephen-elop/&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran [[Anssi Vanjoki]], head of the smartphones division, left the company around this time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/23/anssi-vanjoki-on-quitting-nokia-i-didn-t-become-the-ceo-it-is/&lt;/ref&gt; His final appearance was at Nokia World 2010 when the [[Nokia E7]] and other Symbian^3 devices were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_world_2010-review-511p2.php&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually on 11 February 2011, a "strategic partnership" with [[Microsoft]] was announced which involves the use of [[Windows Phone]] as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority, as well as the combination of Microsoft services, such as [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] search and [[Microsoft adCenter|adCenter]] advertizing on Nokia devices, joint marketing and a "shared roadmap" between the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/02/11/nokia-and-microsoft-announce-strategic-partnership/&lt;/ref&gt; This alliance, coupled with the CEO's "Burning Platform" memo, caused a great deal of media interest as well as divisions between analysts, fans and Nokia employees themselves. CEO Elop as well as chairman Ollila and the company's board of directors (which included future chairman [[Risto Siilasmaa]]) supported and defended the Microsoft deal.&lt;ref&gt;https://asokan.org/operation-elop/&lt;/ref&gt; Vanjoki compared choosing Android to 'peeing in your pants for warmth in winter' (a Finnish [[proverb]]) shortly before his departure in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zdnet.com/article/nokia-using-android-like-peeing-in-your-pants-for-warmth-in-winter/&lt;/ref&gt; Former CEO Kallasvuo had already dismissed Android when Google announced it in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/nokia-to-google-android-is-potty/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the MeeGo "Harmattan"-based [[Nokia N9|N9]] was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership, although the CEO said that the N9's "innovations" will live on in the future,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2011/06/nokia-n9-failure/&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually made their way on the [[Nokia Asha platform|Asha platform]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/9/4314844/nokia-asha-501-new-platform-launch&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement of the Microsoft partnership, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David J.|title=[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]|date=April 2014|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company posted a large loss for the second quarter of 2011 - only their second quarterly loss in 19 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/21/nokia_q2_2011_massive_loss/&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the [[Nokia Lumia 800|Lumia 800]], which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012 the company's stock price fell below $2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/709681-nokia-is-finnished-prepare-for-bankruptcy|title=Nokia Is Finnished: Prepare For Bankruptcy|first=Kofi|last=Bofah|date=9 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nokia-bankrupt-2012-4?IR=T|title=And Now Nokia Has A New Problem -- It Might Go Bankrupt|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Elop announced cost-cutting measures in June by shedding 10,000 employees by the end of the year and the closure of the [[Salo, Finland|Salo]] manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/14/nokia_job_losses_struggles/|title=Foundering Nokia pushes 10,000 bods, 3 veeps overboard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish prime minister also announced that the government won't save the company from an emergency state fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/finnish-government-hangs-up-on-nokia/|title=Finnish Government Hangs Up on Nokia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time Nokia started a new project codenamed "[[Meltemi]]", a platform for low-end smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/05/nokia_meltemi_for_s40/&lt;/ref&gt; With the Microsoft alliance and under Elop's management, Nokia also had a renewed focus on the North American market where Nokia phones were, in stark contrast to the rest of the world, almost irrelevant for many years.&lt;ref&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/303519-nokia-a-look-at-the-global-battle-over-mobile-advertising&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://money.cnn.com/2010/09/16/technology/nokia/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy began in January 2012 with the introduction of the [[Nokia Lumia 900]] smartphone in partnership with U.S. carrier [[AT&amp;T]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2136320/ces-nokia-looks-crack-market-lumia-n900&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Nokia introduced a new corporate typeface called "Pure".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/nokia-unveils-new-typeface-pure/&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2011, Nokia announced that it would adopt a new three-digit naming system for mobile phone products and stop using letters, effectively ending the [[Nseries]], [[Eseries]], and short-lived [[Cseries]]. That same day the [[Nokia 500]] was introduced with the new system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.phonearena.com/news/Nokia-changes-its-naming-system-again-goes-back-to-pure-numbers_id20806&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia last used three-digit names on analogue phones in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/02/nokia_numbered/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Nokia Lumia 920|Lumia 920]] was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. Elop said that the positive reaction to it had created a sense of hope and optimism in the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://mynokiablog.com/2012/12/18/video-stephen-elop-interviewed-by-yle-on-positive-nokia-lumia-920-feedback/&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also making gains in developing countries with its [[Nokia Asha|Asha]] series, which were selling strongly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.informationweek.com/desktop/nokia-lumia-sales-strong-asha-stronger/d/d-id/1108160|title=Nokia Lumia Sales Strong, Asha Stronger |publisher=InformationWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nokia's smartphone sales and market share greatly increased throughout 2013, including in the North American market,&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/29/nokia-had-a-stunning-q3-in-north-america-with-device-volume-up-367-from-last-year/&lt;/ref&gt; it was still not enough to avoid financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22197404|title=Nokia shares fall after sales drop|date=18 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ollila stepped down as chairman on 4 May 2012 and was replaced by Risto Siilasmaa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/computer/291683/jorma-ollila-resigns-as-nokia-chairman-after-13-years&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ristoonstage.jpg|left|thumb|Risto Siilasmaa, Nokia chairman since 2012]]
In September 2013 Nokia announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2013/09/03/microsoft-to-acquire-nokias-devices-services-business-license-nokias-patents-and-mapping-services|title=Microsoft to acquire Nokia's Devices &amp; Services business, license Nokia's patents and mapping services |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was positive for Nokia to avoid further negative financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO [[Steve Ballmer]], who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/microscope/report/The-acquisition-of-Nokia-Steve-Ballmers-last-hurrah|title=The acquisition of Nokia: Steve Ballmer's last hurrah?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nokia chairman, Risto Siilasmaa, described the deal as rationally correct (in the best interests of Nokia shareholders), but emotionally difficult&lt;ref&gt;https://asokan.org/operation-elop/&lt;/ref&gt; - experts agree that Nokia would have been in a cash crisis had it not sold the division to Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000005845497.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://asokan.org/operation-elop/&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts believe that Ballmer pushed for the buyout because of fears that Nokia was close to adopting Android and abandoning their alliance with Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;https://betanews.com/2013/09/05/why-microsoft-really-bought-nokia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/analysts-microsoft-bought-nokia-because-nokia-was-going-to-stop-making-windows-phones-2013-9?IR=T&lt;/ref&gt; There had been speculation for long that Nokia was experimenting with Android at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/09/14/nokia-was-developing-an-android-phone-before-the-microsoft-purchase/#26c21ec13e7d&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in January 2014 the [[Nokia X]] was introduced which ran on a customised version of Android. It was a surprising and somewhat odd launch coming just weeks away from the finalisation of the Microsoft buyout.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5445150/why-is-nokia-making-android-phones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/24/5440498/nokia-x-android-phone-hands-on&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including Ballmer's successor [[Satya Nadella]], felt that Microsoft thought merging their software teams with Nokia's hardware engineering and designs would "accelerate" growth of Windows Phone.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/windows-phone/135827/satya-nadella-admits-nokia-acquisition&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed in April 2014, with [[Microsoft Mobile]] becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

===Stock===
Nokia is a [[Public limited company|public limited liability company]] and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]], beginning in 1915.&lt;ref name="Towards Telecommunications"/&gt; Nokia has had a secondary listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] since 1994.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Towards Telecommunications"/&gt; Nokia shares were delisted from the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 2003, the [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Paris Stock Exchange]] in 2004, the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] in 2007 and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/nokia-applies-for-delisting-from-the-frankfurt-stock-exchange-helsinki-nok1v-1590801.htm|title=Nokia applies for delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange|last=|first=|date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=24 November 2017|publisher=marketwired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the [[CAC 40]] index on 6 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/01/07/800138/10158973/en/Nokia-announces-settlement-of-its-public-exchange-offer-for-Alcatel-Lucent-securities-the-registration-of-new-shares-and-its-inclusion-in-the-CAC-40-index.html?f=22&amp;fvtc=2&amp;fvtv=1|title=Nokia announces settlement of its public exchange offer for Alcatel-Lucent securities, the registration of new shares and its inclusion in the CAC 40 index|first=|last=NOKIA|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.

===Corporate culture===
Nokia's official [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]] manifesto since the 1990s is called ''The Nokia Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~coleman/ibm/Nokia.pdf |title=Newsletter|website=faculty.fuqua.duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a [[Flat organization|flat]], [[Entrepreneurial network|networked organization]].&lt;ref name="Nokia Way"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/A4126303|title=Nokia Way and values|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=14 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513163145/http://www.nokia.com/A4126303|archivedate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.

In 1992, Nokia adopted values that were defined with the key words ''respect'', ''achievement'', ''renewal'' and ''challenge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dominiescommunicate.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/new-old-nokia-values/|title=New Old Nokia Values|date=25 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, the company redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: ''Engaging You'', ''Achieving Together'', ''Passion for Innovation'' and ''Very Human''.&lt;ref name="Nokia Way"/&gt; In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business, using the original 1992 values again.

===Headquarters===
[[File:Nokian pääkonttori Keilaniemessä.jpg|thumb|The former Nokia House, Nokia's head office until April 2014. The building is located by the [[Gulf of Finland]] in [[Keilaniemi]], [[Espoo]], and was constructed between 1995 and 1997.

Nokia are based at Karaportti in [[Espoo]], Finland, just outside capital [[Helsinki]]. It has been their [[corporate headquarters|head office]] since 2014 after moving from the purpose-built [[Nokia House]] in Espoo as part of the sale of the mobile phone business to Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unleashthephones.com/2014/04/26/nokia-house-now-has-microsoft-branding/|title=Nokia House now has Microsoft Branding|last=|first=|date=|publisher=UnleashThePhones|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525022038/http://tech.infaround.com/2012/12/04/official-nokia-to-sell-and-lease-back-of-nokia-house|archive-date=25 May 2014|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building in Karaportti was previously the headquarters of NSN (now Nokia Networks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://company.nokia.com/en/contact|title=Contact|publisher=Nokia|access-date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325211543/http://company.nokia.com/en/contact|archive-date=25 March 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran===
In 2008, [[Nokia Siemens Networks]], a joint venture between Nokia and [[Siemens|Siemens AG]], reportedly provided [[Iran]]'s monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8112550.stm|title=Hi-tech helps Iranian monitoring|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=22 June 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use [[deep packet inspection]] to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/irans-web-spying-aided-western-technology|title=Iran’s Web Spying Aided By Western Technology |publisher=YaleGlobal Online |access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|post-election protests in Iran in June 2009]], Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to use of deep packet inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124562668777335653 |title=Iran's Web Spying Aided By Western Technology|last=Rhoads|first=Christopher|author2=Chao, Loretta |date=22 June 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|pages=A1|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a [[boycott]] of their products and services in [[Iran]]. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning [[SMS|SMS messaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/14/nokia-boycott-iran-election-protests|title=Iranian consumers boycott Nokia for 'collaboration'|last=Kamali Dehghan|first=Saeed|date=14 July 2009|work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/global/Press/Press+releases/news-archive/Provision+of+Lawful+Intercept+capability+in+Iran.htm |title=Provision of Lawful Intercept capability in Iran |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=Nokia Siemens Networks |accessdate=14 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625174434/http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/global/Press/Press+releases/news-archive/Provision+of+Lawful+Intercept+capability+in+Iran.htm |archivedate=25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lex Nokia===
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/06/finland_nokia_snooping/|title='Lex Nokia' company snoop law passes in Finland|last=Ozimek|first=John|date=6 March 2009|publisher=The Register|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic [[surveillance]] were not changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/35783.php|title=Nokia Denies Threat to Leave Finland|date=1 February 2009|publisher=cellular-news|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish media dubbed the law ''Lex Nokia'' because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.

The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of [[Hämeenlinna]] had recently given the required notice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/talous/Lex+Nokian+käytöstä+ilmoitettiin+ensimmäistä+kertaa/a1361762941046 Lex Nokian käytöstä ilmoitettiin ensimmäistä kertaa – Lex Nokia – Talous – Helsingin Sanomat]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nokia–Apple patent dispute===
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against [[Apple Inc.]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware|U.S. District Court of Delaware]] claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.&lt;ref name="Nokia-Apple"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60H05R20100118?type=marketsNews|title=SCENARIOS-What lies ahead in Nokia vs Apple legal battle|last=Virki|first=Tarmo|date=18 January 2010|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's general counsel, [[Bruce Sewell]] went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S. International Trade Commission]] (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theandroid.in/nokias-new-patent-suit-against-apple/|title=The war of the Smartphones: Nokia's new patent suit against Apple|date=6 January 2010|work=Snartphone Reviews|accessdate=25 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709014240/http://www.theandroid.in/nokias-new-patent-suit-against-apple/|archivedate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the [[iPhone]], [[Macintosh]] and [[iPod]]. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Nokia-Apple"/&gt;

In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal-tech/smart-phones/230600172|title=Nokia's Patent Settlement With Apple Won't Help Much|date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/14/apple-nokia-patent-lawsuit-settlement_n_876499.html|title=Apple Settles With Nokia in Patent Lawsuit|date=14 June 2011|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=29 June 2011|first=Catharine|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-14/nokia-apple-payments-to-nokia-settle-all-litigation.html|title=Nokia Wins Apple Patent-License Deal Cash, Settles Lawsuits|date=14 June 2011|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 June 2011|first1=Diana|last1=ben-Aaron|first2=Kati|last2=Pohjanpalo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged tax evasion in India===
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged in January 2013 with non-payment of [[Tax Deducted at Source|TDS]] and transgressing [[transfer pricing]] norms in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Income Tax department asks Nokia to pay Rs 13,000 crore|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/Income-Tax-department-asks-Nokia-to-pay-Rs-13000-crore/articleshow/18268748.cms|publisher=Economic Times|accessdate=31 January 2013|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia tax case: IT officials grill Price Waterhouse|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/nokia-tax-case-it-officials-grill-price-waterhouse/article4312124.ece|publisher=Business Line|accessdate=31 January 2013|author=T. E. Raja Simhan|location=Chennai|date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unpaid TDS of {{Indian Rupee|link=Indian rupee}}30&amp;nbsp;billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia suspected of flouting transfer pricing rules too|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/nokia-suspected-of-flouting-transfer-pricing-rules-too/article4360530.ece|publisher=Business Line|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">[[image:Gas Core light bulb.png|thumb|right|Nuclear gas core closed cycle rocket engine diagram, nuclear "light bulb"]]
A '''nuclear lightbulb''' is a hypothetical type of spacecraft engine using a [[gaseous fission reactor]] to achieve [[nuclear propulsion]]. Specifically it would be a type of [[gas core reactor rocket]] that separates [[nuclear fuel]] from [[coolant]]/[[propellant]] with a [[quartz]] wall. It would be operated at such high temperature (approx. 25,000°C) that the vast majority of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] emissions would be in the hard [[ultraviolet]] range. Fused silica is almost completely transparent to this light, so it would be used to contain the [[uranium hexafluoride]] and allow the light to heat [[reaction mass]] in a rocket or to generate electricity using a [[heat engine]] or [[photovoltaics]]. 

This type of reactor shows great promise in both of these roles. As a rocket engine it, like all nuclear rocket designs, can greatly exceed the power density{{dubious|date=August 2018}} of a chemical rocket. However, it also does not involve the release of any radioactive material from the rocket, unlike [[Gas_core_reactor_rocket#Open_cycle_designs|open cycle]] designs which would cause [[nuclear fallout]] if used in a planetary atmosphere (e.g. [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]). As a method to generate electricity, nuclear lightbulbs are extremely efficient because higher-temperature heat contains more [[Gibbs free energy]] than the low-temperature heat produced in current fossil-fuel plants and water-cooled nuclear reactors. The theoretical [[specific impulse]] (''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;) range from 1500 to 3000 seconds.

'''Olivetti S.p.A.''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of [[typewriter]]s, computers, tablets, smartphones, printers and other such business products as calculators and fax machines. Headquartered in [[Ivrea]], in the [[Metropolitan City of Turin]], the company has been part of the [[Telecom Italia]] Group since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial programmable "[[desktop calculator|desktop computer]]", the [[Programma 101]], was produced by Olivetti in 1964 and was a commercial success.

== Founding ==
[[File:Macchina da scrivere Olivetti M40 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|Olivetti M40 typewriter (1930), designed by [[Camillo Olivetti]] with [[Gino Levi Martinoli]] ([[Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]], Milan).]]

The company was founded as a typewriter manufacturer by [[Camillo Olivetti]] in 1908 in [[Ivrea]], [[Italy]]. The firm was mainly developed by his son [[Adriano Olivetti]]. Olivetti opened its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1930, and its [[Divisumma]] electric calculator was launched in 1948. Olivetti produced Italy's first [[electronics|electronic]] computer, the [[transistor]]ised [[Olivetti Elea|Elea 9003]], in 1959, and purchased the [[Underwood Typewriter Company]] that year. In 1964 the company sold its electronics division to the American company [[General Electric]]. It continued to develop new computing products on its own; one of these was [[Programma 101]], the first commercially produced personal computer. In the 1970s and 1980s they were the biggest manufacturer for office machines in [[Europe]] and 2nd biggest PC vendor behind [[IBM]] in Europe.

In 1980, Olivetti began distributing in Indonesia through Dragon Computer &amp; Communication.

In 1981, Olivetti installed the [[electronic voting systems for the European Parliament]] in Strasburg and Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYGDyF6YBvY&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1994, the company launched Olivetti Telemedia chaired by Elserino Piol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LqDhhCEXukC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=olivetti+typewriters+in+1994&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikg5S-qe_ZAhWP21MKHX8KCjMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=olivetti%20typewriters%20in%201994&amp;f=false|title=Cyberspace &amp; Repositioning Of Corporations|last=Ramu|first=S.

Olivetti was famous for the attention it gave to [[Industrial design|design]]: {{quote|[A] preoccupation with design developed into a comprehensive corporate philosophy, which embraced everything from the shape of a space bar to the color scheme for an advertising poster.|Jonathan Martin|International Directory of Company Histories}} In 1952, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held an exhibit titled "Olivetti: Design in Industry"; today, many Olivetti products are still part of the museum's permanent collection. Another major show, mounted by the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]] in Paris in 1969, toured five other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Woodham | first =Jonathan| title =Twentieth Century Design | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | year =1997 | location = Oxford | page =160| isbn = 0-19-284204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivetti was also renowned for the caliber of the architects it engaged to design its factories and offices, including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Gae Aulenti]], [[Egon Eiermann]], [[Figini-Pollini]], [[Ignazio Gardella]], [[Carlo Scarpa]], [[BBPR]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan H. Shapira, Renzo Zorzi, ''Design Process: Olivetti 1908–1978'', catalogue of a show at the Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery of [[UCLA]], 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1940s to the 1960s, Olivetti [[industrial design]] was led by [[Marcello Nizzoli]], responsible for the Lexicon 80 (1948) and the portable [[Lettera 22]] (1950). Later, [[Mario Bellini]] and [[Ettore Sottsass]] directed design.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Olivetti-1992 "Olivetti"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Bellini designed the [[Programma 101]] (1965), [[Divisumma 18]] (1973) and Logos 68 (1973) calculators and the TCV-250 [[video display terminal]] (1966), among others. Sottsass designed the Tekne 3 typewriter (1958), [[Olivetti Elea|Elea 9003 computer]] (1959), the Praxis 48 typewriter (1964), the Valentine portable typewriter (1969), and others. Michele De Lucchi designed the Art Jet 10 [[inkjet printer]] (1999) (winner of the [[Compasso d'Oro]]) and the Gioconda calculator (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History &amp; Culture Photo Archive | publisher = Telecom Italia| url = http://www.storiaolivetti.telecomitalia.it/uk/cgi-bin/Societa/archivio_foto_prodotti.asp | accessdate =2008-04-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407183610/http://www.storiaolivetti.telecomitalia.it/uk/cgi-bin/Societa/archivio_foto_prodotti.asp | archivedate = 2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s Olivetti manufactured and sold two ranges of minicomputers. The 'A' series started with the typewriter-sized A4 through to the large A8, and the desk-sized DE500 and DE700 series. [[George Sowden]] worked for Olivetti from 1970 until 1990, and designed their first [[Desktop computer|desktop]] computer, Olivetti L1, in 1978 (following ergonomic research lasting two years). In 1991, Sowden won the prestigious [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[Compasso d'Oro]] Award for the design of the Olivetti [[fax]] OFX420.

Olivetti paid attention to more than the importance of product design; graphic and architectural design were also considered pivotal to the company. [[Giovanni Pintori]] was hired by Adriano Olivetti in 1936 to work in the publicity department. Pintori was the creator of the Olivetti logo and many promotional posters used to advertise the company and its products. During his activity as Art Director from 1950, Olivetti's graphic design obtained several international awards, and he designed works that created the Olivetti image and became emblematic Italian reference in the history of 20th-century design.&lt;ref&gt;Musina, Massimiliano. (2014) ''Giovanni Pintori. The Stark Tension Between Flair and Discretion.'' Bologna: Fausto Lupetti Editore.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those designers also created the Olivetti Synthesis office furniture series which mainly were used to be installed in Olivetti's own headquarters, worldwide branch offices and show rooms. Olivetti also produced some industrial production machinery, including metal working machines of the Horizon series.

== Typewriters ==
Olivetti began with mechanical typewriters when the company was founded in 1909, and produced them until the mid 1990s. Until the mid 1960s they were fully mechanical, and models such as the portable [[Olivetti Valentine]] were designed by Ettore Sottsass.

With the Tekne/Editor series and Praxis 48, some of the first electromechanical typewriters were introduced. The Editor series was used for speed typing championship competition. The Editor 5 from 1969 was the top model of that series, with proportional spacing and the ability to support justified text borders.

In 1972 the electromechanical typeball machines of the Lexicon 90 to 94C series were introduced, as competitors to the [[IBM Selectric typewriter]]s, the top model 94c supported proportional spacing and justified text borders like the Editor 5, as well as lift-off correction.

In 1978 Olivetti was one of the first manufacturers to introduce electronic daisywheel printer-based word processing machines called TES 401 and TES 501. Later the ET series typewriters without (or with) [[LCD]] and different levels of text editing capabilities were popular in offices. Models in that line were ET 121, ET 201, ET 221, ET 225, ET 231, ET 351, ET 109, ET 110, ET 111, ET 112, ET 115, ET 116, ET 2000, ET 2100, ET 2200, ET 2250, ET 2300, Et 2400 and ET 2500. For home users in 1982 the Praxis 35, Praxis 40 and 45D were some of the first portable electronic typewriters. Later, Olivetti added the Praxis 20, ET Compact 50, ET Compact 60, ET Compact 70, ET Compact 65/66, the ET Personal series and Linea 101. The top models were 8 lines LCD based portables like Top 100 and Studio 801, with the possibility to save the text to [[3.5 inch floppy disk]].

The professional line was upgraded with the ETV series video typewriters based on [[CP/M]] operating system, ETV 240, ETV 250, ETV 300, ETV 350 and later [[MS-DOS]] operating system based ETV 260, ETV 500, ETV 2700, ETV 2900, ETV 4000s word processing systems having floppy drives or [[hard disk]]s. Some of them (ETV 300, 350, 500, 2900) were external boxes which could be connected through optional serial interface to many of the ET series office typewriters, the others were fully integrated with an external monitor which could be installed on a holder over the desk. Most of the ET/ETV/Praxis series electronic typewriters were designed by Marion Bellini.

By 1994, Olivetti stopped production of typewriters, as most users had transitioned to [[Personal Computer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Computers ==
[[File:Olivetti Programma 101 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|Olivetti's [[Programma 101]] is considered the first commercial desktop computer. Exhibition at [[Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]], Milan.]]

Between 1955 and 1964 Olivetti developed some of the first transistorized [[mainframe computer]] systems, such as the [[Olivetti Elea|Elea 9003]]. Although 40 large commercial 9003 and over 100 smaller 6001 scientific machines were completed and leased to customers to 1964, low sales, loss of two key managers (arguably killed by US intelligence services)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=it|url=http://www.radio24.ilsole24ore.com/notizie/carlo-benedetti-mix24-radio24-115926-gSLAEn7XX|title=Carlo De Benedetti a Mix24 su Radio24: Mario Tchou, inventore del calcolatore Elea, per l'Olivetti fu ucciso dai servizi segreti americani {{!}} Radio24|work=Carlo De Benedetti a Mix24 su Radio24: Mario Tchou, inventore del calcolatore Elea, per l'Olivetti fu ucciso dai servizi segreti americani {{!}} Radio24|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and financial instability caused Olivetti to withdraw from the field in 1964.

In 1965 Olivetti released the [[Programma 101]], considered the first commercial desktop personal computer. It was saved from the sale of the computer division to GE thanks to an employee, Gastone Garziera, who spent successive nights changing the internal categorization of the product from "computer" to "calculator", so leaving the small team in Olivetti and creating some awkward situations in the office, since that space was now owned by GE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Programma 101 Memory of the Future: Quando Olivetti Inventò il PC | language = it |trans-title=When Olivetti invented the PC | format = Google You tube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpkqdbz1R_s | work =History Channel | date =June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Olivetti released the TC800, an intelligent terminal designed to be attached to a mainframe and used in the finance sector. It was followed in 1977 by the TC1800.

Olivetti's first modern personal computer, the [[Olivetti M20|'''M20''']], featuring a [[Zilog]] [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], was released in 1982. In 1983 Olivetti introduced the [[Olivetti M24|'''M24''']], a clone of the [[IBM PC]] using [[MS-DOS|DOS]] and the [[Intel]] [[Intel 8086|8086]] processor (at 8 [[Hertz|MHz]]) instead of the [[Intel 8088]] used by [[IBM]] (at 4.77&amp;nbsp;MHz). The M24 was sold in North America as the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|'''AT&amp;T''']] '''6300'''. Olivetti also manufactured the AT&amp;T 6300 Plus, which could run both DOS and [[Unix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ejwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |title = InfoWorld | format = Google Books | date = 1986-12-01 |accessdate = 2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M24 in the US also was sold as [[Xerox]] 6060. The '''M28''' was Olivetti’s first PC to have the [[Intel 80286]] processor.

In 1983 Olivetti produced its '''M10''' laptop computer, a [[8085]]-based workalike of the successful [[Radio Shack]] '''[[TRS-80 Model 100]]''', which it marketed in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olivetti M10|url=https://fjkraan.home.xs4all.nl/comp/m10/|website=Yet Another Computer Museum|publisher=fjkraan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first laptops to sell in million-unit quantities, though the [[:it:Olivetti M10]] itself only attained sales figures in the tens of thousands and went out of production within two years.

In 1985 the company acquired a controlling share in the British computer manufacturer [[Acorn Computers Ltd]]; a third partner was [[Thomson SA]]. Olivetti sold the [[Thomson MO6]] and Acorn [[BBC Master]] Compact with brand names Olivetti '''Prodest PC128''' and '''PC128s''' respectively. At the same time Olivetti also tried to compete with [[:de: Schneider Euro PC]] with the MS-DOS based '''Prodest PC1''', but without success.

In 1987 Olivetti introduced the '''LSX''' line of computers which was based on the [[Motorola 68k]] processor. They could run either MOS or Olivetti's [[Unix]], [[Olivetti X/OS|X/OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gentiane.org/~miod/machineroom/machines/olivetti/ |title=Uncle Miod's machineroom | accessdate =2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Olivetti introduced the [[80486]] based next generation of LSX workstations with the '''LSX 5020''' with [[EISA-Bus]], it was shown in [[CeBit]] 1989 as "Computing Platform CP486".

In 1990, Olivetti had its own distribution network in [[New Zealand]] through Essentially Software Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = The free library | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SOFTWARE+SPECTRUM+ACQUIRES+AUSTRALIA%2FNEW+ZEALAND+SUPPLIER+OF+PC...-a018150082 | title = Software spectrum acquires Australia, New Zealand supplier of PC… | type = article}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (owned by Gary McNabb) located at Mt. Eden in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], where an Olivetti '''M300-100''' 16&amp;nbsp;MHz PCs with 80386SX [[CPU]] were sold for NZ$7395 and used as graphical work station for design houses using [[Corel Draw]] as graphical program. The New Zealand distribution stopped in 1991 when Olivetti could not supply their PCs.

Olivetti also sold quasi-portable 8086/8088-based PCs with an integrated [[Alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]] and one or two integrated 3.5" [[floppy disk]] drives, running DOS 3.27, an Olivetti [[OEM]] version of [[PC DOS]] 3.20 with minor improvements like the '''M21''' portable (based on M24) and the '''M15'''. Also later Olivetti produced interesting laptops like '''M111''', '''M211''', '''S20''', '''D33''', '''Philos''' and '''Echos''' series. A very interesting subnotebook was the Olivetti '''Quaderno''', about the same size as an A5 paper – it was the grandfather of the [[netbook]]s introduced 20 years later.

== End of computer production ==
Olivetti did attempt to recover its position by introducing the [[Olivetti Envision|Envision]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/golden/olivetti_envision.htm |title=Olivetti Envision |publisher=Ultimate Console Database |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a full [[multimedia PC]], to be used in the [[living room]]; this project was a failure. [[Packard Bell]] managed to successfully introduce a similar product in the U.S. but only some years later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The main problem of the company was its inability to conjugate innovation with the quality standards it had committed itself to, at a time when the margins on the PC market were diminishing as not only the market but also the number of PC clone producers grew.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The company continued to develop personal computers until it sold its PC business in 1997.

== End of Olivetti as a separate company ==
In the 1990s, Olivetti's computer businesses were in great difficulty, reportedly because of the competition from US vendors and new cheap manufacturers for PC components in [[Taiwan]] like [[ASUS]], [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] and so on from which local system builders profited much to offer cheaper PCs than Olivetti did with their own designs. It was on the brink of collapse and had needed government support to stay afloat. A company in transition, it had moved out of the typewriter business into personal computers before embracing telecoms between 1997 and 1999. In the process it had lost around three-quarters of its staff.

In 1999, The [[Luxembourg]]-based company Bell S.A. acquired a controlling stake in Olivetti, but sold it to a consortium including the [[Pirelli]] and [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] groups two years later. Olivetti then launched a hostile bid for Telecom Italia in February 1999, despite being less than a seventh of the size of its target. In a take-over battle against [[Deutsche Telekom]], and other potential bidders, Olivetti won out and controlled 52.12% of former monopoly Telecom Italia, Italy's #1 fixed-line and mobile phone operator. However, the ownership structure of the merged Olivetti / Telecom Italia was complex and multi-layered with Olivetti took on around $16 billion of extra debt. It was then referred to as the "Olivetti/Telecom Italia affair" because of the unpleasant secret affairs behind.

After a 2003 reorganization Olivetti became the office equipment and systems services subsidiary of Telecom Italia. In 2003 Olivetti was absorbed into the [[Telecom Italia]] group, maintaining a separate identity as Olivetti Tecnost.

==Rebirth and resumption of computer production==
In 2005, Telecom Italia re-launched the company in the information technology sector, investing €200 million; at first restoring the original Olivetti brand, then replacing it with Olivetti Tecnost in 2003. In 2007, Olivetti launched the "LINEA_OFFICE", designed by [[Jasper Morrison]] for Olivetti; a new line of PCs, notebooks, printers, [[fax machine]]s and calculators. Olivetti today operates in Italy and [[Switzerland]], and has sales associates in 83 countries. Research and development are located in [[Agliè]], [[Carsoli]] and [[Scarmagno]] in Italy, and [[Yverdon]], Switzerland.

In March 2011 Olivetti began producing the OliPad, its first [[tablet computer]], featuring a ten-inch screen, 3G, WiFi, [[Bluetooth]] connectivity, [[Nvidia Tegra]] 2, [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2.2 and a 1024 x 600 display. It also features an application store, with [[Application software|apps]] specifically designed by Olivetti for 'business &amp; government'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = Mar 6, 2011 | url= https://www.engadget.com/2011/03/06/olivetti-launches-olipad-tablet-second-coming-of-the-typewriter/| title=Olivetti launches OliPad tablet, second coming of the typewriter? | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the R&amp;D department in [[Arnad]] was sold to [[SICPA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sicpa.com/news/government-security-solutions/europe/sicpa-finalises-acquisition-olivetti-i-jet-production-unit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smartphones==
In 2013, Olivetti launched a series of smartphones called ''Oliphone'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language = it | url = http://www.olivetti.it/IT/Page/t02/view_html?idp=59 | publisher = Olivetti | title =Telefoni e Smartphone |trans-title=Telephones &amp; smartphones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parametric design''' is a process based on [[algorithm]]ic thinking that enables the expression of [[parameter]]s and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.&lt;ref name="PDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt;

Parametric design is a paradigm in design where the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures.

The term ''parametric'' originates from mathematics ([[parametric equation]]) and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system. While today the term is used in reference to computational design systems, there are precedents for these modern systems in the works of architects such as [[Antoni Gaudí]], who used analog models to explore design space.&lt;ref name="Frazer"/&gt;

Parametric modeling systems can be divided into two main types:
* Propagation-based systems where one computes from known to unknowns with a dataflow model.
* Constraint systems which solve sets of continuous and discrete constraints.&lt;ref name=article2/&gt;

Form-finding is one of the strategies implemented through propagation-based systems. The idea behind form-finding is to optimize certain design goals against a set of design constraints.&lt;ref name=article2/&gt;

== History (early examples) ==

=== Analogue parametric design ===

[[File:Maqueta funicular.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An upside down force model of the Colònia Güell, Sagrada Família Museum]]
One of the earliest examples of parametric design was the upside down model of churches by [[Antonio Gaudi]]. In his design for the [[Church of Colònia Güell]] he created a model of strings weighted down with birdshot to create complex vaulted ceilings and arches. By adjusting the position of the weights or the length of the strings he could alter the shape of each arch and also see how this change influenced the arches connected to it. He placed a mirror on the bottom of the model to see how it should look upside-down.

==== Features of Gaudi's method ====

Gaudi's analogue method includes the main features of a computational of a parametric model (input parameters, equation, output):
* The string length, birdshot weight and anchor point location all form independent input parameters
* The vertex locations of the points on the strings being the outcomes of the model
* The outcomes are derived by explicit functions, in this case gravity or Newtons law of motion.

By modifying individual parameters of these models Gaudi could generate different versions of his model while being certain the resulting structure would stand in pure compression.
Instead of having to manually calculate the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive the shape of the catenary curves through the force of gravity acting on the strings.&lt;ref name="Web2" /&gt;

=== Sketchpad ===
Where Gaudi used physical laws to speed up his calculation of parametric equations, [[Ivan Sutherland]] looked to the processing power of digital computers.

Sutherland created an interactive computer-aided design program called [[Sketchpad]]. Using a light pen, users could draw lines and arcs that could be related to each other using constraints. These constraints contained all the essential properties of parametric equations. Users could experiment and explore different designs by altering the parameters of an entity and let Sketchpad do the calculations and redraw the geometry according to the constraints imposed upon it.&lt;ref name="Web2" /&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Shenzhen Bao'an Int Airport T3 Hall 深圳宝安国际机场 photo Christian Gänshirt 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Departure Hall of [[Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport]]]]
Nature has always served as inspiration for architects and designers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Computer technology has given designers and architects the tools to analyse and simulate the complexity observed in nature and apply it to structural building shapes and urban organizational patterns. In the 1980s architects and designers started using computers running software developed for the aerospace and moving picture industries to "animate form".&lt;ref name="Web1" /&gt;

One of the first architects and theorists that used computers to generate architecture was [[Greg Lynn]]. His [[Blob architecture|blob]] and [[fold architecture]] is some of the early examples of computer generated architecture. [[Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport]]'s new Terminal 3, finished in 2013, designed by Italian architect [[Massimiliano Fuksas]], with parametric design support by the engineering firm [[Knippers Helbig]], is an example for the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building.

== Urban design ==
Parametric urbanism is concerned with the study and prediction of settlement patterns. Architect [[Frei Otto]] distinguishes occupying and connecting as the two fundamental processes that are in involved with all urbanisation.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; Studies look at producing solutions that reduce overall path length in systems while maintaining low average detour factor or facade differentiation{{clarify|date=December 2015}}.

== Software ==

=== Catia ===
[[CATIA]] (Computer Aided three-dimensional Interactive Application) was used by architect [[Frank Gehry]] to design some of his award-winning curvilinear buildings such as the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/the-building/the-construction/?_ga=2.124519370.1105664913.1495291920-1776029359.1495291920|title=The construction - Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|work=Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|access-date=2017-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gehry Technologies, the technology arm of his firm, have since created [[Digital Project]], their own parametric design software based on their experience with CATIA.

=== Autodesk 3DS Max ===
[[Autodesk 3ds Max]] is a parametric 3D modeling software which provides  modeling, animation, simulation, and rendering functions for games, film, and motion graphics. 3ds Max uses the concept of modifiers and wired parameters to control its geometry and gives the user the ability to script its functionality. Max Creation Graph is a visual programming node-based tool creation environment in 3ds Max 2016 that is similar to Grasshopper and Dynamo.

=== Autodesk Maya ===
[[Autodesk Maya]] is a 3D computer graphics software originally developed by Alias Systems Corporation (formerly Alias|Wavefront) and currently owned and developed by Autodesk, Inc. It is used to create interactive 3D applications, including video games, animated film, TV series, or visual effects. Maya exposes a node graph architecture. Scene elements are node-based, each node having its own attributes and customization. As a result, the visual representation of a scene is based  on a network of interconnecting nodes, depending on each other's information. Maya is equipped with a cross-platform scripting language, called Maya Embedded Language. MEL is provided for scripting and a means to customize the core functionality of the software, since many of the tools and commands used are written in it. MEL or Python can be used to engineer modifications, plug-ins or be injected into runtime. User interaction is recorded in MEL, allowing novice users to implement subroutines.

=== Grasshopper 3D ===
[[File:Grasshopper MainWindow.png|thumb|right|The Grasshopper canvas with some nodes]]
[[Grasshopper 3d]] (originally Explicit History) is a plug-in for [[Rhinoceros 3D]] that presents the users with a visual programming language interface to create and edit geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grasshopper3d.com/|title=Grasshopper|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Components or nodes are dragged onto a canvas in order to build a grasshopper definition. Grasshopper is based on graphs (see [[Graph (discrete mathematics)]]) that map the flow of relations from parameters through user-defined functions (nodes), resulting in the generation of geometry. Changing parameters or geometry causes to changes to propagate throughout all functions, and the geometry to be redrawn.&lt;ref name="Web2" /&gt;

=== Autodesk Revit ===
[[Autodesk Revit]] is building information modeling (BIM) software used by architects and other building professionals. Revit was developed in response to the need for software that could create three-dimensional parametric models that include both geometry and non-geometric design and construction information. Every change made to an element in Revit is automatically propagated through the model to keep all components, views and annotations consistent. This eases collaboration between teams and ensures that all information (floor areas, schedules, etc.) are updated dynamically when changes in the model are made.

=== Autodesk Dynamo ===
Dynamo is an open source graphical programming environment for design. Dynamo extends building information modeling with the data and logic environment of a graphical algorithm editor.

=== GenerativeComponents ===
GenerativeComponents, parametric CAD software developed by Bentley Systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/modeling-and-visualization-software/generativecomponents/|title=Computational Design Software|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first introduced in 2003, became increasingly used in practice (especially by the London architectural community) by early 2005, and was commercially released in November 2007. GenerativeComponents has a strong traditional base of users in academia and at technologically advanced design firms.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} GenerativeComponents is often referred to by the nickname of 'GC'. GC epitomizes the quest to bring parametric modeling capabilities of 3D solid modeling into architectural design, seeking to provide greater fluidity and fluency than mechanical 3D solid modeling.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Users can interact with the software by either dynamically modeling and directly manipulating geometry, or by applying rules and capturing relationships among model elements, or by defining complex forms and systems through concisely expressed algorithms. The software supports many industry standard file input and outputs including DGN by Bentley Systems, DWG by Autodesk, STL (Stereo Lithography), Rhino, and others. The software can also integrate with Building Information Modeling systems.

The software has a published API and uses a simple scripting language, both allowing the integration with many different software tools, and the creation of custom programs by users.

This software is primarily used by architects and engineers in the design of buildings, but has also been used to model natural and biological structures and mathematical systems.

Generative Components runs exclusively on Microsoft Windows operating systems, and in English.

Bentley Systems, Incorporated is offering GC as a technology preview of GC as a free download. This is a version of GC that no longer requires Bentley's MicroStation software for it to run, and that has features and a user interface focused on computational design.

=== Marionette ===
Marionette is an open source graphical scripting tool (or visual programming environment) for the architecture, engineering, construction, landscape, and entertainment design industries that is built into the Mac and Windows versions of Vectorworks software. The tool was first made available in the Vectorworks 2016 line of software products. Marionette enables designers to create custom application algorithms that build interactive parametric objects and streamline complex workflows, as well as build automated 2D drawing, 3D modeling, and BIM workflows within Vectorworks software.

Built in the Python programming language, everything in Marionette consists of nodes which are linked together in a flowchart arrangement. Each node contains a Python script with predefined inputs and outputs that can be accessed and modified with a built-in editor. Nodes are placed directly into the Vectorworks document and then connected to create complex algorithms. Since Marionette is fully integrated into Vectorworks software, it can also be used to create entirely self-contained parametric objects that can be inserted into new and existing designs.

=== Modelur ===
[[Modelur]] is a parametric '''urban design''' software plug-in for Trimble [[SketchUp]], developed by Agilicity d.o.o. (LLC).. Its primary goal is to help the users create conceptual urban massing. In contrast to common CAD applications, where the user designs buildings with usual dimensions such as width, depth and height, Modelur offers design of built environment through key urban parameters such as number of storeys and gross floor area of a building.

Modelur calculates key urban control parameters on the fly (e.g. floor area ratio or required number of parking lots), delivering urban design information while the development is still evolving. This way it helps taking well-informed decision during the earliest stages, when design decisions have the highest impact.

=== Archimatix ===
Archimatix is a node-based parametric modeler extension for [https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/59733 Unity 3D]. It enables visual modeling of 3D models within the Unity 3D editor.

The '''Payment Services Directive'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32007L0064&amp;from=EN2007/64/EC |title=DIRECTIVE 2007/64/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (PSD, Directive 2007/64/EC, replaced by PSD 2, Directive (EU) 2015/2366) is an [[EU Directive]], administered by the [[Directorate-General for Internal Market and Services (European Commission)|European Commission (Directorate General Internal Market)]] to regulate payment services and [[payment service provider]]s throughout the [[European Union]] (EU) and [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). The Directive's purpose was to increase pan-European competition and participation in the payments industry also from non-banks, and to provide for a level playing field by harmonizing consumer protection and the rights and obligations for payment providers and users.&lt;ref name="PSD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-1-directive-2007-64-ec_en|title=Payment services (PSD 1) - Directive 2007/64/EC|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|author=|accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Single Euro Payments Area|SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)]] is a self-regulatory initiative by the European banking sector represented in the [[European Payments Council]], which defines the harmonization of payment products, infrastructures and technical standards (Rulebooks for [[Wire transfer|credit transfer]]/[[direct debit]], [[ISO 9362|BIC]], [[International Bank Account Number|IBAN]], [[ISO 20022]] XML message format, [[EMV]] chip cards/terminals). The PSD provides the legal framework within which all payment service providers must operate.

The PSD's purpose in regard to the payments industry was to increase pan-European competition with participation also from non-banks, and to provide for a level playing field by harmonizing consumer protection and the rights and obligations for payment providers and users.&lt;ref name=PSD /&gt;
The PSD's purpose in regard to consumers was to increase customer rights, guarantee faster payments (no later than next day from 1 January 2012 on), describe refund rights, and give clearer information on payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What it means for Consumers|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/docs/framework/psd_consumers/psd_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the PSD is a [[maximum harmonisation]] directive, certain elements allow for different options  by individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/options_en.htm |title=Member States' options - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final adopted text of PSD went into force 25 December 2007 and was to be transposed into national legislation by all EU and EEA member states by 1 November 2009 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32007L0064|title=Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|date=5 December 2007|accessdate= 2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/consumer-finance-and-payments/payment-services/payment-services_en|title=Payment Services - European Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical overview===
The PSD contains two main sections:

# The 'market rules' describe which type of organizations can provide payment services. Next to credit institutions (i.e. banks) and certain authorities (e.g. central banks, government bodies), the PSD mentions electronic money institutions, created by the [[E-Money Directive]] in 2000, and created the new category of 'payment institutions' with its own prudential regime rules. Organizations that are neither credit institutions or EMIs can apply for an authorization as a payment institution if they meet certain capital and risk management requirements. The application can be made in any EU country where they are established and they can then "passport" their payment services into all other EU member states without additional PI requirements.
# The 'business conduct rules' specify what transparency of information payment service institutions need to provide, including any charges, exchange rates, transaction references and maximum execution time. It stipulates the rights and obligations for both payment service providers and users, how to authorize and execute transactions, liability in case of unauthorized use of payment instruments, refunds on payments, revoking payment orders, and value dating of payments.

Each country had to designate a 'competent authority' for prudential supervision of the PIs and to monitor compliance with business conduct rules, as transposed into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/docs/framework/transposition/authorisation_supervision_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Competent authorities for the authorisation and supervision of payment institutions (Article 20)|publisher=Ec.europa.eu\accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Updates===
The PSD was updated in 2009 (EC Regulation 924/2009) and 2012 (EU Regulation 260/2012). An implementation report from 2013 found the PSD facilitated "provision of uniform payment services across the EU" and reduced legal and production costs for many payment service providers and that "the expected benefits have not yet been fully realised". The same report found the 2009 update "... to be functioning well. For example, charges for 100 EUR transfers followed a further downward trend to 0.50 EUR euro-area average for transfers initiated online and remained low, at 3.10 EUR for transfers initiated at the bank counter".&lt;ref name=EU2013 /&gt;

===Remaining issues===
# The PSD only applies to payments within the European Economic Area, but not to transactions to or from third countries.
# PSD exemptions related to payment activities leave users unprotected.
# The PSD option for merchants to charge a fee or give a rebate, combined with the option for countries to limit this, has led to "extreme heterogeneity in the market". 
# So-called “third party payment service providers” have emerged, which facilitate online shopping by offering low cost payment solutions on the Internet by using the customers' home online banking application with their agreement, and informing merchants that the money is on its way. Other ‘account information services’ offer consolidated information on different accounts of a payments service user. Harmonisation of refund rules regarding direct debits, a reduction of the scope of the “simplified regime” for so-called “small payment institutions” and addressing security, access to information on payment accounts or data privacy with possible licensing and supervision have been proposed.&lt;ref name=EU2013 /&gt;

===Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2)===
On October 8, 2015, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission proposal to create safer and more innovative European payments (PSD2, Directive (EU) 2015/2366). The new rules aim to better protect consumers when they pay online, promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments such as through [[open banking]], and make cross-border European payment services safer.&lt;ref name ="PSD2 press release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5792_en.htm?locale=en|title=European Parliament adopts European Commission proposal to create safer and more innovative European payments|author=EU Commission|publisher=EU Commission|accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioner [[Jonathan Hill]], responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said, "This legislation is a step towards a digital single market; it will benefit consumers and businesses, and help the economy grow."&lt;ref name ="PSD2 press release" /&gt;

On November 16, 2015, the [[Council of the European Union]] passed PSD2. Member states will have two years to incorporate the directive into their national laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="PSD2 passed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/11/16-electronic-payment-services/|title=Electronic payment services: Council adopts updated rules|publisher=European Council|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The EU and many banks are pushing this development with the new Payments Service Directive 2 (PSD2), which has come into force on 13 January 2018. Banks need to adapt to these changes that open many technical challenges, but also many strategic opportunities, such as collaborating with fintech providers, for the future.

==Market implementation==
PSD2 does not specify the actual machine-to-machine API standards and specification details to be used. The banks and other financial institutions had to agree upon such details to ensure interoperability. The '[https://www.berlin-group.org/ Berlin Group]', a pan-European payments interoperability standards and harmonisation initiative with the primary objective of defining open and common scheme- and processor-independent standards in the interbanking domain between Creditor Bank (Acquirer) and Debtor Bank (Issuer), has worked on complementing the work carried out by e.g. the European Payments Council. As such, the Berlin Group has been established as a pure technical standardisation body, focusing on detailed technical and organisational requirements to achieve this primary objective. 

The [https://www.openbankproject.com/ Open Bank Project], established in 2010 by [https://www.tesobe.com/ TESOBE], provides open standards and open source technology to support PSD2 and Open Banking. It provides public "sandboxes" such as https://psd2-api.openbankproject.com/ where developers can try APIs using simulated data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">'''RFIC''' is an abbreviation of '''Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit'''. Applications for RFICs include radar and communications, although the term RFIC might be applied to any electrical [[integrated circuit]] operating in a frequency range suitable for wireless transmission.

There is considerable interest in RFIC research due to the cost benefit of shifting as much of the wireless [[transceiver]] as possible to a single technology, which in turn would allow for a [[system on a chip]] solution as opposed to the more common system-on-package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Xplore Search|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&amp;queryText=RFIC|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=22 June 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interest is bolstered by the pervasiveness of wireless capabilities in electronics.  Current research focuses on integrating the [[RF power amplifier]] (PA) with [[CMOS]] technology, either by using [[MOSFETs]] or [[SiGe]] HBTs.

==RFIC Related Research Conferences==
RFIC is also used to refer to the annual RFIC Symposium, a research conference held as part of Microwave Week, which is headlined by the International Microwave Symposium.  Other peer-reviewed research conferences are listed in the table below.

'''SensorThings API'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorthings|title=OGC SensorThings API|last=|first=|date=|website=Open Geospatial Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Open Geospatial Consortium|Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)]] standard providing an open and unified framework to interconnect [[Internet of Things|IoT]] sensing devices, data, and applications over the Web. It is an open standard addressing the [[Interoperability#Syntactic interoperability|syntactic interoperability]] and [[semantic interoperability]] of the Internet of Things. It complements the existing IoT networking protocols such [[CoAP]], [[MQTT]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[6LoWPAN|6LowPAN]]. While the above-mentioned IoT networking protocols are addressing the ability for different IoT systems to exchange information, OGC SensorThings API is addressing the ability for different IoT systems to use and understand the exchanged information. As an OGC standard, SensorThings API also allows easy integration into existing [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]]s or [[Geographic Information Systems]].

OGC SensorThings API has two parts: (1) Part I - Sensing and (2) Part II - Tasking. OGC SensorThings API Part I - Sensing was released for public comment on June 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OGC seeks public comment on SensorThings API standard for Internet of Things {{!}} OGC|url = http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/2238|website = www.opengeospatial.org|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OGC Technical Committee (TC) approves start of electronic vote on December 3, 2015, and the SensorThings API Part I - Sensing passed the TC vote on February 1, 2016. The [http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html official OGC standard specification] was published online on July 26, 2016.

OGC SensorThings API Part II - Tasking Core was released for public comment on February 20, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/2739|title=OGC seeks public comment on ‘SensorThings API Part 2 – Tasking Core’ Candidate Standard for use in the Internet of Things {{!}} OGC|website=www.opengeospatial.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Design ==
SensorThings API is designed specifically for resource-constrained IoT devices and the Web developer community. It follows [[REST]] principles, the [[JSON]] encoding, and the OASIS [[Open Data Protocol|OData]] protocol and URL conventions. Also, it has an [[MQTT]] extension allowing users/devices to publish and subscribe updates from devices, and can use [[CoAP]] in addition to HTTP.
[[File:SensorThings API data model.svg|thumb|400x400px|SensorThings API data model]]
The foundation of the SensorThings API is its data model that is based on the [[ISO 19156]] (ISO/OGC [[Observations and Measurements]]), that defines a conceptual model for observations, and for features involved in sampling when making observations. In the context of the SensorThings, the features are modelled as ''Things'', ''Sensors'' (''i.e.'', Procedures in O&amp;M), and ''Feature of Interests''. As a result, the SensorThings API provides an interoperable Observation-focus view, that is particularly useful to reconcile the differences between heterogeneous sensing systems (e.g., ''in-situ'' sensors and remote sensors).

An IoT device or system is modelled as a ''Thing''. A ''Thing'' has an arbitrary number of ''Location''s (including 0 ''Location''s) and an arbitrary number of ''Datastreams'' (including 0 ''Datastream''s). Each ''Datastream'' observes one ''ObservedProperty'' with one ''Sensor'' and has many ''Observations'' collected by the ''Sensor''. Each ''Observation'' observes one particular ''FeatureOfInterest''. The O&amp;M based model allows SensorThings to accommodate heterogeneous IoT devices and the data collected by the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = API Reference|url = http://www.sensorup.com/docs/?json#introduction|website = www.sensorup.com|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SensorThings API provides two main functionalities, each handled by a part. The two profiles are the Sensing part and the Tasking part. The Sensing part provides a standard way to manage and retrieve observations and metadata from heterogeneous IoT sensor systems, and the Sensing part functions are similar to the OGC [[Sensor Observation Service]]. The Tasking part provides a standard way for parameterizing - also called tasking - of task-able IoT devices, such as sensors or actuators. The Tasking part functions are similar to the OGC [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sps Sensor Planning Service].  The Sensing part is designed based on the ISO/OGC [[Observations and Measurements]] (O&amp;M) model, and allows IoT devices and applications to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (''i.e.'', HTTP POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE) IoT data and metadata in a SensorThings service.

== Entities (Resources) ==
SensorThings API Part I - Sensing defines the following resources. As SensorThings is a RESTful web service, each entity can be CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE with standard [[HTTP Verbs|HTTP verbs]] ([[POST (HTTP)|POST]], [[HTTP GET|GET]], PATCH, and DELETE):&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html|title=OGC® SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Liang|editor-first=Steve|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Huang|editor-first2=Chih-Yuan|editor-last3=Khalafbeigi|editor-first3=Tania|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SensorThings Data Model|url = https://ogc-iot.github.io/ogc-iot-api/datamodel.html|website = ogc-iot.github.io|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Thing&lt;/code&gt;: An object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things) that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Y.2060&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Overview of the Internet of things|url = https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Y.2060-201206-I|website = www.itu.int|access-date = 2016-01-26|last = tsbmail}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Locations&lt;/code&gt;: Locates the ''Thing'' or the ''Things'' it associated with.
* &lt;code&gt;HistoricalLocations&lt;/code&gt;: Set provides the current (i.e., last known) and previous locations of the ''Thing'' with their time.
* &lt;code&gt;Datastream&lt;/code&gt;: A collection of Observations and the Observations in a ''Datastream'' measure the same ''ObservedProperty'' and are produced by the same ''Sensor''.
* &lt;code&gt;ObservedProperty&lt;/code&gt; : Specifies the phenomenon of an ''Observation''.
* &lt;code&gt;Sensor&lt;/code&gt; : An instrument that observes a property or phenomenon with the goal of producing an estimate of the value of the property.
* &lt;code&gt;Observation&lt;/code&gt;: Act of measuring or otherwise determining the value of a property.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISO 19156:2011 - Geographic information -- Observations and measurements|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32574|website = www.iso.org|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;FeatureOfInterest&lt;/code&gt;: An ''Observation'' results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon.The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the ''FeatureOfInterest'' of the ''Observation''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
In addition to the above sensing resources, SensorThings API Part II - Tasking Core defines the following resources:
* &lt;code&gt;TaskingCapabilities&lt;/code&gt;: Specifies the task-able parameters of an actuator.
* &lt;code&gt;Tasks&lt;/code&gt;: A collection of Tasks that has been created.
* &lt;code&gt;Actuator&lt;/code&gt; : A type of transducer that converts a signal to some real-world action or phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorml|title=Sensor Model Language (SensorML) {{!}} OGC|website=www.opengeospatial.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Example Payload ==
&lt;code&gt;http://example.org/v1.0/Datastream(id)/Observations&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript" enclose="div" line&gt;
{
  "@iot.count": 2,
  "value": [
    {
      "@iot.id": 1,
      "@iot.selfLink": "http://example.org/v1.0/Observations(1)",
      "phenomenonTime": "2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z",
      "result": "-9",
      "resultTime": null,

    }
  ]
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Data Array Extensions ==
In order to reduce the data size transmitted over the network, SensorThings API data array extension allows users to request for multiple Observation entities and format the entities in the dataArray format. When a SensorThings service returns a dataArray response, the service groups Observation entities by Datastream or MultiDatastream, which means the Observation entities that link to the same Datastream or the same MultiDatastream are aggregated in one dataArray.

=== Example request for data array ===
&lt;code&gt;http://example.org/v1.0/Observations?$resultFormat=dataArray&lt;/code&gt;

=== Example data array response ===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript" enclose="div" line&gt;

== Evaluation ==
'''Interoperability between OpenIoT and SensorThings'''
"''We believe that the implementation of the SensorThing API will be a major improvement for the OpenIoT middleware. It will give OpenIoT a standardized and truly easy to use interface to sensor values.This will complement the rich semantic reasoning services with a simple resource based interface. And the consistent data model mapping gives both a common context to describe the internet of things''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mapping the OGC SensorThings API onto the OpenIoT Middleware|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-16546-2_6|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2015-01-01|isbn = 9783319165455|pages = 62–70|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-16546-2_6|language = en|first = Hylke van der|last = Schaaf|first2 = Reinhard|last2 = Herzog|editor-first = Ivana Podnar|editor-last = Žarko|editor-first2 = Krešimir|editor-last2 = Pripužić|editor-first3 = Martin|editor-last3 = Serrano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym [[HEAT]]) the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the jet from a shaped charge does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2007/ARL-SR-150.pdf Introduction to Shaped Charges, Walters, Army Research Laboratory, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munroe effect==
The Munroe or Neumann effect is the focusing of blast energy by a hollow or void cut on a surface of an explosive. The earliest mention of hollow charges occurred in 1792. [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] (1765–1841) was a German mining engineer at that time; in a mining journal, he advocated a conical space at the forward end of a blasting charge to increase the explosive's effect and thereby save powder.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Baader (March 1792) [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10704955_00275.html "Versuch einer Theorie der Sprengarbeit"] (Investigation of a theory of blasting), ''Bergmännisches Journal'' (Miners' Journal), vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 193–212.  Reprinted in:  Franz Hoffmann et al. ed.s, ''Franz von Baader's sämtliche Werke …'' [Franz von Baader's complete works …] (Leipzig (Germany):  Herrmann Bethmann, 1854), Part I, vol. 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vS4CAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 153–166.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the [[Harz]] mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive at the time was gunpowder, which is not a [[high explosive]] and hence incapable of producing the [[shock wave]] that the shaped-charge effect requires.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Kennedy, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA220095 ''History of the Shaped Charge Effect:  The First 100 Years''] (Los Alamos, New Mexico:  Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1990),  pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true hollow charge effect was achieved in 1883, by Max von Foerster (1845–1905),&lt;ref&gt;For a brief biography of [[:de:Max von Foerster|Max von Foerster]], see the German Wikipedia article on him.&lt;/ref&gt; chief of the nitrocellulose factory of Wolff &amp; Co. in [[Walsrode]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), pp. 5 and 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

By 1886, Gustav Bloem of [[Düsseldorf]], Germany had filed {{US patent|342423}} for hemispherical cavity metal detonators to concentrate the effect of the explosion in an axial direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|inventor=Gustav Bloem|number=342423|title=Shell for detonating caps|y=1886|m=05|d=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munroe effect is named after [[Charles E. Munroe]], who discovered it in 1888.  As a civilian chemist working at the U.S. [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], he noticed that when a block of explosive [[guncotton]] with the manufacturer's name stamped into it was detonated next to a metal plate, the lettering was cut into the plate. Conversely, if letters were raised in relief above the surface of the explosive, then the letters on the plate would also be raised above its surface.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Although Munroe's discovery of the shaped charge was widely publicized in 1900 in ''Popular Science Monthly'', the importance of the tin can "liner" of the hollow charge remained unrecognized for another 44&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of that 1900 article was reprinted in the February 1945 issue of ''[[Popular Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PAA65&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "It makes steel flow like mud" ''Popular Science'', February 1945, pp. 65–69]&lt;/ref&gt; describing how shaped-charge warheads worked.  It was this article that at last revealed to the general public how the fabled ''[[Bazooka]]'' actually worked against armored vehicles during WWII.

In 1910, Egon Neumann of Germany discovered that a block of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], which would normally dent a steel plate, punched a hole through it if the explosive had a conical indentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Big Bang: A history of explosives | author = G.I.

However, it was not until 1932 that Franz Rudolf Thomanek, a student of physics at Vienna's ''Technische Hochschule'', conceived an anti-tank round that was based on the hollow charge effect.  When the Austrian government showed no interest in pursuing the idea, Thomanek moved to [[Technical University of Berlin|Berlin's ''Technische Hochschule'']], where he continued his studies under the ballistics expert Carl Julius Cranz.&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Carl Julius Cranz (1858–1945), see:

*  [[:de:Carl Cranz|German Wikipedia: Carl Cranz]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There in 1935, he and Hellmuth von Huttern developed a prototype anti-tank round.  Although the weapon's performance proved disappointing, Thomanek continued his developmental work, collaborating with [[Hubert Schardin]] at the ''Waffeninstitut der Luftwaffe'' (Air Force Weapons Institute) in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut W.

By 1937, Schardin believed that hollow-charge effects were due to the interactions of shock waves.  It was during the testing of this idea that, on February 4, 1938, Thomanek conceived the shaped-charge explosive (or ''Hohlladungs-Auskleidungseffekt'' (hollow-charge liner effect)).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  (It was Gustav Adolf Thomer who in 1938 first visualized, by flash radiography, the metallic jet produced by a shaped-charge explosion.&lt;ref&gt;See:

During World War II, shaped-charge munitions were developed by Germany ([[Panzerschreck]], [[Panzerfaust]], [[Panzerwurfmine]], [[Mistel]]), Britain ([[PIAT]], Beehive charge), the Soviet Union ([[RPG-43]], [[RPG-6]]), and the U.S. ([[bazooka]]).&lt;ref&gt;Donald R.

Tanks faced a serious vulnerability from a weapon that could be carried by an [[infantryman]] or aircraft.

One of the earliest uses of shaped charges was by German glider-borne troops against the Belgian [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael|Fort Eben-Emael]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Col. James E.

Due to the lack of metal liner they shook the turrets but they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb on the turrets and smash the gun barrels.&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucas|first1=James|title=Storming eagles : German airborne forces in World War Two|date=1988|publisher=Arms and Armour|location=London|isbn=9780853688792|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Modern military===
{{further|High explosive anti-tank warhead}}
The common term in military terminology for shaped charge [[warhead]]s is [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT). HEAT warheads are frequently used in [[anti-tank guided missile]]s, unguided [[rocket]]s, gun-fired projectiles (both spun and unspun&lt;!--needs def of terms or wikilink to ??--&gt;), [[rifle grenade]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[bomblet]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and various other weapons.

===Non-military===
In non-military applications shaped charges are used in [[building implosion|explosive demolition of buildings and structures]], in particular for cutting through metal piles, columns and beams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/parkersburg-belpre-bridge | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/500-wood-street-building | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =500 Wood Street Building|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mondial-defence.com/2011/Products/RAZOR.html | work= Mondial Defence Systems | title =Semtex RAZOR |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for boring holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | title =An Overview of the Shaped Charge Concept | first =William | last =Walters | access-date =2011-08-27 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110819124915/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | archive-date =2011-08-19 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[steelmaking]], small shaped charges are often used to pierce [[Tap (steelmaking)|taps]] that have become plugged with slag.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt; They are also used in quarrying, breaking up ice, breaking log jams, felling trees, and drilling post holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Shaped charges are used most extensively in the [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] industries, in particular in the [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion of oil and gas wells]], in which they are detonated to [[perforation (oil well)|perforate the metal casing]] of the well at intervals to admit the influx of oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm |title=Shaped Charge |publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 110715-N-KG738-278.jpg|thumb|right|A {{Convert|40|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} [[Composition B]] 'formed projectile' used by combat engineers. The shaped charge is used to bore a hole for a cratering charge.]]
A typical device consists of a solid cylinder of explosive with a metal-lined [[conical]] hollow in one end and a central [[detonator]], array of detonators, or [[detonation]] wave guide at the other end. Explosive energy is released directly away from ([[Normal (geometry)|normal to]]) the surface of an explosive, so shaping the explosive will concentrate the explosive energy in the void. If the hollow is properly shaped (usually conically), the enormous [[pressure]] generated by the detonation of the explosive drives the liner in the hollow cavity inward to collapse upon its central axis. The resulting collision forms and projects a high-velocity jet of metal particles forward along the axis. Most of the jet material originates from the innermost part of the liner, a layer of about 10% to 20% of the thickness. The rest of the liner forms a slower-moving slug of material, which, because of its appearance, is sometimes called a "carrot".

Because of the variation along the liner in its collapse velocity, the jet's velocity also varies along its length, decreasing from the front. This variation in jet velocity stretches it and eventually leads to its break-up into particles. Over time, the particles tend to fall out of alignment, which reduces the depth of penetration at long standoffs.

Also, at the apex of the cone, which forms the very front of the jet, the liner does not have time to be fully accelerated before it forms its part of the jet. This results in its small part of jet being projected at a lower velocity than jet formed later behind it. As a result, the initial parts of the jet coalesce to form a pronounced wider tip portion.

Most of the jet travels at [[hypersonic]] speed. The tip moves at 7 to 14&amp;nbsp;km/s, the jet tail at a lower velocity (1 to 3&amp;nbsp;km/s), and the slug at a still lower velocity (less than 1&amp;nbsp;km/s). The exact velocities depend on the charge's configuration and confinement, explosive type, materials used, and the explosive-initiation mode. At typical velocities, the penetration process generates such enormous pressures that it may be considered [[hydrodynamic]]; to a good approximation, the jet and armor may be treated as [[inviscid flow|inviscid]], [[compressible flow|compressible]] fluids (see, for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrett Birkhoff|G. Birkhoff]], D.P. MacDougall, E.M. Pugh, and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G.I. Taylor]], "[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1698173]," ''J. Appl. Phys.'', vol. 19, pp. 563–582, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;), with their material strengths ignored.

A recent technique using magnetic diffusion analysis showed that the temperature of the outer 50% by volume of a copper jet tip while in flight was between 1100K and 1200K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhlig |first1=W. Casey |last2=Hummer |first2=Charles |title=In-flight conductivity and temperature measurements of hypervelocity projectiles |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2013 |volume=58 |pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; much closer to the melting point of copper (1358 K) than previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=William|title=Fundamentals of Shaped Charges|date=1998|publisher=CMCPress|location=Baltimore Maryland|isbn=0-471-62172-2|page=192|edition=softcover edition with corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature is consistent with a hydrodynamic calculation that simulated the entire experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sable |first1=P. |title=Characterization In-Flight Temperature of Shaped Charge Penetrators in CTH |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2017 |volume=204 |pages=375–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, two-color radiometry measurements from the late 1970s indicate lower temperatures for various shaped charge liner material, cone construction and type of explosive filler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Holle |first1=W.G. |last2=Trimble |first2=J.J. |title=Temperature Measurement of Copper and Eutectic Metal Shaped Charge Jets |journal=U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory |date=1977 |issue=BRL-R-2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Comp-B loaded shaped charge with a copper liner and pointed cone apex had a jet tip temperature ranging from 668 K to 863 K over a five shot sampling. Octol-loaded charges with a rounded cone apex generally had higher surface temperatures with an average of 810 K, and the temperature of a tin-lead liner with Comp-B fill averaged 842 K. While the tin-lead jet was determined to be liquid, the copper jets are well below the melting point of copper. However, these temperatures are not completely consistent with evidence that soft recovered copper jet particles show signs of melting at the core while the outer portion remains solid and cannot be equated with bulk temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=D. H. |last2=Walters |first2=W. P. |title=Analysis of "Soft" Recovered Shaped Charge Jet Particles |date=1996 |issue=UCRL-JC-123850 |doi=10.2172/251380 |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:167531/metadc665285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the charge relative to its target is critical for optimum penetration for two reasons. If the charge is detonated too close there is not enough time for the jet to fully develop. But the jet disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under two meters. At such standoffs, it breaks into particles which tend to tumble and drift off the axis of penetration, so that the successive particles tend to widen rather than deepen the hole. At very long standoffs, velocity is lost to [[air drag]], further degrading penetration.

The key to the effectiveness of the hollow charge is its diameter. As the penetration continues through the target, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic "fist to finger" action, where the size of the eventual "finger" is based on the size of the original "fist". In general, shaped charges can penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150% to 700%&lt;ref&gt;''Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994'', pp. 140–141, addresses the reported ≈700 mm penetration of the Swedish 106 3A-HEAT-T and Austrian RAT 700 HEAT projectiles for the 106&amp;nbsp;mm M40A1 recoilless rifle.&lt;/ref&gt; of their diameter, depending on the charge quality. The figure is for basic steel plate, not for the [[composite armor]], [[reactive armor]], or other types of modern armor.

===Liner===
The most common shape of the liner is [[cone (geometry)|conical]], with an internal apex angle of 40 to 90 degrees. Different apex angles yield different distributions of jet mass and velocity. Small apex angles can result in jet [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]], or even in the failure of the jet to form at all; this is attributed to the collapse velocity being above a certain threshold, normally slightly higher than the liner material's bulk sound speed. Other widely used shapes include hemispheres, tulips, trumpets, [[ellipse]]s, and bi-conics; the various shapes yield jets with different velocity and mass distributions.

Liners have been made from many materials, including various metals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a278191.pdf|title=Shaped Charge Liner Materials: Resources, Processes, Properties, Costs, and Applications, 1991|author=|date=|website=dtic.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and glass. The deepest penetrations are achieved with a dense, [[ductile]] metal, and a very common choice has been [[copper]]. For some modern anti-armor weapons, [[molybdenum]] and pseudo-alloys of [[copper-tungsten|tungsten filler and copper binder]] (9:1, thus density is ≈18&amp;nbsp;Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) have been adopted. Nearly every common metallic element has been tried, including [[aluminum]], [[tungsten]], [[tantalum]], [[depleted uranium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zinc]], [[zirconium]], [[molybdenum]], [[beryllium]], [[nickel]], [[silver]], and even [[gold]] and [[platinum]]. The selection of the material depends on the target to be penetrated; for example, aluminum has been found advantageous for [[concrete]] targets.&lt;!--List of liner materials supplemented from Kennedy, 1983--&gt;

In early antitank weapons, copper was used as a liner material. Later, in the 1970s, it was found [[tantalum]] is superior to copper, due to its much higher [[density]] and very high ductility at high strain rates. Other high-density metals and alloys tend to have drawbacks in terms of price, toxicity, radioactivity, or lack of ductility.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Russell and Kok Loong Lee, ''Structure-Property Relations in Nonferrous Metals'' (Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 218].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the deepest penetrations, pure metals yield the best results, because they display the greatest ductility, which delays the breakup of the jet into particles as it stretches. In charges for [[oil well completion]], however, it is essential that a solid slug or "carrot" not be formed, since it would plug the hole just penetrated and interfere with the influx of oil. In the petroleum industry, therefore, liners are generally fabricated by [[powder metallurgy]], often of [[pseudo-alloy]]s which, if [[sintering|unsintered]], yield jets that are composed mainly of dispersed fine metal particles.

Unsintered [[Powder metallurgy#Powder compaction|cold pressed]] liners, however, are not waterproof and tend to be [[brittle]], which makes them easy to damage during handling. [[binary alloy|Bimetallic]] liners, usually zinc-lined copper, can be used; during jet formation the zinc layer vaporizes and a slug is not formed; the disadvantage is an increased cost and dependency of jet formation on the quality of bonding the two layers. Low-melting-point (below 500&amp;nbsp;°C) [[solder]]/[[braze]]-like alloys (e.g., Sn&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;97.6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;, or pure metals like lead, zinc or cadmium) can be used; these melt before reaching the well casing, and the molten metal does not obstruct the hole. Other alloys, binary [[eutectic]]s (e.g. Pb&lt;sub&gt;88.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;11.1&lt;/sub&gt;, Sn&lt;sub&gt;61.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;38.1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- Pb??? --&gt;, or Ag&lt;sub&gt;71.9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;28.1&lt;/sub&gt;), form a metal-matrix composite material with ductile matrix with brittle [[dendrite (metal)|dendrites]]; such materials reduce slug formation but are difficult to shape.

A metal-matrix composite with discrete inclusions of low-melting material is another option; the inclusions either melt before the jet reaches the well casing, weakening the material, or serve as crack [[nucleation]] sites, and the slug breaks up on impact. The dispersion of the second phase can be achieved also with castable alloys (e.g., copper) with a low-melting-point metal insoluble in copper, such as bismuth, 1–5% lithium, or up to 50% (usually 15–30%) lead; the size of inclusions can be adjusted by thermal treatment. Non-homogeneous distribution of the inclusions can also be achieved. Other additives can modify the alloy properties; tin (4–8%), nickel (up to 30% and often together with tin), up to 8% aluminium, [[phosphorus]] (forming brittle phosphides) or 1–5% [[silicon]] form brittle inclusions serving as crack initiation sites. Up to 30% zinc can be added to lower the material cost and to form additional brittle phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5098487.html|title=Copper alloys for shaped charge liners - Olin Corporation|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxide glass liners produce jets of low density, therefore yielding less penetration depth. Double-layer liners, with one layer of a less dense but [[pyrophoric]] metal (e.g. [[aluminum]] or [[magnesium]]), can be used to enhance [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] effects following the armor-piercing action; [[explosive welding]] can be used for making those, as then the metal-metal interface is homogeneous, does not contain significant amount of [[intermetallics]], and does not have adverse effects to the formation of the jet.&lt;ref&gt;"Method of making a bimetallic shaped-charge liner" {{US patent|4807795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penetration depth is proportional to the maximum length of the jet, which is a product of the jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material, the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Held. "[http://www.argospress.com/jbt/Volume4/4-3-1.pdf Liners for shaped charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707161507/http://www.argospress.com/jbt/Volume4/4-3-1.pdf |date=2011-07-07 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 4, no. 3, November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed can reach 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation; the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2–5&amp;nbsp;km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are [[face-centered cubic]] metals, as they are the most ductile, but even [[graphite]] and zero-ductility [[ceramic]] cones show significant penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Doig, "[http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf Some metallurgical aspects of shaped charge liners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724081452/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 1, no. 1, March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explosive charge===
For optimal penetration, a high explosive with a high detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is [[HMX]] (octogen), although never in its pure form, as it would be too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], with which it forms [[Octol]]. Other common high-performance explosives are [[RDX]]-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form [[Composition B]] and the [[Cyclotol]]s) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered [[aluminum]] to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive [[CL-20]] in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been in the form of the PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).

===Other features===
A 'waveshaper' is a body (typically a disc or cylindrical block) of an inert material (typically solid or foamed plastic, but sometimes metal, perhaps hollow) inserted within the explosive for the purpose of changing the path of the detonation wave. The effect is to modify the collapse of the cone and resulting jet formation, with the intent of increasing penetration performance. Waveshapers are often used to save space; a shorter charge with a waveshaper can achieve the same performance as a longer charge without a waveshaper.&lt;!--See U.S. Patent 2,809,585, Oct. 15, 1957--&gt;

Another useful design feature is ''sub-calibration'', the use of a liner having a smaller diameter (caliber) than the explosive charge. In an ordinary charge, the explosive near the base of the cone is so thin that it is unable to accelerate the adjacent liner to sufficient velocity to form an effective jet. In a sub-calibrated charge, this part of the device is effectively cut off, resulting in a shorter charge with the same performance.

==Defences==
During [[World War II]], the precision of the charge's construction and its detonation mode were both inferior to modern warheads. This lower precision caused the jet to curve and to break up at an earlier time and hence at a shorter distance. The resulting dispersion decreased the penetration depth for a given cone diameter and also shortened the optimum standoff distance. Since the charges were less effective at larger standoffs, [[spaced armour|side and turret skirts]] (known as ''Schürzen'') fitted to some German tanks to protect against ordinary [[anti-tank rifle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7rrMe15jhwC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=when+was+schurzen+introduced%3F%3F |title= Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf.G, H and J 1942–45 |author1=Hilary L. Doyle |author2=Thomas L. Jentz |author3=Tony Bryan  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were fortuitously found to give the jet room to disperse and hence also reduce HEAT penetration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The use of add-on [[spaced armor]] skirts on armored vehicles may have the opposite effect and actually ''increase'' the penetration of some shaped charge warheads. Due to constraints in the length of the projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff.&lt;ref&gt;WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim (1999) - Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics 24 - Effectiveness Factors for Explosive Reactive Armour Systems - page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Skirting should not be confused with [[cage armor]] which is used to damage the fusing system of [[RPG-7]] projectiles. The armor works by deforming the inner and outer [[ogive]]s and shorting the firing circuit between the rocket's [[piezoelectric]] nose probe and rear [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] assembly. Cage armor can also cause the projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge's penetration stream.  If the nose probe strikes one of the cage armor slats, the warhead will function as normal.

==Variants==
There are several different forms of shaped charge.

===Linear shaped charges===
[[File:LinearShapedCharge.png|thumb|upright|Linear shaped charge]]
A linear shaped charge (LSC) has a lining with V-shaped profile and varying length. The lining is surrounded with explosive, the explosive then encased within a suitable material that serves to protect the explosive and to confine (tamp) it on detonation. "At detonation, the focusing of the explosive high pressure wave as it becomes incident to the side wall causes the metal liner of the LSC to collapse–creating the cutting force."&lt;ref&gt;Accurate Energetic Systems LLC [http://www.aesys.biz/wp-content/uploads/14-102_liner-shaped-charge.pdf]" Linear Shape Charge&lt;/ref&gt;  The detonation projects into the lining, to form a continuous, knife-like (planar) jet. The jet cuts any material in its path, to a depth depending on the size and materials used in the charge. For the cutting of complex geometries, there are also flexible versions of the linear shaped charge, these with a lead or high-density foam sheathing and a ductile/flexible lining material, which also is often lead. LSCs are commonly used in the cutting of rolled steel joists (RSJ) and other structural targets, such as in the [[Building implosion|controlled demolition]] of buildings. LSCs are also used to separate the stages of [[multistage rocket]]s.

===Explosively formed penetrator===
{{Main|Explosively formed penetrator}}

[[File:explosively formed penetrator.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Formation of an EFP warhead. [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Research Laboratory]]

The explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is also known as the self-forging fragment (SFF), explosively formed projectile (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and [[Misznay-Schardin effect|Misznay-Schardin]] (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive's detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge's diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).

The EFP is relatively unaffected by first-generation [[reactive armor]] and can travel up to perhaps 1000 charge diameters (CD)s before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or successfully hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of a ball or slug EFP normally causes a large-diameter but relatively shallow hole, of, at most, a couple of CDs. If the EFP perforates the armor, [[spalling]] and extensive behind armor effects (BAE, also called behind armor damage, BAD) will occur. The BAE is mainly caused by the high-temperature and high-velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and the blast [[overpressure]] caused by this debris. More modern EFP warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce long-rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned rod/slug projectiles. The long-rods are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAE, multi-slugs are better at defeating light or area targets and the finned projectiles are much more accurate.

The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of main battle tanks (MBT) such as the top, belly and rear armored areas. It is well suited for the attack of other less heavily protected armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and in the breaching of material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs. Weapons using the EFP principle have already been used in combat; the "[[smart weapon|smart]]" submunitions in the [[CBU-97]] [[cluster bomb]] used by the US Air Force and Navy in the 2003 Iraq war employed this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided [[artillery shell]]s under Project [[SADARM]] (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectile (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use EFP principle. Examples of EFP warheads are US patents 5038683&lt;ref&gt;Ernest L.Baker, Pai-Lien Lu, Brian Fuchs and Barry Fishburn(1991)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/High_explosive_assembly_for_projecting_h.pdf?id=2dkbAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U1uJ8lS6CfmjJo1JKILjvWDC9sCSg High explosive assembly for projecting high velocity long rods]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US6606951.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold S.Klein (2003) "[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Bounding_anti_tank_anti_vehicle_weapon.pdf?id=oOoMAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3WM4xBQ5f0d23uQdUeF1unjyGE9Q Bounding Anti-tank/Anti-vehicle weapon]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem warhead===
Some modern anti-tank rockets ([[RPG-27]], [[RPG-29]]) and missiles ([[BGM-71 TOW|TOW 2B]], [[ERYX]], [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]], [[MILAN]]) use a [[tandem warhead]] shaped charge, consisting of two separate shaped charges, one in front of the other, typically with some distance between them. TOW-2A was the first to use tandem warheads in the mid-1980s, an aspect of the weapon which the US Army had to reveal under news media and Congressional pressure resulting from the concern that NATO antitank missiles were ineffective against Soviet tanks that were fitted with the new [[Reactive armour|ERA boxes]].  The Army revealed that a 40&amp;nbsp;mm precursor shaped charge warhead was fitted on the tip of the TOW-2B collapsible probe.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman A. "ARMY ANTITANK CANDIDATES PROLIFERATE" Armed Forces Journal International/December 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the front charge is somewhat smaller than the rear one, as it is intended primarily to disrupt ERA boxes or tiles. Examples of tandem warheads are US patents 7363862&lt;ref&gt;Jason C.Gilliam and Darin L.Kielsmeier(2008)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Multi_purpose_single_initiated_tandem_wa.pdf?id=Nt-qAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0l5gTdL-TqxXkvATTpIYTVLeAg2g Multi-purpose single initiated tandem warhead]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US 5561261.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Lindstadt and Manfred Klare(1996)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Tandem_warhead_with_a_secondary_projecti.pdf?id=icslAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nqrCamThCu2bvHpqBNleeq4ssfQ Tandem warhead with a secondary projectile]"&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] antiarmor missile is one of the few that have accomplished the complex engineering feat of having two shaped charges of the same diameter stacked in one warhead.  Recently, a Russian arms firm revealed a 125mm tank cannon round with two same diameter shaped charges one behind the other, but with the back one offset so its penetration stream will not interfere with the front shaped charge's penetration stream.  The reasoning behind both the Hellfire and the Russian 125&amp;nbsp;mm munitions having tandem same diameter warheads is not to increase penetration, but to increase the [[beyond-armour effect|beyond-armor effect]].

===Voitenko compressor===
{{Main|Voitenko compressor}}
In 1964 a Russian scientist proposed that a shaped charge originally developed for piercing thick steel armor be adapted to the task of accelerating shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;Войтенко (Voitenko), А.Е. (1964) "Получение газовых струй большой скорости" (Obtaining high speed gas jets), ''Доклады Академии Наук СССР'' (Reports of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR), '''158''' : 1278-1280.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting device, looking a little like a wind tunnel, is called a Voitenko compressor.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-440/ch6-15.htm The Suicidal Wind Tunnel]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable [[steel]] plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A 66-pound shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was 220,000 feet per second (67&amp;nbsp;km/s). The apparatus exposed to the detonation was completely destroyed, but not before useful data was extracted.&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm Shaped Charge History]"&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates [[hydrogen]] gas which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosive Accelerators"[http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SPBI134.HTM Voitenko Implosion Gun]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.I.

===Nuclear shaped charges===
The proposed [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion nuclear propulsion]] system would have required the development of [[nuclear shaped charge]]s for reaction acceleration of spacecraft. Shaped charge effects driven by nuclear explosions have been discussed speculatively, but are not known to have been produced in fact.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gsponer (2008) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510071v5 Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons: Military Effectiveness and Collateral Effects]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, George, ''Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965'', p. 113. {{ISBN|0-14-027732-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, ''Project Orion'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the early nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] was quoted as saying, in the context of shaped charges, ''"A one-kiloton fission device, shaped properly, could make a hole ten feet in diameter a thousand feet into solid rock."''&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, John, ''The Curve of Binding Energy'', p.159 {{ISBN|0-374-51598-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a nuclear driven [[explosively formed penetrator]] was apparently proposed for terminal ballistic missile defense in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosively Produced Flechettes; JASON report 66-121, Institute for Defense Analysis, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. Richard Blankenbecler http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5196.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shaving cream.jpg|thumb|right|Man using shaving cream]]

'''Shaving cream''' or '''shaving foam ''' is a frothy cosmetic cream applied to [[body hair]], usually [[facial hair]], to facilitate [[shaving]]. The use of cream achieves three effects: lubricates the cutting process; swells [[keratin]]; and desensitizes skin. Shaving creams commonly consist of an emulsion of oils, soaps or [[surfactant]]s, and water.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Thomas Clausen et al. "Hair Preparations," Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2006). {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_571.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blades with [[Polymeric surface|polymeric coating]] reduce the need for shaving creams.

== History ==
[[File:A barber getting ready to shave the face of a seated custome Wellcome V0019707.jpg|thumb|"A barber getting ready to shave the face of a seated customer", c. 1801.]]
A rudimentary form of shaving cream was documented in [[Sumer]] around {{Nowrap|3000 BC}}. This substance combined wood alkali and animal fat and was applied to a beard as a shaving preparation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gillette.com/glossary/en-CA/shavinghistory.shtml "History of Shaving" at Gillette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610115055/https://www.gillette.com/glossary/en-CA/shavinghistory.shtml |date=10 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 20th century, bars or sticks of hard [[shaving soap]] were used. Later, tubes containing compounds of oils and soft soap were sold. Newer creams introduced in the 1940s ([[Burma-Shave]]) neither produced lather nor required brushes, often referred to as brushless creams.&lt;ref name=Poucher&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HI8dGHgeIQC&amp;pg=PA51 | title=Poucher's perfumes, cosmetics and soaps | first1=Hilda | last1=Butler | first2=William Arthur | last2=Poucher | isbn=978-0-7514-0479-1 | publisher=Springer | year=2000 | page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first can of pressurized shaving cream was [[Rise shaving cream]], introduced in 1949.&lt;ref name=fu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/CarterWallace-Inc-Company-History.html |title=1949: Carter launches Rise, the first pressurized shave cream. |publisher=Funding Universe }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the following decade this format attained two-thirds of the American market.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4HI8dGHgeIQC&amp;pg=PA51 | title=Poucher's perfumes, cosmetics and soaps | first1=Hilda | last1=Butler | first2=William Arthur | last2=Poucher | isbn=978-0-7514-0479-1 | publisher=Springer | year=2000 | page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) were used as [[propellant]]s until they were banned in the late 1970s for destroying the [[ozone layer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/epa/25b.htm | title= A Look at EPA Accomplishments: 25 Years of Protecting Public Health and the Environment | accessdate=22 November 2008 | date=1 December 1995 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaseous hydrocarbons such as mixtures of [[pentane]], [[propane]], [[butane]] and [[isobutane]] took their place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923213502/http://www.epa.gov/highgwp/pdfs/chap10_aero.pdf | format=pdf | title=Cost and Emission Reduction Analysis of HFC Emissions from Aerosols in the United States | accessdate=22 November 2008 | date=June 2001 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, [[shaving gel]] was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2027218/summary.html | title=Canadian Patent #2027218 | accessdate=22 November 2008 | work=Canadian Patents Database | publisher=[[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, [[Procter &amp; Gamble|The Procter &amp; Gamble Company]] patented a post-foaming gel composition, which turns the gel into a foam after application to the skin, combining properties of both foams and gels.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 5248495, issued 28 September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify | date=July 2018 | reason=How is this relevant? Are there any creams using this formulation?}}

== Contents ==
Shaving creams and soaps are available as solids (bars); creams, generally in tubes; or [[Aerosol spray|aerosols]]. All forms may be applied with a [[shaving brush]].

Shaving creams contain 20–30% [[soap]] [potassium or [[triethanolamine]] (TEA)], up to about 10% [[glycerine]], [[emollients]], [[emulsifiers]], and [[foaming agent]]s. Aerosols are diluted creams dispensed from pressurized cans with the aid of [[hydrocarbon]] [[propellants]] (up to about 10%).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Arza Seidel et al. | author=Martin M. Rieger | chapter=Cosmetics | title=Kirk-Othmer Chemical Technology of Cosmetics | year=2013 | pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flammability of the hydrocarbons is offset by the large amounts of water in cream formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1988/03/14/70302/index.htm | title=A DOWN-TO-EARTH JOB: SAVING THE SKY | publisher=''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' | accessdate=22 November 2008 | date=14 March 1988 |author1=Gannes, Stuart | author2=Slovak, Julianne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beard-softening is due to hair hydration, which also depends on pH. In electric or [[Dry Shaving|dry shaving]], swelling of the hairs is not desired, and such preparations use high amounts of [[alcohol]] (50–80%) to dry the skin and stiffen the hairs.

'''SolidRun''' is an [[Israel]]i company producing [[Embedded systems]] components, mainly [[mini computer]]s, [[Single-board computer]]s and [[computer-on-module]] devices. It is specially known for their [[CuBox]] family of mini-computers (said to be the world's smallest desktop computer at the time of its launch), and for producing [[motherboard]]s and processing components such as the HummingBoard motherboard.

Situated in the [[Yokneam Illit]] Industrial Park, SolidRun develops and manufactures products aimed both for the private entertainment sector, and for companies developing [[Computer processor|processor]] based products, notably components of "[[Internet of Things]]" technology systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company page|url=http://www.solid-run.com/company/|website=SolidRun|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the scope of the IoT technology, SolidRun's mini computers are aimed to cover the intermediate sphere, between sensors and user devices, and between the larger network or Cloud framework. Within such a network, mini computers or [[System on module|system-on-module]] devices, act as mediators gathering and processing information from sensors or user devices and communicating with the network - this is also known as [[Edge computing]].

==History==
[[File:SolidRun-soms.jpg|280px|thumbnail|Three of SolidRun's MicroSOMs from the i.MX6, Intel Braswell &amp; Marvell ARMADA product families.]]
SolidRun was founded in 2010 by co-founders [[Rabeeh Khoury]] (formally an engineer at [[Marvell Technology Group]]) and [[Kossay Omary]], today chairman and [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] respectively. The goal of SolidRun has been to develop, produce and market components aimed for integration with IoT systems.

The company today is situated in the [[Yokneam Illit]] [[HiTech]] Industrial Park in the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] of Israel, and headed by Dr. Atai Ziv (CEO).

The major product development line aimed at the consumer market is the CuBox family of mini-computers. The first of which was announced in December 2011, followed by the development of the CuBox-i series, announced in November 2013. The most recent addition to the CuBox line has been the CuBoxTV (announced in December 2014), which has been marketed primarily for the [[home video|home entertainment]] market. A further primary product developed by SolidRun is the Hummingboard, an uncased single-board computer, marketed to developers as an integrated processing component.

SolidRun develops all of its products using [[Open-source software]] (such as [[Linux]] and [[OpenELEC]]), identifying itself as a member of the OSS community and a promoter of Open-source software platforms.

The products developed by SolidRun are classed into three families, based upon the processor maker. Each family offers roughly the same range of mini-computers, SOM's &amp; COM's - currently divided into [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] iMX-6, [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]] Armada &amp; [[Intel]] [[Braswell (SOC)|Braswell]] families. Every processing family offering different advantages with different application capacities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7786">'''Transmodel''' (formally ''CEN TC278, Reference Data Model For Public Transport, EN12896'') is the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] European Reference Data Model for [[Public Transport]] Information; it provides an [[Standard data model| conceptual model]] of common  public transport concepts and data structures that can be used to build many different kinds of [[public transport information system]], including for timetabling, fares, operational management, real time data, [[Journey Planner|journey planning]] etc.

==Scope==
Transmodel provides a comprehensive conceptual model for public transport (PT) information systems including  [[passenger information system]]s, with coverage of a number of different subdomains of PT information, including transport network infrastructure and [[topology]], public transport schedules, [[Journey Planner|journey planning]], fares, fare validation, [[Real-time locating system|real-time passenger information]] and operational aspects  of [[public transport]].

* It is documented and diagrammed as an [[entity-relationship model]] and in [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), accompanied by detailed descriptions of the concepts, elements and attributes needed to represent transport information.
* It uses modern informational architecture principles to separate different concerns as independent layers.
* It makes extensive use of node and link concepts to describe individual transport information layers.
* It supports the reuse of transport information entities for different applications.
* It can represent multi-modal, multi-operator transport systems, with many different organisational structures, complex fare models, and different organisational practices.

Transmodel establishes a consistent terminology for describing public transport concepts, providing definitive equivalents for use in the National Languages of each participant nation. Where PT related words in vernacular use may span a number of different concepts and lead to differences of interpretation,  it establishes a more precise technical terminology   for unambiguous  use by PT information system developers. For example the terms  'trip', 'journey', 'service', are overlapping concepts that in Transmodel are  used only in a more specific usages.

The current{{When|date=June 2011}} version of Transmodel is 5.1 with a 6.0 in draft.

==History==
Transmodel was originally developed within a range of European projects under several European Programmes (Drive I, Drive II, TAP) with the support of the [[European Commission]] (DGXIII), and  national public institutions, in particular  the [[French Ministry of Transport]] (Direction des Transports Terrestres) as well as several private companies.

===Initial development &amp; First Generation use===
* Transmodel development started with the '''Cassiope''' project (1989-1991, Drive I programme). The results of Cassiope were then developed further by the EuroBus and Harpist (Drive II) projects.   This produced Transmodel  V4.1 ENV 12896 with a E/R “Oracle” formalism.
* The Telematics Applications Programme project '''TITAN''' (1996-1998) continued to validate and enhance Transmodel implementing it in three European pilot sites and has accompanied the standardisation process of Transmodel, voted in 1997 as the European experimental norm ENV 12896.  This led to Transmodel V5.0: with multi-modality, real-time control, layers, and data versioning
* '''SITP''': Système d'Information pour le Transport Public (Information System for Public Transport) started in 1999 under the sponsorship of the [[French Ministry of Transport]], which supports the Transmodel site.  SITP developed Transmodel V5.1, adding a UML formalism.

In 2006 version 5.1 of Transmodel was formally adopted by CEN as a European standard, EN12896.

===Second Generation use of Transmodel  (Transmodel V5.1) ===
Transmodel has been fundamental to the development of a number of concrete national data models and European Standards,including both European standards  [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] (SIRI: 2001-2005, now a CEN technical specification) for [[Real-time data]] exchange for buses, and [[Identification of Fixed Objects In Public Transport]] (2006-2007), now assimilated into Transmodel v6.0 Part2, and   national standards such as  [[TransXChange]] (2001-2005,  now the UK standard for bus PT timetables), and the French Trident standard (1999-2003).  Its provision of a uniform conceptual framework, consistent terminology and well grounded abstractions make it especially valuable for comparing, harmonising and modernising legacy standards and systems and for international cooperation.

===Third Generation (Transmodel v6.0) ===
* Transmodel based applications are now in widespread use through many parts of Europe for exchanging timetable and real-time data. A revised V6.0 version of Transmodel incorporating additional capabilities and breaking the specification into eight separate modules is underdevelopment.  Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3, covering respectively common concepts, network descriptions, and timetables were published in 2015. Parts 4, 5, 6 covering operational actions, fares and passenger information services are due for publication in 2018. Parts 7 &amp; 8 covering  driver management and management information and statistics are due for publication in   2019. 
* '''[[NeTEx]]''':   (NETwork EXchange) is a concrete XML scheme implementing the central components of the Transmodel model as a modular W3C schema.  It was developed as a CEN Technical Standard by CEN WG278 SG9 between 2009 and 2014 as a European-wide format for exchanging inter-modal stop, timetable, and fare data for public transport.  A revised version is under development  for completion in 2018.  
* In 2017, under the Intelligent Transport Systems Priority Action A Directive (2010/40/E), the European Commission recognized NeTEx as a strategic standard for the cross-border exchange of data to  enable the provision of EU-wide multi-modal travel information services, with the aim of making data available in NeTEx format at National Access Points in all European countries.

A '''Trap Door Forage Wagon''' is a type of [[wagon]] used in [[farming]] that can unload without the operator having to stop. It earned top honors in the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]]'s 14th annual Farmer Idea Exchange in the annual convention.

==Operation==
Two doors are located at the bottom of the wagon. Normally these are locked at a 45 degree angle downward to hold the [[hay]]lidge inside the wagon. When the farmer drives over the pile he releases the doors from inside the cab of the tractor to instantly unload the wagon. This design offers greater safety, less wear from moving parts and most importantly greater efficiency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4588">The '''Zenith Flash-Matic''' was the first wireless [[remote control]] invented by [[Eugene Polley]] in 1955. It had only one button that was used to power on and off, channel up, channel down, and mute. The Flash-matic's phototechnology was a significant innovation in television and allowed for wireless signal transfer previously exclusive to radio.&lt;ref name=RemoteControl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benson-Allott|first1=Caetlin|title=Remote Control|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781623563110|series=Object Lessons|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt;

== Design and production ==
Earlier remotes could turn sets on/off and change channels, but were connected to the TV with a cable.&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parsons|first1=Patrick|title=The "Most Thrilling Invention Since the Radio Itself!": The Evolution of the Radio Remote Control in the 1920s and 1930s|journal=Journal of Radio &amp; Audio Media|date=2014|volume=21|issue=1|pages=66–79|doi=10.1080/19376529.2014.891217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flash-matic came in response to consumer complaints about the inconvenience of these cables running from the transmitter to the TV monitor. Earlier remotes served as the central control system for transmitting complex signals to the receiving monitor. The Flash-matic instead placed the complexity in the receiver as opposed to the transmitter. It used a directional beam of light to control a television outfitted with four [[Photoresistor|photo cells]] in the corners of the screen. The light signal would activate one of the four control functions, which turned the picture and sound on or off, and turned the channel tuner dial clockwise and counter-clockwise. The bottom receptors received the signal to mute and power on/off, and the upper cells received signals to channel up/down.&lt;ref name="Langer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Langer |first=Emily |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/eugene-j-polley-engineer-who-invented-the-first-wireless-tv-remote-control-dies-at-96/2012/05/22/gIQAv4J4iU_story.html |title=Eugene J. Polley, engineer who invented the first wireless TV remote control, dies at 96 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for the various signals to be received by the monitor, the remote control had to be directed towards one of the four photocells. The system responded to full-spectrum light so could be activated or interfered with by other light sources including indoor light bulbs and the sun. Despite these defects, the Flash-matic remained in high demand. In September 1955, Zenith released an apology for its inability to meet the high demand of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, September 12, 1955, A3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Bret Maxwell. TV Repair: New Media "solutions" to Old Media Problems. UMI, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flash-matic was quickly replaced by new control systems. The "Zenith Space Command" remote control went into production in 1956 with aims to improve upon the Flash-matic's design.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Benson-Allott 2015, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertisement Campaign==
The Flash-matic was marketed as an interactive technology for tuning device for the television. [[wikt:mute|Muting]] was the first control feature to be included on a remote control while unavailable on the monitor. The advertisement campaign for the Flash-matic remote control noted its ability to "shut off annoying commercials while the picture remains on the screen.”&lt;ref name="Langer"/&gt; The mute button was explicitly designed for the purpose of tuning out of commercials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As a result of this new feature as well as the Flash-matic's pistol shape, the Flash-matic's ad campaigns invited viewers to "shoot" the annoying commercials or announcers that they were tired of listening to, while leaving the image present so that the viewer would know when to turn the sound back on.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Bret Maxwell.
